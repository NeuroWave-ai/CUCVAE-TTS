Don t do it If it wasn t wise don t you suppose that the last thing he could wish you to do would be to sacrifice yourself to a sick whim of his The kindness expressed in the words touched Annie Kilburn She had a certain beauty of feature she was near sighted but her eyes were brown and soft her lips red and full her dark hair grew low and played in little wisps and rings on her temples where her complexion was clearest the bold contour of her face with its decided chin and the rather large salient nose was like her father s it was this probably that gave an impression of strength with a wistful qualification She was at that time rather thin and it could have been seen that she would be handsomer when her frame had rounded out in fulfilment of its generous design She opened her lips to speak but shut them again in an effort at self control before she said But I really wish to do it At this moment I would rather be in Hatboro than in Rome Oh very well said the old lady gathering herself up as one does from throwing away one s sympathy upon an unworthy object if you really wish it I know that it must seem preposterous and and almost ungrateful that I should think of going back when I might just as well stay Why I ve a great many more friends here than I have there I suppose I shall be almost a stranger when I get there and there s no comparison in congeniality and yet I feel that I must go back I can t tell you why But I have a longing I feel that I must try to be of some use in the world try to do some good and in Hatboro I think I shall know how She put on her glasses and looked at the old lady as if she might attempt an explanation but as if a clearer vision of the veteran worldling discouraged her she did not make the effort Oh said the old lady If you want to be of use and do good She stopped as if then there were no more to be said by a sensible person And shall you be going soon she asked The idea seemed to suggest her own departure and she rose after speaking Just as soon as possible answered Miss Kilburn Words take on a colour of something more than their explicit meaning from the mood in which they are spoken Miss Kilburn had a sense of hurrying her visitor away and the old lady had a sense of being turned out of doors that the preparations for the homeward voyage might begin instantly II Many times after the preparations began and many times after they were ended Miss Kilburn faltered in doubt of her decision and if there had been any will stronger than her own to oppose it she might have reversed it and stayed in Rome All the way home there was a strain of misgiving in her satisfaction at doing what she believed to be for the best and the first sight of her native land gave her a shock of emotion which was not unmixed joy She felt forlorn among people who were coming home with all sorts of high expectations while she only had high intentions These dated back a good many years in fact they dated back to the time when the first flush of her unthinking girlhood was over and she began to question herself as to the life she was living It was a very pleasant life ostensibly Her father had been elected from the bench to Congress and had kept his title and his repute as a lawyer through several terms in the House before he settled down to the practice of his profession in the courts at Washington where he made a good deal of money They passed from boarding to house keeping in the easy Washington way after their impermanent Congressional years and divided their time between a comfortable little place in Nevada Circle and the old homestead in Hatboro He was fond of Washington and robustly content with the world as he found it there and elsewhere If his daughter s compunctions came to her through him it must have been from some remoter ancestry he was not apparently characterised by their transmission and probably she derived them from her mother who died when she was a little girl and of whom she had no recollection Till he began to break after they went abroad he had his own way in everything but as men grow old or infirm they fall into subjection to their womenkind their rude wills yield in the suppler insistence of the feminine purpose they take the colour of the feminine moods and emotions the cycle of life completes itself where it began in helpless dependence upon the sex and Rufus Kilburn did not escape the common lot He was often complaining and unlovely as aged and ailing men must be perhaps he was usually so but he had moments when he recognised the beauty of his daughter s aspiration with a spiritual sympathy which showed that he must always have had an intellectual perception of it He expressed with rhetorical largeness and looseness the longing which was not very definite in her own heart and mingled with it a strain of homesickness poignantly simple and direct for the places the scenes the persons the things of his early days As he failed more and more his homesickness was for natural aspects which had wholly ceased to exist through modern changes and improvements and for people long since dead whom he could find only in an illusion of that environment in some other world In the pathos of this situation it was easy for his daughter to keep him ignorant of the passionate rebellion against her own ideals in which she sometimes surprised herself When he died all counter currents were lost in the tidal revulsion of feeling which swept her to the fulfilment of what she hoped was deepest and strongest in her nature with shame for what she hoped was shallowest till that moment of repulsion in which she saw the thickly roofed and many towered hills of Boston grow up out of the western waves She had always regarded her soul as the battlefield of two opposite principles the good and the bad the high and the low God made her she thought and He alone He made everything that she was but she would not have said that He made the evil in her Yet her belief did not admit the existence of Creative Evil and so she said to herself that she herself was that evil and she must struggle against herself she must question whatever she strongly wished because she strongly wished it It was not logical she did not push her postulates to their obvious conclusions and there was apt to be the same kind of break between her conclusions and her actions as between her reasons and her conclusions She acted impulsively and from a force which she could not analyse She indulged reveries so vivid that they seemed to weaken and exhaust her for the grapple with realities the recollection of them abashed her in the presence of facts With all this it must not be supposed that she was morbidly introspective Her life had been apparently a life of cheerful acquiescence in worldly conditions it had been in some measure a life of fashion or at least of society It had not been without the interests of other girls lives by any means she had sometimes had fancies flirtations but she did not think she had been really in love and she had refused some offers of marriage for that reason III The industry of making straw hats began at Hatboro as many other industries have begun in New England with no great local advantages but simply because its founder happened to live there and to believe that it would pay There was a railroad and labour of the sort he wanted was cheap and abundant in the village and the outlying farms In time the work came to be done more and more by machinery and to be gathered into large shops The buildings increased in size and number the single line of the railroad was multiplied into four and in the region of the tracks several large ugly windowy wooden bulks grew up for shoe shops a stocking factory followed yet this business activity did not warp the old village from its picturesqueness or quiet The railroad tracks crossed its main street but the shops were all on one side of them with the work people s cottages and boarding houses and on the other were the simple square roomy old mansions with their white paint and their green blinds varied by the modern colour and carpentry of French roofed villas The old houses stood quite close to the street with a strip of narrow door yard before them the new ones affected a certain depth of lawn over which their owners personally pushed a clucking hand mower in the summer evenings after tea The fences had been taken away from the new houses in the taste of some of the Boston suburbs they generally remained before the old ones whose inmates resented the ragged effect that their absence gave the street The irregularity had hitherto been of an orderly and harmonious kind such as naturally follows the growth of a country road into a village thoroughfare The dwellings were placed nearer or further from the sidewalk as their builders fancied and the elms that met in a low arch above the street had an illusive symmetry in the perspective they were really set at uneven intervals and in a line that wavered capriciously in and out The street itself lounged and curved along widening and contracting like a river and then suddenly lost itself over the brow of an upland which formed a natural boundary of the village Beyond this was South Hatboro a group of cottages built by city people who had lately come in idlers and invalids the former for the cool summer and the latter for the dry winter At chance intervals in the old village new side streets branched from the thoroughfare to the right and the left and here and there a Queen Anne cottage showed its chimneys and gables on them The roadway under the elms that kept it dark and cool with their hovering shade and swept the wagon tops with their pendulous boughs at places was unpaved but the sidewalks were asphalted to the last dwelling in every direction and they were promptly broken out in winter by the public snow plough Miss Kilburn saw them in the spring when their usefulness was least apparent and she did not know whether to praise the spirit of progress which showed itself in them as well as in other things at Hatboro She had come prepared to have misgivings but she had promised herself to be just she thought she could bear the old ugliness if not the new Some of the new things however were not so ugly the young station master was handsome in his railroad uniform and pleasanter to the eye than the veteran baggage master incongruous in his stiff silk cap and his shirt sleeves and spectacles The station itself one of Richardson s massive and low with red tiled spreading veranda roofs impressed her with its fitness and strengthened her for her encounter with the business architecture of Hatboro which was of the florid ambitious New York type prevalent with every American town in the early stages of its prosperity The buildings were of pink brick faced with granite and supported in the first story by columns of painted iron flat roofed blocks looked down over the low wooden structures of earlier Hatboro and a large hotel had pushed back the old time tavern and planted itself flush upon the sidewalk But the stores seemed very good as she glanced at them from her carriage and their show windows were tastefully arranged the apothecary s had an interior of glittering neatness unsurpassed by an Italian apothecary s and the provision man s besides its symmetrical array of pendent sides and quarters indoors had banks of fruit and vegetables without and a large aquarium with a spraying fountain in its window Bolton the farmer who had always taken care of the Kilburn place came to meet her at the station and drive her home Miss Kilburn had bidden him drive slowly so that she could see all the changes and she noticed the new town hall with which she could find no fault the Baptist and Methodist churches were the same as of old the Unitarian church seemed to have shrunk as if the architecture had sympathised with its dwindling body of worshippers just beyond it was the village green with the soldiers monument and the tall white painted flag pole and the four small brass cannon threatening the points of the compass at its base Stop a moment mister Bolton said Miss Kilburn and she put her head quite out of the carriage and stared at the figure on the monument It was strange that the first misgiving she could really make sure of concerning Hatboro should relate to this figure which she herself was mainly responsible for placing there When the money was subscribed and voted for the statue the committee wrote out to her at Rome as one who would naturally feel an interest in getting something fit and economical for them She accepted the trust with zeal and pleasure but she overruled their simple notion of an American volunteer at rest with his hands folded on the muzzle of his gun as intolerably hackneyed and commonplace Her conscience she said would not let her add another recruit to the regiment of stone soldiers standing about in that posture on the tops of pedestals all over the country and so instead of going to an Italian statuary with her fellow townsmen s letter and getting him to make the figure they wanted she doubled the money and gave the commission to a young girl from Kansas who had come out to develop at Rome the genius recognised at Topeka They decided together that it would be best to have something ideal and the sculptor promptly imagined and rapidly executed a design for a winged Victory poising on the summit of a white marble shaft and clasping its hands under its chin in expression of the grief that mingled with the popular exultation Miss Kilburn had her doubts while the work went on but she silenced them with the theory that when the figure was in position it would be all right Now that she saw it in position she wished to ask mister Bolton what was thought of it but she could not nerve herself to the question He remained silent and she felt that he was sorry for her Oh may I be very humble may I be helped to be very humble she prayed under her breath It seemed as if she could not take her eyes from the figure it was such a modern such an American shape so youthfully inadequate so simple so sophisticated so like a young lady in society indecorously exposed for a tableau vivant She wondered if the people in Hatboro felt all this about it if they realised how its involuntary frivolity insulted the solemn memory of the slain Drive on please she said gently Bolton pulled the reins and as the horses started he pointed with his whip to a church at the other side of the green That s the new Orthodox church he explained Oh is it asked Miss Kilburn It s very handsome I m sure She was not sensible of admiring the large Romanesque pile very much though it was certainly not bad but she remembered that Bolton was a member of the Orthodox church and she was grateful to him for not saying anything about the soldiers monument We sold the old buildin to the Catholics and they moved it down ont the side street Miss Kilburn caught the glimmer of a cross where he beckoned through the flutter of the foliage They had to razee the steeple some to git their cross on he added and then he showed her the high school building as they passed and the Episcopal chapel of blameless church warden s Gothic half hidden by its Japanese ivy under a branching elm on another side street Yes she said that was built before we went abroad I disremember he said absently He let the horses walk on the soft darkly shaded road where the wheels made a pleasant grinding sound and set himself sidewise on his front seat so as to talk to Miss Kilburn more at his ease I d know he began after clearing his throat with a conscious air as you know we d got a new minister to our church No I hadn t heard of it said Miss Kilburn with her mind full of the monument still But I might have heard and forgotten it she added I was very much taken up toward the last before I left Rome Well come to think said Bolton I don t know s you d had time to heard He hain t been here a great while Is he satisfactory asked Miss Kilburn feeling how far from satisfactory the Victory was and formulating an explanatory apology to the committee in her mind Oh yes he s satisfactory enough as far forth as that goes He s talented and he s right up with the times Yes he s progressive I guess they got pretty tired of mister Rogers even before he died and they kept the supply a goin till all was blue before they could settle on anybody In fact they couldn t seem to agree on anybody till mister Peck come Miss Kilburn had got as far in her tacit interview with the committee as to have offered to replace at her own expense the Victory with a Volunteer and she seemed to be listening to Bolton with rapt attention Well it s like this continued the farmer He s progressive in his idees n at the same time he s spiritual minded and so I guess he suits pretty well all round Of course you can t suit everybody There s always got to be a dog in the manger it don t matter where you go But if anybody was to ask me I should say mister Peck suited Yes I don t know but what I should Miss Kilburn instantaneously closed her transaction with the committee removed the Victory and had the Volunteer unveiled with appropriate ceremonies opened with prayer by the reverend mister Peck Peck she said Did you tell me his name was Peck Yes ma am reverend Julius W Peck He s from down Penobscotport way in Maine I guess he s all right Miss Kilburn did not reply Her mind had been taken off the monument for the moment by her dislike for the name of the new minister and the Victory had seized the opportunity to get back Bolton sighed deeply and continued in a strain whose diffusiveness at last became perceptible to Miss Kilburn through her own humiliation There s some in every community that s bound to complain I don t care what you do to accommodate em and what I done I done as much to stop their clack as anything and give him the right sort of a start off an I guess I did But Mis Bolton she didn t know but what you d look at it in the light of a libbutty and I didn t know but what you would think I no business to done it He seemed to be addressing a question to her but she only replied with a dazed frown and Bolton was obliged to go on I didn t let him room in your part of the house that is to say not sleep there but I thought as you was comin home and I better be airin it up some anyway I might as well let him set in the old Judge s room If you think it was more than I had a right to do I m willin to pay for it Git up Bolton turned fully round toward his horses to hide the workings of emotion in his face and shook the reins like a desperate man What are you talking about mister Bolton cried Miss Kilburn Whom are you talking about Bolton answered with a kind of violence mister Peck I took him to board first off You took him to board Yes I know it wa n t just accordin to the letter o the law and the old Judge was always pootty p tic lah But I ve took care of the place goin on twenty years now and I hain t never had a chick nor a child in it before The child he continued partly turning his face round again and beginning to look Miss Kilburn in the eye wa n t one to touch anything anyway and we kep her in our part all the while Mis Bolton she couldn t seem to let her out of her sight she got so fond of her and she used to follow me round among the hosses like a kitten I declare I miss her Bolton s face the colour of one of the lean ploughed fields of Hatboro and deeply furrowed lighted up with real feeling which he tried to make go as far in the work of reconciling Miss Kilburn as if it had been factitious But I don t understand she said What child are you talking about mister Peck s Was he married she asked with displeasure she did not know why Well yes he had been answered Bolton But she d be n in the asylum ever since the child was born Oh said Miss Kilburn with relief and she fell back upon the seat from which she had started forward Bolton might easily have taken her tone for that of disgust He faced round upon her once more It was kind of queer his havin the child with him an takin most the care of her himself and so as I say Mis Bolton and me we took him in as much to stop folks mouths as anything till they got kinder used to it But we didn t take him into your part as I say and as I say I m willin to pay you whatever you say for the use of the old Judge s study I presume that part of it was a libbutty It was all perfectly right mister Bolton said Miss Kilburn His wife died anyway more than a year ago said Bolton as if the fact completed his atonement to Miss Kilburn Git ep I told him from the start that it had got to be a temporary thing an t I only took him till he could git settled somehow I guess he means to go to house keepin if he can git the right kind of a house keeper he wants an old one If it was a young one I guess he wouldn t have any great trouble if he went about it the right way Bolton s sarcasm was merely a race sarcasm He was a very mild man and his thick growing eyelashes softened and shadowed his grey eyes and gave his lean face pathos You could have let him stay till he had found a suitable place said Miss Kilburn Oh I wa n t goin to do that said Bolton But I m bliged to you just the same They came up in sight of the old square house standing back a good distance from the road with a broad sweep of grass sloping down before it into a little valley and rising again to the wall fencing the grounds from the street The wall was overhung there by a company of magnificent elms which turned and formed one side of the avenue leading to the house Their tops met and mixed somewhat incongruously with those of the stiff dark maples which more densely shaded the other side of the lane Bolton drove into their gloom and then out into the wide sunny space at the side of the house where Miss Kilburn had alighted so often with her father Bolton s dog grown now so very old as to be weak minded barked crazily at his master and then recognising him broke into an imbecile whimper and went back and coiled his rheumatism up in the sun on a warm stone before the door missus Bolton had to step over him as she came out formally supporting her right elbow with her left hand as she offered the other in greeting to Miss Kilburn with a look of question at her husband Miss Kilburn intercepted the look and began to laugh All was unchanged and all so strange it seemed as if her father must both get down with her from the carriage and come to meet her from the house Her glance involuntarily took in the familiar masses and details the patches of short tough grass mixed with decaying chips and small weeds underfoot and the spacious June sky overhead the fine network and blisters of the cracking and warping white paint on the clapboarding and the hills beyond the bulks of the village houses and trees the woodshed stretching with its low board arches to the barn and the milk pans tilted to sun against the underpinning of the L and missus Bolton s pot plants in the kitchen window Did you think I could be hard about such a thing as that It was perfectly right O missus Bolton She stopped laughing and began to cry she put away missus Bolton s carefully offered hand she threw herself upon the bony structure of her bosom and buried her face sobbing in the leathery folds of her neck missus Bolton suffered her embrace above the old dog who fled with a cry of rheumatic apprehension from the sweep of Miss Kilburn s skirts and then came back and snuffed at them in a vain effort to recall her Well go in and lay down by the stove said missus Bolton with a divided interest while she beat Miss Kilburn s back with her bony palm in sign of sympathy But the dog went off up the lane and stood there by the pasture bars barking abstractedly at intervals IV Miss Kilburn found that the house had been well aired for her coming but an old earthy and mouldy smell which it took days and nights of open doors and windows to drive out stole back again with the first turn of rainy weather She had fires built on the hearths and in the stoves and after opening her trunks and scattering her dresses on beds and chairs she spent most of the first week outside of the house wandering about the fields and orchards to adjust herself anew to the estranged features of the place The house she found lower ceiled and smaller than she remembered it The Boltons had kept it up very well and in spite of the earthy and mouldy smell it was conscientiously clean There was not a speck of dust anywhere the old yellowish white paint was spotless the windows shone But there was a sort of frigidity in the perfect order and repair which repelled her and she left her things tossed about as if to break the ice of this propriety In several places within and without she found marks of the faithful hand of Bolton in economical patches of the woodwork but she was not sure that they had not been there eleven years before and there were darnings in the carpets and curtains which affected her with the same mixture of novelty and familiarity Certain stale smells about the place minor smells as compared with the prevalent odour confused her she could not decide whether she remembered them of old or was reminded of the odours she used to catch in passing the pantry on the steamer Her father had never been sure that he would not return any next year or month and the house had always been ready to receive them In his study everything was as he left it His daughter looked for signs of mister Peck s occupation but there were none missus Bolton explained that she had put him in a table from her own sitting room to write at The Judge s desk was untouched and his heavy wooden arm chair stood pulled up to it as if he were in it The ranks of law books in their yellow sheepskin with their red titles above and their black titles below were in the order he had taught missus Bolton to replace them in after dusting the stuffed owl on a shelf above the mantel looked down with a clear solemnity in its gum copal eyes and missus Bolton took it from its perch to show Miss Kilburn that there was not a moth on it nor the sign of a moth Miss Kilburn experienced here that refusal of the old associations to take the form of welcome which she had already felt in the earth and sky and air outside in everything there was a sense of impassable separation Her dead father was no nearer in his wonted place than the trees of the orchard or the outline of the well known hills or the pink of the familiar sunsets In her rummaging about the house she pulled open a chest of drawers which used to stand in the room where she slept when a child It was full of her own childish clothing a little girl s linen and muslin and she thought with a throe of despair that she could as well hope to get hack into these outgrown garments which the helpless piety of missus Bolton had kept from the rag bag as to think of re entering the relations of the life so long left off It surprised her to find how cold the Boltons were she had remembered them as always very kind and willing but she was so used now to the ways of the Italians and their showy affection it was hard for her to realise that people could be both kind and cold The Boltons seemed ashamed of their feelings and hid them it was the same in some degree with all the villagers when she began to meet them and the fact slowly worked back into her consciousness wounding its way in People did not come to see her at once They waited as they told her till she got settled before they called and then they did not appear very glad to have her back But this was not altogether the effect of their temperament The Kilburns had made a long summer always in Hatboro and they had always talked of it as home but they had never passed a whole year there since Judge Kilburn first went to Congress and they were not regarded as full neighbours or permanent citizens Miss Kilburn however kept up her childhood friendships and she and some of the ladies called one another by their Christian names but they believed that she met people in Washington whom she liked better the winters she spent there certainly weakened the ties between them and when it came to those eleven years in Rome the letters they exchanged grew rarer and rarer till they stopped altogether Some of the girls went away some died others became dead and absent to her in their marriages and household cares After waiting for one another three of them came together to see her one day They all kissed her after a questioning glance at her face and dress as if they wanted to see whether she had grown proud or too fashionable But they were themselves apparently much better dressed and certainly more richly dressed In a place like Hatboro where there is no dinner giving and evening parties are few the best dress is a street costume which may be worn for calls and shopping and for church and all public entertainments The well to do ladies make an effect of outdoor fashion in which the poorest shop hand has her part and in their turn they share her indoor simplicity These old friends of Annie s wore bonnets and frocks of the latest style and costly material They let her make the advances receiving them with blank passivity or repelling them with irony according to the several needs of their self respect and talking to one another across her One of them asked her when her hair had begun to turn and they each told her how thin she was but promised her that Hatboro air would bring her up At the same time they feigned humility in regard to everything about Hatboro but the air they laughed when she said she intended now to make it her home the whole year round and said they guessed she would be tired of it long before fall there were plenty of summer folks that passed the winter as long as the June weather lasted As they grew more secure of themselves or less afraid of one another in her presence their voices rose they laughed loudly at nothing and they yelled in a nervous chorus at times each trying to make herself heard above the others She asked them about the social life in the village and they told her that a good many new people had really settled there but they did not know whether she would like them they were not the old Hatboro style Annie showed them some of the things she had brought home especially Roman views and they said now she ought to give an evening in the church parlour with them You ll have to come to our church Annie said missus Putney The Unitarian doesn t have preaching once in a month and mister Peck is very liberal He s most too liberal for some said Emmeline Gerrish Of the three she had grown the stoutest and from being a slight light minded girl she had become a heavy matron habitually censorious in her speech She did not mean any more by it however than she did by her girlish frivolity and if she was not supported in her severity she was apt to break down and disown it with a giggle as she now did Well I don t know about his being too liberal said missus Wilmington a large red haired blonde with a lazy laugh He makes you feel that you re a pretty miserable sinner She made a grimace of humorous disgust mister Gerrish says that s just the trouble missus Gerrish broke in mister Peck don t put stress enough on the promises That s what mister Gerrish says You must have been surprised Annie she added to find that he d been staying in your house I was glad missus Bolton invited him answered Annie sincerely but not instantly The ladies waited with an exchange of glances for her reply as if they had talked the matter over beforehand and had agreed to find out just how Annie Kilburn felt about it Oh I guess he paid his board said missus Wilmington jocosely rejecting the implication that he had been the guest of the Boltons I don t see what he expects to do with that little girl of his without any mother that way said missus Gerrish He ought to get married Perhaps he will when he s waited a proper time suggested missus Putney demurely Well his wife s been the same as dead ever since the child was born I don t know what you call a proper time Ellen argued missus Gerrish I presume a minister feels differently about such things missus Wilmington remarked indolently I don t see why a minister should feel any different from anybody else said missus Gerrish It s his duty to do it on his child s account I don t see why he don t have the remains brought to Hatboro anyway They debated this point at some length and they seemed to forget Annie She listened with more interest than her concern in the last resting place of the minister s dead wife really inspired These old friends of hers seemed to have lost the sensitiveness of their girlhood without having gained tenderness in its place They treated the affair with a nakedness that shocked her In the country and in small towns people come face to face with life especially women It means marrying child bearing household cares and burdens neighbourhood gossip sickness death burial and whether the corpse appeared natural But ever so much kindness goes with their disillusion they are blunted but not embittered They ended by recalling Annie to mind and missus Putney said I suppose you haven t been to the cemetery yet I They ve got it all fixed up since you went away drives laid out and paths cut through and everything A good many have put up family tombs and they ve taken away the old iron fences round the lots and put granite curbing They mow the grass all the time It s a perfect garden missus Putney was a small woman already beginning to wrinkle She had married a man whom Annie remembered as a mischievous little boy with a sharp tongue and a nervous temperament her father had always liked him when he came about the house but Annie had lost sight of him in the years that make small boys and girls large ones and he was at college when she went abroad She had an impression of something unhappy in her friend s marriage I think it s too much fixed up myself said missus Gerrish She turned suddenly to Annie You going to have your father fetched home The other ladies started a little at the question and looked at Annie it was not that they were shocked but they wanted to see whether she would not be so No she said briefly She added helplessly It wasn t his wish I should have thought he would have liked to be buried alongside of your mother said missus Gerrish But the Judge always was a little peculiar I presume you can have the name and the date put on the monument just the same Annie flushed at this intimate comment and suggestion from a woman whom as a girl she had never admitted to familiarity with her but had tolerated her because she was such a harmless simpleton and hung upon other girls whom she liked better The word monument cowed her however She was afraid they might begin to talk about the soldiers monument She answered hastily and began to ask them about their families missus Wilmington who had no children and missus Putney who had one spoke of missus Gerrish s large family She had four children and she refused the praises of her friends for them though she celebrated them herself You ought to have seen the two little girls that Ellen lost Annie she said Ellen Putney I don t see how you ever got over that Those two lovely healthy children gone and poor little Winthrop left I always did say it was too hard She had married a clerk in the principal dry goods store who had prospered rapidly and was now one of the first business men of the place and had an ambition to be a leading citizen She believed in his fitness to deal with the questions of religion and education which he took part in and was always quoting mister Gerrish She called him mister Gerrish so much that other people began to call him so too But missus Putney s husband held out against it and had the habit of returning the little man s ceremonious salutations with an easy Hello Billy Good morning Billy It was his theory that this was good for Gerrish who might otherwise have forgotten when everybody called him Billy He was one of the old Putneys and he was a lawyer by profession missus Wilmington s husband had come to Hatboro since Annie s long absence began he had capital and he had started a stocking mill in Hatboro He was much older than his wife whom he had married after a protracted widowerhood She had one of the best houses and the most richly furnished in Hatboro She and missus Putney saw missus Gerrish at rare intervals and in observance of some notable fact of their girlish friendship like the present In pursuance of the subject of children missus Gerrish said that she sometimes had a notion to offer to take mister Peck s little girl herself till he could get fixed somehow but mister Gerrish would not let her mister Gerrish said mister Peck had better get married himself if he wanted a step mother for his little girl mister Gerrish was peculiar about keeping a family to itself Well you ll think we ve come to board with you too said missus Putney in reference to mister Peck The ladies all rose and having got upon their feet began to shout and laugh again like girls they implied They stayed and talked a long time after rising with the same note of unsparing personality in their talk Where there are few public interests and few events as in such places there can be no small talk nothing of the careless touch and go of larger societies Every one knows all the others and knows the worst of them People are not unkind they are mutually and freely helpful but they have only themselves to occupy their minds Annie s friends had also to distinguish themselves to her from the rest of the villagers and it was easiest to do this by an attitude of criticism mingled with large allowance They ended a dissection of the community by saying that they believed there was no place like Hatboro after all In the contagion of their perfunctory gaiety Annie began to scream and laugh too as she followed them to the door and stood talking to them while they got into missus Wilmington s extension top carry all She answered with deafening promises when they put their bonnets out of the carry all and called back to her to be sure to come soon to see them soon V missus Bolton made no advances with Annie toward the discussion of her friends but when Annie asked about their families she answered with the incisive directness of a country bred woman She delivered her judgments as she went about her work the morning after the ladies visit while Annie sat before the breakfast table which she had given her leave to clear As she passed in and out from the dining room to the kitchen she kept talking she raised her voice in the further room and lowered it when she drew near again She wore a dismal calico wrapper which made no compromise with the gauntness of her figure her reddish brown hair which grew in a fringe below her crown was plaited into small tags or tails pulled up and tied across the top of her head the bare surfaces of which were curiously mottled with the dye which she sometimes put on her hair Behind this was gathered up into a small knob pierced with a single hair pin the arrangement left missus Bolton s visage to the unrestricted expression of character She did not let it express toward Annie any expectation of the confidential relations that are supposed to exist between people who have been a long time master and servant She had never recognised her relations with the Kilburns in these terms She was a mature Yankee single woman of confirmed self respect when she first came as house keeper to Judge Kilburn twenty years ago and she had not changed her nature in changing her condition by her marriage with Oliver Bolton she was childless unless his comparative youth conferred a sort of adoptive maternity upon her Annie went into her father s study where she had lit the fire in the Franklin stove on her way to breakfast It had come on to rain during the night after the fine yesterday which missus Gerrish had denounced to its face as a weather breeder At first it rained silently stealthily but toward morning Annie heard the wind rising and when she looked out of her window after daylight she found a fierce north easterly storm drenching and chilling the landscape Now across the flattened and tangled grass of the lawn the elms were writhing in the gale and swinging their long lean boughs to and fro from another window she saw the cuffed and hustled maples ruffling their stiff masses of foliage and shuddering in the storm She turned away with a sigh of the luxurious melancholy which a northeaster inspires in people safely sheltered from it and sat down before her fire She recalled the three women who had visited her the day before in the better remembered figures of their childhood and young girlhood and their present character did not seem a broken promise Nothing was really disappointed in it but the animal joy the hopeful riot of their young blood which must fade and die with the happiest fate She perceived that what they had come to was not unjust to what they had been and as our own fate always appears to us unaccomplished a thing for the distant future to fulfil she began to ask herself what was to be the natural sequence of such a temperament such mental and moral traits as hers Had her life been so noble in anything but vague aspirations that she could ever reasonably expect the destiny of grand usefulness which she had always unreasonably expected The question came home to her with such pain in the light of what her old playmates had become that she suddenly ceased to enjoy the misery of the storm out of doors or the purring content of the fire on the hearth of the stove at her feet the book she had taken down to read fell unopened into her lap and she gave herself up to a half hour of such piercing self question as only a high minded woman can endure when the flattering promises of youth have grown vague and few There is no condition of life that is wholly acceptable but none that is not tolerable when once it establishes itself and while Annie Kilburn had never consented to be an old maid she had become one without great suffering At thirty one she could not call herself anything else she often called herself an old maid with the mental reservation that she was not one She was merely unmarried she might marry any time Now when she assured herself of this as she had done many times before she suddenly wondered if she should ever marry she wondered if she had seemed to her friends yesterday like a person who would never marry Did one carry such a thing in one s looks Perhaps they idealised her they had not seen her since she was twenty and perhaps they still thought of her as a young girl It now seemed to her as if she had left her youth in Rome as in Rome it had seemed to her that she should find it again in Hatboro A pang of aimless unlocalised homesickness passed through her she realised that she was alone in the world She rose to escape the pang and went to the window of the parlour which looked toward the street where she saw the figure of a young man draped in a long indiarubber gossamer coat fluttering in the wind that pushed him along as he tacked on a southerly course he bowed and twisted his head to escape the lash of the rain She watched him till he turned into the lane leading to the house and then at a discreeter distance she watched him through the window at the other corner making his way up to the front door in the teeth of the gale He seemed to have a bundle under his arm and as he stepped into the shelter of the portico and freed his arm to ring she discovered that it was a bundle of books Whether missus Bolton did not hear the bell or whether she heard it and decided that it would be absurd to leave her work for it when Miss Kilburn who was so much nearer could answer it she did not come even at a second ring and Annie was forced to go to the door herself or leave the poor man dripping in the cold wind outside She had made up her mind at sight of the books that he was a canvasser for some subscription book such as used to come in her father s time but when she opened to him he took off his hat with a great deal of manner and said Miss Kilburn with so much insinuation of gentle disinterestedness that it flashed upon her that it might be mister Peck Yes she said with confusion while the flash of conjecture faded away mister Brandreth said her visitor whom she now saw to be much younger than mister Peck could be He looked not much more than twenty two or twenty three his damp hair waved and curled upon his temples and forehead and his blue eyes lightened from a beardless and freshly shaven face I called this morning because I felt sure of finding you at home He smiled at his reference to the weather and Annie smiled too as she again answered Yes She did not want his books but she liked something that was cheerful and enthusiastic in him she added Won t you step into the study Thanks yes said the young man flinging off his gossamer and hanging it up to drip into the pan of the hat rack He gathered up his books from the chair where he had laid them and held them at his waist with both hands while he bowed her precedence beside the study door I don t know he began but I ought to apologise for coming on a day like this when you were not expecting to be interrupted Oh no I m not at all busy But you must have had courage to brave a storm like this No The truth is Miss Kilburn I was very anxious to see you about a matter I have at heart that I desire your help with He wants me Annie thought to give him the use of my name as a subscriber to his book there seemed really to be a half dozen books in his bundle and he s come to me first I had expected to come with missus Munger she s a great friend of mine you haven t met her yet but you ll like her she s the leading spirit in South Hatboro and we were coming together this morning but she was unexpectedly called away yesterday and so I ventured to call alone I m very glad to see you mister Brandreth Annie said Then missus Munger has subscribed already and I m only second fiddle after all she thought The truth is said mister Brandreth I m the factotum or teetotum of the South Hatboro ladies book club and I ve been deputed to come and see if you wouldn t like to join it Oh said Annie and with a thrill of dismay she asked herself how much she had let her manner betray that she had supposed he was a book agent I shall be very glad indeed mister Brandreth missus Munger was sure you would said mister Brandreth joyously I ve brought some of the books with me the last he said and Annie had time to get into a new social attitude toward him during their discussion of the books She chose one and mister Brandreth took her subscription and wrote her name in the club book One of the reasons he said why I would have preferred to come with missus Munger is that she is so heart and soul with mo in my little scheme She could have put it before you in so much better light than I can But she was called away so suddenly I hope for no serious cause said Annie Oh no It s just to Cambridge Her son is one of the Freshman Nine and he s been hit by a ball Oh said Annie Yes it s a great pity for missus Munger But I come to you for advice as well as company operation Miss Kilburn You must have met a great many English people in Rome and heard some of them talk about it We re thinking some of the young people here about getting up some outdoor theatricals like Lady Archibald Campbell s don t you know You know about them he added at the blankness in her face I read accounts of them in the English papers They must have been very original But do you think that in a community like Hatboro Are there enough who could enter into the spirit Oh yes indeed cried mister Brandreth ardently You ve no idea what a place Hatboro has got to be You ve not been about much yet Miss Kilburn No said Annie I haven t really been off our own place since I came I ve seen nobody but two or three old friends and we naturally talked more about old times than anything else But I hear that there are great changes Yes said mister Brandreth The social growth has been even greater than the business growth You ve no idea People have come in for the winter as well as the summer South Hatboro where we live you must see South Hatboro Miss Kilburn is quite a famous health resort A great many Boston doctors send their patients to us now instead of Colorado or the Adirondacks In fact that s what brought us to Hatboro My mother couldn t have lived if she had tried to stay in Melrose One lung all gone and the other seriously affected And people have found out what a charming place it is for the summer It s cool and it s so near you know the gentlemen can run out every night only an hour and a quarter from town and expresses both ways All very agreeable people too and cultivated mister Fellows the painter makes a long summer he bought an old farm house and built a studio Miss Jennings the flower painter has a little box there too mister Chapley the publisher of New York has built the Misses Clevinger and missus Valence are all near us There s one family from Chicago quite nice New England by birth you know and missus Munger of course so that there s a very pleasant variety I certainly had no idea of it said Annie I knew you couldn t have said mister Brandreth or you wouldn t have felt any doubt about our having the material for the theatricals You see I want to interest all the nice people in it and make it a whole town affair I think it s a great pity for some of the old village families and the summer folks as they call us not to mingle more than they do and missus Munger thinks so too and we ve been talking you over Miss Kilburn and we ve decided that you could do more than anybody else to help on a scheme that s meant to bring them together Because I m neither summer folks nor old village families asked Annie Because you re both retorted mister Brandreth I don t see that said Annie but we ll suppose the case for the sake of argument What do you expect me to do in theatricals in doors or out I never took part in anything of the kind I can t see an inch beyond the end of my nose without glasses I never could learn the simplest thing by heart I m clumsy and awkward I get confused Oh my dear Miss Kilburn spare yourself We don t expect you to take part in the play I don t admit that you re what you say at all but we only want you to lend us your countenance Oh is that all And what do you expect to do with my countenance Annie said with a laugh of misgiving Everything We know how much influence your name has one of the old Hatboro names in the community and all that and we do want to interest the whole community in our scheme We want to establish a Social Union for the work people don t you know and we think it would be much nicer if it seemed to originate with the old village people Annie could not resist an impression in favour of the scheme It gave definition to the vague intentions with which she had returned to Hatboro it might afford her a chance to make reparation for the figure on the soldiers monument I m not sure she began If I knew just what a Social Union is Well at first mister Brandreth interposed it will only be a reading room supplied with the magazines and papers and well lighted and heated where the work people those who have no families especially could spend their evenings Afterward we should hope to have a kitchen and supply tea and coffee and oysters perhaps at a nominal cost and ice cream in the summer But what have your outdoor theatricals to do But of course You intend to give the proceeds Exactly And we want the proceeds to be as large as possible We propose to give our time and money to getting the thing up in the best shape and then we want all the villagers to give their half dollars and make it a success every way I see said Annie We want it to be successful and we want it to be distinguished we want to make it unique missus Munger is going to give her grounds and the decorations and there will be a supper afterward and a little dance Such things are a great deal of trouble said Annie with a smile from the vantage ground of her larger experience What do you propose to do what play Well we ve about decided upon some scenes from Romeo and Juliet They would be very easy to set outdoors don t you know and everybody knows them and they wouldn t be hard to do The ballroom in the house of the Capulets could be made to open on a kind of garden terrace missus Munger has a lovely terrace in her grounds for lawn tennis and then we could have a minuet on the grass You know Miss Mather introduces a minuet in that scene and makes a great deal of it Or I forgot She s come up since you went away Yes I hadn t heard of her Isn t a minuet at Verona in the time of the Scaligeri rather Well yes it is rather But you ve no idea how pretty it is And then you know we could have the whole of the balcony scene and other bits that we choose to work in perhaps parts of other acts that would suit the scene Yes it would be charming I can see how very charming it could be made Then we may count upon you he asked Yes yes she said but I don t really know what I m to do mister Brandreth had risen but he sat down again as if glad to afford her any light he could throw upon the subject How am I to influence people as you say she continued I m quite a stranger in Hatboro I hardly know anybody But a great many people know you Miss Kilburn Your name is associated with the history of the place and you could do everything for us You won t refuse cried mister Brandreth winningly For instance you know missus Wilmington Oh yes she s an old girl friend of mine Then you know how enormously clever she is She can do anything We want her to take an active part the part of the Nurse She s delightfully funny But you know her peculiar temperament how she hates initiative of all kinds and we want somebody to bring mister Wilmington round If we could get them committed to the scheme and a man like mister Putney he d make a capital Mercutio it would go like wildfire We want to interest the churches too The object is so worthy and the theatricals will be so entirely unobjectionable in every respect We have the Unitarians and Universalists of course The Baptists and Methodists will be hard to manage but the Orthodox are of so many different shades and I understand the new minister mister Peck is very liberal He was here in your house I believe Yes but I never saw him said Annie He boarded with the farmer I m a Unitarian myself Of course It would be a great point gained if we could interest him Every care will be taken to have the affair unobjectionable You see the design is to let everybody come to the theatricals and only those remain to the supper and dance whom we invite That will keep out the socially objectionable element the shoe shop hands and the straw shop girls Oh said Annie But isn t the the Social Union for just that class Yes it s expressly for them and we intend to organise a system of entertainments lectures concerts readings for the winter and keep them interested the whole year round in it The object is to show them that the best people in the community have their interests at heart and wish to get on common ground with them Yes said Annie the object is certainly very good mister Brandreth rose again and put out his hand Then you will help us Oh I don t know about that yet At least you won t hinder us Certainly not Then I consider you in a very hopeful condition Miss Kilburn and I feel that I can safely leave you to missus Munger She is coming to see you as soon as she gets back Annie found herself sadder when he was gone and she threw herself upon the old feather cushioned lounge to enjoy a reverie in keeping with the dreary storm outside Was it for this that she had left Rome She had felt as every American of conscience feels abroad the drawings of a duty obscure and indefinable toward her country the duty to come home and do something for it be something in it This is the impulse of no common patriotism it is perhaps a sense of the opportunity which America supremely affords for the race to help itself and for each member of it to help all the rest But from the moment Annie arrived in Hatboro the difficulty of being helpful to anything or any one had increased upon her with every new fact that she had learned about it and the people in it To her they seemed terribly self sufficing They seemed occupied and prosperous from her front parlour window she did not see anybody going by who appeared to be in need of her and she shrank from a more thorough exploration of the place She found she had fancied necessity coming to her and taking away her good works as it were in a basket but till mister Brandreth appeared with his scheme nothing had applied for her help She had always hated theatricals they bored her and yet the Social Union was a good object and if this scheme would bring her acquainted in Hatboro it might be the stepping stone to something better something really or more ideally useful She wondered what South Hatboro was like she would get missus Bolton s opinion which if severe would be just She would ask missus Bolton about missus Munger too She would tell missus Bolton to tell mister Peck to call to dine Would it be thought patronising to mister Peck The fire from the Franklin stove diffused a drowsy comfort through the room the rain lashed the window panes and the wind shrilled in the gable Annie fell off to sleep When she woke up she heard missus Bolton laying the table for her one o clock dinner and she knew it was half past twelve because missus Bolton always laid the table just half an hour beforehand She went out to speak to missus Bolton There was no want of distinctness in missus Bolton s opinion but Annie felt that there was a want of perspective and proportion in it arising from the narrowness of missus Bolton s experience and her ignorance of the world she was farm bred and she had always lived upon the outskirts of Hatboro even when it was a much smaller place than now But missus Bolton had her criterions and she believed in them firmly in a time when agnosticism extends among cultivated people to every region of conjecture the social convictions of missus Bolton were untainted by misgiving In the first place she despised laziness and as South Hatboro was the summer home of open and avowed disoccupation of an idleness so entire that it had to seek refuge from itself in all manner of pastimes she held its population in a contempt to which her meagre phrase did imperfect justice From time to time she had to stop altogether and vent it in Wells of varying accents and inflections but all expressive of aversion and in snorts and sniffs still more intense in purport Then she held that people who had nothing else to do ought at least to be exemplary in their lives and she was merciless to the goings on in South Hatboro which had penetrated on the breath of scandal to the elder village When Annie came to find out what these were she did not think them dreadful they were small flirtations and harmless intimacies between the members of the summer community which in the imagination of the village blackened into guilty intrigue On the tongues of some South Hatboro was another Gomorrah missus Bolton believed the worst especially of the women I hear said missus Bolton that them women come up here for rest I don t know what they want to rest from but if it s from doin nothin all winter long I guess they go back to the city poot near s tired s they come Perhaps Annie felt that it was useless to try to enlighten her in regard to the fatigues from which the summer sojourner in the country escapes so eagerly the cares of giving and going to lunches and dinners the labour of afternoon teas the late hours and the heavy suppers of evening receptions the drain of charity doing and play going the slavery of amateur art study and parlour readings and musicales the writing of invitations and acceptances and refusals the trying on of dresses the calls made and received She let her talk on and tried to figure as well as she could from her talk the form and magnitude of the task laid upon her by mister Brandreth of reconciling Old Hatboro to South Hatboro and uniting them in a common enterprise missus Bolton she said abruptly leaving the subject at last I ve been thinking whether I oughtn t to do something about mister Peck I don t want him to feel that he was unwelcome to me in my house I should like him to feel that I approved of his having been here As this was not a question missus Bolton after the fashion of country people held her peace and Annie went on Does he never come to see you Well he was here last night said missus Bolton Last night cried Annie Why in the world didn t you let me know I didn t know as you wanted to know began missus Bolton with a sullen defiance mixed with pleasure in Annie s reproach He was out there in my settin room with his little girl But don t you see that if you didn t let me know he was here it would look to him as if I didn t wish to meet him as if I had told you that you were not to introduce him Probably missus Bolton believed too that a man s mind was agile enough for these conjectures but she said she did not suppose he would take it in that way she added that he stayed longer than she expected because the little girl seemed to like it so much she always cried when she had to go away Do you mean that she s attached to the place demanded Annie Well yes she is missus Bolton admitted And the cat Annie had a great desire to tell missus Bolton that she had behaved very stupidly But she knew missus Bolton would not stand that and she had to content herself with saying severely The next time he comes let me know without fail please What is the child like she asked Well I guess it must favour the mother if anything It don t seem to take after him any Why don t you have it here often then asked Annie if it s so much attached to the place Well I didn t know as you wanted to have it round replied missus Bolton bluntly Annie made a Tchk of impatience with her obtuseness and asked Where is mister Peck staying Well he s staying at Mis Warner s till he can get settled Is it far from here It s down in the north part of the village Over the Track Is mister Bolton at home Yes he is said missus Bolton with the effect of not intending to deny it Then I want him to hitch up now at once right away and go and get the child and bring her here to dinner with me Annie got so far with her severity feeling that it was needed to mask a proceeding so romantic perhaps so silly She added timidly Can he do it I d know but what he can said missus Bolton dryly and whatever her feeling really was in regard to the matter her manner gave no hint of it Annie did not know whether Bolton was going on her errand or not from missus Bolton but in ten or twelve minutes she saw him emerge from the avenue into the street in the carry all tightly curtained against the storm Half an hour later he returned and his wife set down in the library a shabbily dressed little girl with her cheeks bright and her hair curling from the weather and staring at Annie and rather disposed to cry She said hastily Bring in the cat missus Bolton we re going to have the cat to dinner with us This inspiration seemed to decide the little girl against crying The cat was equipped with a doily and actually provided with dinner at a small table apart the child did not look at it as Annie had expected she would but remained with her eyes fastened on Annie herself She did not stir from the spot where missus Bolton had put her down but she let Annie take her up and arrange her in a chair with large books graduated to the desired height under her and made no sign of satisfaction or disapproval Once she looked round when missus Bolton finally went out after bringing in the last dish for dinner and then fastened her eyes on Annie again twisting her head shyly round to follow her in every gesture and expression as Annie fitted on a napkin under her chin cut up her meat poured her milk and buttered her bread She answered nothing to the chatter which Annie tried to make lively and entertaining and made no sound but that of a broken and suppressed breathing Annie had forgotten to ask her name of missus Bolton and she asked it in vain of the child herself with a great variety of circumlocution she was so unused to children that she was ashamed to invent any pet name for her she called her in what she felt to be a stiff and school mistressly fashion Little Girl and talked on at her growing more and more nervous herself without perceiving that the child s condition was approaching a climax She had taken off her glasses from the notion that they embarrassed her guest and she did not see the pretty lips beginning to curl nor the searching eyes clouding with tears the storm of sobs that suddenly burst upon her astounded her missus Bolton missus Bolton she screamed in hysterical helplessness missus Bolton rushed in and with an instant perception of the situation caught the child to her bony breast and fled with it to her own room where Annie heard its wails die gradually away amid murmurs of comfort and reassurance from missus Bolton She felt like a great criminal and a great fool at the same time she was vexed with the stupid child which she had meant so well by and indignant with missus Bolton whose flight with it had somehow implied a reproach of her behaviour When she could govern herself she went out to missus Bolton s room where she found the little one quiet enough and missus Bolton tying on the long apron in which she cleared up the dinner and washed the dishes I guess she ll get along now she said without the critical tone which Annie was prepared to resent She was scared some and she felt kind of strange I presume Yes and I behaved like a simpleton dressing up the cat I suppose answered Annie But I thought it would amuse her You can t tell how children will take a thing I don t believe they like anything that s out of the common well not a great deal There was a leniency in missus Bolton s manner which encouraged Annie to go on and accuse herself more and more and then an unresponsive blankness that silenced her She went back to her own rooms and to get away from her shame she began to write a letter It was to a friend in Rome and from the sense we all have that a letter which is to go such a great distance ought to be a long letter and from finding that she had really a good deal to say she let it grow so that she began apologising for its length half a dozen pages before the end It took her nearly the whole afternoon and she regained a little of her self respect by ridiculing the people she had met VI Toward five o clock Annie was interrupted by a knock at her door which ought to have prepared her for something unusual for it was missus Bolton s habit to come and go without knocking But she called Come in without rising from her letter and missus Bolton entered with a stranger The little girl clung to his forefinger pressing her head against his leg and glancing shyly up at Annie She sprang up and This is mister Peck Miss Kilburn said missus Bolton How do you do said mister Peck taking the hand she gave him He was gaunt without being tall and his clothes hung loosely about him as if he had fallen away in them since they were made His face was almost the face of the caricature American deep slightly curved vertical lines enclosed his mouth in their parenthesis a thin dust coloured beard fell from his cheeks and chin his upper lip was shaven But instead of the slight frown of challenge and self assertion which marks this face in the type his large blue eyes set near together gazed sadly from under a smooth forehead extending itself well up toward the crown where his dry hair dropped over it I am very glad to see you mister Peck said Annie I ve wanted to tell you how pleased I am that you found shelter in my old home when you first came to Hatboro mister Peck s trousers were short and badly kneed and his long coat hung formlessly from his shoulders she involuntarily took a patronising tone toward him which was not habitual with her Thank you he said with the dry serious voice which seemed the fit vocal expression of his presence I have been afraid that it seemed like an intrusion to you Oh not the least retorted Annie You were very welcome I hope you re comfortably placed where you are now Quite so said the minister I d heard so much of your little girl from missus Bolton and her attachment to the house that I ventured to send for her to day But I believe I gave her rather a bad quarter of an hour and that she liked the place better under missus Bolton s regime She expected some deprecatory expression of gratitude from him which would relieve her of the lingering shame she felt for having managed so badly but he made none It was my fault I m not used to children and I hadn t taken the precaution to ask her name Her name is Idella said the minister Annie thought it very ugly but with the intention of saying something kind she said What a quaint name It was her mother s choice returned the minister Her own name was Ella and my mother s name was Ida she combined the two Oh said Annie She abhorred those made up names in which the New England country people sometimes indulge their fancy and Idella struck her as a particularly repulsive invention but she felt that she must not visit the fault upon the little creature Don t you think you could give me another trial some time Idella She stooped down and took the child s unoccupied hand which she let her keep only twisting her face away to hide it in her father s pantaloon leg Come now won t you give me a forgiving little kiss Idella looked round and Annie made bold to gather her up Idella broke into a laugh and took Annie s cheeks between her hands Well I declare said missus Bolton You never can tell what that child will do next I never can tell what I will do next myself said Annie She liked the feeling of the little warm soft body in her arms against her breast and it was flattering to have triumphed where she had seemed to fail so desperately They had all been standing and she now said Won t you sit down mister Peck She added by an impulse which she instantly thought ill advised There is something I would like to speak to you about Thank you said mister Peck seating himself beyond the stove We must be getting home before a great while It is nearly tea time I won t detain you unduly said Annie missus Bolton left them at her hint of something special to say to the minister Annie could not have had the face to speak of mister Brandreth s theatricals in that grim presence and as it was she resolved to put forward their serious object She began abruptly mister Peck I ve been asked to interest myself for a Social Union which the ladies of South Hatboro are trying to establish for the operatives I suppose you haven t heard anything of the scheme No I hadn t said mister Peck He was one of those people who sit very high and he now seemed taller and more impressive than when he stood It is certainly a very good object Annie resumed and she went on to explain it at second hand from mister Brandreth as well as she could The little girl was standing in her lap and got between her and mister Peck so that she had to look first around one side of her and then another to see how he was taking it He nodded his head and said gravely Yes and Yes and Yes at each significant point of her statement At the end he asked And are the means forthcoming Have they raised the money for renting and furnishing the rooms Well no they haven t yet or not quite as I understand Have they tried to interest the working people themselves in it If they are to value its benefits it ought to cost them something self denial privation even Yes I know Annie began I m not satisfied the minister pursued that it is wise to provide people with even harmless amusements that take them much away from their homes These things are invented by well to do people who have no occupation and think that others want pastimes as much as themselves But what working people want is rest and what they need are decent homes where they can take it Besides unless they help to support this union out of their own means the better sort among them will feel wounded by its existence as a sort of superfluous charity Yes I see said Annie She saw this side of the affair with surprise The minister seemed to have thought more about such matters than she had and she insensibly receded from her first hasty generalisation of him and paused to reapproach him on another level The little girl began to play with her glasses and accidentally knocked them from her nose The minister s face and figure became a blur and in the purblindness to which she was reduced she had a moment of clouded volition in which she was tempted to renounce and even oppose the scheme for a Social Union in spite of her promise to mister Brandreth But she remembered that she was a consistent and faithful person and she said The ladies have a plan for raising the money and they ve applied to me to second it to use my influence somehow among the villagers to get them interested and the working people can help too if they choose But I m quite a stranger amongst those I m expected to influence and I don t at all know how they will take it The minister listened neither prompting nor interrupting The ladies plan is to have an entertainment at one of the cottages and charge an admission and devote the proceeds to the union She paused mister Peck still remained silent but she knew he was attentive She pushed on They intend to have a a representation in the open air of one of Shakespeare s plays or scenes from one Do you wish me interrupted the minister to promote the establishment of this union Is that why you speak to me of it Why I don t know why I speak to you of it she replied with a laugh of embarrassment to which he was cold apparently I certainly couldn t ask you to take part in an affair that you didn t approve I don t know that I disapprove of it Properly managed it might be a good thing Yes of course But I understand why you might not sympathise with that part of it and that is why I told you of it said Annie What part The the theatricals Why not asked the minister I know missus Bolton told me you were very liberal Annie faltered on but I didn t expect you as a But of course I read Shakespeare a great deal said mister Peck I have never been in the theatre but I should like to see one of his plays represented where it could cause no one to offend Yes said Annie and this would be by amateurs and there could be no possible offence in it I wished to know how the general idea would strike you Of course the ladies would be only too glad of your advice and company operation Their plan is to sell tickets to every one for the theatricals and to a certain number of invited persons for a supper and a little dance afterward on the lawn I don t know if I understand exactly said the minister Annie repeated her statement more definitely and explained from mister Brandreth as before that the invitations were to be given so as to eliminate the shop hand element from the supper and dance mister Peck listened quietly That would prevent my taking part in the affair he said as quietly as he had listened Of course dancing Annie began It is not that Many people who hold strictly to the old opinions now allow their children to learn dancing But I could not join at all with those who were willing to lay the foundations of a Social Union in a social disunion in the exclusion of its beneficiaries from the society of their benefactors He was not sarcastic but the grotesqueness of the situation as he had sketched it was apparent She remembered now that she had felt something incongruous in it when mister Brandreth exposed it but not deeply The minister continued gently The ladies who are trying to get up this Social Union proceed upon the assumption that working people can neither see nor feel a slight but it is a great mistake to do so Annie had the obtuseness about those she fancied below her which is one of the consequences of being brought up in a superior station She believed that there was something to say on the other side and she attempted to say it I don t know that you could call it a slight exactly People can ask those they prefer to a social entertainment Yes if it is for their own pleasure But even in a public affair like this the work people would feel uncomfortable and out of place wouldn t they if they stayed to the supper and the dance They might be exposed to greater suffering among those whose manners and breeding were different and it might be very embarrassing all round Isn t there that side to be regarded You beg the question said the minister as unsparingly as if she were a man The point is whether a Social Union beginning in social exclusion could ever do any good What part do these ladies expect to take in maintaining it Do they intend to spend their evenings there to associate on equal terms with the shoe shop and straw shop hands I don t suppose they do but I don t know said Annie dryly and she replied by helplessly quoting mister Brandreth They intend to organise a system of lectures concerts and readings They wish to get on common ground with them They can never get on common ground with them in that way said the minister No doubt they think they want to do them good but good is from the heart and there is no heart in what they propose The working people would know that at once Then you mean to say Annie asked half alarmed and half amused that there can be no friendly intercourse with the poor and the well to do unless it is based upon social equality I will answer your question by asking another Suppose you were one of the poor and the well to do offered to be friendly with you on such terms as you have mentioned how should you feel toward them If you make it a personal question It makes itself a personal question said the minister dispassionately Well then I trust I should have the good sense to see that social equality between people who were better dressed better taught and better bred than myself was impossible and that for me to force myself into their company was not only bad taste but it was foolish I have often heard my father say that the great superiority of the American practice of democracy over the French ideal was that it didn t involve any assumption of social equality He said that equality before the law and in politics was sacred but that the principle could never govern society and that Americans all instinctively recognised it And I believe that to try to mix the different classes would be un American mister Peck smiled and this was the first break in his seriousness We don t know what is or will be American yet But we will suppose you are quite right The question is how would you feel toward the people whose company you wouldn t force yourself into Why of course Annie was surprised into saying I suppose I shouldn t feel very kindly toward them Even if you knew that they felt kindly toward you I m afraid that would only make the matter worse she said with an uneasy laugh The minister was silent on his side of the stove But do I understand you to say she demanded that there can be no love at all no kindness between the rich and the poor God tells us all to love one another Surely said the minister Would you suffer such a slight as your friends propose to be offered to any one you loved She did not answer and he continued thoughtfully I suppose that if a poor person could do a rich person a kindness which cost him some sacrifice he might love him In that case there could be love between the rich and the poor And there could be no love if a rich man did the same Oh yes the minister said upon the same ground Only the rich man would have to make a sacrifice first that he would really feel Then you mean to say that people can t do any good at all with their money Annie asked Money is a palliative but it can t cure It can sometimes create a bond of gratitude perhaps but it can t create sympathy between rich and poor But why can t it Because sympathy common feeling the sense of fraternity can spring only from like experiences like hopes like fears And money cannot buy these He rose and looked a moment about him as if trying to recall something Then with a stiff obeisance he said Good evening and went out while she remained daunted and bewildered with the child in her arms as unconscious of having kept it as he of having left it with her missus Bolton must have reminded him of his oversight for after being gone so long as it would have taken him to walk to her parlour and back he returned and said simply I forgot Idella He put out his hands to take her but she turned perversely from him and hid her face in Annie s neck pushing his hands away with a backward reach of her little arm Come Idella he said Idella only snuggled the closer missus Bolton came in with the little girl s wraps they were very common and poor and the thought of getting her something prettier went through Annie s mind At sight of missus Bolton the child turned from Annie to her older friend I m afraid you have a woman child for your daughter mister Peck said Annie remotely hurt at the little one s fickleness Neither mister Peck nor missus Bolton smiled and with some vague intention of showing him that she could meet the poor on common ground by sharing their labours she knelt down and helped missus Bolton tie on and button on Idella s things VII Next morning the day broke clear after the long storm and Annie woke in revolt against the sort of subjection in which she had parted from mister Peck She felt the need of showing missus Bolton that although she had been civil to him she had no sympathy with his ideas but she could not think of any way to formulate her opposition and all she could say in offence was Does mister Peck usually forget his child when he starts home I don t know as he does answered missus Bolton simply He s rather of an absent minded man and I suppose he s like other men when he gets talking The child s clothes were disgracefully shabby said Annie vexed that her attack could come to no more than this I presume said missus Bolton that if he kept more of his money for himself he could dress her better Oh that s the way with these philanthropists said Annie thinking of Hollingsworth in The Blithedale Romance the only philanthropist whom she had really ever known They are always ready to sacrifice the happiness and comfort of any one to the general good missus Bolton stood a moment and then went out without replying but she looked as offended as Annie could have wished About ten o clock the bell rang and she came gloomily into the study and announced that missus Munger was in the parlour Annie had already heard an authoritative rustling of skirts and she was instinctively prepared for the large vigorous woman who turned upon her from the picture she had been looking at on the wall and came toward her with the confident air of one sure they must be friends missus Munger was dressed in a dark firm woollen stuff which communicated its colour if not its material to the matter of fact bonnet which she wore on her plainly dressed hair In one of her hands which were cased in driving gloves of somewhat insistent evidence she carried a robust black silk sun umbrella and the effect of her dress otherwise might be summarised in the statement that where other women would have worn lace she seemed to wear leather She had not only leather gloves and a broad leather belt at her waist but a leather collar her watch was secured by a leather cord passing round her neck and the stubby tassel of her umbrella stick was leather she might be said to be in harness She had a large handsome face no longer fresh but with an effect of exemplary cleanness and a pair of large grey eyes that suggested the notion of being newly washed and that now looked at Annie with the assumption of fully understanding her Ah Miss Kilburn she said without any of the wonted preliminaries of introduction and greeting I should have come long ago to see you but I ve been dispersed over the four quarters of the globe ever since you came my dear I got home last night on the nine o clock train in the last agonies of that howling tempest Did you ever know anything like it I see your trees have escaped I wonder they weren t torn to shreds Annie took her on her own ground of ignoring their past non acquaintance Yes it was awful And your son how did you leave him mister Brandreth Oh yes poor little man I found him waiting for me at home last night and he told me he had been here He was blowing about in the storm all day Such a spirit There was nothing serious the matter the bridge of the nose was all right merely the cartilage pushed aside by the ball She had passed so lightly from mister Brandreth s heroic spirit to her son s nose that Annie woman as she was and born to these bold bounds over sequence was not sure where they had arrived till missus Munger added Jim s used to these things I m thankful it wasn t a finger or an eye What is that She jumped from her chair and swooped upon the Spanish Roman water colour Annie had stood against some books on the table pending its final disposition It s only a Guerra said Annie My things are all scattered about still I have scarcely tried to get into shape yet missus Munger would not let her interpose any idea of there being a past between them She merely said You knew the Herricks at Rome of course I m in hopes I shall get them here when they come back I want you to help me colonise Hatboro with the right sort of people it s so easy to get the wrong sort But so far I think we ve succeeded beyond our wildest dreams It s easy enough to get nice people together at the seaside but inland No it s only a very few nice people who will come into the country for the summer and we propose to make Hatboro a winter colony too that gives us agreeable invalids you know it gave us the Brandreths He told you of our projected theatricals I suppose Yes said Annie non committally he did I know just how you feel about it my dear said missus Munger Been there myself as Jim says But it grows upon you I m glad you didn t refuse outright and missus Munger looked at her with eyes of large expectance No I didn t said Annie obliged by this expectance to say something But to tell you the truth missus Munger I don t see how I m to be of any use to you or to mister Brandreth Oh take a cab and go about like Boots and Brewer you know for the Veneerings She said this as if she knew about the humour rather than felt it We are placing all our hopes of bringing round the Old Hatborians in you I m afraid you re mistaken about my influence said Annie mister Brandreth spoke of it and I had an opportunity of trying it last night and seeing just what it amounted to Yes missus Munger prompted with an increase of expectance in her large clear eyes and of impartiality in her whole face mister Peck was here said Annie reluctantly and I tried it on him Yes repeated missus Munger as immutably as if she were sitting for her photograph and keeping the expression Annie broke from her reluctance with a sort of violence which carried her further than she would have gone otherwise She ridiculed mister Peck s appearance and manner and laughed at his ideas to missus Munger She had not a good conscience in it but the perverse impulse persisted in her There seemed no other way in which she could assert herself against him missus Munger listened judicially but she seemed to take in only what mister Peck had thought of the dance and supper at the end she said rather vacantly What nonsense Yes but I m afraid he thinks it s wisdom and for all practical purposes it amounts to that You see what my influence has done at the outset missus Munger He ll never give way on such a point Oh very well then said missus Munger with the utmost lightness and indifference we ll drop the idea of the invited supper and dance Do you think that would be well asked Annie Yes why not It s only an idea I don t think you ve made at all a bad beginning It was very well to try the idea on some one who would be frank about it and wouldn t go away and talk against it said missus Munger rising I want you to come with me my dear To see mister Peck Excuse me I don t think I could said Annie No to see some of his parishioners said missus Munger His deacons to begin with or his deacons wives This seemed so much less than calling on mister Peck that Annie looked out at missus Munger s basket phaeton at her gate and knew that she would go with very little more urgence After all you know you re not one of his congregation he may yield to them said missus Munger We must have him if only because he s hard to get It ll give us an idea of what we ve got to contend with It had a very practical sound it was really like meeting the difficulties on their own ground and it overcame the question of taste which was rising in Annie s mind She demurred a little more upon the theory of her uselessness but missus Munger insisted and carried her off down the village street The air sparkled full of sun and a breeze from the south west frolicked with the twinkling leaves of the overarching elms and made their shadows dance on the crisp roadway packed hard by the rain and faced with clean sand which crackled pleasantly under missus Munger s phaeton wheels She talked incessantly I think we ll go first to missus Gerrish s and then to missus Wilmington s You know them Oh yes they were old girl friends Then you know why I go to missus Gerrish s first She ll care a great deal and missus Wilmington won t care at all She s a delicious creature missus Wilmington don t you think That large indolent nature mister Brandreth says she makes him think of the land in which it seemed always afternoon Annie remembered Lyra Goodman as a long lazy red haired girl who laughed easily and she could not readily realise her in the character of a Titian esque beauty with a gift for humorous dramatics which she had filled out into during the years of her absence from Hatboro but she said Oh yes in the necessity of polite acquiescence and missus Munger went on talking She s the only one of the Old Hatboro people so far as I know them who has any breadth of view Whoa She pulled up suddenly beside a stout short lady in a fashionable walking dress who was pushing an elegant perambulator with one hand and shielding her complexion with a crimson sun umbrella in the other missus Gerrish missus Munger called and missus Gerrish who had already looked around at the approaching phaeton and then looked away so as not to have seemed to look stopped abruptly and after some exploration of the vicinity discovered where the voice came from Oh missus Munger she called back bridling with pleasure at being greeted in that way by the chief lady of South Hatboro and struggling to keep up a dignified indifference at the same time Why Annie she added Good morning Emmeline said Annie she annexed some irrelevancies about the weather which missus Munger swept away with business like robustness We were driving down to your house to find you I want to see the principal ladies of your church and talk with them about our Social Union You ve heard about it Well nothing very particular said missus Gerrish she had probably heard nothing at all After a moment she asked Have you seen missus Wilmington yet
7059_77900_000016_000000	train-clean-100	 No I haven t 
none	none	cried missus Munger The fact is I wanted to talk it over with you and mister Gerrish first Oh said missus Gerrish brightening Well I was just going right there I guess he s in Well we shall meet there then Sorry I can t offer you a seat But there s nothing but the rumble and that wouldn t hold you all missus Munger called this back after starting her pony missus Gerrish did not understand and screamed What missus Munger repeated her joke at the top of her voice Oh I can walk missus Gerrish yelled at the top of hers Both the ladies laughed at their repartee She s as jealous of missus Wilmington as a cat missus Munger confided to Annie as they drove away and she s just as pleased as Punch that I ve spoken to her first missus Wilmington won t mind She s so delightfully indifferent it really renders her almost superior you might forget that she was a village person But this has been an immense stroke I don t know she mused whether I d better let her get there first and prepare her husband or do it myself No I ll let her I ll stop here at Gates s She stopped at the pavement in front of a provision store and a pale stout man in the long over shirt of his business came out to receive her orders He stood passing his hand through the top of a barrel of beans and listened to missus Munger with a humorous patient smile mister Gates I want you to send me up a leg of lamb for dinner a large one Last year s then suggested Gates No this year s insisted missus Munger and Gates gave way with the air of pacifying a wilful child which would get after all only what he chose to allow it All right ma am a large leg of this year s lamb grown to order Any peas spinnage cucumbers sparrowgrass Southern I suppose said missus Munger Well not if you want to call em native said Gates Yes I ll take two bunches of asparagus and some peas Any strawberries natives suggested Gates Nonsense Same thing natives of Norfolk You had better be honest with me mister Gates said missus Munger Yes I ll take a couple of boxes All right Want em nice and the biggest ones at the bottom of the box Yes I do That s what I thought Some customers wants the big ones on top but I tell em it s all foolishness just vanity Gates laughed a dry hacking little laugh at his drollery and kept his eyes on Annie She smiled at last with permissive recognition and Gates came forward Used to know your father pretty well but I can t keep up with the young folks any more He was really not many years older than Annie he rubbed his right hand on the inside of his long shirt and gave it her to shake Well you haven t been about much for the last nine or ten years that s a fact Eleven said Annie trying to be gay with the hand shaking and wondering if this were meeting the lower classes on common ground and what mister Peck would think of it That so queried Gates Well I declare No wonder you ve grown He hacked out another laugh and stood on the curb stone looking at Annie a moment Then he asked Anything else missus Munger No that s all Tell me mister Gates how do mister Peck and mister Gerrish get on asked missus Munger in a lower tone Well said Gates he s workin round the deacon s workin round gradually I guess I guess if mister Peck was to put in a little more brimstone the deacon d be all right He s a great hand for brimstone you know the deacon is missus Munger laughed again and then she said with a proselyting sigh It s a pity you couldn t all find your way into the Church Well may be it would be a good thing said Gates as missus Munger gathered up her reins and chirped to her pony He isn t a member of mister Peck s church she explained to Annie but he s one of the society and his wife s very devout Orthodox He s a great character we think and he ll treat you very well if you keep on the right side of him They say he cheats awfully in the weight though VIII missus Munger drove across the street and drew up before a large handsomely ugly brick dry goods store whose showy windows had caught Annie s eye the day she arrived in Hatboro I see missus Gerrish has got here first missus Munger said indicating the perambulator at the door and she dismounted and fastened her pony with a weight which she took from the front of the phaeton On either door jamb of the store was a curved plate of polished metal with the name GERRISH cut into it in black letters the sills of the wide windows were of metal and bore the same legend At the threshold a very prim ceremonious little man spare and straight met missus Munger with a ceremonious bow and a solemn How do you do ma am I how do you do I hope I see you well and he put a small dry hand into the ample clasp of missus Munger s gauntlet Very well indeed mister Gerrish Isn t it a lovely morning You know Miss Kilburn mister Gerrish He took Annie s hand into his right and covered it with his left lifting his eyes to look her in the face with an old merchant like cordiality Why yes indeed Delighted to see her Her father was one of my best friends I may say that I owe everything that I am to Squire Kilburn he advised me to stick to commerce when I once thought of studying law Glad to welcome you back to Hatboro Miss Kilburn You see changes on the surface no doubt but you ll find the genuine old feeling here Walk right back ladies he continued releasing Annie s hand to waft them before him toward the rear of the store You ll find missus Gerrish in my room there my Growlery as I call it He seemed to think he had invented the name And missus Gerrish tells me that you ve really come back he said leaning decorously toward Annie as they walked with the intention of taking up your residence permanently among us You will find very few places like Hatboro As he spoke walking with his hands clasped behind him he glanced to right and left at the shop girls on foot behind the counter who dropped their eyes under their different bangs as they caught his glance and bridled nervously He denied them the use of chewing gum he permitted no conversation as he called it among them and he addressed no jokes or idle speeches to them himself A system of grooves overhead brought to his counting room the cash from the clerks in wooden balls and he returned the change and kept the accounts with a pitiless eye for errors The women were afraid of him and hated him with bitterness which exploded at crises in excesses of hysterical impudence His store was an example of variety punctuality and quality Upon the theory for which he deserved the credit of giving to a country place the advantages of one of the great city establishments he was gradually gathering in their fashion the small commerce into his hands He had already opened his bazaar through into the adjoining store which he had bought out and he kept every sort of thing desired or needed in a country town with a tempting stock of articles before unknown to the shopkeepers of Hatboro Everything was of the very quality represented the prices were low but inflexible and cash payments except in the case of some rich customers of unimpeachable credit were invariably exacted at the same time every reasonable facility for the exchange or return of goods was afforded Nothing could exceed the justice and fidelity of his dealing with the public He had even some effects of generosity in his dealing with his dependants he furnished them free seats in the churches of their different persuasions and he closed every night at six o clock except Saturday when the shop hands were paid off and made their purchases for the coming week He stepped lightly before Annie and missus Munger and pushed open the ground glass door of his office for them It was like a bank parlour except for missus Gerrish sitting in her husband s leather cushioned swivel chair with her last born in her lap she greeted the others noisily without trying to rise You see we are quite at home here said mister Gerrish Yes and very snug you are too said missus Munger taking one half of the leather lounge and leaving the other half to Annie I don t wonder missus Gerrish likes to visit you here mister Gerrish laughed and said to his wife who moved provisionally in her chair seeing he had none Sit still my dear I prefer my usual perch He took a high stool beside a desk and gathered a ruler in his hand Well I may as well begin at the beginning said missus Munger and I ll try to be short for I know that these are business hours Take all the time you want missus Munger said mister Gerrish affably It s my idea that a good business man s business can go on without him when necessary Of course missus Munger sighed If everybody had your system mister Gerrish She went on and succinctly expounded the scheme of the Social Union I suppose I can t deny that the idea occurred to me she concluded but we can t hope to develop it without the company operation of the ladies of Old Hatboro and I ve come first of all to missus Gerrish mister Gerrish bowed his acknowledgments of the honour done his wife with a gravity which she misinterpreted I think she began with her censorious manner and accent that these people have too much done for them now They re perfectly spoiled Don t you Annie mister Gerrish did not give Annie time to answer I differ with you my dear he cut in It is my opinion Or I don t know but you wish to confine this matter entirely to the ladies he suggested to missus Munger Oh I m only too proud and glad that you feel interested in the matter cried missus Munger Without the gentlemen s practical views we ladies are such feeble folk mere conies in the rocks I am as much opposed as missus Gerrish or any one to acceding to unjust demands on the part of my clerks or other employees mister Gerrish began Yes that s what I mean said his wife and broke down with a giggle He went on without regarding her I have always made it a rule as far as business went to keep my own affairs entirely in my own hands I fix the hours and I fix the wages and I fix all the other conditions and I say plainly If you don t like them don t come or don t stay and I never have any difficulty I m sure said missus Munger that if all the employers in the country would take such a stand there would soon be an end of labour troubles I think we re too concessive And I do too missus Munger cried missus Gerrish glad of the occasion to be censorious and of the finer lady s opinion at the same time That s what I meant Don t you Annie I m afraid I don t understand exactly Annie replied mister Gerrish kept his eye on missus Munger s face now arranged for indefinite photography as he went on That is exactly what I say to them That is what I said to mister Marvin one year ago when he had that trouble in his shoe shop I said You re too concessive I said mister Marvin if you give those fellows an inch they ll take an ell mister Marvin said I you ve got to begin by being your own master if you want to be master of anybody else You ve got to put your foot down as mister Lincoln said and as I say you ve got to keep it down missus Gerrish looked at the other ladies for admiration and missus Munger said rapidly without disarranging her face Oh yes And how much misery could be saved in such cases by a little firmness at the outset mister Marvin differed with me said mister Gerrish sorrowfully He agreed with me on the main point but he said that too many of his hands had been in his regiment and he couldn t lock them out He submitted to arbitration And what is arbitration asked mister Gerrish levelling his ruler at missus Munger It is postponing the evil day Exactly said missus Munger without winking mister Marvin mister Gerrish proceeded may be running very smoothly now and sailing before the wind all all nicely but I tell you his house is built upon the sand He put his ruler by on the desk very softly and resumed with impressive quiet I never had any trouble but once I had a porter in this store who wanted his pay raised I simply said that I made it a rule to propose all advances of salary myself and I should submit to no dictation from any one He told me to go to a place that I will not repeat and I told him to walk out of my store He was under the influence of liquor at the time I suppose I understand that he is drinking very hard He does nothing to support his family whatever and from all that I can gather he bids fair to fill a drunkard s grave inside of six months missus Munger seized her opportunity Yes and it is just such cases as this that the Social Union is designed to meet If this man had some such place to spend his evenings and bring his family if he chose where he could get a cup of good coffee for the same price as a glass of rum Don t you see She looked round at the different faces and mister Gerrish slightly frowned as if the vision of the Social Union interposing between his late porter and a drunkard s grave with a cup of good coffee were not to his taste altogether but he said Precisely so And I was about to make the remark that while I am very strict and obliged to be with those under me in business no one is more disposed to promote such objects as this of yours I was sure you would approve of it said missus Munger That is why I came to you to you and missus Gerrish first said missus Munger I was sure you would see it in the right light She looked round at Annie for corroboration and Annie was in the social necessity of making a confirmatory murmur mister Gerrish ignored them both in the more interesting work of celebrating himself I may say that there is not an institution in this town which I have not contributed my humble efforts to to establish from the drinking fountain in front of this store to the soldiers monument on the village green Annie turned red missus Munger said shamelessly That beautiful monument and looked at Annie with eyes full of gratitude to mister Gerrish The schools the sidewalks the water works the free library the introduction of electricity the projected system of drainage and all the various religious enterprises at various times I am proud I am humbly proud that I have been allowed to be the means of doing sustaining He lost himself in the labyrinths of his sentence and missus Munger came to his rescue I fancy Hatboro wouldn t be Hatboro without you mister Gerrish And you don t think that mister Peck s objection will be seriously felt by other leading citizens What is mister Peck s objection demanded mister Gerrish perceptibly bristling up at the name of his pastor Why he talked it over with Miss Kilburn last night and he objected to an entertainment which wouldn t be open to all to the shop hands and everybody missus Munger explained the point fully She repeated some things that Annie had said in ridicule of mister Peck s position regarding it If you do think that part would be bad or impolitic missus Munger concluded we could drop the invited supper and the dance and simply have the theatricals She bent upon mister Gerrish a face of candid deference that filled him with self importance almost to bursting No he said shaking his head and No closing his lips abruptly and opening them again to emit a final No with an explosive force which alone seemed to save him Not at all missus Munger not on any account I am surprised at mister Peck or rather I am not surprised He is not a practical man not a man of the world and I should have much preferred to hear that he objected to the dancing and the play I could have understood that I could have gone with him in that to a certain extent though I can see no harm in such things when properly conducted I have a great respect for mister Peck I was largely instrumental in getting him here but he is altogether wrong in this matter We are not obliged to go out into the highways and the hedges until the bidden guests have er declined Exactly said missus Munger I never thought of that missus Gerrish shifted her baby to another knee and followed her husband with her eyes as he dismounted from his stool and began to pace the room I came into this town a poor boy without a penny in my pocket and I have made my own way every inch of it unaided and alone I am a thorough believer in giving every one an equal chance to rise and to get along I would not throw an obstacle in anybody s way but I do not believe I do not believe in pampering those who have not risen or have made no effort to rise It s their wastefulness in nine cases out of ten that keeps them down said missus Gerrish I don t care what it is I don t ask what it is that keeps them down I don t expect to invite my clerks or missus Gerrish s servants into my parlour I will meet them at the polls or the communion table or on any proper occasion but a man s home is sacred I will not allow my wife or my children to associate with those whose whose whose idleness or vice or whatever has kept them down in a country where where everybody stands on an equality and what I will not do myself I will not ask others to do I make it a rule to do unto others as I would have them do unto me It is all nonsense to attempt to introduce those one ideaed notions into put them in practice Yes said missus Munger with deep conviction that is my own feeling mister Gerrish and I m glad to have it corroborated by your experience Then you wouldn t drop the little invited dance and supper I will tell you how I feel about it missus Munger said mister Gerrish pausing in his walk and putting on a fine patronising gentleman of the old school smile You may put me down for any number of tickets five ten fifteen and you may command me in anything I can do to further the objects of your enterprise if you will keep the invited supper and dance But I should not be prepared to do anything if they are dropped What a comfort it is to meet a person who knows his own mind exclaimed missus Munger Got company Billy asked a voice at the door and it added Glad to see you here missus Gerrish Ah mister Putney Come in Hope I see you well sir cried mister Gerrish Come in he repeated with jovial frankness Nobody but friends here I don t know about that said mister Putney with whimsical perversity holding the door ajar I see that arch conspirator from South Hatboro he said looking at missus Munger He showed himself as he stood holding the door ajar a lank little figure dressed with reckless slovenliness in a suit of old fashioned black a loose neck cloth fell stringing down his shirt front which his unbuttoned waistcoat exposed with its stains from the tobacco upon which his thin little jaws worked mechanically as he stared into the room with flamy blue eyes his silk hat was pushed back from a high clear forehead he had yesterday s stubble on his beardless cheeks a heavy moustache and imperial gave dash to a cast of countenance that might otherwise have seemed slight and effeminate Yes but I m in charge of Miss Kilburn and you needn t be afraid of me Come in We wish to consult you cried missus Munger missus Gerrish cackled some applausive incoherencies Putney advanced into the room and dropped his burlesque air as he approached Annie Miss Kilburn I must apologise for not having called with missus Putney to pay my respects I have been away when I got back I found she had stolen a march on me But I m going to make Ellen bring me at once I don t think I ve been in your house since the old Judge s time Well he was an able man and a good man I was awfully fond of the old Judge in a boy s way Thank you said Annie touched by something gentle and honest in his words He was a Christian gentleman said mister Gerrish with authority Putney said without noticing mister Gerrish Well I m glad you ve come back to the old place Miss Kilburn I almost said Annie I shouldn t have minded Ralph she retorted Shouldn t you Well that s right Putney continued ignoring the laugh of the others at Annie s sally You ll find Hatboro pretty exciting after Rome for a while I suppose But you ll get used to it It s got more of the modern improvements I m told and it s more public spirited more snap to it I m told that there s more enterprise in Hatboro more real crowd in South Hatboro alone than there is in the Quirinal and the Vatican put together You had better come and live at South Hatboro mister Putney that would be just the atmosphere for you said missus Munger with aimless hospitality She said this to every one Is it about coming to South Hatboro you want to consult me asked Putney Well it is and it isn t she began Better be honest missus Munger said Putney You can t do anything for a client who won t be honest with his attorney That s what I have to continually impress upon the reprobates who come to me I say It don t matter what you ve done if you expect me to get you off you ve got to make a clean breast of it They generally do they see the sense of it They all laughed and mister Gerrish said mister Putney is one of Hatboro s privileged characters Miss Kilburn Thank you Billy returned the lawyer with mock tenderness Now missus Munger out with it You ll have to tell him sooner or later missus Munger said missus Gerrish with overweening pleasure in her acquaintance with both of these superior people He ll get it out of you anyway Her husband looked at her and she fell silent missus Munger swept her with a tolerant smile as she looked up at Putney Why it s really Miss Kilburn s affair she began and she laid the case before the lawyer with a fulness that made Annie wince Putney took a piece of tobacco from his pocket and tore off a morsel with his teeth Excuse me Annie It s a beastly habit But it s saved me from something worse You don t know what I ve been but anybody in Hatboro can tell you I made my shame so public that it s no use trying to blink the past You don t have to be a hypocrite in a place where everybody s seen you in the gutter that s the only advantage I ve got over my fellow citizens and of course I abuse it that s nature you know When I began to pull up I found that tobacco helped me I smoked and chewed both now I only chew Well he said dropping the pathetic simplicity with which he had spoken and turning with a fierce jocularity from the shocked and pitying look in Annie s face to missus Munger what do you propose to do Brother Peck s head seems to be pretty level in the abstract Yes said missus Munger willing to put the case impartially and I should be perfectly willing to drop the invited dance and supper if it was thought best though I must say I don t at all agree with mister Peck in principle I don t see what would become of society You ought to be in politics missus Munger said Putney Your readiness to sacrifice principle to expediency shows what a reform will be wrought when you ladies get the suffrage What does Brother Gerrish think No no said missus Munger We want an impartial opinion I always think as Brother Gerrish thinks said Putney I guess you better give up the fandango hey Billy No sir no mister Putney answered the merchant nervously I can t agree with you And I will tell you why sir He gave his reasons with some abatement of pomp and detail and with the tremulous eagerness of a solemn man who expects a sarcastic rejoinder It would be a bad precedent This town is full now of a class of persons who are using every opportunity to to abuse their privileges And this would be simply adding fuel to the flame Do you really think so Billy asked the lawyer with cool derision Well we all abuse our privileges at every opportunity of course I was just saying that I abused mine and I suppose those fellows would abuse theirs if you happened to hurt their wives and daughters feelings And how are you going to manage Aren t you afraid that they will hang around after the show indefinitely unless you ask all those who have not received invitations to the dance and supper to clear the grounds as they do in the circus when the minstrels are going to give a performance not included in the price of admission Mind I don t care anything about your Social Union Oh but surely cried missus Munger you must allow that it s a good object Well perhaps it is if it will keep the men away from the rum holes Yes I guess it is You won t sell liquor We expect to furnish coffee at cost price said missus Munger smiling at Putney s joke And good navy plug too I hope But you see it would be rather awkward don t you You see Annie Yes I see said Annie I hadn t thought of that part before And you didn t agree with Brother Peck on general principles There we see the effect of residence abroad said Putney The uncorrupted or I will say the uninterrupted Hatborian has none of those aristocratic predilections of yours Annie He grows up in a community where there is neither poverty nor richness and where political economy can show by the figures that the profligate shop hands get nine tenths of the profits and starve on em while the good little company rolls in luxury on the other tenth But you ve got used to something different over there and of course Brother Peck s ideas startled you Well I suppose I should have been just so myself mister Putney has never felt just right about the working men since he lost the boycotters case said mister Gerrish with a snicker Oh come now Billy why did you give me away said Putney with mock suffering Well I suppose I might as well own up missus Munger it s no use trying to keep it from you you know it already Yes Annie I defended some poor devils here for combining to injure a non union man for doing once just what the big manufacturing Trusts do every day of the year with impunity and I lost the case I expected to I told em they were wrong but I did my best for em Why you fools said I that s the way I talk to em Annie I call em pet names they like it they re used to em they get em every day in the newspapers you fools said I what do you want to boycott for when you can vote What do you want to break the laws for when you can make em You idiots you said I what do you putter round for persecuting non union men that have as good a right to earn their bread as you when you might make the whole United States of America a Labour Union Of course I didn t say that in court Oh how delicious you are mister Putney said missus Munger Glad you like me missus Munger Putney replied Yes you re delightful said the lady recovering from the effects of the drollery which they had all pretended to enjoy mister Gerrish and missus Gerrish by his leave even more than the others But you re not candid All this doesn t help us to a conclusion Would you give up the invited dance and supper or wouldn t you That s the question And no shirking hey asked Putney No shirking Putney glanced through a little transparent space in the ground glass windows framing the room which mister Gerrish used for keeping an eye on his sales ladies to see that they did not sit down Hello he exclaimed There s doctor Morrell Let s put the case to him He opened the door and called down the store Come in here Doc What called back an amused voice and after a moment steps approached and doctor Morrell hesitated at the open door He was a tall man with a slight stoop well dressed full bearded with kind boyish blue eyes that twinkled in fascinating friendliness upon the group Nobody sick here I hope Walk right in sir come in doctor Morrell said mister Gerrish missus Munger and missus Gerrish you know Present you to Miss Kilburn who has come to make her home among us after a prolonged residence abroad doctor Morrell Miss Kilburn No there s nobody sick here in one sense said Putney when the doctor had greeted the ladies But we want your advice all the same missus Munger is in a pretty bad way morally Doc Don t you mind mister Putney doctor screamed missus Gerrish Putney said with respectful recognition of the poor woman s attempt to be arch I ll try to keep within the bounds of truth in stating the case missus Gerrish He went on to state it with so much gravity and scrupulosity and with so many appeals to missus Munger to correct him if he were wrong that the doctor was shaking with laughter when Putney came to an end with unbroken seriousness At each repetition of the facts Annie s relation to them grew more intolerable and she suspected Putney of an intention to punish her Well what do you say he demanded of the doctor Ha ha ha ah ha ha laughed the doctor shutting his eyes and throwing back his head Seems to consider it a laughing matter said Putney to missus Munger Yes and that is all your fault said missus Munger trying with the ineffectiveness of a large woman to pout No no I m not laughing began the doctor Smiling perhaps suggested Putney The doctor went off again Then I beg I beg your pardon missus Munger he resumed But it isn t a professional question you know and I I really couldn t judge have any opinion on such a matter No shirking said Putney That s what missus Munger said to me Of course not gurgled the doctor You ladies will know what to do I m sure I shouldn t he added Well I must be going said Putney Sorry to leave you in this fix Doc He flashed out of the door and suddenly came back to offer Annie his hand I beg your pardon Annie I m going to make Ellen bring me round Good morning He bowed cursorily to the rest Wait I ll go with you Putney said the doctor missus Munger rose and Annie with her We must go too she said We ve taken up mister Gerrish s time most unconscionably and now mister Gerrish did not urge her to remain Well good bye said missus Gerrish with a genteel prolongation of the last syllable mister Gerrish followed his guests down the store and even out upon the sidewalk where he presided with unheeded hospitality over the superfluous politeness of Putney and doctor Morrell in putting missus Munger and Annie into the phaeton missus Munger attempted to drive away without having taken up her hitching weight I suppose that there isn t a post in this town that my wife hasn t tried to pull up in that way said Putney gravely The doctor doubled himself down with another fit of laughing Annie wanted to laugh too but she did not like his laughing She questioned if it were not undignified She felt that it might be disrespectful Then she asked herself why he should respect her IX
7059_77897_000001_000000	train-clean-100	 That was a great success said missus Munger as they drove away 
7059_77897_000001_000001	train-clean-100	Annie said nothing and she added Don t you think so 
7059_77897_000002_000000	train-clean-100	 Well I confess said Annie I don t see how exactly 
7059_77897_000002_000001	train-clean-100	Do you mean with regard to mister Gerrish 
7059_77897_000003_000000	train-clean-100	 Oh no I don t care anything about him said missus Munger touching her pony with the tip of her whip lash 
7059_77897_000003_000001	train-clean-100	 He s an odious little creature and I knew that he would go for the dance and supper because mister Peck was opposed to them 
7059_77897_000003_000002	train-clean-100	He s one of the anti Peck party in his church and that is the reason I spoke to him 
7059_77897_000003_000003	train-clean-100	But I meant the other gentlemen 
7059_77897_000003_000004	train-clean-100	You saw how they took it 
7059_77897_000004_000000	train-clean-100	 I saw that they both made fun of it said Annie 
7059_77897_000005_000000	train-clean-100	 Yes that s just the point 
7059_77897_000005_000001	train-clean-100	It s so fortunate they were frank about it 
7059_77897_000005_000002	train-clean-100	It throws a new light on it and if that s the way nice people are going to look at it why we must give up the idea 
7059_77897_000005_000003	train-clean-100	I m quite prepared to do so 
7059_77897_000005_000004	train-clean-100	But I want to see missus Wilmington first 
7059_77897_000006_000000	train-clean-100	 missus Munger said Annie uneasily I would rather not see missus Wilmington with you on this subject I should be of no use 
none	none	My dear you would be of the greatest use persisted Munger and she laid her arm across Annie s lap as if to prevent her jumping out of the phaeton
7059_77897_000007_000001	train-clean-100	 As missus Wilmington s old friend you will have the greatest influence with her 
7059_77897_000008_000000	train-clean-100	 But I don t know that I wish to influence her in favour of the supper and dance I don t know that I believe in them said Annie cowed and troubled by the affair 
none	none	That doesn t make the slightest difference said missus Munger impartially All you will have to do is to keep still 
7059_77897_000009_000001	train-clean-100	I will put the case to her 
7059_77897_000010_000000	train-clean-100	She checked the pony before the bar which the flagman at the railroad crossing had let down while a long freight train clattered deafeningly by and then drove bumping and jouncing across the tracks 
none	none	I suppose you remember what Over the Track means in Hatboro
7059_77897_000011_000000	train-clean-100	 Oh yes said Annie with a smile 
7059_77897_000011_000001	train-clean-100	 Social perdition at the least 
none	none	You don t mean that missus Wilmington lives Over the Track Yes It isn t so bad as it used to be socially 
7059_77897_000012_000002	train-clean-100	mister Wilmington has built a very fine house on this side and there are several pretty Queen Anne cottages going up 
7059_77897_000013_000000	train-clean-100	They drove along under the elms which here stood somewhat at random about the wide grassless street between the high windowy bulks of the shoe shops and hat shops 
7059_77897_000013_000001	train-clean-100	The dust gradually freed itself from the cinders about the tracks and it hardened into a handsome newly made road beyond the houses of the shop hands 
7059_77897_000013_000002	train-clean-100	They passed some open lots and then on a pleasant rise of ground they came to a stately residence lifted still higher on its underpinning of granite blocks 
7059_77897_000013_000003	train-clean-100	It was built in a Boston suburban taste of twenty years ago with a lofty mansard roof and it was painted the stone grey colour which was once esteemed for being so quiet The lawn before it sloped down to the road where it ended smoothly at the brink of a neat stone wall 
7059_77897_000013_000004	train-clean-100	A black asphalt path curved from the steps by which you mounted from the street to the steps by which you mounted to the heavy portico before the massive black walnut doors 
none	none	The ladies were shown into the music room from which the notes of a piano were sounding when they rang and missus Wilmington rose from the instrument to meet them A young man who had been standing beside her turned away missus Wilmington was dressed in a light morning dress with a Watteau fall whose delicate russets and faded reds and yellows heightened the richness of her complexion and hair
7059_77897_000015_000000	train-clean-100	 Why Annie she said how glad I am to see you 
7059_77897_000015_000001	train-clean-100	And you too missus Munger 
none	none	How vurry nice Her words took value from the thick mellow tones of her voice and passed for much more than they were worth intrinsically 
7059_77897_000015_000003	train-clean-100	She moved lazily about and got them into chairs and was not resentful when missus Munger broke out with How hot you have it Have we We had the furnace lighted yesterday and we ve been in all the morning and so we hadn t noticed 
none	none	Jack won t you shut the register she drawled over her shoulder This is my nephew mister Jack Wilmington Miss Kilburn mister Wilmington and missus Munger are old friends 
7059_77897_000016_000000	train-clean-100	The young fellow bowed silently and Annie instantly took a dislike to him his heavy jaw long eyes and low forehead almost hidden under a thick bang 
7059_77897_000016_000001	train-clean-100	He sat down cornerwise on a chair and listened with a scornful thrust of his thick lips to their talk 
none	none	missus Munger was not abashed by him 
7059_77897_000017_000001	train-clean-100	She opened her budget with all her robust authority and once more put Annie to shame 
7059_77897_000017_000002	train-clean-100	When she came to the question of the invited supper and dance and having previously committed missus Wilmington in favour of the general scheme asked her what she thought of that part mister Jack Wilmington answered for her 
7059_77897_000018_000000	train-clean-100	 I should think you had a right to do what you please about it 
7059_77897_000018_000001	train-clean-100	It s none of the hands business if you don t choose to ask them 
7059_77897_000019_000000	train-clean-100	 Yes that s what any one would think in the abstract said missus Munger 
none	none	Now little boy said missus Wilmington with indolent amusement putting out a silencing hand in the direction of the young man don t you be so fast 
7059_77897_000020_000001	train-clean-100	You let your aunty speak for herself 
7059_77897_000020_000002	train-clean-100	I don t know about not letting the hands stay to the dance and supper missus Munger 
7059_77897_000020_000003	train-clean-100	You know I might feel put upon I used to be one of the hands myself 
7059_77897_000020_000004	train-clean-100	Yes Annie there was a time after you went away and after father died when I actually fell so low as to work for an honest living 
7059_77897_000021_000000	train-clean-100	 I think I heard Lyra said Annie but I had forgotten The fact in connection with what had been said made her still more uncomfortable 
7059_77897_000022_000000	train-clean-100	 Well I didn t work very hard and I didn t have to work long 
7059_77897_000022_000001	train-clean-100	But I was a hand and there s no use trying to deny it 
7059_77897_000022_000002	train-clean-100	As mister Putney says he and I have our record and we don t have to make any pretences 
7059_77897_000022_000003	train-clean-100	And the question is whether I ought to go back on my fellow hands 
none	none	Oh but missus Wilmington said missus Munger with intense deprecation that s such a very different thing 
7059_77897_000023_000001	train-clean-100	You were not brought up to it it was just temporary and besides 
7059_77897_000024_000000	train-clean-100	 And besides there was mister Wilmington I know 
7059_77897_000024_000001	train-clean-100	He was very opportune 
7059_77897_000024_000002	train-clean-100	I might have been a hand at this moment if mister Wilmington had not come along and invited me to be a head the head of his house 
none	none	But I don t know Annie whether I oughtn t to remember my low beginnings I suppose we all like to be consistent answered Annie aimlessly uneasily
7059_77897_000026_000000	train-clean-100	 Yes missus Munger broke in but they were not your beginnings missus Wilmington they were your incidents your accidents 
7059_77897_000027_000000	train-clean-100	 It s very pretty of you to say so missus Munger drawled missus Wilmington But I guess I must oppose the little invited dance and supper on principle 
7059_77897_000027_000001	train-clean-100	We all like to be consistent as Annie says even if we re inconsistent in the attempt she added with a laugh 
none	none	Very well then exclaimed missus Munger we ll drop them 
7059_77897_000028_000001	train-clean-100	As I said to Miss Kilburn on our way here if missus Wilmington is opposed to them we ll drop them 
7059_77897_000029_000000	train-clean-100	 Oh am I such an influential person said missus Wilmington with a shrug It s rather awful isn t it Annie 
7059_77897_000030_000000	train-clean-100	 Not at all missus Munger answered for Annie 
7059_77897_000030_000001	train-clean-100	 We ve just been talking the matter over with mister Putney and doctor Morrell and they re both opposed You re merely the straw that breaks the camel s back missus Wilmington 
none	none	Oh thank you 
7059_77897_000031_000001	train-clean-100	That s a great relief 
none	none	Well and now the question is will you take the part of the Nurse or not in the dramatics asked missus Munger returning to business
7059_77897_000033_000000	train-clean-100	 Well I must think about that and I must ask mister Wilmington 
7059_77897_000033_000001	train-clean-100	Jack she called over her shoulder to the young man at the window do you think your uncle would approve of me as Juliet s Nurse 
none	none	You d better ask him growled the young fellow
7059_77897_000035_000000	train-clean-100	 Well said missus Wilmington with another laugh I ll think it over missus Munger 
7059_77897_000036_000000	train-clean-100	 Thank you said missus Munger 
7059_77897_000036_000001	train-clean-100	 And now we must really be going she added pulling out her watch by its leathern guard 
7059_77897_000037_000000	train-clean-100	 Not till you ve had lunch said missus Wilmington rising with the ladies You must stay 
7059_77897_000037_000001	train-clean-100	Annie I shall not excuse you 
7059_77897_000038_000000	train-clean-100	 Well said missus Munger complying without regard to Annie all this diplomacy is certainly very exhausting 
none	none	Lunch will be on the table in one moment returned missus Wilmington as the ladies sat down again provisionally
7059_77897_000039_000001	train-clean-100	 Will you join us Jack 
7059_77897_000040_000000	train-clean-100	 No I m going to the office said the nephew bowing himself out of the room 
7059_77897_000041_000000	train-clean-100	 Jack s learning to be superintendent said missus Wilmington lifting her teasing voice to make him hear her in the hall and he s been spending the whole morning here 
7059_77897_000042_000000	train-clean-100	In the richly appointed dining room a glitter of china and glass and a mass of carven oak the table was laid for two 
7059_77897_000043_000000	train-clean-100	 Put another plate Norah said missus Wilmington carelessly 
none	none	There was bouillon in teacups chicken cutlets in white sauce and luscious strawberries What a cook cried missus Munger over the cutlets Yes she s a treasure I don t deny it said missus Wilmington X By the end of May most of the summer folk had come to their cottages in South Hatboro One after another the ladies called upon Annie They all talked to her of the Social Union and it seemed to be agreed that it was fully in train though what was really in train was the entertainment to be given at missus Munger s for the benefit of the Union the Union always dropped out of the talk as soon as the theatricals were mentioned When Annie went to return these visits she scarcely recognised even the shape of the country once so familiar to her of which the summer settlement had possessed itself She found herself in a strange world a world of colonial and Queen Anne architecture where conscious lines and insistent colours contributed to an effect of posing which she had never seen off the stage But it was not a very large world and after the young trees and hedges should have grown up and helped to hide it she felt sure that it would be a better world In detail it was not so bad now but the whole was a violent effect of porches gables chimneys galleries loggias balconies and jalousies which nature had not yet had time to palliate missus Munger was at home and wanted her to spend the day to drive out with her to stay to lunch When Annie would not do any of these things she invited herself to go with her to call at the Brandreths But first she ordered her to go out with her to see the place where they intended to have the theatricals a pretty bit of natural boscage white birches pines and oaks faced by a stretch of smooth turf where a young man in a flannel blazer was painting a tennis court in the grass missus Munger introduced him as her Jim and the young fellow paused from his work long enough to bow to her his nose now seemed in perfect repair mister Brandreth met them at the door of his mother s cottage It was a very small cottage on the outside with a good deal of stained glass en evidence in leaded sashes where the sashes were not leaded and the glass not stained the panes were cut up into very large ones with little ones round them Everything was very old fashioned inside The door opened directly into a wainscoted square hall which had a large fireplace with gleaming brass andirons and a carved mantel carried to the ceiling It was both baronial and colonial in its decoration there was part of a suit of imitation armour under a pair of moose antlers on one wall and at one side of the fireplace there was a spinning wheel with a tuft of flax ready to be spun There were Japanese swords on the lowest mantel shelf together with fans and vases a long old flint lock musket stretched across the panel above mister Brandreth began to show things to Annie and to tell how little they cost as soon as the ladies entered His mother s voice called from above Now Percy you stop till I get there and in a moment or two she appeared from behind a portiere in one corner Before she shook hands with the ladies or allowed any kind of greeting she pulled the portiere aside and made Annie admire the snug concealment of the staircase Then she made her go upstairs and see the chambers and the second hand colonial bedsteads and the andirons everywhere and the old chests of drawers and their brasses and she told her some story about each and how Percy picked it up and had it repaired When they came down the son took Annie in hand again and walked her over the ground floor ending with the kitchen which was in the taste of an old New England kitchen with hard seated high backed chairs and a kitchen table with curiously turned legs which he had picked up in the hen house of a neighbouring farmer for a song There was an authentic crane in the dining room fireplace which he had found in a heap of scrap iron at a blacksmith s shop and had got for next to nothing The sideboard he had got at an old second hand shop in the North End and he believed it was an heirloom from the house of one of the old ministers of the North End Church Everything nearly in the Brandreth cottage was an heirloom though Annie could not remember afterward any object that had been an heirloom in the Brandreth family When she went back with mister Brandreth to the hall which seemed to be also the drawing room she found that missus Brandreth had lighted the fire on the hearth though it was rather a warm day without for the sake of the effect She was sitting in the chimney seat and shielding her face from the blaze with an old fashioned feather hand screen Now don t you think we have a lovely little home she demanded missus Munger began to break out in its praise but she shook the screen silencingly at her No no I want Miss Kilburn s unbiassed opinion Don t you speak missus Munger Now haven t we missus Brandreth made Annie assent to the superiority of her cottage in detail She recapitulated the different facts of the architecture and furnishing from each of which she seemed to acquire personal merit and she insisted that Percy should show some of them again We think it s a little picture she concluded and once more Annie felt obliged to murmur her acquiescence At last missus Munger said that she must go to lunch and was going to take Annie with her Annie said she must lunch at home and then missus Brandreth pressed them both to stay to lunch with her You shall have a cup of tea out of a piece of real Satsuma she said but they resisted I don t believe she added apparently relieved by their persistence and losing a little anxiety of manner that Percy s had any chance to consult you on a very important point about your theatricals Miss Kilburn Oh that will do some other time mother said mister Brandreth No no Now And you can have missus Munger s opinion too You know Miss Sue Northwick is going to be Juliet No shouted missus Munger I thought she had refused positively When did she change her mind She s just sent Percy a note We were talking it over when you came and Percy was going over to tell you Then it is sure to be a success said missus Munger with a solemnity of triumph Yes but Percy feels that it complicates one point more than ever It s a question that always comes up in amateur dramatics said mister Brandreth with reluctance and it always will and of course it s particularly embarrassing in Romeo and Juliet If they don t show any affection it s very awkward and stiff and if I never approved of those liberties on the stage said missus Brandreth I tell Percy that it s my principal objection to it I can t make it seem nice But he says that it s essential to the effect Now I say that they might just incline their heads toward each other without actually you know But Percy is afraid that it won t do especially in the parting scene on the balcony so passionate you know it won t do simply to They must act like lovers And it s such a great point to get Miss Sue Northwick to take the part that he mustn t risk losing her by anything that might seem Yes said missus Munger with deep concern mister Brandreth looked very unhappy It s an embarrassing point We can t change the play and so the difficulty must be met and disposed of at once He did not look at either of the ladies but missus Munger referred the matter to Annie with a glance of impartiality His mother also turned her eyes upon Annie Percy thought that you must have seen so much of amateur dramatics in Europe that you could tell him just how to do Perhaps you could consult Miss Northwick herself said Annie dryly after a moment of indignation and another of amusement I thought of that said missus Brandreth but as Percy s to be Romeo You see he wishes the play to be a success artistically but if it s to succeed socially he must have Miss Northwick and she might resign at the first suggestion of Bessie Chapley would certainly have been better She s so outspoken you could have put the case right to her said missus Munger Yes said mister Brandreth gloomily But we shall find out a way Why you can settle it at rehearsal Perhaps at rehearsal said mister Brandreth with a pensive absence of mind missus Munger crushed his hand and his mother s in her leathern grasp and took Annie away with her It isn t lunch time yet she explained when they were out of earshot but I saw she was simply killing you and so I made the excuse She has no mercy There s time enough for you to make your calls before lunch and then you can come home with me Annie suggested that this would not do after refusing missus Brandreth Why it would never have done to accept missus Munger cried They didn t dream of it At the next place she said This is the Clevingers They re some of our all the year round people too She opened the door without ringing and let herself noisily in This is the way we run in without ceremony everywhere It s quite one family That s the charm of the place We expect to take each other as we find them Her freedom did not find the ladies off their guard anywhere At all the houses there was a skurrying of feet and a flashing of skirts out of the room or up the stairs and there was an interval for a thorough study of the features of the room before the hostess came in with the effect of coming in just as she was She had naturally always made some change in her dress and Annie felt that she had not really liked being run in upon Everywhere they talked to her about the theatricals and they talked across her to missus Munger about one another pretty freely Well that s all there is of us at present said missus Munger coming down the main road with her from the last place and you see just what we are It s a neighbourhood where everybody s just adapted to everybody else It s not a mere mush of concession as Emerson says people are perfectly outspoken but there s the greatest good feeling and no vulgar display or lavish expenditure or anything Annie walked slowly homeward She was tired and she was now aware of having been extremely bored by the South Hatboro people She was very censorious of them as we are of other people when we have reason to be discontented with ourselves They were making a pretence of simplicity and unconventionality but they had brought each her full complement of servants with her and each was apparently giving herself in the summer to the unrealities that occupied her during the winter Everywhere Annie had found the affectation of intellectual interests and the assumption that these were the highest interests of life there could be no doubt that culture was the ideal of South Hatboro and several of the ladies complained that in the summer they got behind with their reading or their art or their music They said it was even more trouble to keep house in the country than it was in town sometimes your servants would not come with you or if they did they were always discontented and you did not know what moment they would leave you Annie asked herself how her own life was in any wise different from that of these people It had received a little more light into it but as yet it had not conformed itself to any ideal of duty She too was idle and vapid like the society of which her whole past had made her a part and she owned to herself groaning in spirit that it was no easier to escape from her tradition at Hatboro than it was at Rome When she reached her own house again missus Bolton called to her from the kitchen threshold as she was passing the corner on her way to the front door Mis Putney s b en here I guess you ll find a note from her on the parlour table Annie fired in resentment of the uncouthness It was missus Bolton s business to come into the parlour and give her the note with a respectful statement of the facts But she did not tell her so it would have been useless missus Putney s note was an invitation to a family tea for the next evening XI Putney met Annie at the door and led her into the parlour beside the hall He had a little crippled boy on his right arm and he gave her his left hand In the parlour he set his burden down in a chair and the child drew up under his thin arms a pair of crutches that stood beside it His white face had the eager purity and the waxen translucence which we see in sufferers from hip disease This is our Winthrop said his father beginning to talk at once We receive the company and do the honours while mother s looking after the tea We only keep one undersized girl he explained more directly to Annie and Ellen has to be chief cook and bottlewasher herself She ll be in directly Just lay off your bonnet anywhere She was taking in the humility of the house and its belongings while she received the impression of an unimagined simplicity in its life from his easy explanations The furniture was in green terry the carpet a harsh brilliant tapestry on the marble topped centre table was a big clasp Bible and a basket with a stereoscope and views the marbleised iron shelf above the stove pipe hole supported two glass vases and a French clock under a glass bell through the open door across the oil cloth of the hallway she saw the white painted pine balusters of the steep cramped stairs It was clear that neither Putney nor his wife had been touched by the aesthetic craze the parlour was in the tastelessness of fifteen years before but after the decoration of South Hatboro she found a delicious repose in it Her eyes dwelt with relief on the wall paper of French grey sprigged with small gilt flowers and broken by a few cold engravings and framed photographs Putney himself was as little decorated as the parlour He had put on a clean shirt but the bulging bosom had broken away from its single button and showed two serrated edges of ragged linen his collar lost itself from time to time under the rise of his plastron scarf band which kept escaping from the stud that ought to have held it down behind His hair was brushed smoothly across a forehead which looked as innocent and gentle as the little boy s We don t often give these festivities he went on but you don t come home once in twelve years every day Annie I can t tell you how glad I am to see you in our house and Ellen s just as excited as the rest of us she was sorry to miss you when she called You re very kind Ralph I can t tell you what a pleasure it was to come and I m not going to let the trouble I m giving spoil my pleasure Well that s right said Putney We sha n t either He took out a cigar and put it into his mouth It s only a dry smoke Ellen makes me let up on my chewing when we have company and I must have something in my mouth so I get a cigar It s a sort of compromise I m a terribly nervous man Annie you can t imagine If it wasn t for the grace of God I think I should fly to pieces sometimes But I guess that s what holds me together that and Winthy here I dropped him on the stairs out there when I was drunk one night I saw you looking at them I suppose you ve been told it s all right I presume the Almighty knows what He s about but sometimes He appears to save at the spigot and waste at the bung hole like the rest of us He let me cripple my boy to reform me Don t Ralph said Annie with a voice of low entreaty She turned and spoke to the child and asked him if he would not come to see her What he asked breaking with a sort of absent minded start from his intentness upon his father s words She repeated her invitation Thanks he said in the prompt clear little pipe which startles by its distinctness and decision on the lips of crippled children I guess father ll bring me some day Don t you want I should go out and tell mother she s here he asked his father Well if you want to Winthrop said his father The boy swung himself lightly out of the room on his crutches and his father turned to her Well how does Hatboro strike you anyway Annie You needn t mind being honest with me you know He did not give her a chance to say and she was willing to let him talk on and tell her what he thought of Hatboro himself Well it s like every other place in the world at every moment of history it s in a transition state The theory is you know that most places are at a standstill the greatest part of the time they haven t begun to move or they ve stopped moving but I guess that s a mistake they re moving all the while I suppose Rome itself was in a transition state when you left Oh very decidedly It had ceased to be old and was becoming new Well that s just the way with Hatboro There is no old Hatboro any more and there never was as your father and mine could tell us if they were here They lived in a painfully transitional period poor old fellows But for all that there is a difference They lived in what was really a New England village and we live now in a sprawling American town and by American of course I mean a town where at least one third of the people are raw foreigners or rawly extracted natives The old New England ideal characterises them all up to a certain point socially it puts a decent outside on most of em it makes em keep Sunday and drink on the sly We got in the Irish long ago and now they re part of the conservative element We got in the French Canadians and some of them are our best mechanics and citizens We re getting in the Italians and as soon as they want something better than bread and vinegar to eat they ll begin going to Congress and boycotting and striking and forming pools and trusts just like any other class of law abiding Americans There used to be some talk of the Chinese but I guess they ve pretty much blown over We ve got Ah Lee and Sam Lung here just as they have everywhere but their laundries don t seem to increase The Irish are spreading out into the country and scooping in the farms that are not picturesque enough for the summer folks You can buy a farm anywhere round Hatboro for less than the buildings on it cost I d rather the Irish would have the land than the summer folks They make an honest living off it and the other fellows that come out to roost here from June till October simply keep somebody else from making a living off it and corrupt all the poor people in sight by their idleness and luxury That s what I tell em at South Hatboro They don t like it but I guess they believe it anyhow they have to hear it They ll tell you in self defence that J Milton Northwick is a practical farmer and sells his butter for a dollar a pound He s done more than anybody else to improve the breeds of cattle and horses and he spends fifteen thousand a year on his place It can t return him five and that s the reason he s a curse and a fraud Who is mister Northwick Ralph Annie interposed Everybody at South Hatboro asked me if I d met the Northwicks He s a very great and good man said Putney He s worth a million and he runs a big manufacturing company at Ponkwasset Falls and he owns a fancy farm just beyond South Hatboro He lives in Boston but he comes out here early enough to dodge his tax there and let poorer people pay it He s got miles of cut stone wall round his place and conservatories and gardens and villas and drives inside of it and he keeps up the town roads outside at his own expense Yes we feel it such an honour and advantage to have J Milton in Hatboro that our assessors practically allow him to fix the amount of tax here himself People who can pay only a little at the highest valuation are assessed to the last dollar of their property and income but the assessors know that this wouldn t do with mister Northwick They make a guess at his income and he always pays their bills without asking for abatement they think themselves wise and public spirited men for doing it and most of their fellow citizens think so too You see it s not only difficult for a rich man to get into the kingdom of heaven Annie but he makes it hard for other people Well as I was saying socially the old New England element is at the top of the heap here That s so everywhere The people that are on the ground first it don t matter much who they are have to manage pretty badly not to leave their descendants in social ascendency over all newer comers for ever Why I can see it in my own case I can see that I was a sort of fetich to the bedevilled fancy of the people here when I was seen drunk in the streets every day just because I was one of the old Hatboro Putneys and when I began to hold up there wasn t a man in the community that wasn t proud and flattered to help me Curious isn t it It made me sick of myself and ashamed of them and I just made up my mind as soon as I got straight again I d give all my help to the men that hadn t a tradition That s what I ve done Annie There isn t any low friendless rapscallion in this town that hasn t got me for his friend and Ellen We ve been in all the strikes with the men and all their fool boycottings and kicking over the traces generally Anybody else would have been turned out of respectable society for one half that I ve done but it tolerates me because I m one of the old Hatboro Putneys You re one of the old Hatboro Kilburns and if you want to have a mind of your own and a heart of your own all you ve got to do is to have it They ll like it they ll think it s original That s the reason South Hatboro got after you with that Social Union scheme They were right in thinking you would have a great deal of influence I was sorry you had to throw it against Brother Peck Annie felt herself jump at this climax as if she had been touched on an exposed nerve She grew red and tried to be angry but she was only ashamed and tempted to lie out of the part she had taken missus Munger she said gave that a very unfair turn I didn t mean to ridicule mister Peck I think he was perfectly sincere The scheme of the invited dance and supper has been entirely given up And I don t care for the project of the Social Union at all Well I m glad to hear it said Putney indifferently and he resumed his analysis of Hatboro We ve got all the modern improvements here Annie I suppose you d find the modern improvements most of em in Sheol electric light Bell telephone asphalt sidewalks and city water though I don t know about the water and I presume they haven t got a public library or an opera house perhaps they have got an opera house in Sheol you see I use the Revised Version it don t sound so much like swearing But as I was saying missus Putney came in and he stopped with the laugh of a man who knows that his wife will find it necessary to account for him and apologise for him The ladies kissed each other missus Putney was dressed in the black silk of a woman who has one silk she was red from the kitchen but all was neat and orderly in the hasty toilet which she must have made since leaving the cook stove A faint mixed perfume of violet sachet and fricasseed chicken attended her Well as you were saying Ralph she suggested Oh I was just tracing a little parallel between Hatboro and Sheol replied her husband missus Putney made a tchk of humorous patience and laughed toward Annie for sympathy Well then I guess you needn t go on Tea s ready Shall we wait for the doctor No doctors are too uncertain We ll wait for him while we re eating That s what fetches him the soonest I m hungry Ain t you Win Not so very said the boy with his queer promptness He stood resting himself on his crutches at the door and he now wheeled about and led the way out to the living room swinging himself actively forward It seemed that his haste was to get to the dumb waiter in the little china closet opening off the dining room which was like the papered inside of a square box He called to the girl below and helped pull it up as Annie could tell by the creaking of the rope and the light jar of the finally arriving crockery A half grown girl then appeared and put the dishes on at the places indicated with nods and looks by missus Putney who had taken her place at the table There was a platter of stewed fowl and a plate of high piled waffles sweltering in successive courses of butter and sugar In cut glass dishes one at each end of the table there were canned cherries and pine apple There was a square of old fashioned soda biscuit not broken apart which sent up a pleasant smell in the centre of the table was a shallow vase of strawberries It was all very good and appetising but to Annie it was pathetically old fashioned and helped her to realise how wholly out of the world was the life which her friends led Winthrop said Putney and the father and mother bowed their heads The boy dropped his over his folded hands and piped up clearly Our Father which art in heaven help us to remember those who have nothing to eat Amen That s a grace that Win got up himself his father explained beginning to heap a plate with chicken and mashed potato which he then handed to Annie passing her the biscuit and the butter We think it suits the Almighty about as well as anything I suppose you know Ralph of old Annie said missus Putney The only way he keeps within bounds at all is by letting himself perfectly loose Putney laughed out his acquiescence and they began to talk together about old times missus Putney and Annie recalled the childish plays and adventures they had together and one dreadful quarrel Putney told of the first time he saw Annie when his father took him one day for a call on the old judge and how the old judge put him through his paces in American history and would not admit the theory that the battle of Bunker s Hill could have been fought on Breed s Hill Putney said that it was years before it occurred to him that the judge must have been joking he had always thought he was simply ignorant I used to set a good deal by the battle of Bunker s Hill he continued I thought the whole Revolution and subsequent history revolved round it and that it gave us all liberty equality and fraternity at a clip But the Lord always finds some odd jobs to look after next day and I guess He didn t clear em all up at Bunker s Hill Putney s irony and piety were very much of a piece apparently and Annie was not quite sure which this conclusion was She glanced at his wife who seemed satisfied with it in either case She was waiting patiently for him to wake up to the fact that he had not yet given her anything to eat after helping Annie and the boy he helped himself and pending his wife s pre occupation with the tea he forgot her Why didn t you throw something at me he roared in grief and self reproach There wouldn t have been a loose piece of crockery on this side of the table if I hadn t got my tea in time Oh I was listening to Annie s share in the conversation said missus Putney and her husband was about to say something in retort of her thrust when a tap on the front door was heard Come in come in Doc he shouted missus Putney s just been helped and the tea is going to begin doctor Morrell s chuckle made answer for him and after time enough to put down his hat he came in rubbing his hands and smiling and making short nods round the table How d ye do missus Putney How d ye do Miss Kilburn Winthrop He passed his hand over the boy s smooth hair and slipped into the chair beside him You see the reason why we always wait for the doctor in this formal way said Putney is that he isn t in here more than seven nights of the week and he rather stands on his dignity Hand round the doctor s plate my son he added to the boy and he took it from Annie to whom the boy gave it and began to heap it from the various dishes Think you can lift that much back to the doctor Win I guess so said the boy coolly What is flooring Win at present said his father and getting him down and rolling him over is that problem of the robin that eats half a pint of grasshoppers and then doesn t weigh a bit more than he did before When he gets a little older said the doctor shaking over his plateful he ll be interested to trace the processes of his father s thought from a guest and half a peck of stewed chicken to a robin and half a pint of Don t doctor pleaded missus Putney He won t have the least trouble if he ll keep to the surface Putney laughed impartially and said Well we ll take the doctor out and weigh him when he gets done We expected Brother Peck here this evening he explained to doctor Morrell You re our sober second thought Well he broke off looking across the table at his wife with mock anxiety Anything wrong about that Ellen Not as far as I m concerned missus Putney interposed the doctor I m glad to be here on any terms Go on Putney Oh there isn t anything more You know how Miss Kilburn here has been round throwing ridicule on Brother Peck because he wants the shop hands treated with common decency and my idea was to get the two together and see how she would feel doctor Morrell laughed at this with what Annie thought was unnecessary malice but he stopped suddenly after a glance at her and Putney went on Brother Peck pleaded another engagement Said he had to go off into the country to see a sick woman that wasn t expected to live You don t remember the Merrifields do you Annie Well it doesn t matter One of em married West and her husband left her and she came home here and got a divorce I got it for her She s the one As a consumptive she had superior attractions for Brother Peck It isn t a case that admits of jealousy exactly but it wouldn t matter to Brother Peck anyway If he saw a chance to do a good action he d wade through blood Now look here Ralph said missus Putney there s such a thing as letting yourself too loose Well gore then said Putney buttering himself a biscuit The boy who had kept quiet till now seemed reached by this last touch and broke into a high crowing laugh in which they all joined except his father Gore suits Winthy anyway he said beginning to eat his biscuit I met one of the deacons from Brother Peck s last parish in Boston yesterday He asked me if we considered Brother Peck anyways peculiar in Hatboro and when I said we thought he was a little too luxurious the deacon came out with a lot of things The way Brother Peck behaved toward the needy in that last parish of his made it simply uninhabitable to the standard Christian They had to get rid of him somehow send him away or kill him Of course the deacon said they didn t want to kill him Where was his last parish asked the doctor Down on the Maine coast somewhere Penobscotport I believe And was he indigenous there No I believe not he s from Massachusetts Farm boy and then mill hand I understand Self helped to an education divinity student with summer intervals of waiting at table in the mountain hotels probably Drifted down Maine way on his first call and stuck but I guess he won t stick here very long Annie s friend mister Gerrish is going to look after Brother Peck before a great while He laughed to see her blush and went on You see Brother Gerrish has got a high ideal of what a Christian minister ought to be he hasn t said much about it but I can see that Brother Peck doesn t come up to it Well Brother Gerrish has got a good many ideals He likes to get anybody he can by the throat and squeeze the difference of opinion out of em There now Ralph his wife interposed you let mister Gerrish alone You don t like people to differ with you either Is your cup out doctor Thank you said the doctor handing it up to her And you mean mister Gerrish doesn t like mister Peck s doctrine he asked of Putney Oh I don t know that he objects to his doctrine he can t very well it s between the leds of the Bible as the Hard shell Baptist said But he objects to Brother Peck s walk and conversation He thinks he walks too much with the poor and converses too much with the lowly He says he thinks that the pew owners in mister Peck s church and the people who pay his salary have some rights to his company that he s bound to respect The doctor relished the irony but he asked Isn t there something to say on that side Oh yes a good deal There s always something to say on both sides even when one s a wrong side That s what makes it all so tiresome makes you wish you were dead He looked up and caught his boy s eye fixed with melancholy intensity upon him I hope you ll never look at both sides when you grow up Win It s mighty uncomfortable You take the right side and stick to that Brother Gerrish he resumed to the doctor goes round taking the credit of Brother Peck s call here but the fact is he opposed it He didn t like his being so indifferent about the salary Brother Gerrish held that the labourer was worthy of his hire and if he didn t inquire what his wages were going to be it was a pretty good sign that he wasn t going to earn them Well there was some logic in that said the doctor smiling as before Plenty And now it worries Brother Gerrish to see Brother Peck going round in the same old suit of clothes he came here in and dressing his child like a shabby little Irish girl He says that he who provideth not for those of his own household is worse than a heathen That s perfectly true And he would like to know what Brother Peck does with his money anyway He would like to insinuate that he loses it at poker I guess at any rate he can t find out whom he gives it to and he certainly doesn t spend it on himself From your account of mister Peck said the doctor I should think Brother Gerrish might safely object to him as a certain kind of sentimentalist Well yes he might looking at him from the outside But when you come to talk with Brother Peck you find yourself sort of frozen out with a most unexpected hard headed cold bloodedness Brother Peck is plain common sense itself He seems to be a man without an illusion without an emotion Oh not so bad as that laughed the doctor Ask Miss Kilburn She s talked with him and she hates him No I don t Ralph Annie began Oh well then perhaps he only made you hate yourself said Putney There was something charming in his mockery like the teasing of a brother with a sister and Annie did not find the atonement to which he brought her altogether painful It seemed to her really that she was getting off pretty easily and she laughed with hearty consent at last Winthrop asked solemnly How did he do that Oh I can t tell exactly Winthrop she said touched by the boy s simple interest in this abstruse point He made me feel that I had been rather mean and cruel when I thought I had only been practical I can t explain but it wasn t a comfortable feeling my dear I guess that s the trouble with Brother Peck said Putney He doesn t make you feel comfortable He doesn t flatter you up worth a cent There was Annie expecting him to take the most fervent interest in her theatricals and her Social Union and coo round and tell her what a noble woman she was and beg her to consider her health and not overwork herself in doing good but instead of that he simply showed her that she was a moral Cave Dweller and that she was living in a Stone Age of social brutalities and of course she hated him Yes that was the way Winthrop said Annie and they all laughed with her Now you take them into the parlour Ralph said his wife rising and tell them how he made you hate him I shouldn t like anything better replied Putney He lifted the large ugly kerosene lamp that had been set on the table when it grew dark during tea and carried it into the parlour with him His wife remained to speak with her little helper but she sent Annie with the gentlemen Why there isn t a great deal of it more spirit than letter so to speak said Putney when he put down the lamp in the parlour You know how I like to go on about other people s sins and the world s wickedness generally but one day Brother Peck in that cool impersonal way of his suggested that it was not a wholly meritorious thing to hate evil He went so far as to say that perhaps we could not love them that despitefully used us if we hated their evil so furiously He said it was a good deal more desirable to understand evil than to hate it for then we could begin to cure it Yes Brother Peck let in a good deal of light on me He rather insinuated that I must be possessed by the very evils I hated and that was the reason I was so violent about them I had always supposed that I hated other people s cruelty because I was merciful and their meanness because I was magnanimous and their intolerance because I was generous and their conceit because I was modest and their selfishness because I was disinterested but after listening to Brother Peck a while I came to the conclusion that I hated these things in others because I was cruel myself and mean and bigoted and conceited and piggish and that s why I ve hated Brother Peck ever since just like you Annie But he didn t reform me I m thankful to say any more than he did you I ve gone on just the same and I suppose I hate more infernal scoundrels and loathe more infernal idiots to day than ever but I perceive that I m no part of the power that makes for righteousness as long as I work that racket and now I sin with light and knowledge anyway No Annie he went on I can understand why Brother Peck is not the success with women and feminine temperaments like me that his virtues entitle him to be What we feminine temperaments want is a prophet and Brother Peck doesn t prophesy worth a cent He doesn t pretend to be authorised in any sort of way he has a sneaking style of being no better than you are and of being rather stumped by some of the truths he finds out No women like a good prophet about as well as they do a good doctor Now if you if you could unite the two functions Doc Sort of medicine man suggested Morrell Exactly The aborigines understood the thing Why I suppose that a real live medicine man could go through a community like this and not leave a sinful soul nor a sore body in it among the ladies perfect faith cure But what did you say to mister Peck Ralph asked Annie Didn t you attempt any defence No said Putney He had the advantage of me You can t talk back at a man in the pulpit Oh it was a sermon I suppose the other people thought so But I knew it was a private conversation that he was publicly holding with me Putney and the doctor began to talk of the nature and origin of evil and Annie and the boy listened Putney took high ground and attributed it to Adam You know Annie he explained I don t believe this but I like to get a scientific man that won t quite deny Scripture or the good old Bible premises and see him suffer Hello you up yet Winthrop I guess I ll go through the form of carrying you to bed my son When missus Putney rejoined them Annie said she must go and missus Putney went upstairs with her apparently to help her put on her things but really to have that talk before parting which guest and hostess value above the whole evening s pleasure She showed Annie the pictures of the little girls that had died and talked a great deal about their sickness and their loveliness in death Then they spoke of others and missus Putney asked Annie if she had seen Lyra Wilmington lately Annie told of her call with missus Munger and missus Putney said I like Lyra and I always did I presume she isn t very happily married he s too old there couldn t have been any love on her part But she would be a better woman than she is if she had children Ralph says added missus Putney smiling that he knows she would be a good mother she s such a good aunt Annie put her two hands impressively on the hands of her friend folded at her waist Ellen what does it mean Nothing more than what you saw Annie She must have or she will have some one to amuse her to be at her beck and call and it s best to have it all in the family Ralph says But isn t it doesn t he think it s odd It makes talk They moved a little toward the door holding each other s hands Ellen I ve had a lovely time And so have I Annie I thought you d like to meet doctor Morrell Oh yes indeed And I can t tell you what a night this has been for Ralph He likes you so much and it isn t often that he has a chance to talk to two such people as you and doctor Morrell How brilliant he is Annie sighed Yes he s a very able man It s very fortunate for Hatboro to have such a doctor He and Ralph are great cronies I never feel uneasy now when Ralph s out late I know he s been up at the doctor s office talking I Annie broke in with a laugh I ve no doubt doctor Morrell is all you say Ellen but I meant Ralph when I spoke of brilliancy He has a great future I m sure missus Putney was silent for a moment I m satisfied with the present so long as Ralph The tears suddenly gushed out of her eyes and ran down over the fine wrinkles of her plump little cheeks Not quite so much loud talking please piped a thin high voice from a room across the stairs landing Why dear little soul cried Annie I forgot he d gone to bed Would you like to see him asked his mother She led the way into the room where the boy lay in a low bed near a larger one His crutches lay beside it Win sleeps in our room yet He can take care of himself quite well But when he wakes in the night he likes to reach out and touch his father s hand The child looked mortified I wish I could reach out and touch my father s hand when I wake in the night said Annie The cloud left the boy s face I can t remember whether I said my prayers mother I ve been thinking so Well say them over again to me The men s voices sounded in the hall below and the ladies found them there doctor Morrell had his hat in his hand Look here Annie said Putney I expected to walk home with you but Doc Morrell says he s going to cut me out It looks like a put up job I don t know whether you re in it or not but there s no doubt about Morrell missus Putney gave a sort of gasp and then they all shouted with laughter and Annie and the doctor went out into the night In the imperfect light which the electrics of the main street flung afar into the little avenue where Putney lived and the moon sent through the sidewalk trees they struck against each other as they walked and the doctor said Hadn t you better take my arm Miss Kilburn till we get used to the dark Yes I think I had decidedly she answered and she hurried to add doctor Morrell there is something I want to ask you You re their physician aren t you The Putneys Yes Well then you can tell me Oh no I can t if you ask me as their physician he interrupted Well then as their friend missus Putney said something to me that makes me very unhappy I thought mister Putney was out of all danger of his trouble Hasn t he perfectly reformed Does he ever She stopped and doctor Morrell did not answer at once Then he said seriously It s a continual fight with a man of Putney s temperament and sometimes he gets beaten Yes I guess you d better know it Poor Ellen They don t allow themselves to be discouraged As soon as he s on his feet they begin the fight again But of course it prevents his success in his profession and he ll always be a second rate country lawyer Poor Ralph And so brilliant as he is He could be anything We must be glad if he can be something as it is Yes and how happy they seem together all three of them That child worships his father and how tender Ralph is of him How good he is to his wife and how proud she is of him And that awful shadow over them all the time I don t see how they live The doctor was silent for a moment and finally said They have the peace that seems to come to people from the presence of a common peril and they have the comfort of people who never blink the facts I think Ralph is terrible I wish he d let other people blink the facts a little Of course said the doctor it s become a habit with him now or a mania He seems to speak of his trouble as if mentioning it were a sort of conjuration to prevent it I wouldn t venture to check him in his way of talking He may find strength in it It s all terrible But it isn t by any means hopeless I m so glad to hear you say so You see a great deal of them I believe Yes said the doctor getting back from their seriousness with apparent relief Pretty nearly every day Putney and I consider the ways of God to man a good deal together You can imagine that in a place like Hatboro one would make the most of such a friend In fact anywhere Yes of course Annie assented doctor Morrell she added in that effect of continuing the subject with which one breaks away from it do you know much about South Hatboro I have some patients there I was there this morning I heard of you They all take a great interest in your theatricals In my theatricals Really this is too much Who has made them my theatricals I should like to know Everybody at South Hatboro talked as if I had got them up And haven t you No I ve had nothing to do with them mister Brandreth spoke to me about them a week ago and I was foolish enough to go round with missus Munger to collect public opinion about her invited dance and supper and now it appears that I have invented the whole affair I certainly got that impression said the doctor with a laugh lurking under his gravity Well it s simply atrocious said Annie I ve nothing at all to do with either I don t even know that I approve of their object Their object Yes The Social Union Oh Oh yes I had forgot about the object and now the doctor laughed outright It seems to have dropped into the background with everybody said Annie laughing too You like the unconventionality of South Hatboro suggested the doctor after a little silence Oh very much said Annie I was used to the same thing abroad It might be an American colony anywhere on the Continent I suppose said the doctor musingly that the same conditions of sojourn and disoccupation would produce the same social effects anywhere Then you must feel quite at home in South Hatboro Quite It s what I came back to avoid I was sick of the life over there and I wanted to be of some use here instead of wasting all my days She stopped resolved not to go on if he took this lightly but the doctor answered her with sufficient gravity Well It seemed to me that if I could be of any use in the world anywhere I could in the place where I was born and where my whole childhood was spent I ve been at home a month now the most useless person in Hatboro I did catch at the first thing that offered at mister Brandreth and his ridiculous Social Union and theatricals and brought all this trouble on myself I talked to mister Peck about them You know what his views are Only from Putney s talk said the doctor He didn t merely disapprove of the dance and supper but he had some very peculiar notions about the relations of the different classes in general said Annie and this was the point she had meant circuitously to lead up to when she began to speak of South Hatboro though she theoretically despised all sorts of feminine indirectness Yes said the doctor What notions Well he thinks that if you have money you can t do good with it That s rather odd said doctor Morrell I don t state it quite fairly He meant that you can t make any kindness with it between yourself and the the poor That s odd too Yes said Annie anxiously You can impose an obligation he says but you can t create sympathy Of course Ralph exaggerates what I said about him in connection with the invited dance and supper though I don t justify what I did say and if I d known then as I do now what his history had been I should have been more careful in my talk with him I should be very sorry to have hurt his feelings and I suppose people who ve come up in that way are sensitive She suggested this and it was not the reassurance she was seeking to have doctor Morrell say Naturally She continued with an effort I m afraid I didn t respect his sincerity and I ought to have done that though I don t at all agree with him on the other points It seems to me that what he said was shocking and perfectly impossible Why what was it asked the doctor He said there could be no real kindness between the rich and poor because all their experiences of life were different It amounted to saying that there ought not to be any wealth Don t you think so Really I ve never thought about it returned doctor Morrell After a moment he asked Isn t it rather an abstraction Don t say that said Annie nervously It s the most concrete thing in the world The doctor laughed with enjoyment of her convulsive emphasis but she went on I don t think life s worth living if you re to be shut up all your days to the intelligence merely of your own class Who said you were mister Peck And what was your inference from the fact That there oughtn t to be any classes Of course it won t do to say that There must be social differences Don t you think so I don t know said doctor Morrell I never thought of it in that light before It s a very curious question He asked brightening gaily after a moment of sober pause Is that the whole trouble Isn t it enough No I don t think it is Why didn t you tell him that you didn t want any gratitude Not want any she demanded Oh said doctor Morrell I didn t know but you thought it was enough to give Annie believed that he was making fun of her and she tried to make her resentful silence dignified but she only answered sadly No it isn t enough for me Besides he made me see that you can t give sympathy where you can t receive it Well that is bad said the doctor and he laughed again Excuse me he added I see the point But why don t you forget it Forget it Yes If you can t help it why need you worry about it She gave a kind of gasp of astonishment Do you really think that would be right She edged a little away from doctor Morrell as if with distrust Well no I can t say that I do he returned thoughtfully without seeming to have noticed her withdrawal I don t suppose I was looking at the moral side It s rather out of my way to do that If a physician let himself get into the habit of doing that he might regard nine tenths of the diseases he has to treat as just penalties and decline to interfere She fancied that he was amused again rather than deeply concerned and she determined to make him own his personal complicity in the matter if she could Then you do feel sympathy with your patients You find it necessary to do so The doctor thought a moment I take an interest in their diseases But you want them to get well Oh certainly I m bound to do all I can for them as a physician Nothing more Yes I m sorry for them for their families if it seems to be going badly with them And and as as Don t you care at all for your work as a part of what every one ought to do for others as humanity philan She stopped the offensive word Well I can t say that I ve looked at it in that light exactly he answered I suspect I m not very good at generalising my own relations to others though I like well enough to speculate in the abstract But don t you think mister Peck has overlooked one important fact in his theory What about the people who have grown rich from being poor as most Americans have They have the same experiences and why can t they sympathise with those who have remained poor I never thought of that Why didn t I ask him that She lamented so sincerely that the doctor laughed again I think that mister Peck Oh no oh no said the doctor in an entreating coaxing tone expressive of a satiety with the subject that he might very well have felt and he ended with another laugh in which after a moment of indignant self question she joined him Isn t that delicious he exclaimed and she involuntarily slowed her pace with his The spicy scent of sweet currant blossoms hung in the dewy air that wrapped one of the darkened village houses From a syringa bush before another as they moved on a denser perfume stole out with the wild song of a cat bird hidden in it the music and the odour seemed braided together The shadows of the trees cast by the electrics on the walks were so thick and black that they looked palpable it seemed as if she could stoop down and lift them from the ground A broad bath of moonlight washed one of the house fronts and the white painted clapboards looked wet with it They talked of these things of themselves and of their own traits and peculiarities and at her door they ended far from mister Peck and all the perplexities he had suggested She had told doctor Morrell of some things she had brought home with her and had said she hoped he would find time to come and see them It would have been stiff not to do it and she believed she had done it in a very off hand business like way But she continued to question whether she had

none	none	Miss Northwick called upon Annie during the week with excuses for her delay and for coming alone She seemed to have intentions of being polite but she constantly betrayed her want of interest in Annie and disappointed an expectation of refinement which her physical delicacy awakened 
7059_77900_000003_000002	train-clean-100	She asked her how she ever came to take up the Social Union and answered for her that of course it had the attraction of the theatricals and went on to talk of her sister s part in them 
none	none	The relation of the Northwick family to the coming entertainment and an impression of frail mottled wrists and high thin cheeks and an absence of modelling under affluent drapery was the main effect of Miss Northwick s visit When Annie returned it she met the younger sister whom she found a great beauty She seemed very cold and of a hauteur which she subdued with difficulty but she was more consecutively polite than her sister and Annie watched with fascination her turns of the head her movements of leopard swiftness and elasticity the changing lights of her complexion the curves of her fine lips the fluttering of her thin nostrils A very new basket phaeton stood glittering at Annie s door when she got home and missus Wilmington put her head out of the open parlour window How d ye do Annie she drawled in her tender voice Won t you come in You see I m in possession 
7059_77900_000006_000002	train-clean-100	I ve just got my new phaeton and I drove up at once to crush you with it 
7059_77900_000006_000003	train-clean-100	Isn t it a beauty 
7059_77900_000007_000000	train-clean-100	 You re too late Lyra said Annie 
7059_77900_000007_000001	train-clean-100	 I ve just come from the Northwicks and another crushing beauty has got in ahead of your phaeton 
none	none	Oh poor Annie Lyra began to laugh with agreeable intelligence Do come in and tell me about it
7059_77900_000009_000000	train-clean-100	 Why is that girl going to take part in the theatricals 
none	none	She doesn t care to please any one does she
7059_77900_000010_000000	train-clean-100	 I didn t know that people took part in theatricals for that Annie 
7059_77900_000010_000001	train-clean-100	I thought they wanted to please themselves and mortify others 
none	none	I do But then I may be different Perhaps Miss Northwick wants to please mister Brandreth Do you mean it Lyra demanded Annie arrested on her threshold by the charm of this improbability
7059_77900_000012_000000	train-clean-100	 Well I don t know they re opposites 
none	none	But upon second thoughts you needn t come in Annie 
7059_77900_000012_000002	train-clean-100	I want you to take a drive with me and try my new phaeton said Lyra coming out 
7059_77900_000013_000000	train-clean-100	Annie now looked at it with that irresolution of hers and Lyra commanded Get right in 
7059_77900_000013_000001	train-clean-100	We ll go down to the Works 
7059_77900_000013_000002	train-clean-100	You ve never met my husband yet have you Annie 
7059_77900_000014_000000	train-clean-100	 No I haven t Lyra 
none	none	I ve always just missed him somehow 
7059_77900_000014_000002	train-clean-100	He seems to have been perpetually just gone to town or not got back 
7059_77900_000015_000000	train-clean-100	 Well he s really at home now 
7059_77900_000015_000001	train-clean-100	And I don t mean at the house which isn t home to him but the Works 
7059_77900_000015_000002	train-clean-100	You ve never seen the Works either have you 
none	none	No I haven t
7059_77900_000017_000000	train-clean-100	 Well then we ll just go round there and kill two birds with one stone I ought to show off my new phaeton to mister Wilmington first of all he gave it to me 
7059_77900_000017_000001	train-clean-100	It would be kind of conjugal or filial or something 
none	none	You know mister Wilmington and I are not exactly contemporaries Annie I heard he was somewhat your senior said Annie reluctantly Lyra laughed Well I always say we were born in the same century any way They came round into the region of the shops and Lyra checked her pony in front of her husband s factory 
7059_77900_000020_000001	train-clean-100	It was not imposingly large but as missus Wilmington caused Annie to observe it was as big as the hat shops and as ugly as the shoe shops 
none	none	The structure trembled with the operation of its industry and as they mounted the wooden steps to the open outside door an inner door swung ajar for a moment and let out a roar mingled of the hum and whirl and clash of machinery and fragments of voice borne to them on a whiff of warm greasy air Of course it doesn t smell very nice said Lyra She pushed open the door of the office and finding its first apartment empty led the way with Annie to the inner room where her husband sat writing at a table
7059_77900_000023_000000	train-clean-100	 George I want to introduce you to Miss Kilburn 
none	none	Oh yes yes yes said her husband scrambling to his feet and coming round to greet Annie He was a small man very bald with a serious and wrinkled forehead and rather austere brows but his mouth had a furtive curl at one corner which with the habit he had of touching it there with the tip of his tongue made Annie think of a cat that had been at the cream I ve been hoping to call with missus Wilmington to pay my respects but I ve been away a great deal this season and and We re all very happy to have you home again Miss Kilburn 
7059_77900_000024_000003	train-clean-100	I ve often heard my wife speak of your old days together at Hatboro 
7059_77900_000025_000000	train-clean-100	They fenced with some polite feints of interest in each other the old man standing beside his writing table and staying himself with a shaking hand upon it 
7059_77900_000026_000000	train-clean-100	Lyra interrupted them 
none	none	Well I think now that Annie is here we d better not let her get away without showing her the Works
7059_77900_000027_000000	train-clean-100	 Oh oh decidedly 
7059_77900_000027_000001	train-clean-100	I ll go with you with great pleasure 
none	none	Ah He bustled about putting the things together on his table and then reaching for the Panama hat on a hook behind it There was something pathetic in his eagerness to do what Lyra bade him and Annie fancied in him the uneasy consciousness which an elderly husband might feel in the presence of those who met him for the first time with his young wife 
7059_77900_000027_000004	train-clean-100	At the outer office door they encountered Jack Wilmington 
7059_77900_000028_000000	train-clean-100	 I ll show them through he said to his uncle and the old man assented with Well perhaps you d better Jack and went back to his room 
7059_77900_000029_000000	train-clean-100	The Wilmington Stocking Mills spun their own threads and the first room was like what Annie had seen before in cotton factories with a faint smell of oil from the machinery and a fine snow of fluff in the air and catching to the white washed walls and the foul window sashes 
7059_77900_000029_000001	train-clean-100	The tireless machines marched back and forth across the floor and the men who watched them with suicidal intensity ran after them barefooted when they made off with a broken thread spliced it and then escaped from them to their stations again 
7059_77900_000029_000002	train-clean-100	In other rooms where there was a stunning whir of spindles girls and women were at work they looked after Lyra and her nephew from under cotton frowsed bangs they all seemed to know her and returned her easy kindly greetings with an effect of liking 
none	none	From time to time at Lyra s bidding the young fellow explained to Annie some curious feature of the processes in the room where the stockings were knitted she tried to understand the machinery that wrought and seemed to live before her eyes 
7059_77900_000029_000004	train-clean-100	But her mind wandered to the men and women who were operating it and who seemed no more a voluntary part of it than all the rest except when Jack Wilmington curtly ordered them to do this or that in illustration of some point he was explaining 
7059_77900_000029_000005	train-clean-100	She wearied herself as people do in such places in expressing her wonder at the ingenuity of the machinery it was a relief to get away from it all into the room cool and quiet where half a dozen neat girls were counting and stamping the stockings with different numbers 
none	none	Here s where I used to work said Lyra and here s where I first met mister Wilmington The place is full of romantic associations The stockings are all one size Annie but people like to wear different numbers and so we try to gratify them Which number do you wear Or don t you wear the Wilmington machine knit I don t Well they re not dreams exactly Annie when all s said and done for them 
7059_77900_000030_000000	train-clean-100	When they left the mill she asked Annie to come home to tea with her saying as if from a perception of her dislike for the young fellow that Jack was going to Boston 
none	none	They had a long evening together after mister Wilmington took himself off after tea to his study as he called it and remained shut in there Annie was uneasily aware of him from time to time but Lyra had apparently no more disturbance from his absence than from his presence which she had managed with a frank acceptance of everything it suggested 
7059_77900_000031_000002	train-clean-100	She talked freely of her marriage not as if it were like others but for what it was She showed Annie over the house and she ended with a display of the rich dresses which he was always buying her and which she never wore because she never went anywhere 
none	none	Annie said she thought she would at least like to go to the seaside somewhere during the summer but No Lyra said it would be too much trouble and you know Annie I always did hate trouble I don t want the care of a cottage and I don t want to be poked into a hotel so I stay in Hatboro She said that she had always been a village girl and did not miss the interests of a larger life as she caught glimpses of them in South Hatboro or want the bother of them 
7059_77900_000032_000002	train-clean-100	She said she studied music a little and confessed that she read a good deal novels mostly though the library was handsomely equipped with well bound general literature 
7059_77900_000033_000000	train-clean-100	At moments it all seemed no harm at others the luxury in which this life was so contentedly sunk oppressed Annie like a thick close air 
none	none	Yet she knew that Lyra was kind to many of the poor people about her and did a great deal of good as the phrase is with the superfluity which it involved no self denial to give from But mister Peck had given her a point of view and though she believed she did not agree with him she could not escape from it Lyra told her much about people in Hatboro and characterised them all so humorously and she seemed so good natured in her ridicule which spared nobody She shrieked with laughter about mister Brandreth when Annie told her of his mother s doubt whether his love making with Miss Northwick ought to be tacit or explicit in the kissing and embracing between Romeo and Juliet
7059_77900_000036_000000	train-clean-100	 Don t you think Annie we d better refer him to mister Peck 
none	none	I should like to hear mister Brandreth and mister Peek discussing it I must tell Jack about it I might get him to ask Sue Northwick and get her ideas Has mister Wilmington known the Northwicks long Annie asked He used to go to their Boston house when he was at Harvard Oh then said Annie perhaps he accounts for her playing Juliet though as Tybalt I don t see exactly how he
7059_77900_000040_000000	train-clean-100	 Oh it s at the rehearsals you know that the fun is and then it don t matter what part you have 
none	none	Annie lay awake a long time that night 
7059_77900_000041_000001	train-clean-100	She was sure that she ought not to like Lyra if she did not approve of her and that she ought not to have gone home to tea with her and spent the evening with her unless she fully respected her 
7059_77900_000041_000002	train-clean-100	But she had to own to herself that she did like her and enjoyed hearing her soft drawl 
7059_77900_000041_000003	train-clean-100	She tried to think how Jack Wilmington s having gone to Boston for the evening made it somehow less censurable for her to spend it with Lyra even if she did not approve of her 
none	none	As she drowsed this became perfectly clear XIII In the process of that expansion from a New England village to an American town of which Putney spoke Hatboro had suffered one kind of deterioration which Annie could not help noticing She remembered a distinctly intellectual life which might still exist in its elements but which certainly no longer had as definite expression There used to be houses in which people maiden aunts and hale grandmothers took a keen interest in literature and read the new books and discussed them some time after they had ceased to be new in the publishing centres but whilst they were still not old But now the grandmothers had died out and the maiden aunts had faded in and she could not find just such houses anywhere in Hatboro The decay of the Unitarians as a sect perhaps had something to do with the literary lapse of the place their highly intellectualised belief had favoured taste in a direction where the more ritualistic and emotional religions did not promote it and it is certain that they were no longer the leading people It would have been hard to say just who these leading people were The old political and juristic pre eminence which the lawyers had once enjoyed was a tradition the learned professions yielded in distinction to the growing wealth and plutocratic influence of the prosperous manufacturers the situation might be summed up in the fact that Colonel Marvin of the shoe interest and mister Wilmington now filled the place once held by Judge Kilburn and Squire Putney The social life in private houses had undoubtedly shrunk but it had expanded in the direction of church sociables and it had become much more ecclesiastical in every way without becoming more religious As formerly some people were acceptable and some were not but it was as everywhere else more a question of money there was an aristocracy and a commonalty but there was a confusion and a more ready convertibility in the materials of each The social authority of such a person as missus Gerrish was not the only change that bewildered Annie and the effort to extend her relations with the village people was one from which she shrank till her consciousness had more perfectly adjusted itself to the new conditions Meanwhile doctor Morrell came to call the night after their tea at the Putneys and he fell into the habit of coming several nights in the week and staying late Sometimes he was sent for at her house by sick people and he must have left word at his office where he was to be found He had spent part of his student life in Europe and he looked back to his travel there with a fondness that the Old World inspires less and less in Americans This with his derivation from one of the unliterary Boston suburbs and his unambitious residence in a place like Hatboro gave her a sense of provinciality in him On his part he apparently found it droll that a woman of her acquaintance with a larger life should be willing to live in Hatboro at all and he seemed incredulous about her staying after summer was over She felt that she mystified him and sometimes she felt the pursuit of a curiosity which was a little too like a psychical diagnosis He had a way of sitting beside her table and playing with her paper cutter while he submitted with a quizzical smile to her endeavours to turn him to account She did not mind his laughing at her eagerness a woman is willing enough to join a man in making fun of her femininity if she believes that he respects her and she tried to make him talk about Hatboro and tell her how she could be of use among the working people She would have liked very much to know whether he gave his medical service gratis among them and whether he found it a pleasure and a privilege to do so There was one moment when she would have liked to ask him to let her be at the charges of his more indigent patients but with the words behind her lips she perceived that it would not do At the best it would be taking his opportunity from him and making it hers She began to see that one ought to have a conscience about doing good She let the chance of proposing this impossibility go by and after a little silence doctor Morrell seemed to revert in her interest to the economical situation in Hatboro You know that most of the hands in the hat shops are from the farms around and some of them own property here in the village I know the owner of three small houses who s always worked in the shops You couldn t very well offer help to a landed proprietor like that No said Annie abashed in view of him I suppose you ought to go to a factory town like Fall River if you really wanted to deal with overwork and squalor I m beginning to think there s no such thing anywhere she said desperately The doctor s eyes twinkled sympathetically I don t know whether Benson earned his three houses altogether in the hat shops He likes a good horse as he says and he likes to trade it for a better I know that from experience But he s a great friend of mine Well then there are more women than men in the shops and they earn more I suppose that s rather disappointing too It is rather But on the other hand the work only lasts eight months of the year and that cuts wages down to an average of a dollar a day Ah cried Annie There s some hope in that What do they do when the work stops Oh they go back to their country seats All Perhaps not all I thought so Well you d better look round among those that stay Even among these she looked in vain for destitution she could find that in satisfactory degree only in straggling veterans of the great army of tramps which once overran country places in the summer She would have preferred not to see or know the objects of her charity and because she preferred this she forced herself to face their distasteful misery missus Bolton had orders to send no one from the door who asked for food or work but to call Annie and let her judge the case She knew that it was folly and she was afraid it was worse but she could not send the homeless creatures away as hungry or poor as they came They filled her gentlewoman s soul with loathing but if she kept beyond the range of the powerful corporeal odour that enveloped them she could experience the luxury of pity for them The filthy rags that caricatured them their sick or sodden faces always frowsed with a week s beard represented typical poverty to her and accused her comfortable state with a poignant contrast and she consoled herself as far as she could with the superstition that in meeting them she was fulfilling a duty sacred in proportion to the disgust she felt in the encounter The work at the hat shops fell off after the spring orders and did not revive till the beginning of August If there was less money among the hands and their families who remained than there was in time of full work the weather made less demand upon their resources The children lived mostly out of doors and seemed to have always what they wanted of the season s fruit and vegetables They got these too late from the decaying lots at the provision stores and too early from the nearest orchards and doctor Morrell admitted that there was a good deal of sickness especially among the little ones from this diet Annie wondered whether she ought not to offer herself as a nurse among them she asked him whether she could not be of use in that way and had to confess that she knew nothing about the prevailing disease Then I don t think you d better undertake it he said There are too many nurses there already such as they are It s the dull time in most of the shops you know and the women have plenty of leisure There are about five volunteer nurses for every patient not counting the grandmothers on both sides I think they would resent any outside aid Ah I m always on the outside But can t I send I mean carry them anything nourishing any little dishes Arrowroot is about all the convalescents can manage She made a note of it But jelly and chicken broth are always relished by their friends doctor Morrell I must ask you not to turn me into ridicule if you please I cannot permit it I beg your pardon I do indeed Miss Kilburn I didn t mean to ridicule you I began seriously but I was led astray by remembering what becomes of most of the good things sent to sick people I know she said breaking into a laugh I have eaten lots of them for my father And is arrowroot the only thing The doctor reflected gravely Why no There s a poor little life now and then that might be saved by the sea air Yes if you care to send some of my patients with a mother and a grandmother apiece to the seaside Don t say another word doctor cried Annie You make me so happy I will I will send their whole families And you won t you won t let a case escape will you doctor It was a break in the iron wall of uselessness which had closed her in she behaved like a young girl with an invitation to a ball When the first patient came back well from the seaside her rejoicing overflowed in exultation before the friends to whom she confessed her agency in the affair Putney pretended that he could not see what pleasure she could reasonably take in restoring the child to the sort of life it had been born to but that was a matter she would not consider theoretically or practically She began to go outside of doctor Morrell s authority she looked up two cases herself and upon advising with their grandmothers sent them to the seaside and she was at the station when the train came in with the young mother and the still younger aunt of one of the sick children She did not see the baby and the mother passed her with a stare of impassioned reproach and fell sobbing on the neck of her husband waiting for her on the platform Annie felt the blood drop back upon her heart She caught at the girlish aunt who was looking about her with a sense of the interest which attached to herself as a party to the spectacle Oh Rebecca where is the child Well there Miss Kilburn I m ril sorry to tell you but I guess the sea air didn t do it a great deal of good if any I tell Maria she ll see it in the right light after a while but of course she can t first off Well there Somebody s got to look after it You ll excuse me Miss Kilburn Annie saw her run off to the baggage car from which the baggage man was handing out a narrow box The ground reeled under her feet she got the public depot carriage and drove home She sent for doctor Morrell and poured out the confession of her error upon him before he could speak I am a murderess she ended hysterically Don t deny it I think you can be got off on the ground of insanity Miss Kilburn if you go on in this way he answered Her desperation broke in tears Oh what shall I do what shall I do I ve killed the child Oh no you haven t he retorted I know the case The only hope for it was the sea air I was going to ask you to send it She took down her handkerchief and gave him a piercing look doctor Morrell if you are lying to me I m not lying Miss Kilburn he answered You ve done a very unwarrantable thing in both of the cases that you sent to the seaside on your own responsibility One of them I certainly shouldn t have advised sending but it s turned out well You ve no more credit for it though than for this that died and you won t think I m lying perhaps when I say you re equally to blame in both instances I I beg your pardon she faltered with dawning comfort in his severity I didn t mean I didn t intend to say I know it said doctor Morrell allowing himself to smile Just remember that you blundered into doing the only thing left to be done for missus Savor s child and don t try it again That s all He smiled once more and at some permissive light in her face he began even to laugh You you re horrible Oh no I m not he gasped All the tears in the world wouldn t help and my laughing hurts nobody I m sorry for you and I m sorry for the mother but I ve told you the truth I have indeed and you must believe me The child s father came to see her the next night Rebecca she seemed to think that you felt kind of bad may be because Maria wouldn t speak to you when she first got off the cars yesterday and I don t say she done exactly right myself The way I look at it and the way I tell Maria she d ought to is like this You done what you done for the best and we wa n t obliged to take your advice anyway But of course Maria she d kind of set her heart on savin it and she can t seem to get over it right away He talked on much longer to the same effect tilted back in his chair and looking down while he covered and uncovered one of his knees with his straw hat He had the usual rustic difficulty in getting away but Annie was glad to keep him in her gratitude for his kindness Besides she could not let him go without satisfying a suspicion she had And doctor Morrell have you seen him for missus Savor have you She stopped for shame of her hypocrisy No m We hain t seen him sence I guess she ll get along It needed this stroke to complete her humiliation before the single hearted fellow I I suppose she stammered out that you your wife wouldn t like me to come to the I can understand that but oh if there is anything I can do for you flowers or my carriage or helping anyway mister Savor stood up I m much obliged to you Miss Kilburn but we thought we hadn t better wait well not a great while and the funeral was this afternoon Well I wish you good evening She met the mother a few days after in the street with an impulse to cross over to the other side she advanced straight upon her missus Savor What can I say to you Oh I don t presume but what you meant for the best Miss Kilburn But I guess I shall know what to do next time I kind of felt the whole while that it was a resk But it s all right now Annie realised in her resentment of the poor thing s uncouth sorrow that she had spoken to her with the hope of getting not giving comfort Yes yes she confessed I was to blame The bereaved mother did not gainsay her and she felt that whatever was the justice of the case she had met her present deserts She had to bear the discredit into which the seaside fell with the mothers of all the other sick children She tried to bring doctor Morrell once to the consideration of her culpability in the case of those who might have lived if the case of missus Savor s baby had not frightened their mothers from sending them to the seaside but he refused to grapple with the problem She was obliged to believe him when he said he should not have advised sending any of the recent cases there that the disease was changing its character and such a course could have done no good Look here Miss Kilburn he said after scanning her face sharply I m going to leave you a little tonic I think you re rather run down Well she said passively XIV It was in her revulsion from the direct beneficence which had proved so dangerous that Annie was able to give herself to the more general interests of the Social Union She had not the courage to test her influence for it among the workpeople whom it was to entertain and elevate and whose company operation mister Peck had thought important but she went about among the other classes and found a degree of favour and deference which surprised her and an ignorance of what lay so heavy on her heart which was still more comforting She was nowhere treated as the guilty wretch she called herself some who knew of the facts had got them wrong and she discovered what must always astonish the inquirer below the pretentious surface of our democracy an indifference and an incredulity concerning the feelings of people of lower station which could not be surpassed in another civilisation Her concern for missus Savor was treated as a great trial for Miss Kilburn but the mother s bereavement was regarded as something those people were used to and got over more easily than one could imagine Annie s mission took her to the ministers of the various denominations and she was able to overcome any scruples they might have about the theatricals by urging the excellence of their object As a Unitarian she was not prepared for the liberality with which the matter was considered the Episcopalians of course were with her but the Universalist minister himself was not more friendly than the young Methodist preacher who volunteered to call with her on the pastor of the Baptist church and help present the affair in the right light she had expected a degree of narrow mindedness of bigotry which her sect learned to attribute to others in the militant period before they had imbibed so much of its own tolerance But the recollection of what had passed with mister Peck remained a reproach in her mind and nothing that she accomplished for the Social Union with the other ministers was important In her vivid reveries she often met him and combated his peculiar ideas while she admitted a wrong in her own position and made every expression of regret and parted from him on the best terms esteemed and complimented in high degree in reality she saw him seldom and still more rarely spoke to him and then with a distance and consciousness altogether different from the effects dramatised in her fancy Sometimes during the period of her interest in the sick children of the hands she saw him in their houses or coming and going outside but she had no chance to speak with him or else said to herself that she had none because she was ashamed before him She thought he avoided her but this was probably only a phase of the impersonality which seemed characteristic of him in everything At these times she felt a strange pathos in the lonely man whom she knew to be at odds with many of his own people and she longed to interpret herself more sympathetically to him but actually confronted with him she was sensible of something cold and even hard in the nimbus her compassion cast about him Yet even this added to the mystery that piqued her and that loosed her fancy to play as soon as they parted in conjecture about his past life his marriage and the mad wife who had left him with the child he seemed so ill fitted to care for Then the next time they met she was abashed with the recollection of having unwarrantably romanced the plain simple homely little man and she added an embarrassment of her own to that shyness of his which kept them apart Except for what she had heard Putney say and what she learned casually from the people themselves she could not have believed he ever did anything for them He came and went so elusively as far as Annie was concerned that she knew of his presence in the houses of sickness and death usually by his little girl whom she found playing about in the street before the door with the children of the hands She seemed to hold her own among the others in their plays and their squabbles if she tried to make up to her Idella smiled but she would not be approached and Annie s heart went out to the little mischief in as helpless goodwill as toward the minister himself She used to hear his voice through the summer open windows when he called upon the Boltons and wondered if some accident would not bring them together but she had to send for missus Bolton at last and bid her tell mister Peck that she would like to see him before he went away one night He came and then she began a parrying parley of preliminary nothings before she could say that she supposed he knew the ladies were going on with their scheme for the establishment of the Social Union he admitted vaguely that he had heard something to that effect and she added that the invited dance and supper had been given up He remained apparently indifferent to the fact and she hurried on And I ought to say mister Peck that nearly every one every one whose opinion you would value agreed with you that it would have been extremely ill advised and and shocking And I m quite ashamed that I should not have seen it from the beginning and I hope I hope you will forgive me if I said things in my my excitement that must have I mean not only what I said to you but what I said to others and I assure you that I regret them and She went on and repeated herself at length and he listened patiently but as if the matter had not really concerned either of them personally She had to conclude that what she had said of him had not reached him and she ended by confessing that she had clung to the Social Union project because it seemed the only thing in which her attempts to do good were not mischievous mister Peck s thin face kindled with a friendlier interest than it had shown while the question at all related to himself and a light of something that she took for humorous compassion came into his large pale blue eyes At least it was intelligence and perhaps the woman nature craves this as much as it is supposed to crave sympathy perhaps the two are finally one I want to tell you something mister Peck an experience of mine she said abruptly and without trying to connect it obviously with what had gone before she told him the story of her ill fated beneficence to the Savors He listened intently and at the end he said I understand But that is sorrow you have caused not evil and what we intend in goodwill must not rest a burden on the conscience no matter how it turns out Otherwise the moral world is no better than a crazy dream without plan or sequence You might as well rejoice in an evil deed because good happened to come of it Oh I thank you she gasped You don t know what a load you have lifted from me Her words feebly expressed the sense of deliverance which overflowed her heart Her strength failed her like that of a person suddenly relieved from some great physical stress or peril but she felt that he had given her the truth and she held fast by it while she went on If you knew or if any one knew how difficult it is what a responsibility to do the least thing for others And once it seemed so simple And it seems all the more difficult the more means you have for doing good The poor people seem to help one another without doing any harm but if I try it Yes said the minister it is difficult to help others when we cease to need help ourselves A man begins poor or his father or grandfather before him it doesn t matter how far back he begins and then he is in accord and full understanding with all the other poor in the world but as he prospers he withdraws from them and loses their point of view Then when he offers help it is not as a brother of those who need it but a patron an agent of the false state of things in which want is possible and his help is not an impulse of the love that ought to bind us all together but a compromise proposed by iniquitous social conditions a peace offering to his own guilty consciousness of his share in the wrong Yes said Annie too grateful for the comfort he had given her to question words whose full purport had not perhaps reached her And I assure you mister Peck I feel very differently about these things since I first talked with you And I wish to tell you in justice to myself that I had no idea then that that you were speaking from your own experience when you you said how working people looked at things I didn t know that you had been that is that Yes said the minister coming to her relief I once worked in a cotton mill Then he continued dismissing the personal concern it seems to me that I saw things in their right light as I have never been able to see them since And how brutal she broke in how cruel and vulgar what I said must have seemed to you I fancied he continued evasively that I had authority to set myself apart from my fellow workmen to be a teacher and guide to the true life But it was a great error The true life was the life of work and no one ever had authority to turn from it Christ Himself came as a labouring man That is true said Annie and his words transfigured the man who spoke them so that her heart turned reverently toward him But if you had been meant to work in a mill all your life she pursued would you have been given the powers you have and that you have just used to save me from despair The minister rose and said with a sigh No one was meant to work in a mill all his life Good night She would have liked to keep him longer but she could not think how at once As he turned to go out through the Boltons part of the house Won t you go out through my door she asked with a helpless effort at hospitality Oh if you wish he answered submissively When she had closed the door upon him she went to speak with missus Bolton She was in the kitchen mixing flour to make bread and Annie traced her by following the lamp light through the open door It discovered Bolton sitting in the outer doorway his back against one jamb and his stocking feet resting against the base of the other missus Bolton Annie began at once making herself free of one of the hard kitchen chairs how is mister Peck getting on in Hatboro I d know as I know just what you mean Miss Kilburn said missus Bolton on the defensive I mean is there a party against him in his church Is he unpopular missus Bolton took some flour and sprinkled it on her bread board then she lifted the mass of dough out of the trough before her and let it sink softly upon the board I d know as you can say he s unpoplah He ain t poplah with some Yes there s a party the Gerrish party Is it a strong one It s pretty strong Do you think it will prevail Well most o folks don t know what they want and if there s some folks that know what they don t want they can generally keep from havin it Bolton made a soft husky prefatory noise of protest in his throat which seemed to stimulate his wife to a more definite assertion and she cut in before he could speak I should say that unless them that stood mister Peck s friends first off and got him here done something to keep him his enemies wa n t goin to take up his cause Annie divined a personal reproach for Bolton in the apparent abstraction Oh now you ll see it ll all come out right in the end Pauliny he mildly opposed There ain t any such great feelin about mister Peck nothin but what ll work itself off perfec ly natural give it time It s goin to come out all right Yes at the day o jedgment missus Bolton assented plunging her fists into the dough and beginning to work a contempt for her husband s optimism into it Yes an a good deal before he returned There s always somethin to objec to every minister we ain t any of us perfect and mister Peck s got his failin s he hain t built up the church quite so much as some on em expected but what he would and there s some that don t like his prayers and some of em thinks he ain t doctrinal enough But I guess take it all round he suits pretty well It ll come out all right Pauliny You ll see A pause ensued of which Annie felt the awfulness It seemed to her that missus Bolton s impatience with this intolerable hopefulness must burst violently She hastened to interpose I think the trouble is that people don t fully understand mister Peck at first But they do finally Yes take time said Bolton Take eternity I guess for some retorted his wife If you think William B Gerrish is goin to work round with time She stopped for want of some sufficiently rejectional phrase and did not go on The way I look at it said Bolton with incorrigible courage is like this When it comes to anything like askin mister Peck to resign it ll develop his strength You can t tell how strong he is without you try to git red of him I most wish it would come once fair and square I m sure you re right mister Bolton said Annie I don t believe that your church would let such a man go when it really came to it Don t they all feel that he has great ability Oh I guess they appreciate him as far forth as ability goes Some on em complains that he s a little too intellectial if anything But I tell em it s a good fault it s a thing that can be got over in time missus Bolton had ceased to take part in the discussion She finished kneading her dough and having fitted it into two baking pans and dusted it with flour she laid a clean towel over both But when Annie rose she took the lamp from the mantel shelf where it stood and held it up for her to find her way back to her own door Annie went to bed with a spirit lightened as well as chastened and kept saying over the words of mister Peck so as to keep fast hold of the consolation they had given her They humbled her with a sense of his wisdom and insight the thought of them kept her awake She remembered the tonic that doctor Morrell had left with her and after questioning whether she really needed it now she made sure by getting up and taking it XV The spring had filled and flushed into summer Bolton had gone over the grass on the slope before the house and it was growing thick again dark green above the yellow of its stubble and the young generation of robins was foraging in it for the callow grasshoppers Some boughs of the maples were beginning to lose the elastic upward lift of their prime and to hang looser and limper with the burden of their foliage The elms drooped lower toward the grass and swept the straggling tops left standing in their shade The early part of September had been fixed for the theatricals Annie refused to have anything to do with them and the preparations remained altogether with Brandreth The minuet he said to her one afternoon when he had come to report to her as a company ordinate authority is going to be something exquisite I assure you A good many of the ladies studied it in the Continental times you know when we had all those Martha Washington parties or I forgot you were out of the country and it will be done perfectly We re going to have the ball room scene on the tennis court just in front of the evergreens don t you know and then the balcony scene in the same place We have to cut some of the business between Romeo and Juliet because it s too long you know and some of it s too too passionate we couldn t do it properly and we ve decided to leave it out But we sketch along through the play and we have Friar Laurence coming with Juliet out of his cell onto the tennis court and meeting Romeo so that tells the story of the marriage You can t imagine what a Mercutio mister Putney makes he throws himself into it heart and soul especially where he fights with Tybalt and gets killed I give him lines there out of other scenes too the tennis court sets that part admirably they come out of a street at the side I think the scenery will surprise you Miss Kilburn Well and then we have the Nurse and Juliet and the poison scene we put it into the garden on the tennis court and we condense the different acts so as to give an idea of all that s happened with Romeo banished and all that Then he comes back from Mantua and we have the tomb scene set at one side of the tennis court just opposite the street scene and he fights with Paris and then we have Juliet come to the door of the tomb it s a liberty of course but we couldn t arrange the light inside and she stabs herself and falls on Romeo s body and that ends the play You see it gives a notion of the whole action and tells the story pretty well I think you ll be pleased I ve no doubt I shall said Annie Did you make the adaptation yourself mister Brandreth Well yes I did mister Brandreth modestly admitted It s been a good deal of work but it s been a pleasure too You know how that is Miss Kilburn in your charities Don t speak of my charities mister Brandreth I m not a charitable person You won t get people to believe that said mister Brandreth Everybody knows how much good you do But as I was saying my idea was to give a notion of the whole play in a series of passages or tableaux Some of my friends think I ve succeeded so well in telling the story don t you know without a change of scene that they re urging me to publish my arrangement for the use of out of door theatricals I should think it would be a very good idea said Annie I suppose mister Chapley would do it Well I don t know I don t know mister Brandreth answered with a note of trouble in his voice I m afraid not he added sadly Miss Kilburn I ve been put in a very unfair position by Miss Northwick s changing her mind about Juliet after the part had been offered to Miss Chapley I ve been made the means of a seeming slight to Miss Chapley when if it hadn t been for the cause I d rather have thrown up the whole affair She gave up the part instantly when she heard that Miss Northwick wished to change her mind but all the same I know He stopped and Annie said encouragingly Yes I see But perhaps she doesn t really care That s what she said returned mister Brandreth ruefully But I don t know I have never spoken of it with her since I went to tell her about it after I got Miss Northwick s note Well mister Brandreth I think you ve really been victimised and I don t believe the Social Union will ever be worth what it s costing I was sure you would appreciate would understand and mister Brandreth pressed her hand gratefully in leave taking She heard him talking with some one at the gate whose sharp All right my son identified Putney She ran to the door to welcome him Oh you re both here she rejoiced at sight of missus Putney too I can send Ellen home suggested Putney Oh no indeed said Annie with single mindedness at which she laughed with missus Putney Only it seemed too good to have you both she explained kissing missus Putney I m so glad to see you Well what s the reason Putney dropped into a chair and began to rock nervously Don t be ashamed we re all selfish Has Brandreth been putting up any more jobs on you No no Only giving me a hint of his troubles and sorrows with those wretched Social Union theatricals Poor young fellow I m sorry for him He is really very sweet and unselfish I like him Yes Brandreth is one of the most lady like fellows I ever saw said Putney That Juliet business has pretty near been the death of him I told him to offer Miss Chapley some other part Rosaline the part of the young lady who was dropped but he couldn t seem to see it Well and how come on the good works Annie The good works Ralph tell me do people think me a charitable person Do they suppose I ve done or can do any good whatever She looked from Putney to his wife and back again with comic entreaty Why aren t you a charitable person Don t you do any good he asked No she shouted Not the least in the world It is pretty rough said Putney taking out a cigar for a dry smoke and nobody will believe me when I report what you say Annie missus Munger is telling round that she don t see how you can live through the summer at the rate you re going She s got it down pretty cold about your taking Brother Peck s idea of the invited dance and supper and joining hands with him to save the vanity of the self respecting poor She says that your suppression of that one unpopular feature has done more than anything else to promote the success of the Social Union You ought to be glad Brother Peck is coming to the show To the theatricals Putney nodded his head That s what he says I believe Brother Peck is coming to see how the upper classes amuse themselves when they really try to benefit the lower classes Annie would not laugh at his joke Ralph she asked is it true that mister Peck is so unpopular in his church Is he really going to be turned out dismissed Oh I don t know about that But they ll bounce him if they can And can nothing be done Can t his friends unite Oh they re united enough now what they re afraid of is that they re not numerous enough Why don t you buy in Annie and help control the stock That old Unitarian concern of yours isn t ever going to get into running order again and if you owned a pew in Ellen s church you could have a vote in church meeting after a while and you could lend Brother Peck your moral support now I never liked that sort of thing Ralph I shouldn t believe with your people Ellen s people please I don t believe with them either But I always vote right Now you think it over No I shall not think it over I don t approve of it If I should take a pew in your church it would be simply to hear mister Peck preach and contribute toward his Salary Yes that s the way to look at it in the beginning I knew you d work round Why Annie in a year s time you ll be trying to buy votes for Brother Peck I should never vote she retorted And I shall keep myself out of all temptation by not going to your church Ellen s church Putney corrected She went the next Sunday to hear mister Peck preach and Putney who seemed to see her the moment she entered the church rose as the sexton was showing her up the aisle and opened the door of his pew for her with ironical welcome You can always have a seat with us Annie he mocked on their way out of the church together Thank you Ralph she answered boldly I m going to speak to the sexton for a pew XVI A wire had been carried from the village to the scene of the play at South Hatboro and electric globes fizzed and hissed overhead flooding the open tennis court with the radiance of sharper moonlight and stamping the thick velvety shadows of the shrubbery and tree tops deep into the raw green of the grass along its borders The spectators were seated on the verandas and terraced turf at the rear of the house and they crowded the sides of the court up to a certain point where a cord stretched across it kept them from encroaching upon the space intended for the action Another rope enclosed an area all round them where chairs and benches were placed for those who had tickets After the rejection of the exclusive feature of the original plan missus Munger had liberalised more and more she caused it to be known that all who could get into her grounds would be welcome on the outside of that rope even though they did not pay anything but a large number of tickets had been sold to the hands as well as to the other villagers and the area within the rope was closely packed Some of the boys climbed the neighbouring trees where from time to time the town authorities threatened them but did not really dislodge them Annie with other friends of missus Munger gained a reserved seat on the veranda through the drawing room windows but once there she found herself in the midst of a sufficiently mixed company How do Miss Kilburn That you Well I declare said a voice that she seemed to know in a key of nervous excitement missus Savor s husband leaned across his wife s lap and shook hands with Annie William thought I better come missus Savor seemed called upon to explain I got to do something Ain t it just too cute for anything the way they got them screens worked into the shrubbery down they ar It s like the cycloraymy to Boston you can t tell where the ground ends and the paintin commences Oh I do want em to begin mister Savor laughed at his wife s impatience and she said playfully What you laughin at I guess you re full as excited as what I be when all s said and done There were other acquaintances of Annie s from Over the Track in the group about her and upon the example of the Savors they all greeted her The wives and sweethearts tittered with self derisive expectation the men were gravely jocose like all Americans in unwonted circumstances but they were respectful to the coming performance perhaps as a tribute to Annie She wondered how some of them came to have those seats which were reserved at an extra price she did not allow for that self respect which causes the American workman to supply himself with the best his money can buy while his money lasts She turned to see who was on her other hand A row of three small children stretched from her to missus Gerrish whom she did not recognise at first Oh Emmeline she said and then for want of something else she added Where is mister Gerrish Isn t he coming He was detained at the store said missus Gerrish with cold importance but he will be here May I ask Annie she pursued solemnly how you got here How did I get here Why through the windows Didn t you May I ask who had charge of the arrangements I don t know I m sure said Annie I suppose missus Munger A burst of music came from the dense shadow into which the group of evergreens at the bottom of the tennis court deepened away from the glister of the electrics There was a deeper hush then a slight jarring and scraping of a chair beyond missus Gerrish who leaned across her children and said He s come Annie right through the parlour window Her voice was lifted to carry above the music and all the people near were able to share the fact that righted missus Gerrish in her own esteem From the covert of the low pines in the middle of the scene Miss Northwick and mister Brandreth appeared hand in hand and then the place filled with figures from other apertures of the little grove and through the artificial wings at the sides and walked the minuet mister Fellows the painter had helped with the costumes supplying some from his own artistic properties and mediaevalising others the Boston costumers had been drawn upon by the men and they all moved through the stately figures with a security which discipline had given them The broad solid colours which they wore took the light and shadow with picturesque effectiveness the masks contributed a sense of mystery novel in Hatboro and kept the friends of the dancers in exciting doubt of their identity the strangeness of the audience to all spectacles of the sort held its judgment in suspense The minuet was encored and had to be given again and it was some time before the applause of the repetition allowed the characters to be heard when the partners of the minuet began to move about arm in arm and the drama properly began When the applause died away it was still not easy to hear a boy in one of the trees called Louder and made some of the people laugh but for the rest they were very orderly throughout Toward the end of the fourth act Annie was startled by a child dashing itself against her knees and breaking into a gurgle of shy laughter as children do Why you little witch she said to the uplifted face of Idella Peck Where is your father Oh somewhere said the child with entire ease of mind And your hat said Annie putting her hand on the curly bare head where s your hat On the ground On the ground where Oh I don t know said Idella lightly as if the pursuit bored her Annie pulled her up on her lap Well now you stay here with me if you please till your papa or your hat comes after you My hat can t come after me said the child turning back her head so as to laugh her sense of the joke in Annie s face No matter your papa can and I m going to keep you Idella let her head fall back against Annie s breast and began to finger the rings on the hand which Annie laid across her lap to keep her For goodness gracious said missus Savor who you got there Miss Kilburn mister Peck s little girl Where d she spring from missus Gerrish leaned forward and spoke across the six legs of her children who were all three standing up in their chairs You don t mean to say that s Idella Peck Where s her father Somewhere she says said Annie willing to answer missus Gerrish with the child s nonchalance Well that s great said missus Gerrish I should think he better be looking after her or some one The music ceased and the last act of the play began Before it ended Idella had fallen asleep and Annie sat still with her after the crowd around her began to break up missus Savor kept her seat beside Annie She said Don t you want I should spell you a little while Miss Kilburn She leaned over the face of the sleeping child Why she ain t much more than a baby William you go and see if you can t find mister Peck I m goin to stay here with Miss Kilburn Her husband humoured her whim and made his way through the knots and clumps of people toward the rope enclosing the tennis court Won t you let me hold her Miss Kilburn she pleaded again No no she isn t heavy I like to hold her replied Annie Then something occurred to her and she started in amazement at herself Or yes missus Savor you may take her a while and she put the child into the arms of the bereaved creature who had fallen desolately back in her chair She hugged Idella up to her breast and hungrily mumbled her with kisses and moaned out over her Oh dear Oh my Oh my XVII 
7220-77905-0000	train-other-500	The people beyond the rope had nearly all gone away and mister Savor was coming back across the court with mister Peck The players appeared from the grove at the other end of the court in their vivid costumes chatting and laughing with their friends
7220-77905-0001	train-other-500	who went down from the piazzas and terraces to congratulate them missus Munger hurried about among them saying something to each group She caught sight of mister Peck and mister Savor and she ran after them arriving with them where Annie sat

7220-77905-0008	train-other-500	She bustled away with missus Savor and mister Peck reluctantly accompanied Annie down over the lawn He was silent but mister Savor was hilarious Well mister Putney he said when he joined the group of which Putney was the centre you done that in apple pie order
7220-77905-0009	train-other-500	I never see anything much better than the way you carried on with missus Wilmington Thank you mister Savor said Putney I m glad you liked it You couldn t say I was trying to flatter her up much anyway No no mister Savor assented with delight in the joke
7220-77905-0010	train-other-500	Well Annie said Putney He shook hands with her and missus Putney who was there with doctor Morrell asked her where she had sat We kept looking all round for you Yes said Putney with his hand on his boy s shoulder we wanted to know how you liked the Mercutio
7220-77905-0011	train-other-500	Ralph it was incomparable Well that will do for a beginning It s a little cold but it s in the right spirit You mean that the Mercutio wasn t comparable to the Nurse Oh Lyra was wonderful said Annie Don t you think so Ellen
7220-77905-0012	train-other-500	She was Lyra said missus Putney definitely No she wasn t Lyra at all retorted Annie That was the marvel of it She was Juliet s nurse Perhaps she was a little of both suggested Putney
7220-77905-0013	train-other-500	What did you think of the performance mister Peck I don t want a personal tribute but if you offer it I shall not be ungrateful I have been very much interested said the minister It was all very new to me
7220-77905-0014	train-other-500	I realised for the first time in my life the great power that the theatre must be I felt how much the drama could do how much good Well that s what we re after said Putney We had no personal motive
none	none	 good right straight along was our motto 
7220-77905-0015	train-other-500	Nobody wanted to outshine anybody else I kept my Mercutio down all through so s not to get ahead of Romeo or Tybalt in the public esteem Did our friends outside the rope catch on to my idea mister Peck smiled at the banter
7220-77905-0016	train-other-500	but he seemed not to know just what to say and Putney went on That s why I made it so bad I didn t want anybody to go home feeling sorry that Mercutio was killed
none	none	 I don t suppose Winthrop could have slept 
7220-77905-0017	train-other-500	You won t sleep yourself to night I m afraid said his wife Oh missus Munger has promised me a particularly weak cup of coffee She has got us all in it seems for a sort of supper in spite of everything
7220-77905-0018	train-other-500	I understand it includes representatives of all the stations and conditions present except the outcasts beyond the rope I don t see what you re doing here mister Peck Was mister Peck really outside the rope Annie asked doctor Morrell as they dropped apart from the others a little
7220-77905-0019	train-other-500	I believe he gave his chair to one of the women from the outside said the doctor Annie moved with him toward Lyra who was joking with some of the hands With all her good nature she had the effect of patronising them as she stood talking about the play with them in her drawl
7220-77905-0020	train-other-500	which she had got back to again They were admiring her in her dress of the querulous old nurse and told her how they never would have known her But there was an insincerity in the effusion of some of the more nervous women
none	none	 and in the reticence of the others who were holding back out of self respect 
7220-77905-0021	train-other-500	She met Annie and Morrell with eager relief Well Annie Perfect Well now that s very nice you can t go beyond perfect you know I did do it pretty well didn t I
7220-77905-0022	train-other-500	Poor mister Brandreth Have you seen him You must say something comforting to him
none	none	 He s really been sacrificed in this business 
7220-77905-0023	train-other-500	You know he wanted Miss Chapley She would have made a lovely Juliet Of course she blames him for it She thinks he wanted to make up to Miss Northwick when Miss Northwick was just flinging herself at Jack Look at her
7220-77905-0024	train-other-500	Jack Wilmington and Miss Sue Northwick were standing together near her father and a party of her friends and she was smiling and talking at him Eyes lips gestures attitude expressed in the proud girl a fawning eagerness to please the man
7220-77905-0025	train-other-500	who received her homage rather as if it bored him His indifferent manner may have been one secret of his power over her and perhaps she was not capable of all the suffering she was capable of inflicting
7220-77905-0026	train-other-500	Lyra turned to walk toward the house deflecting a little in the direction of her nephew and Miss Northwick
7220-77905-0027	train-other-500	Jack she drawled over the shoulder next them as she passed
none	none	 I wish you d bring your aunty s wrap to her on the piazza Why stay here Putney called after her 
7220-77905-0028	train-other-500	They re going to fetch the refreshments out here Yes but I m tired Ralph and I can t sit on the grass at my age She moved on with her sweeping lounging pace and Jack Wilmington after a moment s hesitation bowed to Miss Northwick
7220-77905-0029	train-other-500	and went after her The girl remained apart from her friends as if expecting his return Silhouetted against the bright windows Lyra waited till Jack Wilmington reappeared with a shawl and laid it on her shoulders Then she sank into a chair
7220-77905-0030	train-other-500	The young man stood beside her talking down upon her Something restive and insistent expressed itself in their respective attitudes He sat down at her side Miss Northwick joined her friends carelessly
none	none	 Ah Miss Kilburn said mister Brandreth s voice at Annie s ear 
7220-77905-0031	train-other-500	I m glad to find you I ve just run home with mother she feels the night air and I was afraid you would slip through our fingers before I got back This little business of the refreshments was an afterthought of missus Munger s and we meant it for a surprise
7220-77905-0032	train-other-500	we knew you d approve of it in the form it took He looked round at the straggling workpeople who represented the harmonisation of classes keeping to themselves as if they had been there alone Yes Annie was obliged to say it s very pleasant
7220-77905-0033	train-other-500	She added You must all be rather hungry mister Brandreth If the Social Union ever gets on its feet it will have you to thank more than any one Oh don t speak of me Miss Kilburn Do you know we ve netted about two hundred dollars Isn t that pretty good doctor
7220-77905-0034	train-other-500	Very said the doctor Hadn t we better follow missus Wilmington s example and get up under the piazza roof I m afraid you ll be the worse for the night air Miss Kilburn
none	none	 Putney he called to his friend we re going up to the house 
7220-77905-0035	train-other-500	All right I guess that s a good idea The doctor called to the different knots and groups telling them to come up to the house Some of the workpeople slipped away through the grounds and did not come The Northwicks and their friends moved toward the house
7220-77905-0036	train-other-500	missus Munger came down the lawn to meet her guests Ah that s right It s much better indoors I was just coming for you She addressed herself more particularly to the Northwicks Coffee will be ready in a few moments We ve met with a little delay
7220-77905-0037	train-other-500	I m afraid we must say good night at once said mister Northwick We had arranged to have our friends and some other guests with us at home And we re quite late now missus Munger protested Take our Juliet from us
7220-77905-0038	train-other-500	Oh Miss Northwick how can I thank you enough The whole play turned upon you It s just as well she said to Annie as the Northwicks and their friends walked across the lawn to the gate where they had carriages waiting They d have been difficult to manage
7220-77905-0039	train-other-500	and everybody else will feel a little more at home without them Poor mister Brandreth I m sure you will I did pity you so with such a Juliet on your hands In doors the representatives of the lower classes were less at ease than they were without
7220-77905-0040	train-other-500	Some of the ministers mingled with them and tried to form a bond between them and the other villagers mister Peck took no part in this work he stood holding his elbows with his hands and talking with a perfunctory air to an old lady of his congregation
7220-77905-0041	train-other-500	The young ladies of South Hatboro as missus Munger s assistants went about impartially to high and low with trays of refreshments Annie saw Putney
none	none	 where he stood with his wife and boy refuse coffee 
7220-77905-0042	train-other-500	and she watched him anxiously when the claret cup came He waved his hand over it and said No I ll take some of the lemonade As he lifted a glass of it toward his lips he stopped and made as if to put it down again and his hand shook so that he spilled some of it
7220-77905-0043	train-other-500	Then he dashed it off and reached for another glass I want some more he said with a laugh I m thirsty He drank a second glass and when he saw a tray coming toward Annie where doctor Morrell had joined her he came over and exchanged his empty glass for a full one
7220-77905-0044	train-other-500	Not much to brag of as lemonade he said but first rate rum punch Look here Putney whispered the doctor laying his hand on his arm
none	none	 don t you take any more of that Give me that glass Oh all right laughed Putney dashing it off You re welcome to the tumbler if you want it Doc XVIII missus Munger s guests kept on talking and laughing With the coffee and the punch there began to be a little more freedom Some prohibitionists among the working people went away when they found that the lemonade was punch but missus Munger did not know it and she saw the ideal of a Social Union figuratively accomplished in her own house She stirred about among her guests till she produced a fleeting empty good fellowship among them One of the shoe shop hands with an inextinguishable scent of leather and the character of a droll seconded her efforts with noisy jokes He proposed games and would not be snubbed by the refusal of his boss to countenance him he had the applause of so many others missus Munger approved of the idea Don t you think it would be great fun missus Gerrish she asked Well now if Squire Putney would lead off said the joker looking round Putney could not be found nor doctor Morrell They re off somewhere for a smoke said missus Munger Well that s right I want everybody to feel that my house is their own to night and to come and go just as they like Do you suppose mister Peck is offended she asked under her breath as she passed Annie He couldn t feel that this is the same thing but I can t see him anywhere He wouldn t go without taking leave you don t suppose Annie joined missus Putney They talked at first with those who came to ask where Putney and the doctor were but finally they withdrew into a little alcove from the parlour where missus Munger approved of their being when she discovered them they must be very tired and ought to rest on the lounge there Her theory of the exhaustion of those who had taken part in the play embraced their families The time wore on toward midnight and her guests got themselves away with more or less difficulty as they attempted the formality of leave taking or not Some of the hands who thought this necessary found it a serious affair but most of them slipped off without saying good night to missus Munger or expressing that rapture with the whole evening from beginning to end which the ladies of South Hatboro professed The ladies of South Hatboro and Old Hatboro had met in a general intimacy not approached before and they parted with a flow of mutual esteem The Gerrish children had dropped asleep in nooks and corners from which mister Gerrish hunted them up and put them together for departure while his wife remained with missus Munger unable to stop talking and no longer amenable to the looks with which he governed her in public Lyra came downstairs hooded and wrapped for departure with Jack Wilmington by her side Why Ellen she said looking into the little alcove from the hall Are you here yet And Annie Where in the world is Ralph At the pleading look with which missus Putney replied she exclaimed Oh it s what I was afraid of I don t see what the woman could have been about But of course she didn t think of poor Ralph Ellen let me take you and Winthrop home doctor Morrell will be sure to bring Ralph Well said missus Putney passively but without rising Annie can come too There s plenty of room Jack can walk Jack Wilmington joined Lyra in urging Annie to take his place He said to her apart Young Munger has been telling me that Putney got at the sideboard and carried off the rum I ll stay and help look after him A crazy laugh came into the parlour from the piazza outside and the group in the alcove started forward Putney stood at a window resting one arm on the bar of the long lower sash which was raised to its full height and looking ironically in upon missus Munger and her remaining guests He was still in his Mercutio dress but he had lost his plumed cap and was bareheaded A pace or two behind him stood mister Peck regarding the effect of this apparition upon the company with the same dreamy indrawn presence he had in the pulpit Well missus Munger I m glad I got back in time to tell you how much I ve enjoyed it Brother Peck wanted me to go home but I told him Not till I ve thanked missus Munger Brother Peck not till I ve drunk her health in her own old particular Jamaica He put to his lips the black bottle which he had been holding in his right hand behind him then he took it away looked at it and flung it rolling along the piazza floor Didn t get hold of the inexhaustible bottle that time never do But it s a good article a better article than you used to sell on the sly Bill Gerrish You ll excuse my helping myself missus Munger I knew you d want me to Well it s been a great occasion missus Munger He winked at the hostess You ve had your little invited supper after all You re a manager missus Munger You ve made even the wrath of Brother Peck to praise you The ladies involuntarily shrank backward as Putney suddenly entered through the window and gained the corner of the piano at a dash He stayed himself against it slightly swaying and turned his flaming eyes from one to another as if questioning whom he should attack next Except for the wild look in them which was not so much wilder than they wore in all times of excitement and an occasional halt at a difficult word he gave no sign of being drunk The liquor had as yet merely intensified him missus Munger had the inspiration to treat him as one caresses a dangerous lunatic I m sure you re very kind mister Putney to come back Do sit down Why demanded Putney Everybody else standing That s true said missus Munger I m sure I don t know why Oh yes you do missus Munger It s because they want to have a good view of a man who s made a fool of himself Oh now mister Putney said missus Munger with hospitable deprecation I m sure no one wants to do anything of the kind She looked round at the company for corroboration but no one cared to attract Putney s attention by any sound or sign But I ll tell you what said Putney with a savage burst that a woman who puts hell fire before a poor devil who can t keep out of it when he sees it is better worth looking at mister Putney I assure you said missus Munger that it was the mildest punch And I really didn t think I didn t remember She turned toward missus Putney with her explanation but Putney seemed to have forgotten her and he turned upon mister Gerrish How s that drunkard s grave getting along that you ve dug for your porter Gerrish remained prudently silent I know you Billy You re all right You ve got the pull on your conscience we all have one way or another Here s Annie Kilburn come back from Rome where she couldn t seem to fix it up with hers to suit her and she s trying to get round it in Hatboro with good works Why there isn t any occasion for good works in Hatboro I could have told you that before you came he said addressing Annie directly What we want is faith and lots of it The church is going to pieces because we haven t got any faith His hand slipped from the piano and he dropped heavily back upon a chair that stood near The concussion seemed to complete in his brain the transition from his normal dispositions to their opposite which had already begun Bill Gerrish has done more for Hatboro than any other man in the place He s the only man that holds the church together because he knows the value of faith He said this without a trace of irony glaring at Annie with fierce defiance You come back here and try to set up for a saint in a town where William B Gerrish has done has done more to establish the dry goods business on a metro me tro politan basis than any other man out of New York or Boston He stopped and looked round mystified as if this were not the point which he had been aiming at Lyra broke into a spluttering laugh and suddenly checked herself Putney smiled slightly Pretty good eh Say where was I he asked slyly Lyra hid her face behind Annie s shoulder What s that dress you got on What s all this about anyway Oh yes I know Romeo and Juliet Social Union Well he resumed with a frown there s too much Romeo and Juliet too much Social Union in this town already He stopped and seemed preparing to launch some deadly phrase at missus Wilmington but he only said You re all right Lyra missus Munger said mister Gerrish we must be going Good night ma am missus Gerrish it s time the children were at home Of course it is said Putney watching the Gerrishes getting their children together He waved his hand after them and called out William Gerrish you re a man I honour you He laid hold of the piano and pulled himself to his feet and seemed to become aware for the first time of his wife where she stood with their boy beside her What you doing here with that child at this time of night he shouted at her all that was left of the man in his eyes changing into the glare of a pitiless brute Why don t you go home You want to show people what I did to him You want to publish my shame do you Is that it Look here He began to work himself along toward her by help of the piano A step was heard on the piazza without and doctor Morrell entered through the open window Come now Putney he said gently The other men closed round them Putney stopped What s this Interfering in family matters You better go home and look after your own wives if you got any Get out the way n you mind your own business Doc Morrell You meddle too much His speech was thickening and breaking You think science going do everything evolution Talk me about evolution What s evolution done for Hatboro Volved Gerrish s store One day of Christianity real Christianity Where s that boy If I get hold of him He lunged forward and Jack Wilmington and young Munger stepped before him missus Putney had not moved nor lost the look of sad passive vigilance which she had worn since her husband reappeared She pushed the men aside Ralph behave yourself Here s Winthrop and we want you to take us home Come now She passed her arm through his and the boy took his other hand The action so full of fearless custom and wonted affection from them both seemed with her words to operate another total change in his mood All right I m going Ellen Got to say good night missus Munger that s all He managed to get to her with his wife on his arm and his boy at his side Want to thank you for a pleasant evening missus Munger want to thank you And I want to thank you too missus Munger said missus Putney with an intensity of bitterness no repetition of the words could give It s been a pleasant evening for me Putney wished to stop and explain but his wife pulled him away doctor Morrell and Annie followed to get them safely into the carriage he went with them and when she came back missus Munger was saying I will leave it to mister Wilmington or any one if I m to blame It had quite gone out of my head about mister Putney There was plenty of coffee besides and if everything that could harm particular persons had to be kept out of the way society couldn t go on We ought to consider the greatest good of the greatest number She looked round from one to another for support No one said anything and missus Munger trembling on the verge of a collapse made a direct appeal Don t you think so mister Peck The minister broke his silence with reluctance It s sometimes best to have the effect of error unmistakable Then we are sure it s error missus Munger gave a sob of relief into her handkerchief Yes that s just what I say Lyra bent her face on her arm and Jack Wilmington put his head out of the window where he stood mister Peck remained staring at missus Munger as if doubtful what to do Then he said You seem not to have understood me ma am I should be to blame if I left you in doubt You have been guilty of forgetting your brother s weakness and if the consequence has promptly followed in his shame it is for you to realise it I wish you a good evening He went out with a dignity that thrilled Annie Lyra leaned toward her and said choking with laughter He s left Idella asleep upstairs We haven t any of us got perfect memories have we Run after him Annie said to Jack Wilmington in undertone and get him into my carriage I ll get the little girl Lyra don t speak of it Never said missus Wilmington with delight I m solid for mister Peck every time XIX Annie made up a bed for Idella on a wide old fashioned lounge in her room and put her away in it swathed in a night gown which she found among the survivals of her own childish clothing in that old chest of drawers When she woke in the morning she looked across at the little creature with a tender sense of possession and protection suffusing her troubled recollections of the night before 
7220-77907-0000	train-other-500	Idella stirred stretched herself with a long sigh and then sat up and stared round the strange place as if she were still in a dream Would you like to come in here with me Annie suggested from her bed
7220-77907-0001	train-other-500	The child pushed back her hair with her little hands and after waiting to realise the situation to the limit of her small experience she said with a smile that showed her pretty teeth Yes Then come
7220-77907-0002	train-other-500	Idella tumbled out of bed pulling up the nightgown which was too long for her and softly thumped across the carpet Annie leaned over and lifted her up and pressed the little face to her own
none	none	 and felt the play of the quick light breath over her cheek 
7220-77907-0003	train-other-500	Would you like to stay with me live with me Idella she asked The child turned her face away and hid a roguish smile in the pillow I don t know
none	none	 Would you like to be my little girl 
7220-77907-0004	train-other-500	No No Why not Because because she seemed to search her mind because your night gowns are too long Oh is that all That s no reason Think of something else
7220-77907-0005	train-other-500	Idella rubbed her face hard on the pillow You dress up cats She lifted her face and looked with eyes of laughing malice into Annie s and Annie pushed her face against Idella s neck and cried You re a rogue
7220-77907-0006	train-other-500	The little one screamed with laughter and gurgled Oh you tickle You tickle They had a childish romp prolonged through the details of Idella s washing and dressing and Annie tried to lose in her frolic with the child the anxieties that had beset her waking
7220-77907-0007	train-other-500	she succeeded in confusing them with one another in one dull indefinite pain She wondered when mister Peck would come for Idella but they were still at their belated breakfast when missus Bolton came in to say that Bolton had met the minister on his way up
7220-77907-0008	train-other-500	and had asked him if Idella might not stay the week out with them I don know but he done more n he d ought But she can be with us the rest part when you ve got done with her I haven t begun to get done with her said Annie I m glad mister Bolton asked
7220-77907-0009	train-other-500	After breakfast Bolton himself appeared to ask if Idella might go up to the orchard with him Idella ran out of the room and came back with her hat on and tugging to get into her shabby little sack Annie helped her with it
7220-77907-0010	train-other-500	and Idella tucked her hand into Bolton s loose hard fist and gave it a pull toward the door Well I don t see but what she s goin he said Yes you d better ask her the next time if I can go said Annie
none	none	 Well why don t you asked Bolton humouring the joke 
7220-77907-0011	train-other-500	I guess you d enjoy it about as well as any We re just goin for a basket of wind falls for pies I guess we ain t a goin to be gone a great while Annie watched them up the lane from the library window with a queer grudge at heart
7220-77907-0012	train-other-500	Bolton stiffly lumbering forward at an angle of forty five degrees
none	none	 the child whirling and dancing at his side and now before and now after him 
7220-77907-0013	train-other-500	At the sound of wheels on the gravel before the front door Annie turned away with such an imperative need of its being doctor Morrell s buggy that it was almost an intolerable disappointment to find it missus Munger s phaeton
7220-77907-0014	train-other-500	missus Munger burst in upon her in an excitement which somehow had an effect of premeditation
none	none	 Miss Kilburn I wish to know what you think of mister and missus Putney s behaviour to me 
7220-77907-0015	train-other-500	and mister Peck s in my own house last night They are friends of yours and I wish to know if you approve of it I come to you as their friend and I am sure you will feel as I do that my hospitality has been abused
7220-77907-0016	train-other-500	It was an outrage for mister Putney to get intoxicated in my house and for mister Peck to attack me as he did before everybody because mister Putney had taken advantage of his privileges was abominable
none	none	 I am not a member of his church and even if I were 
7220-77907-0017	train-other-500	he would have had no right to speak so to me Annie felt the blood fly to her head and she waited a moment to regain her coolness I wonder you came to ask me missus Munger
none	none	 if you were so sure that I agreed with you 
7220-77907-0018	train-other-500	I m certainly mister and missus Putney s friend and so far as admiring mister Peck s sincerity and goodness is concerned I m his friend But I m obliged to say that you re mistaken about the rest
7220-77907-0019	train-other-500	She folded her hands at her waist and stood up very straight looking firmly at missus Munger who made a show of taking a new grip of her senses as she sank unbidden into a chair Why what do you mean Miss Kilburn
none	none	 It seems to me that I needn t say 
7220-77907-0020	train-other-500	Why but you must You must you know I can t be left so I must know where I stand I must be sure of my ground I can t go on without understanding just how much you mean by my being mistaken
7220-77907-0021	train-other-500	She looked Annie in the face with eyes superficially expressive of indignant surprise and Annie perceived that she wished to restore herself in her own esteem by browbeating some one else into the affirmation of her innocence
7220-77907-0022	train-other-500	Well if you must know missus Munger I mean that you ought to have remembered mister Putney s infirmity and that it was cruel to put temptation in his way Everybody knows that he can t resist it and that he is making such a hard fight to keep out of it
7220-77907-0023	train-other-500	And then if you press me for an opinion I must say that you were not justifiable in asking mister Peck to take part in a social entertainment when we had explicitly dropped that part of the affair
7220-77907-0024	train-other-500	missus Munger had not pressed Annie for an opinion on this point at all but in their interest in it they both ignored the fact missus Munger tacitly admitted her position in retorting He needn t have stayed
7220-77907-0025	train-other-500	You made him stay you remember how and he couldn t have got away without being rude And you think he wasn t rude to scold me before my guests He told you the truth
7220-77907-0026	train-other-500	He didn t wish to say anything but you forced him to speak just as you have forced me Forced you Miss Kilburn Yes I don t at all agree with mister Peck in many things but he is a good man and last night he spoke the truth
7220-77907-0027	train-other-500	I shouldn t be speaking it if I didn t tell you I thought so Very well then said missus Munger rising After this you can t expect me to have anything to do with the Social Union you couldn t wish me to if that s your opinion of my character
7220-77907-0028	train-other-500	I haven t expressed any opinion of your character missus Munger if you ll remember please and as for the Social Union I shall have nothing further to do with it myself Annie drew herself up a little higher and silently waited for her visitor to go
7220-77907-0029	train-other-500	But missus Munger remained I don t believe missus Putney herself would say what you have said she remarked after an embarrassing moment If it were really so I should be willing to make any reparation to acknowledge it
7220-77907-0030	train-other-500	Will you go with me to missus Putney s I have my phaeton here and I shouldn t dream of going to missus Putney s with you missus Munger urged with the effect of invincible argument I ve been down in the village and I ve talked to a good many about it
7220-77907-0031	train-other-500	some of them hadn t heard of it before and I must say Miss Kilburn that people generally take a very different view of it from what you do They think that my hospitality has been shamefully abused mister Gates said he should think I would have mister Putney arrested
7220-77907-0032	train-other-500	But I don t care for all that What I wish is to prove to you that I am right and if I can go with you to call on missus Putney I shall not care what any one else says Will you come Certainly not cried Annie
7220-77907-0033	train-other-500	They both stood a moment and in this moment doctor Morrell drove up and dropped his hitching weight beyond missus Munger s phaeton As he entered she said We will let doctor Morrell decide
7220-77907-0034	train-other-500	I ve been asking Miss Kilburn to go with me to missus Putney s I think it would be a graceful and proper thing for me to do to express my sympathy and interest and to hear what missus Putney really has to say
none	none	 Don t you think I ought to go to see her doctor 
7220-77907-0035	train-other-500	The doctor laughed I can t prescribe in matters of social duty
none	none	 But what do you want to see missus Putney for 
7220-77907-0036	train-other-500	What for Why doctor on account of mister Putney what took place last night Yes What was that What was that Why his strange behaviour his his intoxication
7220-77907-0037	train-other-500	Was he intoxicated Did you think so
none	none	 Why you were there doctor Didn t you think so 
7220-77907-0038	train-other-500	Annie looked at him with as much astonishment as missus Munger The doctor laughed again You can t always tell when Putney s joking he s a great joker Perhaps he was hoaxing Oh doctor do you think he could have been said missus Munger with clasped hands
7220-77907-0039	train-other-500	It would make me the happiest woman in the world I d forgive him all he s made me suffer But you re joking now doctor You can t tell when people are joking If I m not does it follow that I m really intoxicated
none	none	 Oh but that s nonsense doctor Morrell 
7220-77907-0040	train-other-500	That s mere what do you call it chop logic But I don t mind it I grasp at a straw missus Munger grasped at a straw of the mind to show how But what do you mean
7220-77907-0041	train-other-500	Well missus Putney wasn t intoxicated last night but she s not well this morning I m afraid she couldn t see you Just as you say doctor cried missus Munger with mounting cheerfulness I wish I knew just how much you meant and how little
7220-77907-0042	train-other-500	She moved closer to the doctor and bent a look of candid fondness upon him But I know you re trying to mystify me She pursued him with questions which he easily parried smiling and laughing At the end she left him to Annie
7220-77907-0043	train-other-500	with adieux that were almost radiant Anyhow I shall take the benefit of the doubt and if mister Putney was hoaxing I shall not give myself away Do find out what he means Miss Kilburn won t you She took hold of Annie s unoffered hand
none	none	 and pressed it in a double leathern grasp and ran out of the room with a lightness of spirit which her physical bulk imperfectly expressed XX Well said Annie to the change which came over Morrell s face when missus Munger was gone Oh it s a miserable business He must go on now to the end of his debauch He s got past doing any mischief I m thankful to say But I had hoped to tide him over a while longer and now that fool has spoiled everything Well Annie s heart warmed to his vexation and she postponed another emotion Yes she is a fool I wish you had qualified the term doctor They looked at each other solemnly and then laughed It won t do for a physician to swear said Morrell I wish you d give me a cup of coffee I ve been up all night With Ralph With Putney You shall have it instantly that is as instantly as missus Bolton can kindle up a fire and make it She went out to the kitchen and gave the order with an imperiousness which she softened in doctor Morrell s interest by explaining rather fully to missus Bolton When she came back she wanted to talk seriously tragically about Putney But the doctor would not He said that it paid to sit up with Putney drunk or sober and hear him go on He repeated some things Putney said about mister Peck about Gerrish about missus Munger But why did you try to put her off in that way to make her believe he wasn t intoxicated asked Annie venting her postponed emotion which was of disapproval I don t know It came into my head But she knows better It was rather cruel not that she deserves any mercy She caught so at the idea Oh yes I saw that She ll humbug herself with it and you ll see that before night there ll be two theories of Putney s escapade I think the last will be the popular one It will jump with the general opinion of Putney s ability to carry anything out And missus Munger will do all she can to support it missus Bolton brought in the coffee pot and Annie hesitated a moment with her hand on it before pouring out a cup I don t like it she said I know you don t But you can say that it wasn t Putney who hoaxed missus Munger but doctor Morrell Oh you didn t either of you hoax her Well then there s no harm done I m not so sure And you won t give me any coffee Oh yes I ll give you some coffee said Annie with a sigh of baffled scrupulosity that made them both laugh He broke out again after he had begun to drink his coffee Well she demanded from her own lapse into silence Oh nothing Only Putney He wants Brother Peck as he calls him to unite all the religious elements of Hatboro in a church of his own and send out missionaries to the heathen of South Hatboro to preach a practical Christianity He makes South Hatboro stand for all that s worldly and depraved Poor Ralph Is that the way he talks Oh not all the time He talks a great many other ways I wonder you can laugh He s been very severe on Brother Peck for neglecting the discipline of his child He says he ought to remember his duty to others and save the community from having the child grow up into a capricious wilful woman Putney was very hard upon your sex Miss Kilburn He attributed nearly all the trouble in the world to women s wilfulness and caprice He looked across the table at her with his merry eyes whose sweetness she felt even in her sudden preoccupation with the notion which she now launched upon him leaning forward and pushing some books and magazines aside as if she wished to have nothing between her need and his response doctor Morrell what should you think of my asking mister Peck to give me his little girl To give you his Yes Let me take Idella keep her adopt her I ve nothing to do as you know very well and she d be an occupation and it would be far better for her What Ralph says is true She s growing up without any sort of training and I think if she keeps on she will be mischievous to herself and every one else Really asked the doctor Is it so bad as that Of course not And of course I don t want mister Peck to renounce all claim to his child but to let me have her for the present or indefinitely and get her some decent clothes and trim her hair properly and give her some sort of instruction May I come in drawled missus Wilmington s mellow voice and Annie turned and saw Lyra peering round the edge of the half opened library door I ve been discreetly hemming and scraping and hammering on the wood work so as not to overhear and I d have gone away if I hadn t been afraid of being overheard Oh come in Lyra said Annie and she hoped that she had kept the spirit of resignation with which she spoke out of her voice doctor Morrell jumped up with an apparent desire to escape that wounded and exasperated her She put out her hand quite haughtily to him and asked Oh must you go Yes How do you do missus Wilmington You d better get Miss Kilburn to give you a cup of her coffee Oh I will said Lyra She forbore any reference even by a look to the intimate little situation she had disturbed Morrell added to Annie I like your plan It a the best thing you could do She found she had been keeping his hand and in the revulsion from wrath to joy she violently wrung it I m so glad She could not help following him to the door in the hope that he would say something more but he did not and she could only repeat her rapturous gratitude in several forms of incoherency She ran back to missus Wilmington Lyra what do you think of my taking mister Peck s little girl missus Wilmington never allowed herself to seem surprised at anything she was in fact surprised at very few things She had got into the easiest chair in the room and she answered from it with a luxurious interest in the affair Well you know what people will say Annie No I don t What will they say That you re after mister Peck pretty openly Annie turned scarlet And when they find I m not she demanded with severity that had no effect upon Lyra Then they ll say you couldn t get him They may say what they please What do you think of the plan I think it would be the greatest blessing for the poor little thing said Lyra with a nearer approach to seriousness than she usually made And the greatest care for you she added after a moment I shall not care for the care I shall be glad of it thankful for it cried Annie fervidly If you can get it Lyra suggested I believe I can get it I believe I can make mister Peck see that it s a duty I shall ask him to regard it as a charity to me as a mercy Well that s a good way to work upon mister Peck s feelings said Lyra demurely Was that the plan that doctor Morrell approved of so highly Yes I didn t know but it was some course of treatment You pressed his hand so affectionately I said to myself Well Annie s either an enthusiastic patient or else What demanded Annie at the little stop Lyra made Well you know what people do say Annie What Why that you re very much out of health or Lyra made another of her tantalising stops Or what Or doctor Morrell is very much in love Lyra I can t allow you to say such things to me No that s what I ve kept saying to myself all the time But you would have it out of me I didn t want to say it It was impossible to resist Lyra s pretended deprecation Annie laughed I suppose I can t help people s talking and I ought to be too old to care You ought but you re not said Lyra flatteringly Well Annie what do you think of our little evening at missus Munger s in the dim retrospect Poor Ralph What did the doctor say about him She listened with so keen a relish for the report of Putney s sayings that Annie felt as if she had been turning the affair into comedy for Lyra s amusement Oh dear I wish I could hear him I thought I should have died last night when he came back and began to scare everybody blue with his highly personal remarks I wish he d had time to get round to the Northwicks Lyra said Annie nerving herself to the office don t you think it was wicked to treat that poor girl as you did Well I suppose that s the way some people might look at it said Lyra dispassionately Then how how could you do it Oh it s easy enough to behave wickedly Annie when you feel like it said Lyra much amused by Annie s fervour apparently Besides I don t know that it was so very wicked What makes you think it was Oh it wasn t that merely Lyra may I may I speak to you plainly frankly like a sister Annie s heart filled with tenderness for Lyra with the wish to help her to save a person who charmed her so much Well like a step sister you may said Lyra demurely It wasn t for her sake alone that I hated to see it It was for your sake for his sake Well that s very kind of you Annie said Lyra without the least resentment And I know what you mean But it really doesn t hurt either Jack or me I m not very goody goody Annie I don t pretend to be but I m not very baddy baddy either I assure you Lyra laughed mischievously I m one of the very few persons in Hatboro who are better than they should be I know it Lyra I know it But you have no right to keep him from taking a fancy to some young girl and marrying her to keep him to yourself to make people talk There s something in that Lyra assented with impartiality But I don t think it would be well for Jack to marry yet and if I see him taking a fancy to any real nice girl I sha n t interfere with him But I shall be very particular Annie She looked at Annie with such a droll mock earnest and shook her head with such a burlesque of grandmotherly solicitude that Annie laughed in spite of herself Oh Lyra Lyra And as for me Lyra went on I assure you I don t care for the little bit of harm it does me But you ought you ought cried Annie You ought to respect yourself enough to care You ought to respect other women enough Oh I guess I d let the balance of the sex slide Annie said Lyra No you mustn t you can t We are all bound together we owe everything to each other Isn t that rather Peckish Lyra suggested I don t know But it s true Lyra And I shouldn t be ashamed of getting it from mister Peck Oh I didn t say you would be And I hope you won t be hurt with me I know that it s a most unwarrantable thing to speak to you about such a matter but you know why I do it Yes I suppose it s because you like me and I appreciate that I assure you Annie Lyra was soberer than she had yet been and Annie felt that she was really gaining ground And your husband you ought to respect him Lyra laughed out with great relish Oh now Annie you are joking Why in the world should I respect mister Wilmington An old man like him marrying a young girl like me She jumped up and laughed at the look in Annie s face Will you go round with me to the Putneys thought Ellen might like to see us No no I can t go said Annie finding it impossible to recover at once from the quite unanswerable blow her sense of decorum she thought it her moral sense had received Well you ll be glad to have me go anyway said Lyra She saw Annie shrinking from her and she took hold of her and pulled her up and kissed her You dear old thing I wouldn t hurt your feelings for the world And whichever it is Annie the parson or the doctor I wish him joy That afternoon as Annie was walking to the village the doctor drove up to the sidewalk and stopped near her Miss Kilburn I ve got a letter from home They write me about my mother in a way that makes me rather anxious and I shall run down to Chelsea this evening Oh I m sorry for your bad news I hope it s nothing serious She s old that s the only cause for anxiety But of course I must go Oh yes indeed I do hope you ll find all right with her Thank you very much I m sorry that I must leave Putney at such a time But I leave him with mister Peck who s promised to be with him I thought you d like to know Yes I do it s very kind of you very kind indeed Thank you said the doctor It was not the phrase exactly but it served the purpose of the cordial interest in which they parted as well as another XXI During the days that mister Peck had consented to leave Idella with her Annie took the whole charge of the child and grew into an intimacy with her that was very sweet It was not necessary to this that Idella should be always tractable and docile which she was not but only that she should be affectionate and dependent Annie found that she even liked her to be a little baddish it gave her something to forgive and she experienced a perverse pleasure in discovering that the child of a man so self forgetful as mister Peck was rather more covetous than most children It also amused her that when some of Idella s shabby playmates from Over the Track casually found their way to the woods past Annie s house and tried to tempt Idella to go with them the child disowned them and ran into the house from them so soon was she alienated from her former life by her present social advantages She apparently distinguished between Annie and the Boltons or if not quite this she showed a distinct preference for her company and for her part of the house She hung about Annie with a flattering curiosity and interest in all she did She lost every trace of shyness with her but developed an intense admiration for her in every way for her dresses her rings her laces for the elegancies that marked her a gentlewoman She pronounced them prettier than missus Warner s things and the house prettier and larger Should you like to live with me Annie asked The child seemed to reflect Then she said with the indirection of her age and sex pushing against Annie s knee I don t know what your name is Have you never heard my name It s Annie How do you like it It s it s too short said the child from her readiness always to answer something that charmed Annie Well then you can make it longer You can call me Aunt Annie I think that will be better for a little girl don t you Mothers can whip but aunts can t said Idella bringing a practical knowledge acquired from her observation of life Over the Track to a consideration of the proposed relation I know one aunt who won t said Annie touched by the reply Saturday evening Idella s father came for her and with a preamble which seemed to have been unnecessary when he understood it Annie asked him to let her keep the child at least till he had settled himself in a house of his own or she hinted in some way more comfortable for Idella than he was now living In her anxiety to make him believe that she was not taking too great a burden on her hands she became slowly aware that no fear of this had apparently troubled him and that he was looking at the whole matter from a point outside of questions of polite ceremonial even of personal feeling She was vexed a little with his insensibility to the favour she meant the child and she could not help trying to make him realise it I don t promise always to be the best guide philosopher and friend that Idella could have she took this light tone because she found herself afraid of him but I think I shall be a little improvement on some of her friends Over the Track At least if she wants my cat she shall have it without fighting for it mister Peck looked up with question and she went on to tell him of a struggle which she had seen one day between Idella and a small Irish boy for a kitten it really belonged to the boy but Idella carried it off The minister listened attentively At the end Yes he said that lust of possession is something all but impossible even with constant care to root out of children I have tried to teach Idella that nothing is rightfully hers except while she can use it but it is hard to make her understand and when she is with other children she forgets Annie could not believe at first that he was serious and then she was disposed to laugh Really mister Peck she began I can t think it s so important that a little thing like Idella should be kept from coveting a kitten as that she should be kept from using naughty words and from scratching and biting I know mister Peck consented That is the usual way of looking at such things It seems to me said Annie that it s the common sense way Perhaps But upon the whole I don t agree with you It is bad for the child to use naughty words and to scratch and bite that s part of the warfare in which we all live but it s worse for her to covet and to wish to keep others from having I don t wonder you find it hard to make her understand that Yes it s hard with all of us But if it is ever to be easier we must begin with the children He was silent and Annie did not say anything She was afraid that she had not helped her cause At least she finally ventured you can t object to giving Idella a little rest from the fray Perhaps if she finds that she can get things without fighting for them she ll not covet them so much Yes he said with a dim smile that left him sad again there is some truth in that But I m not sure that I have the right to give her advantages of any kind to lift her above the lot the chance of the least fortunate Surely we are bound to provide for those of our own household said Annie Who are those of our own household asked the minister All mankind are those of our own household These are my mother and my brother and my sister Yes I know said Annie somewhat eagerly quitting this difficult ground But you can leave her with me at least till you get settled she faltered if you don t wish it to be for longer Perhaps it may not be for long he answered if you mean my settlement in Hatboro I doubt he continued lifting his eyes to the question in hers whether I shall remain here Oh I hope you will cried Annie She thought she must make a pretence of misunderstanding him I supposed you were very much satisfied with your work here I am not satisfied with myself in my work replied the minister and I know that I am far from acceptable to many others in it You are acceptable to those who are best able to appreciate you mister Peck she protested and to people of every kind I m sure it s only a question of time when you will be thoroughly acceptable to all I want you to understand mister Peck she added that I was shocked and ashamed the other night at your being tricked into countenancing a part of the entertainment you were promised should be dropped I had nothing to do with it It was very unimportant after all the minister said as far as I was concerned In fact I was interested to see the experiment of bringing the different grades of society together It seems to me it was an utter failure suggested Annie Quite But it was what I expected There appeared an uncandour in this which Annie could not let pass even if it imperilled her present object to bring up the matter of past contention But when we first talked of the Social Union you opposed it because it wouldn t bring the different classes together Did you understand that Then I failed to make myself clear I wished merely to argue that the well meaning ladies who suggested it were not intending a social union at all In fact such a union in our present condition of things with its division of classes is impossible as missus Munger s experiment showed with the best will on both sides But as I said the experiment was interesting though unimportant except as it resulted in heart burning and offence They were on the same ground but they had reached it from starting points so opposite that Annie felt it very unsafe In her fear of getting into some controversy with mister Peck that might interfere with her designs regarding Idella she had a little insincerity in saying missus Munger s bad faith in that was certainly unimportant compared with her part in poor mister Putney s misfortune That was the worst thing that s what I can t forgive mister Peck said nothing to this and Annie somewhat daunted by his silence proceeded I ve had the satisfaction of telling her what I thought on both points But Ralph mister Putney I hear has escaped this time with less than his usual She did not know what lady like word to use for spree and so she stopped mister Peck merely said He has shown great self control and she perceived that he was not going to say more He listened patiently to the reasons she gave for not having offered missus Putney anything more than passive sympathy at a time when help could only have cumbered and kindness wounded her but he made no sign of thinking them either necessary or sufficient In the meantime he had not formally consented to Idella s remaining with her and Annie prepared to lead back to that affair as artfully as she could I really want you to believe mister Peck that I think very differently on some points from what I did when we first talked about the Social Union and I have you to thank for seeing things in a new light And you needn t she added lightly be afraid of my contaminating Idella s mind with any wicked ideas I ll do my best to keep her from coveting kittens or property of any kind though I ve always heard my father say that civilisation was founded upon the instinct of ownership and that it was the only thing that had advanced the world And if you dread the danger of giving her advantages as you say or bettering her worldly lot she continued with a smile for his quixotic scruples why I ll do my best to reduce her blessings to a minimum though I don t see why the poor little thing shouldn t get some good from the inequalities that there always must be in the world I am not sure there always must be inequalities in the world answered the minister There always have been cried Annie There always had been slavery up to a certain time he replied Oh but surely you don t compare the two Annie pleaded with what she really regarded as a kind of lunacy in the good man In the freest society I ve heard my father say there is naturally an upward and downward tendency a perfect level is impossible Some must rise and some must sink But what do you mean by rising If you mean in material things in wealth and the power over others that it gives I don t mean that altogether But there are other ways in cultivation refinement higher tastes and aims than the great mass of people can have You have risen yourself mister Peck I have risen as you call it he said with a meek sufferance of the application of the point to himself Those who rise above the necessity of work for daily bread are in great danger of losing their right relation to other men as I said when we talked of this before A point had remained in Annie s mind from her first talk with doctor Morrell Yes and you said once that there could be no sympathy between the rich and the poor no real love because they had not had the same experience of life But how is it about the poor who become rich They have had the same experience Too often they make haste to forget that they were poor they become hard masters to those they have left behind them They are eager to identify themselves with those who have been rich longer than they Some working men who now see this clearly have the courage to refuse to rise Miss Kilburn why should I let you take my child out of the conditions of self denial and self help to which she was born I don t know said Annie rather blankly Then she added impetuously Because I love her and want her I don t I won t pretend that it s for her sake It s for my sake though I can take better care of her than you can But I m all alone in the world I ve neither kith nor kin nothing but my miserable money I ve set my heart on the child I must have her At least let me keep her a while I will be honest with you mister Peck If I find I m doing her harm and not good I ll give her up I should wish you to feel that she is yours as much as ever and if you will feel so and come often to see her I I shall be very glad and she stopped and mister Peck rose Where is the child he asked with a troubled air and she silently led the way to the kitchen and left him at the door to Idella and the Boltons When she ventured back later he was gone but the child remained Half exultant and half ashamed she promised herself that she really would be true as far as possible to the odd notions of the minister in her treatment of his child When she undressed Idella for bed she noticed again the shabbiness of her poor little clothes She went through the bureau that held her own childish things once more but found them all too large for Idella and too hopelessly antiquated She said to herself that on this point at least she must be a law to herself She went down to see missus Bolton Isn t there some place in the village where they have children s ready made clothes for sale she asked mister Gerrish s said missus Bolton briefly Annie shook her head drawing in her breath I shouldn t want to go there Is there nowhere else There s a Jew place They say he cheats I dare say he doesn t cheat more than most Christians said Annie jumping from her chair I ll try the Jew place I want you to come with me missus Bolton They went together and found a dress that they both decided would fit Idella and a hat that matched it I don t know as he d like to have anything quite so nice said missus Bolton coldly I don t know as he has anything to say about it said Annie mimicking missus Bolton s accent and syntax They both meant mister Peck missus Bolton turned away to hide her pleasure in Annie s audacity and extravagance Want I should carry em she asked when they were out of the store No I can carry them said Annie She put them where Idella must see them as soon as she woke It was late before she slept and Idella s voice broke upon her dreams The child was sitting up in her bed gloating upon the dress and hat hung and perched upon the chair back in the middle of the room Oh whose is it Whose is it Whose is it she screamed and as Annie lifted herself on her elbow and looked over at her Is it mine Is it mine Annie had thought of playing some joke of pretending not to understand of delaying the child s pleasure playing with it teasing But in the face of this rapturous longing she could only answer Yes Mine My very own To have To keep always Yes Idella sprang from her bed and flew upon the things with a primitive greedy transport in their possession She could scarcely be held long enough to be washed before the dress could be put on Be careful be careful not to get it soiled now said Annie No I won t spoil it She went quietly downstairs and when Annie followed she found her posing before the long pier glass in the parlour and twisting and turning for this effect and that All the morning she moved about prim and anxious the wild wood flower was like a hot house blossom wired for a bouquet At the church door she asked Idella Would you rather sit with missus Bolton No no gasped the child intensely with you and she pushed her hand into Annie s and held fast to it Annie s question had been suggested by a belated reluctance to appear before so much of Hatboro in charge of the minister s child But now she could not retreat and with Idella s hand in hers she advanced blushing up the aisle to her pew XXII The farmers carry alls filled the long shed beside the church and their leathern faces looked up with their wives and children s at mister Peck where he sat high behind the pulpit a patient expectance suggested itself in the men s bald or grizzled crowns and in the fantastic hats and bonnets of their women folks The village ladies were all in the perfection of their street costumes and they compared well with three or four of the ladies from South Hatboro but the men with them spoiled all by the inadequacy of their fashion missus Gates the second of her name was very stylish but the provision man had honestly the effect of having got for the day only into the black coat which he had bought ready made for his first wife s funeral mister Wilmington who appeared much shorter than his wife as he sat beside her was as much inferior to her in dress he wore with the carelessness of a rich man who could afford simplicity a loose alpaca coat and a cambric neckcloth over which he twisted his shrivelled neck to catch sight of Annie as she rustled up the aisle missus Gerrish so much as could be seen of her was a mound of bugled velvet topped by a small bonnet which seemed to have gone much to a fat black pompon she sat far within her pew and their children stretched in a row from her side to that of mister Gerrish next the door He did not look round at Annie but kept an attitude of fixed self concentration in harmony with the severe old school respectability of his dress his wife leaned well forward to see and let all her censure appear in her eyes Colonel Marvin of the largest shoe shop showed the side of his large florid face with the kindly smile that seemed to hang loosely upon it and there was a good number of the hat shop and shoe shop hands of different ages and sexes scattered about The gallery commonly empty or almost so showed groups and single figures dropped about here and there on its seats The Putneys were in their pew the little lame boy between the father and mother as their custom was They each looked up at her as she passed and smiled in the slight measure of recognition which people permit themselves in church Putney was sitting with his head hanging forward in pathetic dejection his face when he first lifted it to look at Annie in passing was haggard but otherwise there was no consciousness in it of what had passed since they had sat there the Sunday before When his glance took in Idella too in her sudden finery a light of friendly mocking came into it and seemed to comment the relation Annie had assumed to the child Annie s pew was just in front of Lyra s and Lyra pursed her mouth in burlesque surprise as Annie got into it with Idella and turned round to lift the child to the seat While mister Peck was giving out the hymn Lyra leaned forward and whispered Don t imagine that this turnout is all on your account Annie He s going to preach against the Social Union and the social glass The banter echoed a mechanical expectation in Annie s heart which was probably present in many others there It was some time before she could cast it out even after he had taken his text I am the Resurrection and the Life and she followed him with a mechanical disappointment at his failure to meet it He began by saying that he wished to dissociate his text in his hearers minds from the scent of the upturned earth and the fall of clods upon the coffin lid and he asked them to join him in attempting to find in it another meaning beside that which it usually carried He believed that those words of Christ ought to speak to us of this world as well as the next and enjoin upon us the example which we might all find in Him as well as promise us immortality with Him As the minister went on Annie followed him with the interest which her belief that she heard between the words inspired and occasionally in a discontent with what seemed a mystical almost a fantastical quality of his thought There is an evolution he continued in the moral as well as in the material world and good unfolds in greater good that which was once best ceases to be in that which is better In the political world we have striven forward to liberty as to the final good but with this achieved we find that liberty is only a means and not an end and that we shall abuse it as a means if we do not use it even sacrifice it to promote equality or in other words equality is the perfect work the evolution of liberty Patriotism has been the virtue which has secured an image of brotherhood rude and imperfect to large numbers of men within certain limits but nationality must perish before the universal ideal of fraternity is realised Charity is the holiest of the agencies which have hitherto wrought to redeem the race from savagery and despair but there is something holier yet than charity something higher something purer and further from selfishness something into which charity shall willingly grow and cease and that is justice Not the justice of our Christless codes with their penalties but the instinct of righteous shame which however dumbly however obscurely stirs in every honest man s heart when his superfluity is confronted with another s destitution and which is destined to increase in power till it becomes the social as well as the individual conscience Then in the truly Christian state there shall be no more asking and no more giving no more gratitude and no more merit no more charity but only and evermore justice all shall share alike and want and luxury and killing toil and heartless indolence shall all cease together It is in the spirit of this justice that I believe Christ shall come to judge the world not to condemn and punish so much as to reconcile and to right We live in an age of seeming preparation for indefinite war The lines are drawn harder and faster between the rich and the poor and on either side the forces are embattled The working men are combined in vast organisations to withstand the strength of the capitalists and these are taking the lesson and uniting in trusts The smaller industries are gone and the smaller commerce is being devoured by the larger Where many little shops existed one huge factory assembles manufacture one large store in which many different branches of trade are united swallows up the small dealers Yet in the labour organisations which have their bad side their weak side through which the forces of hell enter I see evidence of the fact that the poor have at last had pity on the poor and will no more betray and underbid and desert one another but will stand and fall together as brothers and the monopolies though they are founded upon ruin though they know no pity and no relenting have a final significance which we must not lose sight of They prophesy the end of competition they eliminate one element of strife of rivalry of warfare But woe to them through whose evil this good comes to any man who prospers on to ease and fortune forgetful or ignorant of the ruin on which his success is built For that death the resurrection and the life seem not to be Whatever his creed or his religious profession his state is more pitiable than that of the sceptic whose words perhaps deny Christ but whose works affirm Him There has been much anxiety in the Church for the future of the world abandoned to the godlessness of science but I cannot share it If God is nothing exists but from Him He directs the very reason that questions Him and Christ rises anew in the doubt of him that the sins of Christendom inspire So far from dreading such misgiving as comes from contemplating the disparity between the Church s profession and her performance I welcome it as another resurrection and a new life The minister paused and seemed about to resume when a scuffling and knocking noise drew all eyes toward the pew of the Gerrish family mister Gerrish had risen and flung open the door so sharply that it struck against the frame work of the pew and he stood pulling his children whom missus Gerrish urged from behind one after another into the aisle beside him One of them had been asleep and he now gave way to the alarm which seizes a small boy suddenly awakened His mother tried to still him stooping over him and twitching him by the hand with repeated Sh sh s as mothers do till her husband got her before him and marched his family down the aisle and out of the door The noise of their feet over the floor of the vestibule died away upon the stone steps outside The minister allowed the pause he had made to prolong itself painfully He wavered after clearing his throat as if to go on with his sermon and then he said sadly Let us pray XXIII 
7220-77911-0000	train-other-500	Putney stopped with his wife and boy and waited for Annie at the corner of the street where their ways parted She had eluded Lyra Wilmington in coming down the aisle
7220-77911-0001	train-other-500	and she had hurried to escape the sensation which broke into eager talk among the people before they got out of church and which began with question whether one of the Gerrish children was sick and ended in the more satisfactory conviction that mister Gerrish was offended at something in the sermon
7220-77911-0002	train-other-500	Well Annie said Putney with a satirical smile Oh Ralph Ellen what does it mean It means that Brother Gerrish thought mister Peck was hitting at him in that talk about the large commerce and it means business said Putney
7220-77911-0003	train-other-500	Brother Gerrish has made a beginning and I guess it s the beginning of the end unless we re all ready to take hold against him What are you going to do Do Anything Everything It was abominable It was atrocious she shuddered out with disgust
7220-77911-0004	train-other-500	How could he imagine that mister Peck would do such a thing Well he s imagined it But he doesn t mean to stay out of church he means to put Brother Peck out We mustn t let him That would be outrageous That s the way Ellen and I feel about it said Putney
7220-77911-0005	train-other-500	but we don t know how much of a party there is with us But everybody everybody must feel the same way about mister Gerrish s behaviour I don t see how you can be so quiet about it you and Ellen Annie looked from one to another indignantly and Putney laughed
7220-77911-0006	train-other-500	We re not feeling quietly about it said missus Putney Putney took out a piece of tobacco and bit off a large corner and began to chew vehemently upon it Hello Idella he said to the little girl holding by Annie s hand and looking up intently at him
7220-77911-0007	train-other-500	with childish interest in what he was eating What a pretty dress you ve got on It s mine said the child To keep Is that so Well it s a beauty I m going to wear it all the time Is that so
7220-77911-0008	train-other-500	Well now you and Winthrop step on ahead a little I want to see how you look in it Splendid he said as she took the boy s hand and looked back over her shoulder for Putney s applause Lyra tells us you ve adopted her for the time being Annie
7220-77911-0009	train-other-500	I guess you ll have your hands full But as I was going to say about feeling differently my experience is that there s always a good sized party for the perverse simply because it seems to answer a need in human nature There s a fascination in it
7220-77911-0010	train-other-500	a man feels as if there must be something in it besides the perversity and because it s so obviously wrong it must be right Don t you believe but what a good half of the people in church to day are pretty sure that Gerrish had a good reason for behaving indecently
7220-77911-0011	train-other-500	The very fact that he did so carries conviction to some minds and those are the minds we have got to deal with When he gets up in the next Society meeting there s a mighty great danger that he ll have a strong party to back him
7220-77911-0012	train-other-500	I can t believe it Annie broke out but she was greatly troubled What do you think Ellen
none	none	 that there s any danger of his carrying the day against mister Peck 
7220-77911-0013	train-other-500	There s a great deal of dissatisfaction with mister Peck already you know and I guess Ralph s right about the rest of it Well I m glad I ve taken a pew I m with you for mister Peck Ralph heart and soul As Brother Brandreth says about the Social Union
7220-77911-0014	train-other-500	Well that s right I shall count upon you And speaking of the Social Union I haven t seen you Annie since that night at missus Munger s I suppose you don t expect me to say anything in self defence
none	none	 No Ralph and you needn t 
7220-77911-0015	train-other-500	I ve defended you sufficiently justified you That won t do said Putney Ellen and I have thought that all out and we find that I or something that stood for me was to blame whoever else was to blame too
7220-77911-0016	train-other-500	we won t mention the hospitable missus Munger When doctor Morrell had to go away Brother Peck took hold with me and he suggested good resolutions I told him I d tried em and they never did me the least good
none	none	 but his sort really seemed to work 
7220-77911-0017	train-other-500	I don t know whether they would work again Ellen thinks they would I think we sha n t ever need anything again but that s what I always think when I come out of it like a man with chills and fever
none	none	 It was doctor Morrell who asked mister Peck to come said missus Putney 
7220-77911-0018	train-other-500	and it turned out for the best Ralph got well quicker than he ever did before Of course Annie she explained it must seem strange to you hearing us talk of it as if it were a disease but that s just like what it is a raging disease
7220-77911-0019	train-other-500	and I can t feel differently about anything that happens in it though I do blame people for it Annie followed with tender interest the loving pride that exonerated and idealised Putney in the words of the woman who had suffered so much with him and must suffer
7220-77911-0020	train-other-500	I couldn t help speaking as I did to missus Munger She deserved it every word said Annie I wonder you didn t say more Oh hold on Putney interposed We ll allow that the local influences were malarial
7220-77911-0021	train-other-500	but I guess we can t excuse the invalid altogether That s Brother Peck s view and I must say I found it decidedly tonic it helped to brace me up I think he was too severe with you altogether said his wife
7220-77911-0022	train-other-500	Putney laughed It was all I could do to keep Ellen from getting up and going out of church too when Brother Gerrish set the example She s a Gerrishite at heart Well remember Ralph said Annie that I m with you in whatever you do to defeat that man It s a good cause
7220-77911-0023	train-other-500	a righteous cause the cause of justice and we must do everything for it she said fervently Yes any enormity is justifiable against injustice he suggested or the unjust it s the same thing
7220-77911-0024	train-other-500	You know I don t mean that I can trust you I shall keep within the law at any rate said Putney Well missus Bolton Annie called out when she entered her house and she pushed on into the kitchen
7220-77911-0025	train-other-500	she had not the patience to wait for her to bring in the dinner before speaking about the exciting event at church But missus Bolton would not be led up to the subject by a tacit invitation
none	none	 and after a suspense in which her zeal for mister Peck began to take a colour of resentment toward missus Bolton 
7220-77911-0026	train-other-500	Annie demanded What do you think of mister Gerrish s scandalous behaviour missus Bolton gave herself time to put a stick of wood into the stove and to punch it with the stove lid handle before answering I don t know as it s anything more than I expected
7220-77911-0027	train-other-500	Annie went on It was shameful
none	none	 Do you suppose he really thought mister Peck was referring to him in his sermon I presume he felt the cap fit But if it hadn t b en one thing twould b en another 
7220-77911-0028	train-other-500	mister Peck was bound to roil the brook for mister Gerrish s drinkin wherever he stood up stream or down Yes He is a wolf A wolf in sheep s clothing said Annie excitedly
none	none	 I d know as you can call him a wolf exactly returned missus Bolton dryly 
7220-77911-0029	train-other-500	He s got his good points I presume Annie was astounded Why missus Bolton you re surely not going to justify him missus Bolton erected herself from cutting a loaf of her best bread into slices
none	none	 and stood with the knife in her hand like a figure of Justice 
7220-77911-0030	train-other-500	Well I guess you no need to ask me a question like that Miss Kilburn I hain t obliged to make up to mister Peck though for what I done in the beginnin by condemnin everybuddy else without mercy now missus Bolton s eyes did not flash fire
7220-77911-0031	train-other-500	but they sent out an icy gleam that went as sharply to Annie s heart Bolton came in from feeding the horse and cow in the barn with a mealy tin pan in his hand from which came a mild subdued radiance like that of his countenance
7220-77911-0032	train-other-500	He was not sensible of arriving upon a dramatic moment and he said without noticing the attitude of either lady I see you walkin home with mister Putney Miss Kilburn What d he say You mean about mister Gerrish He thinks as we all do
7220-77911-0033	train-other-500	that it was a challenge to mister Peck s friends and that we must take it up A light of melancholy satisfaction shone from Bolton s deeply shaded eyes Well he ain t one to lose time not a great deal
none	none	 I presume he s goin to work 
7220-77911-0034	train-other-500	At once said Annie
none	none	 He says mister Gerrish will be sure to bring his grievance up at the next Society meeting 
7220-77911-0035	train-other-500	and we must be ready to meet him and out talk him and out vote him She reported these phrases from Putney s lips Well I guess if it was out talkin mister Putney wouldn t have much trouble about it And as far forth as votin goes I don t believe but what we can carry the day
7220-77911-0036	train-other-500	We couldn t said missus Bolton from the pantry
none	none	 where she had gone to put the bread away in its stone jar 
7220-77911-0037	train-other-500	if it was left to the church She accented the last word with the click of the jar lid and came out Well it ain t a church question It s a Society question missus Bolton replied on her passage to the dining room with the plate of sliced bread
7220-77911-0038	train-other-500	I can t make it seem right to have the minister a Society question Seems to me that the church members d ought have the say Well you can t make the discipline over to suit everybody said Bolton I presume it was ordered for a wise purpose
none	none	 Why land alive Oliver Bolton his wife shouted back from the remoteness to which his words had followed her 
7220-77911-0039	train-other-500	the statute provisions and rules of the Society wa n t ordered by Providence
none	none	 Well not directly as you may say said Bolton beginning high and lowering his voice as she rejoined them 
7220-77911-0040	train-other-500	but I presume the hearts of them that made them was moved missus Bolton could not combat a position of such unimpregnable piety in words but she permitted herself a contemptuous sniff and went on getting the things into the dining room
7220-77911-0041	train-other-500	And I guess it s all goin to work together for good I ain t afraid any but what it s goin to come out all right But we got to be up and doin as they say about lection times The Lord helps them that helps themselves said Bolton
7220-77911-0042	train-other-500	and then as if he felt the weakness of this position as compared with that of entire trust in Providence he winked his mild eyes and added if they re on the right side and put their faith in His promises
none	none	 Well your dinner s ready now missus Bolton said to Annie Idella had clung fast to Annie s hand 
7220-77911-0043	train-other-500	as Annie started toward the dining room she got before her and whispered vehemently What asked Annie bending down she laughed in lifting her head I promised Idella you d let us have some preserves to day missus Bolton missus Bolton smiled with grim pleasure
none	none	 I see all the while her mind was set on something She ain t one to let you forget your promises Well I guess if mister Peck had a little more of her disposition there wouldn t be much doubt about the way it would all come out Well you don t often see pairents take after their children said Bolton venturing a small joke No nor husbands after their wives either said missus Bolton sharply The more s the pity XXIV doctor Morrell came to see Annie late the next Wednesday evening I didn t know you d come back she said She returned to the rocking chair from which she came forward to greet him and he dropped into an easy seat near the table piled with books and sewing I didn t know it myself half an hour ago Really And is this your first visit I must be a very interesting case You are always How have you been I I hardly know whether I ve been at all she answered in mechanical parody of his own reply So many other things have been of so much more importance She let her eyes rest full upon his with a sense of returning comfort and safety in his presence and after a deep breath of satisfaction she asked How did you leave your mother Very much better entirely out of danger It s so odd to think of any one s having a family To me it seems the normal condition not to have any relatives Well we can t very well dispense with mothers said the doctor We have to begin with them at any rate Oh I don t object to them I only wonder at them They fell into a cosy and mutually interesting talk about their separate past and he gave her glimpses of the life simple and studious he had led before he went abroad She confessed to two mistakes in which she had mechanically persisted concerning him one that he came from Charlestown instead of Chelsea and the other that his first name was Joseph instead of James She did not own that she had always thought it odd he should be willing to remain in a place like Hatboro and that it must argue a strangely unambitious temperament in a man of his ability She diverted the impulse to a general satire of village life and ended by saying that she was getting to be a perfect villager herself He laughed and then How has Hatboro been getting along he asked Simply seething with excitement she answered But I should hardly know where to begin if I tried to tell you she added It seems such an age since I saw you Thank you said the doctor I didn t mean to be quite so flattering but you have certainly marked an epoch Really I don t know where to begin I wish you d seen somebody else first Ralph and Ellen or missus Wilmington I might go and see them now No stay now you re here though I know I shall not do justice to the situation But she was able to possess him of it with impartiality even with a little humour all the more because she was at heart intensely partisan and serious No one knows what mister Gerrish intends to do next He has kept quietly about his business and he told some of the ladies who tried to interview him that he was not prepared to talk about the course he had taken He doesn t seem to be ashamed of his behaviour and Ralph thinks that he s either satisfied with it and intends to let it stand as a protest or else he s going to strike another blow on the next business meeting But he s even kept missus Gerrish quiet and all we can do is to unite mister Peck s friends provisionally Ralph s devoted himself to that and he says he has talked forty eight hours to the day ever since Is he Yes perfectly I could hardly believe it when I saw him at church on Sunday It was like seeing one risen from the dead What he must have gone through and Ellen She told me how mister Peck had helped him in the struggle She attributes everything to him But of course you think he had nothing to do with it What makes you think that he asked Oh I don t know Wouldn t that naturally be the attitude of Science Toward religion Perhaps But I m not Science with a large S May be that s the reason why I left the case with mister Peck said the doctor smiling Putney didn t leave off my medicine did he He never got well so soon before They both say that I didn t think you could be so narrow minded doctor Morrell But of course your scientific bigotry couldn t admit the effect of the moral influence It would be too much like a miracle you would have to allow for a mystery I have to allow for a good many said the doctor The world is full of mysteries for me if you mean things that science hasn t explored yet But I hope that they ll all yield to the light and that somewhere there ll be light enough to clear up even the spiritual mysteries Do you really she demanded eagerly Then you believe in a life hereafter You believe in a moral government of the He retreated laughing from her ardent pursuit Oh I m not going to commit myself But I ll go so far as to say that I like to hear mister Peck preach and that I want him to stay I don t say he had nothing to do with Putney s straightening up Putney had a great deal to do with it himself What does he think mister Peck s chances are If mister Gerrish tries to get him dismissed He doesn t know he s quite in the dark He says the party of the perverse the people who think mister Gerrish must have had some good reason for his behaviour simply because they can t see any is unexpectedly large and it doesn t help matters with the more respectable people that the most respectable like mister Wilmington and Colonel Marvin are mister Peck s friends They think there must be something wrong if such good men are opposed to mister Gerrish And I suspect said doctor Morrell soberly that Putney s championship isn t altogether an advantage The people all concede his brilliancy and they are prouder of him on account of his infirmity but I guess they like to feel their superiority to him in practical matters They admire him but they don t want to follow him Oh I suppose so said Annie disconsolately And I imagine that mister Wilmington s course is attributed to Lyra and that doesn t help mister Peck much with the husbands of the ladies who don t approve of her The doctor tacitly declined to touch this delicate point He asked after a pause You ll be at the meeting I couldn t keep away But I ve no vote that s the worst I can only suffer in the cause The doctor smiled You must go too she added eagerly Oh I shall go I couldn t keep away either Besides I can vote How are you getting on with your little protegee Idella Well it isn t such a simple matter as I supposed quite Did you ever hear anything about her mother Nothing more than what every one has Why asked the doctor with scientific curiosity Do you find traits that the father doesn t account for Yes She is very vain and greedy and quick tempered Are those traits uncommon in children In such a degree I should think they were But she s very affectionate too and you can do anything with her through her love of praise She puzzles me a good deal I wish I knew something about her mother But mister Peck himself is a puzzle With all my respect for him and regard and admiration I can t help seeing that he s a very imperfect character Doctor Morrell laughed There s a great deal of human nature in man There isn t enough in mister Peck Annie retorted From the very first he has said things that have stirred me up and put me in a fever but he always seems to be cold and passive himself Perhaps he is cold said the doctor But has he any right to be so retorted Annie with certainly no coldness of her own Well I don t know I never thought of the right or wrong of a man s being what he was born Perhaps we might justly blame his ancestors Annie broke into a laugh at herself Of course But don t you think that a man who is able to put things as he does who can make you see for example the stupidity and cruelty of things that always seemed right and proper before don t you think that he s guilty of a kind of hypocrisy if he doesn t feel as well as see No I can t say that I do said the doctor with pleasure in the feminine excess of her demand And there are so many ways of feeling We re apt to think that our own way is the only way of course but I suppose that most philanthropists men who have done the most to better conditions have been people of cold temperaments and yet you can t say they are unfeeling No certainly Do you think mister Peck is a real philanthropist How you do get back to the personal always said doctor Morrell What makes you ask Because I can t understand his indifference to his child It seems to me that real philanthropy would begin at home But twice he has distinctly forgotten her existence and he always seems bored with it Or not that quite but she seems no more to him than any other child There s something very curious about all that said the doctor In most things the greater includes the less but in philanthropy it seems to exclude it If a man s heart is open to the whole world to all men it s shut sometimes against the individual even the nearest and dearest You see I m willing to admit all you can say against a rival practitioner Oh I understand said Annie But I m not going to gratify your spite At the same time she tacitly consented to the slight for mister Peck which their joking about him involved In such cases we excuse our disloyalty as merely temporary and intend to turn serious again and make full amends for it He made very short work she continued of that notion of yours that there could be any good feeling between the poor and the rich who had once been poor themselves Did I have any such notion as that She recalled the time and place of its expression to him and he said Oh yes Well He says that rich people like that are apt to be the hardest masters and are eager to forget they ever were poor and are only anxious to identify themselves with the rich doctor Morrell seemed to enjoy this immensely That does rather settle it he said recreantly She tried to be severe with him but she only kept on laughing and joking she was aware that he was luring her away from her seriousness missus Bolton brought in the lamp and set it on the library table showing her gaunt outline a moment against it before she left it to throw its softened light into the parlour where they sat The autumn moonshine almost as mellow fell in through the open windows which let in the shrilling of the crickets and grasshoppers and wafts of the warm night wind Does life Annie was asking at the end of half an hour seem more simple or more complicated as you live on That sounds awfully abstruse doesn t it And I don t know why I m always asking you abstruse things but I am Oh I don t mind it said the doctor Perhaps I haven t lived on long enough to answer this particular question I m only thirty six you know Only I m thirty one and I feel a hundred she broke in You don t look it But I believe I rather like abstruse questions You know Putney and I have discussed a great many But just what do you mean by this particular abstraction He took from the table a large ivory paper knife which he was in the habit of playing with in his visits and laid first one side and then the other side of its smooth cool blade in the palm of his left hand as he leaned forward with his elbows on his knees and bent his smiling eyes keenly upon her She stopped rocking herself and said imperatively Will you please put that back doctor Morrell This paper knife Yes And not look at me just in that way When you get that knife and that look I feel a little too much as if you were diagnosing me Diagnosticating suggested the doctor Is it I always supposed it was diagnosing But it doesn t matter It wasn t the name I was objecting to He put the knife back and changed his posture with a smile that left nothing of professional scrutiny in his look Very well then you shall diagnose yourself Diagnosticate please Oh I thought you preferred the other No it sounds undignified now that I know there s a larger word Where was I The personal bearing of the question whether life isn t more and more complicated How did you know it had a personal bearing I suspected as much Yes it has I mean that within the last four or five months since I ve been in Hatboro I seem to have lost my old point of view or rather I don t find it satisfactory any more I m ashamed to think of the simple plans or dreams that I came home with I hardly remember what they were but I must have expected to be a sort of Lady Bountiful here and now I think a Lady Bountiful one of the most mischievous persons that could infest any community You don t mean that charity is played out asked the doctor In the old fashioned way yes But they say poverty is on the increase What is to be done Justice said Annie Those who do most of the work in the world ought to share in its comforts as a right and not be put off with what we idlers have a mind to give them from our superfluity as a grace Yes that s all very true But what till justice is done Oh we must continue to do charity cried Annie with self contempt that amused him But don t you see how much more complicated it is That s what I meant by life not being simple any more It was easy enough to do charity when it used to seem the right and proper remedy for suffering but now when I can t make it appear a finality but only something provisional temporary Don t you see Yes I see But I don t see how you re going to help it At the same time I ll allow that it makes life more difficult For a moment they were both serious and silent Then she said Sometimes I think the fault is all in myself and that if I were not so sophisticated and and selfish I should find the old way of doing good just as effective and natural as ever Then again I think the conditions are all wrong and that we ought to be fairer to people and then we needn t be so good to them I should prefer that I hate being good to people I don t like and I can t like people who don t interest me I think I must be very hard hearted The doctor laughed at this Oh I know said Annie I know the fraudulent reputation I ve got for good works Your charity to tramps is the opprobrium of Hatboro the doctor consented Oh I don t mind that It s easy when people ask you for food or money but the horrible thing is when they ask you for work Think of me who never did anything to earn a cent in my life being humbly asked by a fellow creature to let him work for something to eat and drink It s hideous It s abominable At first I used to be flattered by it and try to conjure up something for them to do and to believe that I was helping the deserving poor Now I give all of them money and tell them that they needn t even pretend to work for it I don t work for my money and I don t see why they should They d find that an unanswerable argument if you put it to them said the doctor He reached out his hand for the paper cutter and then withdrew it in a way that made her laugh But the worst of it is she resumed that I don t love any of the people that I help or hurt whichever it is I did feel remorseful toward missus Savor for a while but I didn t love her and I knew that I only pitied myself through her Don t you see No I don t said the doctor You don t because you re too polite The only kind of creature that I can have any sympathy with is some little wretch like Idella who is perfectly selfish and naughty every way but seems to want me to like her and a reprobate like Lyra or some broken creature like poor Ralph I think there s something in the air the atmosphere that won t allow you to live in the old way if you ve got a grain of conscience or humanity I don t mean that I have But it seems to me as if the world couldn t go on as it has been doing Even here in America where I used to think we had the millennium because slavery was abolished people have more liberty but they seem just as far off as ever from justice That is what paralyses me and mocks me and laughs in my face when I remember how I used to dream of doing good after I came home I had better stayed at Rome The doctor said vaguely I m glad you didn t and he let his eyes dwell on her with a return of the professional interest which she was too lost in her self reproach to be able to resent I blame myself for trying to excuse my own failure on the plea that things generally have gone wrong At times it seems to me that I m responsible for having lost my faith in what I used to think was the right thing to do and then again it seems as if the world were all so bad that no real good could be done in the old way and that my faith is gone because there s nothing for it to rest on any longer I feel that something must be done but I don t know what It would be hard to say said the doctor She perceived that her exaltation amused him but she was too much in earnest to care Then we are guilty all guilty till we find out and begin to do it If the world has come to such a pass that you can t do anything but harm in it Oh is it so bad as that he protested It s quite as bad she insisted Just see what mischief I ve done since I came back to Hatboro I took hold of that miserable Social Union because I was outside of all the life about me and it seemed my only chance of getting into it and I ve done more harm by it in one summer than I could undo in a lifetime Just think of poor mister Brandreth s love affair with Miss Chapley broken off and Lyra s lamentable triumph over Miss Northwick and missus Munger s duplicity and Ralph s escapade all because I wanted to do good A note of exaggeration had begun to prevail in her self upbraiding which was real enough and the time came for him to suggest I think you re a little morbid Miss Kilburn Morbid Of course I am But that doesn t alter the fact that everything is wrong does it Everything Why you don t pretend yourself do you that everything is right A true American ought to do so oughtn t he teased the doctor One mustn t be a bad citizen But if you were a bad citizen she persisted Oh then I might agree with you on some points But I shouldn t say such things to my patients Miss Kilburn It would be a great comfort to them if you did she sighed The doctor broke out in a laugh of delight at her perfervid concentration Oh no no They re mostly nervous women and it would be the death of them if they understood me In fact what s the use of brooding upon such ideas We can t hurry any change but we can make ourselves uncomfortable Why should I be comfortable she asked with a solemnity that made him laugh again Why shouldn t you be Yes that s what I often ask myself But I can t be she said sadly They had risen and he looked at her with his professional interest now openly dominant as he stood holding her hand I m going to send you a little more of that tonic Miss Kilburn She pulled her hand away No I shall not take any more medicine You think everything is physical Why don t you ask at once to see my tongue He went out laughing and she stood looking wistfully at the door he had passed through XXV The bell on the orthodox church called the members of mister Peck s society together for the business meeting with the same plangent lacerant note that summoned them to worship on Sundays Among those who crowded the house were many who had not been there before and seldom in any place of the kind There were admirers of Putney workmen of rebellious repute and of advanced opinions on social and religious questions nonsuited plaintiffs and defendants of shady record for whom he had at one time or another done what he could A good number of the summer folk from South Hatboro were present with the expectation of something dramatic which every one felt and every one hid with the discipline that subdues the outside of life in a New England town to a decorous passivity At the appointed time mister Peck rose to open the meeting with prayer then as if nothing unusual were likely to come before it he declared it ready to proceed to business Some people who had been gathering in the vestibule during his prayer came in and the electric globes which had been recently hung above the pulpit and on the front of the gallery in substitution of the old gas chandelier shed their moony glare upon a house in which few places were vacant mister Gerrish sitting erect and solemn beside his wife in their pew shared with the minister and Putney the tacit interest of the audience He permitted the transaction of several minor affairs and mister Peck as Moderator conducted the business with his habitual exactness and effect of far off impersonality The people waited with exemplary patience and Putney who lounged in one corner of his pew gave no more sign of excitement with his chin sunk in his rumpled shirt front than his sad faced wife at the other end of the seat mister Gerrish rose with the air of rising in his own good time and said with dry pomp mister Moderator I have prepared a resolution which I will ask you to read to this meeting He held up a paper as he spoke and then passed it to the minister who opened and read it Whereas It is indispensable to the prosperity and well being of any and every organisation and especially of a Christian church that the teachings of its minister be in accord with the convictions of a majority of its members upon vital questions of eternal interest with the end and aim of securing the greatest efficiency of that body in the community as an example and a shining light before men to guide their steps in the strait and narrow path therefore Resolved That a committee of this society be appointed to inquire if such is the case in the instance of the reverend Julius W Peck and be instructed to report upon the same A satisfied expectation expressed itself in the silence that followed the reading of the paper whatever pain and shame were mixed with the satisfaction If the contempt of kindly usage shown in offering such a resolution without warning or private notice to the minister shocked many by its brutality still it was satisfactory to find that mister Gerrish had intended to seize the first chance of airing his grievance as everybody had said he would do mister Peck looked up from the paper and across the intervening pews at mister Gerrish Do I understand that you move the adoption of this resolution Why certainly sir said mister Gerrish with an accent of supercilious surprise You did not say so said the minister gently Does any one second Brother Gerrish s motion A murmur of amusement followed mister Peck s reminder to mister Gerrish and an ironical voice called out mister Moderator mister Putney I think it important that the sense of the meeting should be taken on the question the resolution raises I therefore second the motion for its adoption Putney sat down and the murmur now broadened into something like a general laugh hushed as with a sudden sense of the impropriety mister Gerrish had gradually sunk into his seat but now he rose again and when the minister formally announced the motion before the meeting he called sharply mister Moderator Brother Gerrish responded the minister in recognition I wish to offer a few remarks in support of the resolution which I have had the honour the duty I would say of laying before this meeting He jerked his head forward at the last word and slid the fingers of his right hand into the breast of his coat like an orator and stood very straight I have no desire sir to make this the occasion of a personal question between myself and my pastor But sir the question has been forced upon me against my will and my my consent and I was obliged on the last ensuing Sabbath when I sat in this place to enter my public protest against it Sir I came into this community a poor boy without a penny in my pocket and unaided and alone and by my own exertions I have built up one of the business interests of the place I will not stoop to boast of the part I have taken in the prosperity of this place but I will say that no public object has been wanting that my support has not been wanting from the first proposition to concrete the sidewalks of this village to the introduction of city waterworks and an improved system of drainage and er electric lighting So much for my standing in a public capacity As for my business capacity I would gladly let that speak for itself if that capacity had not been turned in the sanctuary itself against the personal reputation which every man holds dearer than life itself and which has had a deadly blow aimed at it through that that very capacity Sir I have established in this town a business which I may humbly say that in no other place of the same numerical size throughout the commonwealth will you find another establishment so nearly corresponding to the wants and the er facilities of a great city In no other establishment in a place of the same importance will you find the interests and the demands and the necessities of the whole community so carefully considered In no other Putney got upon his feet and called out mister Moderator will Brother Gerrish allow me to ask him a single question mister Peck put the request and mister Gerrish involuntarily made a pause in which Putney pursued My question is simply this doesn t Brother Gerrish think it would help us to get at the business in hand sooner if he would print the rest of his advertisement in the Hatboro Register A laugh broke out all over the house as Putney dropped back into his seat mister Gerrish stood apparently undaunted I will attend to you presently sir he said with a schoolmasterly authority which made an impression in his favour with some And I thank the gentleman he continued turning again to address the minister for recalling me from a side issue As he acknowledges in the suggestion which he intended to wound my feelings but I can assure him that my self respect is beyond the reach of slurs and innuendoes I care little for them I care not what quarter they originate from or have their their origin and still less when they spring from a source notoriously incompetent and unworthy to command the respect of this community which has abused all its privileges and trampled the forbearance of its fellow citizens under foot until it has become a a byword in this place sir Putney sprang up again with mister Moderator No sir no sir pursued Gerrish I will not submit to your interruptions I have the floor and I intend to keep it I intend to challenge a full and fearless scrutiny of my motives in this matter and I intend to probe those motives in others Why do we find sir on the one side of this question as its most active exponent a man outside of the church in organising a force within this society to antagonise the most cherished convictions of that church We do not asperse his motives but we ask if these motives coincide with the relations which a Christian minister should sustain to his flock as expressed in the resolution which I have had the privilege to offer more in sorrow than in anger Putney made some starts to rise but quelled himself and finally sank back with an air of ironical patience Gerrish s personalities had turned public sentiment in his favour Colonel Marvin came over to Putney s pew and shook hands with him before sitting down by his side He began to talk with him in whisper while Gerrish went on But on the other hand sir what do we see I will not allude to myself in this connection but I am well aware sir that I represent a large and growing majority of this church in the stand I have taken We are tired sir and I say it to you openly sir what has been bruited about in secret long enough of having what I may call a one sided gospel preached in this church and from this pulpit We enter our protest against the neglect of very essential elements of Christianity not to say the essential the representation of Christ as a a spirit as well as a life Understand me sir we do not object neither I nor any of those who agree with me to the preaching of Christ as a life That is all very well in its place and it is the wish of every true Christian to conform and adapt his own life as far as as circumstances will permit of But when I come to this sanctuary and they come Sabbath after Sabbath and hear nothing said of my Redeemer as a means of salvation and nothing of Him crucified and when I find the precious promises of the gospel ignored and neglected continually and and all the time and each discourse from yonder pulpit filled up with generalities glittering generalities as has been well said by another in relation to and connection with mere conduct I am disappointed sir and dissatisfied and I feel to protest against that line of of preaching During the last six months Sabbath after Sabbath I have listened in vain for the ministrations of the plain gospel and the tenets under which we have been blessed as a church and as a people Instead of this I have heard as I have said and I repeat it without fear of contradiction nothing but one idea appeals and mere moralisings upon duty to others which a child and the veriest tyro could not fail therein and I have culminated or rather it has been culminated to me in a covert attack upon my private affairs and my way of conducting my private business in a manner which I could not overlook For that reason and for the reasons which I have recapitulated and I challenge the closest scrutiny I felt it my duty to enter my public protest and to leave this sanctuary where I have worshipped ever since it was erected with my family And I now urge the adoption of the foregoing resolution because I believe that your usefulness has come to an end to the vast majority of the constituent members of this church and and that is all mister Gerrish stopped so abruptly that Putney who was engaged in talk with Colonel Marvin looked up with a startled air too late to secure the floor mister Peck recognised mister Gates who stood with his wrists caught in either hand across his middle and looked round with a quizzical glance before he began to speak Putney lifted his hand in playful threatening toward Colonel Marvin who got away from him with a face of noiseless laughter and went and joined mister Wilmington where he sat with his wife who entered into the talk between the men mister Moderator said Gates I don t know as I expected to take part in this debate but you can t always tell what s going to happen to you even if you re only a member of the church by marriage as you might say I presume though that I have a right to speak in a meeting like this because I am a member of the society in my own right and I ve got its interests at heart as much as any one I don t know but what I got the interests of Hatboro at heart too but I can t be certain sometimes you can t sometimes you think you ve got the common good in view and you come to look a little closer and you find it s the uncommon good that is to say it s not so much the public weal you re after as what it is the private weal But that s neither here nor there I haven t got anything to say against identifying yourself with things in general I don t know but what it s a good way all is it s apt to make you think you re personally attacked when nobody is meant in particular I think that s what s partly the matter with Brother Gerrish here I heard that sermon and I didn t suppose there was anything in it to hurt any one especially and I was consid ably surprised to see that mister Gerrish seemed to take it to himself somehow and worry over it but I didn t really know just what the trouble was till he explained here tonight All I was thinking was when it come to that about large commerce devouring the small sort of lean and fat kine I wished Jordan and Marsh could hear that or Stewart s in New York or Wanamaker s in Philadelphia I never thought of Brother Gerrish once and I don t presume one out of a hundred did either I The electric light immediately over Gates s head began to hiss and sputter and to suffer the sort of syncope which overtakes electric lights at such times and to leave the house in darkness Gates waited standing till it revived and then added I guess I hain t got anything more to say mister Moderator If I had it s gone from me now I m more used to speaking by kerosene and I always lose my breath when an electric light begins that way Putney was on his legs in good time now and secured recognition before mister Wilmington who made an effort to catch the moderator s eye Gates had put the meeting in good humoured expectation of what they might now have from Putney They liked Gates s points very well but they hoped from Putney something more cruel and unsparing and the greater part of those present must have shared his impatience with mister Wilmington s request that he would give way to him for a moment Yet they all probably felt the same curiosity about what was going forward for it was plain that mister Wilmington and Colonel Marvin were conniving at the same point Marvin had now gone to mister Gerrish and had slipped into the pew beside him with the same sort of hand shake he had given Putney Will my friend mister Putney give way to me for a moment asked mister Wilmington I don t see why I should do that said Putney I assure him that I will not abuse his courtesy and that I will yield the floor to him at any moment Putney hesitated a moment and then with the contented laugh of one who securely bides his time said Go ahead It is simply this said mister Wilmington with a certain formal neatness of speech The point has been touched by the last speaker which I think suggested itself to all who heard the remarks of Brother Gerrish in support of his resolution and the point is simply this whether he has not misapplied the words of the discourse by which he felt himself aggrieved and whether he has not given them a particular bearing foreign to the intention of their author If as I believe this is the case the whole matter can be easily settled by a private conference between the parties and we can be saved the public appearance of disagreement in our society And I would now ask Brother Gerrish in behalf of many who take this view with me whether he will not consent to reconsider the matter and whether in order to arrive at the end proposed he will not for the present at least withdraw the resolution he has offered mister Wilmington sat down amidst a general sensation which was heightened by Putney s failure to anticipate any action on Gerrish s part Gerrish rapidly finished something he was saying to Colonel Marvin and then half rose and said mister Moderator I withdraw my resolution for the time being and for the present sir and sat down again mister Moderator Putney called sharply from his place this is altogether unparliamentary That resolution is properly before the meeting Its adoption has been moved and seconded and it cannot be withdrawn without leave granted by a vote of the meeting I wish to discuss the resolution in all its bearings and I think there are a great many present who share with me a desire to know how far it represents the sense of this society I don t mean as to the supposed personal reflections which it was intended to punish that is a very small matter and as compared with the other questions involved of no consequence whatever Putney tossed his head with insolent pleasure in his contempt of Gerrish His nostrils swelled and he closed his little jaws with a firmness that made his heavy black moustache hang down below the corners of his chin He went on with a wicked twinkle in his eye and a look all round to see that people were waiting to take his next point I judge my old friend Brother Gerrish by myself My old friend Gerrish cares no more really about personal allusions than I do What he really had at heart in offering his resolution was not any supposed attack upon himself or his shop from the pulpit of this church He cared no more for that than I should care for a reference to my notorious habits These are things that we feel may be safely left to the judgment the charitable judgment of the community which will be equally merciful to the man who devours widows houses and to the man who puts an enemy in his mouth to steal away his brains mister Moderator said Colonel Marvin getting upon his feet No sir shouted Putney fiercely I can t allow you to speak Wait till I get done He stopped and then said gently Excuse me Colonel I really must go on I m speaking now in behalf of Brother Gerrish and he doesn t like to have the speaking on his side interrupted Oh all right said Colonel Marvin amiably go on What my old friend William Gerrish really designed in offering that resolution was to bring into question the kind of Christianity which has been preached in this place by our pastor the one sided gospel as he aptly called it and what he and I want to get at is the opinion of the society on that question Has the gospel preached to us here been one sided or hasn t it Brother Gerrish says it has and Brother Gerrish as I understand doesn t change his mind on that point if he does on any in asking to withdraw his resolution He doesn t expect mister Peck to convince him in a private conference that he has been preaching an all round gospel I don t contend that he has but I suppose I m not a very competent judge I don t propose to give you the opinion of one very fallible and erring man and I don t set myself up in judgment of others but I think it s important for all parties concerned to know what the majority of this society think on a question involving its future That importance must excuse if anything can excuse the apparent want of taste of humanity of decency in proposing the inquiry at a meeting over which the person chiefly concerned would naturally preside unless he were warned to absent himself Nobody cares for the contemptible point the wholly insignificant question whether allusion to mister Gerrish s variety store was intended or not What we are all anxious to know is whether he represents any considerable portion of this society in his general attack upon its pastor I want a vote on that and I move the previous question No one stopped to inquire whether this was parliamentary or not Putney sat down and Colonel Marvin rose to say that if a vote was to be taken it was only right and just that mister Peck should somehow be heard in his own behalf and half a dozen voices from all parts of the church supported him mister Peck after a moment said I think I have nothing to say and he added Shall I put the question Question Question came from different quarters It is moved and seconded that the resolution before the meeting be adopted said the minister formally All those in favour will say ay He waited for a distinct space but there was no response mister Gerrish himself did not vote The minister proceeded Those opposed will say no The word burst forth everywhere and it was followed by laughter and inarticulate expressions of triumph and mocking Order order called the minister gravely and he announced The noes have it The electric light began to suffer another syncope When it recovered with the usual fizzing and sputtering mister Peck was on his feet asking to be relieved from his duties as moderator so that he might make a statement to the meeting Colonel Marvin was voted into the chair but refused formally to take possession of it He stood up and said There is no place where we would rather hear you than in that pulpit mister Peck I thank you said the minister making himself heard through the approving murmur but I stand in this place only to ask to be allowed to leave it The friendly feeling which has been expressed toward me in the vote upon the resolution you have just rejected is all that reconciles me to its defeat Its adoption might have spared me a duty which I find painful But perhaps it is best that I should discharge it As to the sermon which called forth that resolution it is only just to say that I intended no personalities in it and I humbly entreat any one who felt himself aggrieved to believe me Every one looked at Gerrish to see how he took this he must have felt it the part of self respect not to change countenance My desire in that discourse was as always to present the truth as I had seen it and try to make it a help to all But I am by no means sure that the author of the resolution was wrong in arraigning me before you for neglecting a very vital part of Christianity in my ministrations here I think with him that those who have made an open profession of Christ have a claim to the consolation of His promises and to the support which good men have found in the mysteries of faith and I ask his patience and that of others who feel that I have not laid sufficient stress upon these My shortcoming is something that I would not have you overlook in any survey of my ministry among you and I am not here now to defend that ministry in any point of view As I look back over it by the light of the one ineffable ideal it seems only a record of failure and defeat He stopped and a sympathetic dissent ran through the meeting There have been times when I was ready to think that the fault was not in me but in my office in the church in religion We all have these moments of clouded vision in which we ourselves loom up in illusory grandeur above the work we have failed to do But it is in no such error that I stand before you now Day after day it has been borne in upon me that I had mistaken my work here and that I ought if there was any truth in me to turn from it for reasons which I will give at length should I be spared to preach in this place next Sabbath I should have willingly acquiesced if our parting had come in the form of my dismissal at your hands Yet I cannot wholly regret that it has not taken that form and that in offering my resignation as I shall formally do to those empowered by the rules of our society to receive it I can make it a means of restoring concord among you It would be affectation in me to pretend that I did not know of the dissension which has had my ministry for its object if not its cause and I earnestly hope that with my withdrawal that dissension may cease and that this church may become a symbol before the world of the peace of Christ I conjure such of my friends as have been active in my behalf to unite with their brethren in a cause which can alone merit their devotion Above all things I beseech you to be at peace one with another Forbear forgive submit remembering that strife for the better part can only make it the worse and that for Christians there can be no rivalry but in concession and self sacrifice Colonel Marvin forgot his office and all parliamentary proprieties in the tide of emotion that swept over the meeting when the minister sat down I am glad he said that no sort of action need be taken now upon mister Peck s proposed resignation which I for one cannot believe this society will ever agree to accept Others echoed his sentiment they spoke out sitting and standing and addressed themselves to no one till Putney moved an adjournment which Colonel Marvin sufficiently recollected himself to put to a vote and declare carried Annie walked home with the Putneys and doctor Morrell She was aware of something unwholesome in the excitement which ran so wholly in mister Peck s favour but abandoned herself to it with feverish helplessness Ah h h cried Putney when they were free of the crowd which pressed upon him with questions and conjectures and comments What a slump what a slump That blessed short legged little seraph has spoilt the best sport that ever was Why he s sent that fool of a Gerrish home with the conviction that he was right in the part of his attack that was the most vilely hypocritical and he s given that heartless scoundrel the pleasure of feeling like an honest man I should like to rap mister Peck s head up against the back of his pulpit and I should like to knock the skulls of Colonel Marvin and mister Wilmington together and see which was the thickest Why I had Gerrish fairly by the throat at last and I was just reaching for the balm of Gilead with my other hand to give him a dose that would have done him for one while Ah it s too bad too bad Well well But haw haw haw didn t Gerrish tangle himself up beautifully in his rhetoric I guess we shall fix Brother Gerrish yet and I don t think we shall let Brother Peck off without a tussle I m going to try print on Brother Gerrish I m going to ask him in the Hatboro Register he doesn t advertise and the editor s as independent as a lion where a man don t advertise Indeed he s not going to do anything of the kind Annie said missus Putney I shall not let him I shall make him drop the whole affair now and let it die out and let us be at peace again as mister Peck says There seemed to be a good deal of sense in that part of it said doctor Morrell I don t know but he was right to propose himself as a peace offering perhaps there s no other way out Well said missus Putney whether he goes or stays I think we owe him that much Don t you Annie Oh yes sighed Annie from the exaltation to which the events of the evening had borne her And we mustn t let him go It would be a loss that every one would feel that I m tired of this fighting missus Putney broke in and I think it s ruining Ralph every way He hasn t slept the last two nights and he s been all in a quiver for the last fortnight For my part I don t care what happens now I m not going to have Ralph mixed up in it any more I think we ought all to forgive and forget I m willing to overlook everything and I believe others are the same You d better ask missus Gerrish the next time she calls Putney interposed missus Putney stopped and took her hand from her husband s arm Well after what mister Gerrish said to night about you I don t think Emmeline had better call very soon Ha ha ha Ha ha ha shrieked Putney and his laugh flapped back at them in derisive echo from the house front they were passing I guess Brother Peck had better stay and help fight it out It won t be all brotherly love after he goes or sisterly either XXVI Annie knew from the light in the kitchen window that missus Bolton who had not gone to the meeting was there and she inferred from the silence of the house that Bolton had not yet come home She went up to her room and after a glance at Idella asleep in her crib she began to lay off her things Then she sat down provisionally by the open window and looked out into the still autumnal night The air was soft and humid with a scent of smoke in it from remote forest fires The village lights showed themselves dimmed by the haze that thickened the moonless dark She heard steps on the gravel of the lane and then two men talking one of whom she knew to be Bolton In a little while the back entry door was opened and shut and after a brief murmur of voices in the library missus Bolton knocked on the door jamb of the room where Annie sat What is it missus Bolton You in bed yet No I m here by the window What is it Well I don t know but what you ll think it s pretty late for callers but mister Peck is down in the library I guess he wants to speak with you about Idella I told him he better see you I will come right down She followed missus Bolton to the foot of the stairs where she kept on to the kitchen while Annie turned into the library mister Peck stood beside her father s desk resting one hand on it and holding his hat in the other Won t you be seated mister Peck I thank you It s only for a moment I am going away to morrow and I wish to speak with you about Idella Yes certainly But surely you are not going to leave Hatboro mister Peck I hoped we all did that after what you had seen of the strong feeling in your favour to night you would reconsider your determination and stay with us She went on impetuously You must know you must understand now how much good you can do here more than any one else more than you could do anywhere else I don t believe that you realise how much depends upon your staying here You can t stop the dissensions by going away it will only make them worse You saw how Colonel Marvin and mister Wilmington were with you and mister Gates all classes I oughtn t to speak to attempt to teach you your duty I m not of your church and I can only tell you how it seems to me that you never can find another place where your principles your views He waited for her to go on but she really had nothing more to say and he began I am not hoping for another charge elsewhere at least not for the present but I am satisfied that my usefulness here is at an end and I do not think that my going away will make matters worse Whether I go or stay the dissensions will continue At any rate I believe that there are those who need help more and whom I can help more in another field Yes she broke in with a woman s relevancy to the immediate point there is nothing to do here He went on as if she had not spoken I am going to Fall River to morrow where I have heard that there is work for me In the mills she exclaimed recurring in thought to what he had once said of his work in them Surely you don t mean that The sight the smell the tumult of the work she had seen that day in the mill with Lyra came upon her with all their offence To throw away all that you have learnt all that you have become to others I am less and less confident that I have become anything useful to others in turning aside from the life of toil and presuming to attempt the guidance of those who remained in it But I don t mean work in the mills he continued or not at first or not unless it seems necessary to my work with those who work in them I have a plan or if it hardly deserves that name a design of being useful to them in such ways as my own experience of their life in the past shall show me in the light of what I shall see among them now I needn t trouble you with it Oh yes she interposed I do not expect to preach at once but only to teach in one of the public schools where I have heard of a vacancy and and perhaps otherwise With those whose lives are made up of hard work there must be room for willing and peaceful service And if it should be necessary that I should work in the mills in order to render this then I will do so but at present I have another way in view a social way that shall bring me into immediate relations with the people She still tried to argue with him to prove him wrong in going away but they both ended where they began He would not or could not explain himself further At last he said But I did not come to urge this matter I have no wish to impose my will my theory upon any one even my own child Oh yes Idella Annie broke in anxiously You will leave her with me mister Peck won t you You don t know how much I m attached to her I see her faults and I shall not spoil her Leave her with me at least till you see your way clear to having her with you and then I will send her to you A trouble showed itself in his face ordinarily so impassive and he seemed at a loss how to answer her but he said I appreciate your kindness to her but I shall not ask you to be at the inconvenience longer than till to morrow I have arranged with another to take her until I am settled and then bring her to me Annie sat intensely searching his face with her lips parted to speak Another she said and the wounded feeling the resentment of his insensibility to her good will that mingled in her heart must have made itself felt in her voice for he went on reluctantly It is a family in which she will be brought up to work and to be helpful to herself They will join me with her You know the mother she has lost her own child missus Savor At the name Annie s spirit fell the tears started from her eyes Yes she must have her It is just it is the only expiation Don t you remember that it was I who sent missus Savor s baby to the sea shore where it died No I had forgotten said the minister aghast I am sorry It doesn t matter said Annie lifelessly it had to be After a pause she asked quietly If missus Savor is going to work in the mills how can she make a home for the child She is not going into the mills he answered She will keep house for us all and we hope to have others who are without homes of their own join us in paying the expenses and doing the work so that all may share its comfort without gain to any one upon their necessity of food and shelter She did not heed his explanation but suddenly entreated Let me go with you I will not be a trouble to you and I will help as well as I can I can t give the child up Why why the thought crazy as it would have once seemed was now such a happy solution of the trouble that she smiled hopefully why shouldn t I go with mister and missus Savor and help to make a home for Idella there You will need money to begin your work I will give you mine I will give it up I will give it all up I will give it to any good object that you approve or you may have it to do what you think best with and I will go with Idella and I will work in the mills there or anything He shook his head and for the first time in their acquaintance he seemed to feel compassion for her It isn t possible I couldn t take your money I shouldn t know what to do with it You know what to do with your own she broke in You do good with that I m afraid I do harm with it too he returned It s only a little but little as it has been I can no longer meet the responsibility it brings But if you took my money she urged you could devote your life to preaching the truth to writing and publishing books and all that and so could others don t you see He shook his head Perhaps others but I have done with preaching for the present Later I may have something to say Now I feel sure of nothing not even of what I ve been saying here Will you send for Idella When she goes with the Savors I will come too He looked at her sorrowfully I think you are a good woman and you mean what you say But I am sorry you say it if any words of mine have caused you to say it for I know you cannot do it Even for me it is hard to go back to those associations and for you they would be impossible You will see she returned with exaltation I will take Idella to the Savors to morrow or no I ll have them come here He stood looking at her in perplexity At last he asked Could I see the child Certainly said Annie with the lofty passion that possessed her and she led him up into the chamber where Idella lay sleeping in Annie s own crib He stood beside it gazing long at the little one from whose eyes he shaded the lamp Then he said I thank you and turned away She followed him down stairs and at the door she said You think I will not come but I will come Don t you believe that He turned sadly from her You might come but you couldn t stay You don t know what it is you can t imagine it and you couldn t bear it I will come and I will stay she answered and when he was gone she fell into one of those intense reveries of hers a rapture in which she prefigured what should happen in that new life before her At its end mister Peck stood beside her grave reading the lesson of her work to the multitude of grateful and loving poor who thronged to pay the last tribute to her memory Putney was there with his wife and Lyra regretful of her lightness and missus Munger repentant of her mendacities They talked together in awe stricken murmurs of the noble career just ended She heard their voices and then she began to ask herself what they would really say of her proposing to go to Fall River with the Savors and be a mill hand XXVII Annie did not sleep After lying a long time awake she took some of the tonic that doctor Morrell had left her upon the chance that it might quiet her but it did no good She dressed herself and sat by the window till morning The breaking day showed her purposes grotesque and monstrous The revulsion that must come came with a tide that swept before it all prepossessions all affections It seemed as if the child still asleep in her crib had heard what she said and would help to hold her to her word She choked down a crust of bread with the coffee she drank at breakfast and instead of romping with Idella at her bath she dressed the little one silently and sent her out to missus Bolton Then she sat down again in the sort of daze in which she had spent the night and as the day passed her revolt from what she had pledged herself to do mounted and mounted It was like the sort of woman she was not to think of any withdrawal from her pledges they were all the more sacred with her because they had been purely voluntary insistent the fact that they had been refused made them the more obligatory She thought some one would come to break in upon the heavy monotony of the time she expected Ralph or Ellen or at least Lyra but she only saw missus Bolton and heard her about her work Sometimes the child stole back from the kitchen or the barn and peeped in upon her with a roguish expectance which her gloomy stare defeated and then it ran off again She lay down in the afternoon and tried to sleep but her brain was inexorably alert and she lay making inventory of all the pleasant things she was to leave for that ugly fate she had insisted on A swarm of fancies gave every detail of the parting dramatic intensity Amidst the poignancy of her regrets her shame for her recreancy was sharper still By night she could bear it no longer It was doctor Morrell s custom to come nearly every night but she was afraid because he had walked home with her from the meeting the night before he might not come now and she sent for him It was in quality of medicine man as well as physician that she wished to see him she meant to tell him all that had passed with mister Peck and this was perfectly easy in the interview she forecast but at the sound of his buggy wheels in the lane a thought came that seemed to forbid her even to speak of mister Peck to him For the first time it occurred to her that the minister might have inferred a meaning from her eagerness and persistence infinitely more preposterous than even the preposterous letter of her words A number of little proofs of the conjecture flashed upon her his anxiety to get away from her his refusal to let her believe in her own constancy of purpose his moments of bewilderment and dismay It needed nothing but this to add the touch of intolerable absurdity to the horror of the whole affair and to snatch the last hope of help from her She let missus Bolton go to the door and she did not rise to meet the doctor she saw from his smile that he knew he had a moral rather than a physical trouble to deal with but she did not relax the severity of her glare in sympathy as she was tempted from some infinite remoteness to do When he said You re not well she whispered solemnly back Not at all He did not pursue his inquiry into her condition but said with an irrelevant cheerfulness that piqued her I was coming here this evening at any rate and I got your message on the way up from my office You are very kind she said a little more audibly I wanted to tell you he went on of what a time Putney and I have had to day working up public sentiment for mister Peck so as to keep him here Annie did not change her position but the expression of her glance changed We ve been round in the enemy s camp everywhere and I ve committed Gerrish himself to an armed neutrality That wasn t difficult The difficulty was in another quarter with mister Peck himself He s more opposed than any one else to his stay in Hatboro You know he intended going away this morning Did he Annie asked dishonestly The question obliged her to say something Yes He came to Putney before breakfast to thank him and take leave of him and to tell him of the plan he had for Imagine what I don t know said Annie hoarsely after an effort as if the untruth would not come easily I am worse than missus Munger she thought For going to Fall River to teach school among the mill hands children And to open a night school for the hands themselves The doctor waited for her sensation and in its absence he looked so disappointed that she was forced to say To teach school Then he went on briskly again Yes Putney laboured with him on his knees so to speak and got him to postpone his going till to morrow morning and then he came to me for help We enlisted missus Wilmington in the cause and we ve spent the day working up the Peck sentiment to a fever heat It s been a very queer campaign three Gentiles toiling for a saint against the elect and bringing them all over at last We ve got a paper signed by a large majority of the members of the church the church not the society asking mister Peck to remain and Putney s gone to him with the paper and he s coming round here to report mister Peck s decision We all agreed that it wouldn t do to say anything about his plan for the future and I fancy some of his people signed our petition under the impression that they were keeping a valuable man out of another pulpit Annie accompanied the doctor s words which she took in to the last syllable with a symphony of conjecture as to how the change in mister Peck s plans if they prevailed with him would affect her and the doctor had not ceased to speak before she perceived that it would be deliverance perfect and complete however inglorious But the tacit drama so vividly preoccupied her with its minor questions of how to descend to this escape with dignity that still she did not speak and he took up the word again I confess I ve had my misgivings about mister Peck and about his final usefulness in a community like this In spite of all that Putney can say of his hard headedness I m afraid that he s a good deal of a dreamer But I gave way to Putney and I hope you ll appreciate what I ve done for your favourite You are very good she said in mechanical acknowledgment her mind was set so strenuously to break from her dishonest reticence that she did not know really what she was saying Why why do you call him a dreamer She cast about in that direction at random Why Well for one thing the reason he gave Putney for giving up his luxuries here that as long as there was hardship and overwork for underpay in the world he must share them It seems to me that I might as well say that as long as there were dyspepsia and rheumatism in the world I must share them Then he has a queer notion that he can go back and find instruction in the working men that they alone have the light and the truth and know the meaning of life I don t say anything against them My observation and my experience is that if others were as good as they are in the ratio of their advantages mister Peck needn t go to them for his ideal But their conditions warp and dull them they see things askew and they don t see them clearly I might as well expose myself to the small pox in hopes of treating my fellow sufferers more intelligently She could not perceive where his analogies rang false they only overwhelmed her with a deeper sense of her own folly But I don t know he went on that a dreamer is such a desperate character if you can only keep him from trying to realise his dreams and if mister Peck consents to stay in Hatboro perhaps we can manage it He drew his chair a little toward the lounge where she reclined and asked with the kindliness that was both personal and professional What seems to be the matter She started up There is nothing nothing that medicine can help Why do you call him my favourite she demanded violently But you have wasted your time If he had made up his mind to what you say he would never give it up never in the world she added hysterically If you ve interfered between any one and his duty in this world where it seems as if hardly any one had any duty you ve done a very unwarrantable thing She was aware from his stare that her words were incoherent if not from the words themselves but she hurried on I am going with him He was here last night and I told him I would I will go with the Savors and we will keep the child together and if they will take me I shall go to work in the mills and I shall not care what people think if it s right She stopped and weakly dropped back on the lounge and hid her face in the pillow I really don t understand The doctor began with a physician s carefulness to unwind the coil she had flung down to him Are the Savors going and the child He will give her the child for the one they lost you know how And they will take it with them But you what have you I must have the child too I can t give it up and I shall go with them There s no other way You don t know I ve given him my word and there is no hope He asked you said the doctor to make sure he had heard aright he asked you advised you to go to work in a cotton mill No she lifted her face to confront him He told me not to go but I said I would They sat staring at each other in a silence which neither of them broke and which promised to last indefinitely They were still in their daze when Putney s voice came through the open hall door Hello hello hello Hello Central Can t I make you hear any one His steps advanced into the hall and he put his head in at the library doorway Thought you d be here he said nodding at the doctor Well doctor Brother Peck s beaten us again He s going Going the doctor echoed Yes It s no use I put the whole case before him and I argued it with a force of logic that would have fetched the twelfth man with eleven stubborn fellows against him on a jury but it didn t fetch Brother Peck He was very appreciative and grateful but he believes he s got a call to give up the ministry for the present at least Well there s some consolation in supposing he may know best after all It seemed to us that he had a great opportunity in Hatboro but if he turns his back on it perhaps it s a sign he wasn t equal to it The doctor told you what we ve been up to Annie Yes she answered faintly from the depths of the labyrinth in which she was plunged again I m sorry for your news about him said the doctor I hoped he was going to stay It s always a pity when such a man lets his sympathies use him instead of using them But we must always judge that kind of crank leniently if he doesn t involve other people in his erase She knew that he was shielding and trying to spare her and she felt inexpressibly degraded by the terms of his forbearance She could not accept and she had not the strength to refuse it and Putney said I ve not seen anything to make me doubt his sanity but I must say the present racket shakes my faith in his common sense and I rather held by that you know But I suppose no man except the kind of a man that a woman would be if she were a man excuse me Annie is ever absolutely right I suppose the truth is a constitutional thing and you can t separate it from the personal consciousness and so you get it coloured and heated by personality when you get it fresh That is we can see what the absolute truth was but never what it is Putney amused himself in speculating on these lines with more or less reference to mister Peck and did not notice that the doctor and Annie gave him only a silent assent As to misleading any one else mister Peck s following in his new religion seems to be confined to the Savors as I understand They are going with him to help him set up a sort of cooperative boarding house Well I don t know where we shall get a hotter gospeller than Brother Peck Poor old fellow I hope he ll get along better in Fall River It is something to be out of reach of Gerrish The doctor asked When is he going Why he s gone by this time I suppose said Putney I tried to get him to think about it overnight but he wouldn t He s anxious to go and get back so as to preach his last sermon here Sunday and he s taken the nine point ten if he hasn t changed his mind Putney looked at his watch Let s hope he hasn t said doctor Morrell Which asked Putney Changed his mind I m sorry he s coming back Annie knew that he was talking at her though he spoke to Putney but she was powerless to protest XXVIII They went away together leaving her to her despair which had passed into a sort of torpor by the following night when doctor Morrell came again out of what she knew must be mere humanity he could not respect her any longer He told her as if for her comfort that Putney had gone to the depot to meet mister Peck who was expected back in the eight o clock train and was to labour with him all night long if necessary to get him to change or at least postpone his purpose The feeling in his favour was growing Putney hoped to put it so strongly to him as a proof of duty that he could not resist it Annie listened comfortlessly Whatever happened nothing could take away the shame of her weakness now She even wished feebly vaguely that she might be forced to keep her word A sound of running on the gravel walk outside and a sharp pull at the door bell seemed to jerk them both to their feet Some one stepped into the hall panting and the face of William Savor showed itself at the door of the room where they stood Doc Doctor Morrell come come quick There s been an accident at the depot mister Peck He panted out the story and Annie saw rather than heard how the minister tried to cross the track from his train where it had halted short of the station and the flying express from the other quarter caught him from his feet and dropped the bleeding fragment that still held his life beside the rail a hundred yards away and then kept on in brute ignorance into the night Where is he Where have you got him the doctor demanded of Savor At my house The doctor ran out of the house and she heard his buggy whirl away followed by the fainter sound of Savor s feet as he followed running after he had stopped to repeat his story to the Boltons Annie turned to the farmer mister Bolton get the carry all I must go And me too said his wife Why no Pauliny I guess you better stay I guess it ll come out all right in the end Bolton began I guess William has exaggerated some may be Anyrate who s goin to look after the little girl if you come I am missus Bolton snapped back She s goin with me Of course she is Be quick mister Bolton Annie called from the stairs which she had already mounted half way She caught up the child limp with sleep from its crib and began to dress it Idella cried and fought away the hands that tormented her and made herself now very stiff and now very lax but Annie and missus Bolton together prevailed against her and she was dressed and had fallen asleep again in her clothes while the women were putting on their hats and sacks and Bolton was driving up to the door with the carry all Why I can see he said when he got out to help them in just how William s got his idee about it His wife s an excitable kind of a woman and she s sent him off lickety split after the doctor without looking to see what the matter was There hain t never been anybody hurt at our depot and it don t stand to reason Oliver Bolton will you hush that noise shrieked his wife If the world was burnin up you d say it was nothing but a chimbley on fire som er s Well well Pauliny have it your own way have it your own way said Bolton I ain t sayin but what there s some thin in William s story but you ll see t he s exaggerated Git up Well do hurry and do be still said his wife Yes yes It s all right Pauliny all right Soon s I m out the lane you ll see t I ll drive fast enough missus Bolton kept a grim silence against which her husband s babble of optimism played like heat lightning on a night sky Idella woke with the rush of cold air and in the dark and strangeness began to cry and wailed heart breakingly between her fits of louder sobbing and then fell asleep again before they reached the house where her father lay dying They had put him in the best bed in missus Savor s little guest room and when Annie entered the minister was apologising to her for spoiling it Now don t you say one word mister Peck she answered him It s all right I ruthah see you layin there just s you be than plenty of folks that She stopped for want of an apt comparison and at sight of Annie she said as if he were a child whose mind was wandering Well I declare if here ain t Miss Kilburn come to see you mister Peck And Mis Bolton Well the land missus Savor came and shook hands with them and in her character of hostess urged them forward from the door where they had halted Want to see mister Peck Well he s real comf table now ain t he doctor Morrell We got him all fixed up nicely and he ain t in a bit o pain It s his spine that s hurt so t he don t feel nothin but he s just as clear in his mind as what you or I be Ain t he doctor He s not suffering said doctor Morrell to whom Annie s eye wandered from missus Savor and there was something in his manner that made her think the minister was not badly hurt She went forward with mister and missus Bolton and after they had both taken the limp hand that lay outside the covering she touched it too It returned no pressure but his large wan eyes looked at her with such gentle dignity and intelligence that she began to frame in her mind an excuse for what seemed almost an intrusion We were afraid you were hurt badly and we thought we thought you might like to see Idella and so we came She is in the next room Thank you said the minister I presume that I am dying the doctor tells me that I have but a few hours to live missus Savor protested Oh I guess you ain t a goin to die this time mister Peck Annie looked from doctor Morrell to Putney who stood with him on the other side of the bed and experienced a shock from their gravity without yet being able to accept the fact it implied There s plenty of folks continued missus Savor hurt worse n what you be that s alive to day and as well as ever they was Bolton seized his chance It s just what I said to Pauliny comin along You ll see said I mister Peck ll be out as spry as any of us before a great while That s the way I felt about it from the start All you got to do is to keep up courage said missus Savor That s so that s half the battle said Bolton There were numbers of people in the room and at the door of the next Annie saw Colonel Marvin and Jack Wilmington She heard afterward that he was going to take the same train to Boston with mister Peck and had helped to bring him to the Savors house The stationmaster was there and some other railroad employes The doctor leaned across the bed and lifted slightly the arm that lay there taking the wrist between his thumb and finger I think we had better let mister Peck rest a while he said to the company generally We re doing him no good The people began to go some of them said Well good night as if they would meet again in the morning They all made the pretence that it was a slight matter and treated the wounded man as if he were a child He did not humour the pretence but said Good bye in return for their Good night with a quiet patience missus Savor hastened after her retreating guests I ain t a goin to let you go without a sup of coffee she said I want you should all stay and git some and I don t believe but what a little of it would do mister Peck good The surface of her lugubrious nature was broken up and whatever was kindly and cheerful in its depths floated to the top she was almost gay in the demand which the calamity made upon her Annie knew that she must have seen and helped to soothe the horror of mutilation which she could not even let her fancy figure and she followed her foolish bustle and chatter with respectful awe Rebecca ll have it right off the stove in half a minute now missus Savor concluded and from a further room came the cheerful click of cups and then a wandering whiff of the coffee life in its vulgar kindliness touched and made friends with death claiming it a part of nature too The night at missus Munger s came back to Annie from the immeasurable remoteness into which all the past had lapsed She looked up at doctor Morrell across the bed Would you like to speak with mister Peck he asked officially Better do it now he said with one of his short nods Putney came and set her a chair She would have liked to fall on her knees beside the bed but she took the chair and drew the minister s hand into hers stretching her arm above his head on the pillow He lay like some poor little wounded boy like Putney s Winthrop the mother that is in every woman s heart gushed out of hers in pity upon him mixed with filial reverence She had thought that she should confess her baseness to him and ask his forgiveness and offer to fulfil with the people he had chosen for the guardians of his child that interrupted purpose of his But in the presence of death so august so simple all the concerns of life seemed trivial and she found herself without words She sobbed over the poor hand she held He turned his eyes upon her and tried to speak but his lips only let out a moaning shuddering sound inarticulate of all that she hoped or feared he might prophesy to shape her future Life alone has any message for life but from the beginning of time it has put its ear to the cold lips that must for ever remain dumb XXIX The evening after the funeral Annie took Idella with the child s clothes and toys in a bundle and Bolton drove them down Over the Track to the Savors She had thought it all out and she perceived that whatever the minister s final intention might have been she was bound by the purpose he had expressed to her and must give up the child For fear she might be acting from the false conscientiousness of which she was beginning to have some notion in herself she put the case to missus Bolton She knew what she must do in any event but it was a comfort to be stayed so firmly in her duty by missus Bolton who did not spare some doubts of missus Savor s fitness for the charge and reflected a subdued censure even upon the judgment of mister Peck himself as she bustled about and helped Annie get Idella and her belongings ready The child watched the preparations with suspicion At the end when she was dressed and Annie tried to lift her into the carriage she broke out in sudden rebellion she cried she shrieked she fought the two good women who were obeying the dead minister s behest were obliged to descend to the foolish lies of the nursery they told her she was going on a visit to the Savors who would take her on the cars with them and then bring her back to Aunt Annie s house Before they could reconcile her to this fabled prospect they had to give it verisimilitude by taking off her everyday clothes and putting on her best dress She did not like missus Savor s house when she came to it nor missus Savor who stopped all blowzed and work deranged from trying to put it in order after the death in it and gave Idella a motherly welcome Annie fancied a certain surprise in her manner and her own ideal of duty was put to proof by missus Savor s owning that she had not expected Annie to bring Idella to her right away If I had not done it at once I never could have done it Annie explained Well I presume it s a cross said missus Savor and I don t feel right to take her If it wa n t for what her father Sh Annie said with a significant glance It s an ugly house screamed the child I want to go back to my Aunt Annie s house I want to go on the cars Yes yes answered missus Savor blindly groping to share in whatever cheat had been practised on the child just as soon as the cars starts Here William you take her out and show her the pretty coop you be n makin the pigeons to keep the cats out They got rid of her with Savor s connivance for the moment and Annie hastened to escape We had to tell her she was going a journey or we never could have got her into the carriage she explained feeling like a thief Yes yes It s all right said missus Savor I see you d be n putting up some kind of job on her the minute she mentioned the cars Don t you fret any Miss Kilburn Rebecca and me ll get along with her you needn t be afraid Annie could not look at the empty crib where it stood in its alcove when she went to bed and she cried upon her own pillow with heart sickness for the child and with a humiliating doubt of her own part in hurrying to give it up without thought of missus Savor s convenience What had seemed so noble so exemplary began to wear another colour and she drowsed worn out at last by the swarming fears shames and despairs which resolved themselves into a fantastic medley of dream images There was a cat trying to get at the pigeons in the coop which mister Savor had carried Idella to see It clawed and miauled at the lattice work of lath and its caterwauling became like the cry of a child so like that it woke Annie from her sleep and still kept on She lay shuddering a moment it seemed as if the dead minister s ghost flitted from the room while the crying defined and located itself more and more till she knew it a child s wail at the door of her house Then she heard Aunt Annie Aunt Annie and soft faint thumps as of a little fist upon the door panels She had no experience of more than one motion from her bed to the door which the same impulse flung open and let her crush to her breast the little tumult of sobs and moans from the threshold Oh wicked selfish heartless wretch she stormed out over the child But now I will never never never give you up Oh my poor little baby my darling God has sent you back to me and I will keep you I don t care what happens What a cruel wretch I have been oh what a cruel wretch my pretty to tear you from your home But now you shall never leave it no one shall take you away She gripped it in a succession of fierce hugs and mumbled it face and neck and little cold wet hands and feet with her kisses and all the time she did not know the child was in its night dress like herself or that her own feet were bare and her drapery as scanty as Idella s A sense of the fact evanescently gleamed upon her with the appearance of missus Bolton lamp in hand and the instantaneous appearance and disappearance of her husband at the back door through which she emerged The two women spent the first moments of the lamp light in making certain that Idella was sound and whole in every part and then in making uncertain for ever how she came to be there Whether she had wandered out in her sleep and found her way home with dream led feet or whether she had watched till the house was quiet and then stolen away was what she could not tell them and must always remain a mystery I don t believe but what mister Bolton had better go and wake up the Savors You got to keep her for the night I presume but they d ought to know where she is and you can take her over there agin come daylight Mrs Bolton shouted Annie in a voice so deep and hoarse that it shook the heart of a woman who had never known fear of man If you say such a thing to me if you ever say such a thing again I I I will hit you Send mister Bolton for Idella s things right away Land said missus Savor when Bolton after a long conciliatory preamble explained that he did not believe Miss Kilburn felt a great deal like giving the child up again I don t want it without it s satisfied to stay I see last night it was just breakin its heart for her and I told William when we first missed her this mornin and he was in such a pucker about her I bet anything he was a mind to that the child had gone back to Miss Kilburn s That s just the words I used didn t I Rebecca I couldn t stand it to have no child grievin around Beyond this sentimental reluctance missus Savor later confessed to Annie herself that she was really accepting the charge of Idella in the same spirit of self sacrifice as that in which Annie was surrendering it and that she felt when mister Peck first suggested it that the child was better off with Miss Kilburn only she hated to say so Her husband seemed to think it would make up to her for the one they lost but nothing could really do that XXX In a reverie of rare vividness following her recovery of the minister s child Annie Kilburn dramatised an escape from all the failures and humiliations of her life in Hatboro She took Idella with her and went back to Rome accomplishing the whole affair so smoothly and rapidly that she wondered at herself for not having thought of such a simple solution of her difficulties before She even began to put some little things together for her flight while she explained to old friends in the American colony that Idella was the orphan child of a country minister which she had adopted That old lady who had found her motives in returning to Hatboro insufficient questioned her sharply why she had adopted the minister s child and did not find her answers satisfactory They were such as also failed to pacify inquiry in Hatboro where Annie remained in spite of her reverie but people accepted the fact and accounted for it in their own way and approved it even though they could not quite approve her The dramatic impressiveness of the minister s death won him undisputed favour yet it failed to establish unity in his society Supply after supply filled his pulpit but the people found them all unsatisfactory when they remembered his preaching and could not make up their minds to any one of them They were more divided than ever except upon the point of regretting mister Peck But they distinguished in honouring his memory They revered his goodness and his wisdom but they regarded his conduct of life as unpractical They said there never was a more inspired teacher but it was impossible to follow him and he could not himself have kept the course he had marked out They said now that he was beyond recall no one else could have built up the church in Hatboro as he could if he could only have let impracticable theories alone mister Gerrish called many people to witness that this was what he had always said He contended that it was the spirit of the gospel which you were to follow He said that if mister Peck had gone to teaching among the mill hands he would have been sick of it inside of six weeks but he was a good Christian man and no one wished less than mister Gerrish to reproach him for what was after all more an error of the head than the heart His critics had it their own way in this for he had not lived to offer that full exposition of his theory and justification of his purpose which he had been expected to give on the Sunday after he was killed and his death was in no wise exegetic It said no more to his people than it had said to Annie it was a mere casualty and his past life broken and unfulfilled with only its intimations and intentions of performance alone remained When people learned as they could hardly help doing from missus Savor s volubility what his plan with regard to Idella had been they instanced that in proof of the injuriousness of his idealism as applied to real life and they held that she had been remanded in that strange way to Miss Kilburn s charge for some purpose which she must not attempt to cross As the minister had been thwarted in another intent by death it was a sign that he was wrong in this too and that she could do better by the child than he had proposed This was the sum of popular opinion and it was further the opinion of missus Gerrish who gave more attention to the case than many others that Annie had first taken the child because she hoped to get mister Peck when she found she could not get doctor Morrell and that she would have been very glad to be rid of it if she had known how but that she would have to keep it now for shame s sake For shame s sake certainly Annie would have done several other things and chief of these would have been never to see doctor Morrell again She believed that he not only knew the folly she had confessed to him but that he had divined the cowardice and meanness in which she had repented it and she felt intolerably disgraced before the thought of him She had imagined mainly because of him that escape to Rome which never has yet been effected though it might have been attempted if Idella had not wakened ill from the sleep she sobbed herself into when she found herself safe in Annie s crib again She had taken a heavy cold and she moped lifelessly about during the day and drowsed early again in the troubled cough broken slumber That child ought to have the doctor said missus Bolton with the grim impartiality in which she masked her interference Well said Annie helplessly At the end of the lung fever which followed It was a narrow chance said the doctor one morning but now I needn t come any more unless you send for me Annie stood at the door where he spoke with his hand on the dash board of his buggy before getting into it She answered with one of those impulses that come from something deeper than intention I will send for you then to tell you how generous you are and in the look with which she spoke she uttered the full meaning that her words withheld He flushed for pleasure of conscious desert but he had to laugh and turn it off lightly I don t think I could come for that But I ll look in to see Idella unprofessionally He drove away and she remained at her door looking up at the summer blue sky that held a few soft white clouds such as might have overhung the same place at the same hour thousands of years before and such as would lazily drift over it in a thousand years to come The morning had an immeasurable vastness through which some crows flying across the pasture above the house sent their voices on the spacious stillness A perception of the unity of all things under the sun flashed and faded upon her as such glimpses do Of her high intentions nothing had resulted An inexorable centrifugality had thrown her off at every point where she tried to cling Nothing of what was established and regulated had desired her intervention a few accidents and irregularities had alone accepted it But now she felt that nothing withal had been lost a magnitude a serenity a tolerance intimated itself in the universal frame of things where her failure her recreancy her folly seemed for the moment to come into true perspective and to show venial and unimportant to be limited to itself and to be even good in its effect of humbling her to patience with all imperfection and shortcoming even her own She was aware of the cessation of a struggle that has never since renewed itself with the old intensity her wishes her propensities ceased in that degree to represent evil in conflict with the portion of good in her they seemed so mixed and interwoven with the good that they could no longer be antagonised for the moment they seemed in their way even wiser and better and ever after to be the nature out of which good as well as evil might come As she remained standing there mister Brandreth came round the corner of the house looking very bright and happy Miss Kilburn he said abruptly I want you to congratulate me I m engaged to Miss Chapley Are you indeed mister Brandreth I do congratulate you with all my heart She is a lovely girl Yes it s all right now said mister Brandreth I ve come to tell you the first one because you seemed to take an interest in it when I told you of the trouble about the Juliet We hadn t come to any understanding before that but that seemed to bring us both to the point and and we re engaged Mother and I are going to New York for the winter we think she can risk it and at any rate she won t be separated from me and we shall be back in our little home next May You know that I m to be with mister Chapley in his business Why no This is great news mister Brandreth I don t know what to say You re very kind said the young man and for the third or fourth time he wrung her hand It isn t a partnership of course but he thinks I can be of use to him I know you can Annie adventured We are very busy getting ready nearly everybody else is gone and mother sent her kindest regards you know she don t make calls and I just ran up to tell you Well good bye Good bye Give my love to your mother and to your to Miss Chapley I will He hurried off and then came running back Oh I forgot About the Social Union fund You know we ve got about two hundred dollars from the theatricals but the matter seems to have stopped there and some of us think there d better be some other disposition of the money Have you any suggestion to make No none Then I ll tell you It s proposed to devote the money to beautifying the grounds around the soldiers monument They ought to be fenced and planted with flowers turned into a little public garden Everybody appreciates the interest you took in the Union and we hoped you d be pleased with that disposition of the money It is very kind said Annie with a meek submission that must have made him believe she was deeply touched As I m not to be here this winter he continued we thought we had better leave the whole matter in your hands and the money has been deposited in the bank subject to your order It was missus Munger s idea I don t think she s ever felt just right about that evening of the dramatics don t you know Good bye He ran off to escape her thanks for this proof of confidence in her taste and judgment and he was gone beyond her protest before she emerged from her daze into a full sense of the absurdity of the situation Well it s a very simple matter to let the money lie in the bank said doctor Morrell who came that evening to make his first unprofessional visit and received with pure amusement the account of the affair which she gave him with a strong infusion of vexation The way I was involved in this odious Social Union business from the first and now have it left on my hands in the end is maddening Why I can t get rid of it she replied Then perhaps he comfortably suggested it s a sign you re not intended to get rid of it What do you mean Why don t you go on he irresponsibly adventured further and establish a Social Union Do you mean it What was that notion of his they usually spoke of the minister pronominally about getting the Savors going in a company operative boarding house at Fall River Putney said something about it Annie explained as she had heard it from him and from the Savors since his death the minister s scheme for a club in which the members should contribute the labour and the provisions and should live cheaply and wholesomely under the management of the Savors at first and afterward should continue them in charge or not as they chose He seemed to have thought it out very carefully But I supposed of course it was unpractical Was that why you were going in for it asked the doctor and then he spared her confusion in adding I don t see why it was unpractical It seems to me a very good notion for a Social Union Why not try it here There isn t the same pressing necessity that there is in a big factory town but you have the money and you have the Savors to make a beginning His tone was still half bantering but it had become more and more serious so that she could say in earnest But the money is one of the drawbacks It was mister Peck s idea that the working people ought to do it all themselves Well I should say that two thirds of that money in the bank had come from them They turned out in great force to mister Brandreth s theatricals And wouldn t it be rather high handed to use their money for anything but the Union You don t suppose said Annie hotly that I would spend a cent of it on the grounds of that idiotic monument I would pay for having it blown up with dynamite No I can t have anything more to do with the wretched affair My touch is fatal The doctor laughed and she added Besides I believe most heartily with mister Peck that no person of means and leisure can meet working people except in the odious character of a patron and if I didn t respect them I respect myself too much for that If I were ready to go in with them and start the Social Union on his basis by helping do house work scullion work for it and eating and living with them I might try but I know from experience I m not I haven t the need and to pretend that I have to forego my comforts and luxuries in a make believe that I haven t them would be too ghastly a farce and I won t Well then don t said the doctor bent more perhaps on carrying his point in argument than on promoting the actual establishment of the Social Union But my idea is this Take two thirds or one half of that money and go to Savor and say Here This is what mister Brandreth s theatricals swindled the shop hands out of It s honestly theirs at least to control and if you want to try that experiment of mister Peck s here in Hatboro it s yours We people of leisure or comparative leisure have really nothing in common with you people who work with your hands for a living and as we really can t be friends with you we won t patronise you We won t advise you and we won t help you but here s the money If you fail you fail and if you succeed you won t succeed by our aid and comfort The plan that Annie and Doctor Morrell talked over half in joke took a more and more serious character in her sense of duty to the minister s memory and the wish to be of use which was not extinct in her however she mocked and defied it It was part of the irony of her fate that the people who were best able to counsel with her in regard to it were Lyra whom she could not approve and Jack Wilmington whom she had always disliked He was able to contribute some facts about the working of the Thayer Club at the Harvard Memorial Hall in Cambridge and Lyra because she had been herself a hand and would not forget it was of use in bringing the scheme into favour with the hands They felt easy with her as they did with Putney and for much the same reason it is one of the pleasing facts of our conditions that people who are socially inferior like best those above them who are morally anomalous It was really through Lyra that Annie got at the working people and when it came to a formal conference there was no one who could command their confidence like Putney whom they saw mad drunk two or three times a year but always pulling up and fighting back to sanity against the enemy whose power some of them had felt too No theory is so perfect as not to be subject to exceptions in the experiment and in spite of her conviction of the truth of mister Peck s social philosophy Annie is aware through her simple and frank relations with the hands in a business matter of mutual kindness which it does not account for But perhaps the philosophy and the experiment were not contradictory perhaps it was intended to cover only the cases in which they had no common interest At anyrate when the Peck Social Union as its members voted to call it at the suggestion of one of their own number got in working order she was as cordially welcomed to the charge of its funds and accounts as if she had been a hat shop hand or a shoe binder She is really of use for its working is by no means ideal and with her wider knowledge she has suggested improvements and expedients for making both ends meet which were sometimes so reluctant to meet She has kept a conscience against subsidising the Union from her own means and she even accepts for her services a small salary which its members think they ought to pay her She owns this ridiculous like all the make believe work of rich people a travesty which has no reality except the little sum it added to the greater sum of her superabundance She is aware that she is a pensioner upon the real members of the Social Union for a chance to be useful and that the work they let her do is the right of some one who needs it She has thought of doing the work and giving the pay to another but she sees that this would be pauperising and degrading another So she dwells in a vicious circle and waits and mostly forgets and is mostly happy The Social Union itself though not a brilliant success in all points is still not a failure and the promise of its future is in the fact that it continues to have a present The people of Hatboro are rather proud of it and strangers visit it as one of the possible solutions of one of the social problems It is predicted that it cannot go on that it must either do better or do worse but it goes on the same Putney studies its existence in the light of his own infirmity to which he still yields from time to time as he has always done He professes to find there a law which would account for a great many facts of human experience otherwise inexplicable He does not attempt to define this occult preservative principle but he offers himself and the Social Union as proofs of its existence and he argues that if they can only last long enough they will finally be established in a virtue and prosperity as great as those of mister Gerrish and his store Annie sometimes feels that nothing else can explain the maintenance of Lyra Wilmington s peculiar domestic relations at the point which perpetually invites comment and never justifies scandal The situation seems to her as lamentable as ever She grieves over Lyra and likes her and laughs with her she no longer detests Jack Wilmington so much since he showed himself so willing and helpful about the Social Union she thinks there must be a great deal of good in him and sometimes she is sorry for him and longs to speak again to Lyra about the wrong she is doing him One of the dangers of having a very definite point of view is the temptation of abusing it to read the whole riddle of the painful earth Annie has permitted herself to think of Lyra s position as one which would be impossible in a state of things where there was neither poverty nor riches and there was neither luxury on one hand to allure nor the fear of want to constrain on the other When her recoil from the fulfilment of her volunteer pledge to mister Peck brought her face to face with her own weakness there were two ways back to self respect either of which she might take She might revert to her first opinion of him and fortify herself in that contempt and rejection of his ideas or she might abandon herself to them with a vague intention of reparation to him and accept them to the last insinuation of their logic This was what she did and while her life remained the same outwardly it was inwardly all changed She never could tell by what steps she reached her agreement with the minister s philosophy perhaps as a woman it was not possible she should but she had a faith concerning it to which she bore unswerving allegiance and it was Putney s delight to witness its revolutionary effect on an old Hatboro Kilburn the daughter of a shrewd lawyer and canny politician like her father and the heir of an aristocratic tradition a gentlewoman born and bred He declared himself a reactionary in comparison with her and had the habit of taking the conservative side against her She was in the joke of this but it was a real trouble to her for a time that doctor Morrell after admitting the force of her reasons should be content to rest in a comfortable inconclusion as to his conduct till one day she reflected that this was what she was herself doing and that she differed from him only in the openness with which she proclaimed her opinions Being a woman her opinions were treated by the magnates of Hatboro as a good joke the harmless fantasies of an old maid which she would get rid of if she could get anybody to marry her being a lady and very well off they were received with deference and she was left to their uninterrupted enjoyment Putney amused himself by saying that she was the fiercest apostle of labour that never did a stroke of work but no one cared half so much for all that as for the question whether her affair with doctor Morrell was a friendship or a courtship They saw an activity of attention on his part which would justify the most devout belief in the latter and yet they were confronted with the fact that it so long remained eventless The two theories one that she was amusing herself with him and the other that he was just playing with her divided public opinion but they did not molest either of the parties to the mystery and the village after a season of acute conjecture quiesced into that sarcastic sufferance of the anomaly into which it may have been noticed that small communities are apt to subside from such occasions Except for some such irreconcilable as missus Gerrish it was a good joke that if you could not find doctor Morrell in his office after tea you could always find him at Miss Kilburn s Perhaps it might have helped solve the mystery if it had been known that she could not accept the situation whatever it really was without satisfying herself upon two points which resolved themselves into one in the process of the inquiry She asked apparently as preliminary to answering a question of his Have you heard that gossip about my being in caring for the poor man Yes And did you what did you think That it wasn t true I knew if there were anything in it you couldn t have talked him over with me She was silent Then she said in a low voice No there couldn t have been But not for that reason alone though it s very delicate and generous of you to think of it very large minded but because it couldn t have been I could have worshipped him but I couldn t have loved him any more she added with an implication that entirely satisfied him than I could have worshipped you THE END End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Annie Kilburn by William Dean Howells END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK ANNIE
