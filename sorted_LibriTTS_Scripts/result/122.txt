THE NATIVE by Thomas Hardy PREFACE The date at which the following events are assumed to have occurred may be set down as between eighteen forty and eighteen fifty when the old watering place herein called Budmouth still retained sufficient afterglow from its Georgian gaiety and prestige to lend it an absorbing attractiveness to the romantic and imaginative soul of a lonely dweller inland Under the general name of Egdon Heath which has been given to the sombre scene of the story are united or typified heaths of various real names to the number of at least a dozen these being virtually one in character and aspect though their original unity or partial unity is now somewhat disguised by intrusive strips and slices brought under the plough with varying degrees of success or planted to woodland It is pleasant to dream that some spot in the extensive tract whose southwestern quarter is here described may be the heath of that traditionary King of Wessex Lear July eighteen ninety five To sorrow I bade good morrow And thought to leave her far away behind But cheerly cheerly She loves me dearly She is so constant to me and so kind I would deceive her And so leave her But ah she is so constant and so kind BOOK ONE THE THREE WOMEN one A Face on Which Time Makes but Little Impression A Saturday afternoon in November was approaching the time of twilight and the vast tract of unenclosed wild known as Egdon Heath embrowned itself moment by moment Overhead the hollow stretch of whitish cloud shutting out the sky was as a tent which had the whole heath for its floor The heaven being spread with this pallid screen and the earth with the darkest vegetation their meeting line at the horizon was clearly marked In such contrast the heath wore the appearance of an instalment of night which had taken up its place before its astronomical hour was come darkness had to a great extent arrived hereon while day stood distinct in the sky Looking upwards a furze cutter would have been inclined to continue work looking down he would have decided to finish his faggot and go home The distant rims of the world and of the firmament seemed to be a division in time no less than a division in matter The face of the heath by its mere complexion added half an hour to evening it could in like manner retard the dawn sadden noon anticipate the frowning of storms scarcely generated and intensify the opacity of a moonless midnight to a cause of shaking and dread In fact precisely at this transitional point of its nightly roll into darkness the great and particular glory of the Egdon waste began and nobody could be said to understand the heath who had not been there at such a time It could best be felt when it could not clearly be seen its complete effect and explanation lying in this and the succeeding hours before the next dawn then and only then did it tell its true tale The spot was indeed a near relation of night and when night showed itself an apparent tendency to gravitate together could be perceived in its shades and the scene The sombre stretch of rounds and hollows seemed to rise and meet the evening gloom in pure sympathy the heath exhaling darkness as rapidly as the heavens precipitated it And so the obscurity in the air and the obscurity in the land closed together in a black fraternization towards which each advanced halfway The place became full of a watchful intentness now for when other things sank blooding to sleep the heath appeared slowly to awake and listen Every night its Titanic form seemed to await something but it had waited thus unmoved during so many centuries through the crises of so many things that it could only be imagined to await one last crisis the final overthrow It was a spot which returned upon the memory of those who loved it with an aspect of peculiar and kindly congruity Smiling champaigns of flowers and fruit hardly do this for they are permanently harmonious only with an existence of better reputation as to its issues than the present Twilight combined with the scenery of Egdon Heath to evolve a thing majestic without severity impressive without showiness emphatic in its admonitions grand in its simplicity The qualifications which frequently invest the facade of a prison with far more dignity than is found in the facade of a palace double its size lent to this heath a sublimity in which spots renowned for beauty of the accepted kind are utterly wanting Fair prospects wed happily with fair times but alas if times be not fair Men have oftener suffered from the mockery of a place too smiling for their reason than from the oppression of surroundings oversadly tinged Haggard Egdon appealed to a subtler and scarcer instinct to a more recently learnt emotion than that which responds to the sort of beauty called charming and fair Indeed it is a question if the exclusive reign of this orthodox beauty is not approaching its last quarter The new Vale of Tempe may be a gaunt waste in Thule human souls may find themselves in closer and closer harmony with external things wearing a sombreness distasteful to our race when it was young The time seems near if it has not actually arrived when the chastened sublimity of a moor a sea or a mountain will be all of nature that is absolutely in keeping with the moods of the more thinking among mankind And ultimately to the commonest tourist spots like Iceland may become what the vineyards and myrtle gardens of South Europe are to him now and Heidelberg and Baden be passed unheeded as he hastens from the Alps to the sand dunes of Scheveningen The most thoroughgoing ascetic could feel that he had a natural right to wander on Egdon he was keeping within the line of legitimate indulgence when he laid himself open to influences such as these Colours and beauties so far subdued were at least the birthright of all Only in summer days of highest feather did its mood touch the level of gaiety Intensity was more usually reached by way of the solemn than by way of the brilliant and such a sort of intensity was often arrived at during winter darkness tempests and mists Then Egdon was aroused to reciprocity for the storm was its lover and the wind its friend Then it became the home of strange phantoms and it was found to be the hitherto unrecognized original of those wild regions of obscurity which are vaguely felt to be compassing us about in midnight dreams of flight and disaster and are never thought of after the dream till revived by scenes like this It was at present a place perfectly accordant with man s nature neither ghastly hateful nor ugly neither commonplace unmeaning nor tame but like man slighted and enduring and withal singularly colossal and mysterious in its swarthy monotony As with some persons who have long lived apart solitude seemed to look out of its countenance It had a lonely face suggesting tragical possibilities This obscure obsolete superseded country figures in Domesday Its condition is recorded therein as that of heathy furzy briary wilderness Bruaria Then follows the length and breadth in leagues and though some uncertainty exists as to the exact extent of this ancient lineal measure it appears from the figures that the area of Egdon down to the present day has but little diminished Turbaria Bruaria the right of cutting heath turf occurs in charters relating to the district Overgrown with heth and mosse says Leland of the same dark sweep of country Here at least were intelligible facts regarding landscape far reaching proofs productive of genuine satisfaction The untameable Ishmaelitish thing that Egdon now was it always had been Civilization was its enemy and ever since the beginning of vegetation its soil had worn the same antique brown dress the natural and invariable garment of the particular formation In its venerable one coat lay a certain vein of satire on human vanity in clothes A person on a heath in raiment of modern cut and colours has more or less an anomalous look We seem to want the oldest and simplest human clothing where the clothing of the earth is so primitive To recline on a stump of thorn in the central valley of Egdon between afternoon and night as now where the eye could reach nothing of the world outside the summits and shoulders of heathland which filled the whole circumference of its glance and to know that everything around and underneath had been from prehistoric times as unaltered as the stars overhead gave ballast to the mind adrift on change and harassed by the irrepressible New The great inviolate place had an ancient permanence which the sea cannot claim Who can say of a particular sea that it is old Distilled by the sun kneaded by the moon it is renewed in a year in a day or in an hour The sea changed the fields changed the rivers the villages and the people changed yet Egdon remained Those surfaces were neither so steep as to be destructible by weather nor so flat as to be the victims of floods and deposits With the exception of an aged highway and a still more aged barrow presently to be referred to themselves almost crystallized to natural products by long continuance even the trifling irregularities were not caused by pickaxe plough or spade but remained as the very finger touches of the last geological change The above mentioned highway traversed the lower levels of the heath from one horizon to another In many portions of its course it overlaid an old vicinal way which branched from the great Western road of the Romans the Via Iceniana or Ikenild Street hard by On the evening under consideration it would have been noticed that though the gloom had increased sufficiently to confuse the minor features of the heath the white surface of the road remained almost as clear as ever two Humanity Appears upon the Scene Hand in Hand with Trouble Along the road walked an old man He was white headed as a mountain bowed in the shoulders and faded in general aspect He wore a glazed hat an ancient boat cloak and shoes his brass buttons bearing an anchor upon their face In his hand was a silver headed walking stick which he used as a veritable third leg perseveringly dotting the ground with its point at every few inches interval One would have said that he had been in his day a naval officer of some sort or other Before him stretched the long laborious road dry empty and white It was quite open to the heath on each side and bisected that vast dark surface like the parting line on a head of black hair diminishing and bending away on the furthest horizon The old man frequently stretched his eyes ahead to gaze over the tract that he had yet to traverse At length he discerned a long distance in front of him a moving spot which appeared to be a vehicle and it proved to be going the same way as that in which he himself was journeying It was the single atom of life that the scene contained and it only served to render the general loneliness more evident Its rate of advance was slow and the old man gained upon it sensibly When he drew nearer he perceived it to be a spring van ordinary in shape but singular in colour this being a lurid red The driver walked beside it and like his van he was completely red One dye of that tincture covered his clothes the cap upon his head his boots his face and his hands He was not temporarily overlaid with the colour it permeated him The old man knew the meaning of this The traveller with the cart was a reddleman a person whose vocation it was to supply farmers with redding for their sheep He was one of a class rapidly becoming extinct in Wessex filling at present in the rural world the place which during the last century the dodo occupied in the world of animals He is a curious interesting and nearly perished link between obsolete forms of life and those which generally prevail The decayed officer by degrees came up alongside his fellow wayfarer and wished him good evening The reddleman turned his head and replied in sad and occupied tones He was young and his face if not exactly handsome approached so near to handsome that nobody would have contradicted an assertion that it really was so in its natural colour His eye which glared so strangely through his stain was in itself attractive keen as that of a bird of prey and blue as autumn mist He had neither whisker nor moustache which allowed the soft curves of the lower part of his face to be apparent His lips were thin and though as it seemed compressed by thought there was a pleasant twitch at their corners now and then He was clothed throughout in a tight fitting suit of corduroy excellent in quality not much worn and well chosen for its purpose but deprived of its original colour by his trade It showed to advantage the good shape of his figure A certain well to do air about the man suggested that he was not poor for his degree The natural query of an observer would have been Why should such a promising being as this have hidden his prepossessing exterior by adopting that singular occupation After replying to the old man s greeting he showed no inclination to continue in talk although they still walked side by side for the elder traveller seemed to desire company There were no sounds but that of the booming wind upon the stretch of tawny herbage around them the crackling wheels the tread of the men and the footsteps of the two shaggy ponies which drew the van They were small hardy animals of a breed between Galloway and Exmoor and were known as heath croppers here Now as they thus pursued their way the reddleman occasionally left his companion s side and stepping behind the van looked into its interior through a small window The look was always anxious He would then return to the old man who made another remark about the state of the country and so on to which the reddleman again abstractedly replied and then again they would lapse into silence The silence conveyed to neither any sense of awkwardness in these lonely places wayfarers after a first greeting frequently plod on for miles without speech contiguity amounts to a tacit conversation where otherwise than in cities such contiguity can be put an end to on the merest inclination and where not to put an end to it is intercourse in itself Possibly these two might not have spoken again till their parting had it not been for the reddleman s visits to his van When he returned from his fifth time of looking in the old man said You have something inside there besides your load Yes Somebody who wants looking after Yes Not long after this a faint cry sounded from the interior The reddleman hastened to the back looked in and came away again You have a child there my man No sir I have a woman The deuce you have Why did she cry out Oh she has fallen asleep and not being used to traveling she s uneasy and keeps dreaming A young woman Yes a young woman That would have interested me forty years ago Perhaps she s your wife My wife said the other bitterly She s above mating with such as I But there s no reason why I should tell you about that That s true And there s no reason why you should not What harm can I do to you or to her The reddleman looked in the old man s face Well sir he said at last I knew her before today though perhaps it would have been better if I had not But she s nothing to me and I am nothing to her and she wouldn t have been in my van if any better carriage had been there to take her Where may I ask At Anglebury I know the town well What was she doing there Oh not much to gossip about However she s tired to death now and not at all well and that s what makes her so restless She dropped off into a nap about an hour ago and twill do her good A nice looking girl no doubt You would say so The other traveller turned his eyes with interest towards the van window and without withdrawing them said I presume I might look in upon her No said the reddleman abruptly It is getting too dark for you to see much of her and more than that I have no right to allow you Thank God she sleeps so well I hope she won t wake till she s home Who is she One of the neighbourhood Tis no matter who excuse me It is not that girl of Blooms End who has been talked about more or less lately If so I know her and I can guess what has happened Tis no matter Now sir I am sorry to say that we shall soon have to part company My ponies are tired and I have further to go and I am going to rest them under this bank for an hour The elder traveller nodded his head indifferently and the reddleman turned his horses and van in upon the turf saying Good night The old man replied and proceeded on his way as before The reddleman watched his form as it diminished to a speck on the road and became absorbed in the thickening films of night He then took some hay from a truss which was slung up under the van and throwing a portion of it in front of the horses made a pad of the rest which he laid on the ground beside his vehicle Upon this he sat down leaning his back against the wheel From the interior a low soft breathing came to his ear It appeared to satisfy him and he musingly surveyed the scene as if considering the next step that he should take To do things musingly and by small degrees seemed indeed to be a duty in the Egdon valleys at this transitional hour for there was that in the condition of the heath itself which resembled protracted and halting dubiousness It was the quality of the repose appertaining to the scene This was not the repose of actual stagnation but the apparent repose of incredible slowness A condition of healthy life so nearly resembling the torpor of death is a noticeable thing of its sort to exhibit the inertness of the desert and at the same time to be exercising powers akin to those of the meadow and even of the forest awakened in those who thought of it the attentiveness usually engendered by understatement and reserve The scene before the reddleman s eyes was a gradual series of ascents from the level of the road backward into the heart of the heath It embraced hillocks pits ridges acclivities one behind the other till all was finished by a high hill cutting against the still light sky The traveller s eye hovered about these things for a time and finally settled upon one noteworthy object up there It was a barrow This bossy projection of earth above its natural level occupied the loftiest ground of the loneliest height that the heath contained Although from the vale it appeared but as a wart on an Atlantean brow its actual bulk was great It formed the pole and axis of this heathery world As the resting man looked at the barrow he became aware that its summit hitherto the highest object in the whole prospect round was surmounted by something higher It rose from the semiglobular mound like a spike from a helmet The first instinct of an imaginative stranger might have been to suppose it the person of one of the Celts who built the barrow so far had all of modern date withdrawn from the scene It seemed a sort of last man among them musing for a moment before dropping into eternal night with the rest of his race There the form stood motionless as the hill beneath Above the plain rose the hill above the hill rose the barrow and above the barrow rose the figure Above the figure was nothing that could be mapped elsewhere than on a celestial globe Such a perfect delicate and necessary finish did the figure give to the dark pile of hills that it seemed to be the only obvious justification of their outline Without it there was the dome without the lantern with it the architectural demands of the mass were satisfied The scene was strangely homogeneous in that the vale the upland the barrow and the figure above it amounted only to unity Looking at this or that member of the group was not observing a complete thing but a fraction of a thing The form was so much like an organic part of the entire motionless structure that to see it move would have impressed the mind as a strange phenomenon Immobility being the chief characteristic of that whole which the person formed portion of the discontinuance of immobility in any quarter suggested confusion Yet that is what happened The figure perceptibly gave up its fixity shifted a step or two and turned round As if alarmed it descended on the right side of the barrow with the glide of a water drop down a bud and then vanished The movement had been sufficient to show more clearly the characteristics of the figure and that it was a woman s The reason of her sudden displacement now appeared With her dropping out of sight on the right side a newcomer bearing a burden protruded into the sky on the left side ascended the tumulus and deposited the burden on the top A second followed then a third a fourth a fifth and ultimately the whole barrow was peopled with burdened figures The only intelligible meaning in this sky backed pantomime of silhouettes was that the woman had no relation to the forms who had taken her place was sedulously avoiding these and had come thither for another object than theirs The imagination of the observer clung by preference to that vanished solitary figure as to something more interesting more important more likely to have a history worth knowing than these newcomers and unconsciously regarded them as intruders But they remained and established themselves and the lonely person who hitherto had been queen of the solitude did not at present seem likely to return three The Custom of the Country Had a looker on been posted in the immediate vicinity of the barrow he would have learned that these persons were boys and men of the neighbouring hamlets Each as he ascended the barrow had been heavily laden with furze faggots carried upon the shoulder by means of a long stake sharpened at each end for impaling them easily two in front and two behind They came from a part of the heath a quarter of a mile to the rear where furze almost exclusively prevailed as a product Every individual was so involved in furze by his method of carrying the faggots that he appeared like a bush on legs till he had thrown them down The party had marched in trail like a travelling flock of sheep that is to say the strongest first the weak and young behind The loads were all laid together and a pyramid of furze thirty feet in circumference now occupied the crown of the tumulus which was known as Rainbarrow for many miles round Some made themselves busy with matches and in selecting the driest tufts of furze others in loosening the bramble bonds which held the faggots together Others again while this was in progress lifted their eyes and swept the vast expanse of country commanded by their position now lying nearly obliterated by shade In the valleys of the heath nothing save its own wild face was visible at any time of day but this spot commanded a horizon enclosing a tract of far extent and in many cases lying beyond the heath country None of its features could be seen now but the whole made itself felt as a vague stretch of remoteness While the men and lads were building the pile a change took place in the mass of shade which denoted the distant landscape Red suns and tufts of fire one by one began to arise flecking the whole country round They were the bonfires of other parishes and hamlets that were engaged in the same sort of commemoration Some were distant and stood in a dense atmosphere so that bundles of pale straw like beams radiated around them in the shape of a fan Some were large and near glowing scarlet red from the shade like wounds in a black hide Some were Maenades with winy faces and blown hair These tinctured the silent bosom of the clouds above them and lit up their ephemeral caves which seemed thenceforth to become scalding caldrons Perhaps as many as thirty bonfires could be counted within the whole bounds of the district and as the hour may be told on a clock face when the figures themselves are invisible so did the men recognize the locality of each fire by its angle and direction though nothing of the scenery could be viewed The first tall flame from Rainbarrow sprang into the sky attracting all eyes that had been fixed on the distant conflagrations back to their own attempt in the same kind The cheerful blaze streaked the inner surface of the human circle now increased by other stragglers male and female with its own gold livery and even overlaid the dark turf around with a lively luminousness which softened off into obscurity where the barrow rounded downwards out of sight It showed the barrow to be the segment of a globe as perfect as on the day when it was thrown up even the little ditch remaining from which the earth was dug Not a plough had ever disturbed a grain of that stubborn soil In the heath s barrenness to the farmer lay its fertility to the historian There had been no obliteration because there had been no tending It seemed as if the bonfire makers were standing in some radiant upper story of the world detached from and independent of the dark stretches below The heath down there was now a vast abyss and no longer a continuation of what they stood on for their eyes adapted to the blaze could see nothing of the deeps beyond its influence Occasionally it is true a more vigorous flare than usual from their faggots sent darting lights like aides de camp down the inclines to some distant bush pool or patch of white sand kindling these to replies of the same colour till all was lost in darkness again Then the whole black phenomenon beneath represented Limbo as viewed from the brink by the sublime Florentine in his vision and the muttered articulations of the wind in the hollows were as complaints and petitions from the souls of mighty worth suspended therein It was as if these men and boys had suddenly dived into past ages and fetched therefrom an hour and deed which had before been familiar with this spot The ashes of the original British pyre which blazed from that summit lay fresh and undisturbed in the barrow beneath their tread The flames from funeral piles long ago kindled there had shone down upon the lowlands as these were shining now Festival fires to Thor and Woden had followed on the same ground and duly had their day Indeed it is pretty well known that such blazes as this the heathmen were now enjoying are rather the lineal descendants from jumbled Druidical rites and Saxon ceremonies than the invention of popular feeling about Gunpowder Plot Moreover to light a fire is the instinctive and resistant act of man when at the winter ingress the curfew is sounded throughout Nature It indicates a spontaneous Promethean rebelliousness against that fiat that this recurrent season shall bring foul times cold darkness misery and death Black chaos comes and the fettered gods of the earth say Let there be light The brilliant lights and sooty shades which struggled upon the skin and clothes of the persons standing round caused their lineaments and general contours to be drawn with Dureresque vigour and dash Yet the permanent moral expression of each face it was impossible to discover for as the nimble flames towered nodded and swooped through the surrounding air the blots of shade and flakes of light upon the countenances of the group changed shape and position endlessly All was unstable quivering as leaves evanescent as lightning Shadowy eye sockets deep as those of a death s head suddenly turned into pits of lustre a lantern jaw was cavernous then it was shining wrinkles were emphasized to ravines or obliterated entirely by a changed ray Nostrils were dark wells sinews in old necks were gilt mouldings things with no particular polish on them were glazed bright objects such as the tip of a furze hook one of the men carried were as glass eyeballs glowed like little lanterns Those whom Nature had depicted as merely quaint became grotesque the grotesque became preternatural for all was in extremity Hence it may be that the face of an old man who had like others been called to the heights by the rising flames was not really the mere nose and chin that it appeared to be but an appreciable quantity of human countenance He stood complacently sunning himself in the heat With a speaker or stake he tossed the outlying scraps of fuel into the conflagration looking at the midst of the pile occasionally lifting his eyes to measure the height of the flame or to follow the great sparks which rose with it and sailed away into darkness The beaming sight and the penetrating warmth seemed to breed in him a cumulative cheerfulness which soon amounted to delight With his stick in his hand he began to jig a private minuet a bunch of copper seals shining and swinging like a pendulum from under his waistcoat he also began to sing in the voice of a bee up a flue The king call d down his no bles all By one by two by three Earl Mar shal I ll go shrive the queen And thou shalt wend with me A boon a boon quoth Earl Mar shal And fell on his bend ded knee That what so e er the queen shall say No harm there of may be Want of breath prevented a continuance of the song and the breakdown attracted the attention of a firm standing man of middle age who kept each corner of his crescent shaped mouth rigorously drawn back into his cheek as if to do away with any suspicion of mirthfulness which might erroneously have attached to him A fair stave Grandfer Cantle but I am afeard tis too much for the mouldy weasand of such a old man as you he said to the wrinkled reveller Dostn t wish th wast three sixes again Grandfer as you was when you first learnt to sing it Hey said Grandfer Cantle stopping in his dance Dostn t wish wast young again I say There s a hole in thy poor bellows nowadays seemingly But there s good art in me If I couldn t make a little wind go a long ways I should seem no younger than the most aged man should I Timothy And how about the new married folks down there at the Quiet Woman Inn the other inquired pointing towards a dim light in the direction of the distant highway but considerably apart from where the reddleman was at that moment resting What s the rights of the matter about em You ought to know being an understanding man But a little rakish hey I own to it Master Cantle is that or he s nothing Yet tis a gay fault neigbbour Fairway that age will cure I heard that they were coming home tonight By this time they must have come What besides The next thing is for us to go and wish em joy I suppose Well no No Now I thought we must I must or twould be very unlike me the first in every spree that s going Do thou put on a fri ar s coat And I ll put on a no ther And we will to Queen Ele anor go Like Fri ar and his bro ther I met Mis ess Yeobright the young bride s aunt last night and she told me that her son Clym was coming home a Christmas Wonderful clever a believe ah I should like to have all that s under that young man s hair Well then I spoke to her in my well known merry way and she said O that what s shaped so venerable should talk like a fool that s what she said to me I don t care for her be jowned if I do and so I told her Be jowned if I care for ee I said I had her there hey I rather think she had you said Fairway No said Grandfer Cantle his countenance slightly flagging Tisn t so bad as that with me Seemingly tis however is it because of the wedding that Clym is coming home a Christmas to make a new arrangement because his mother is now left in the house alone Yes yes that s it But Timothy hearken to me said the Grandfer earnestly Though known as such a joker I be an understanding man if you catch me serious and I am serious now I can tell ee lots about the married couple Yes this morning at six o clock they went up the country to do the job and neither vell nor mark have been seen of em since though I reckon that this afternoon has brought em home again man and woman wife that is Isn t it spoke like a man Timothy and wasn t Mis ess Yeobright wrong about me Yes it will do I didn t know the two had walked together since last fall when her aunt forbad the banns How long has this new set to been in mangling then Do you know Humphrey Yes how long said Grandfer Cantle smartly likewise turning to Humphrey I ask that question Ever since her aunt altered her mind and said she might have the man after all replied Humphrey without removing his eyes from the fire He was a somewhat solemn young fellow and carried the hook and leather gloves of a furze cutter his legs by reason of that occupation being sheathed in bulging leggings as stiff as the Philistine s greaves of brass That s why they went away to be married I count You see after kicking up such a nunny watch and forbidding the banns twould have made Mis ess Yeobright seem foolish like to have a banging wedding in the same parish all as if she d never gainsaid it Exactly seem foolish like and that s very bad for the poor things that be so though I only guess as much to be sure said Grandfer Cantle still strenuously preserving a sensible bearing and mien Ah well I was at church that day said Fairway which was a very curious thing to happen If twasn t my name s Simple said the Grandfer emphatically I ha n t been there to year and now the winter is a coming on I won t say I shall I ha n t been these three years said Humphrey for I m so dead sleepy of a Sunday and tis so terrible far to get there and when you do get there tis such a mortal poor chance that you ll be chose for up above when so many bain t that I bide at home and don t go at all I not only happened to be there said Fairway with a fresh collection of emphasis but I was sitting in the same pew as Mis ess Yeobright And though you may not see it as such it fairly made my blood run cold to hear her Yes it is a curious thing but it made my blood run cold for I was close at her elbow The speaker looked round upon the bystanders now drawing closer to hear him with his lips gathered tighter than ever in the rigorousness of his descriptive moderation Tis a serious job to have things happen to ee there said a woman behind Ye are to declare it was the parson s words Fairway continued And then up stood a woman at my side a touching of me Well be damned if there isn t Mis ess Yeobright a standing up I said to myself Yes neighbours though I was in the temple of prayer that s what I said Tis against my conscience to curse and swear in company and I hope any woman here will overlook it Still what I did say I did say and twould be a lie if I didn t own it So twould neighbour Fairway Be damned if there isn t Mis ess Yeobright a standing up I said the narrator repeated giving out the bad word with the same passionless severity of face as before which proved how entirely necessity and not gusto had to do with the iteration And the next thing I heard was I forbid the banns from her I ll speak to you after the service said the parson in quite a homely way yes turning all at once into a common man no holier than you or I Ah her face was pale Maybe you can call to mind that monument in Weatherbury church the cross legged soldier that have had his arm knocked away by the schoolchildren Well he would about have matched that woman s face when she said I forbid the banns The audience cleared their throats and tossed a few stalks into the fire not because these deeds were urgent but to give themselves time to weigh the moral of the story I m sure when I heard they d been forbid I felt as glad as if anybody had gied me sixpence said an earnest voice that of Olly Dowden a woman who lived by making heath brooms or besoms Her nature was to be civil to enemies as well as to friends and grateful to all the world for letting her remain alive And now the maid have married him just the same said Humphrey After that Mis ess Yeobright came round and was quite agreeable Fairway resumed with an unheeding air to show that his words were no appendage to Humphrey s but the result of independent reflection Supposing they were ashamed I don t see why they shouldn t have done it here right said a wide spread woman whose stays creaked like shoes whenever she stooped or turned Tis well to call the neighbours together and to hae a good racket once now and then and it may as well be when there s a wedding as at tide times I don t care for close ways Ah now you d hardly believe it but I don t care for gay weddings said Timothy Fairway his eyes again travelling round I hardly blame Thomasin Yeobright and neighbour Wildeve for doing it quiet if I must own it A wedding at home means five and six handed reels by the hour and they do a man s legs no good when he s over forty True Once at the woman s house you can hardly say nay to being one in a jig knowing all the time that you be expected to make yourself worth your victuals You be bound to dance at Christmas because tis the time o year you must dance at weddings because tis the time o life At christenings folk will even smuggle in a reel or two if tis no further on than the first or second chiel And this is not naming the songs you ve got to sing For my part I like a good hearty funeral as well as anything You ve as splendid victuals and drink as at other parties and even better And it don t wear your legs to stumps in talking over a poor fellow s ways as it do to stand up in hornpipes Nine folks out of ten would own twas going too far to dance then I suppose suggested Grandfer Cantle Tis the only sort of party a staid man can feel safe at after the mug have been round a few times Well I can t understand a quiet ladylike little body like Tamsin Yeobright caring to be married in such a mean way said Susan Nunsuch the wide woman who preferred the original subject Tis worse than the poorest do And I shouldn t have cared about the man though some may say he s good looking To give him his due he s a clever learned fellow in his way a most as clever as Clym Yeobright used to be He was brought up to better things than keeping the Quiet Woman An engineer that s what the man was as we know but he threw away his chance and so a took a public house to live His learning was no use to him at all Very often the case said Olly the besom maker And yet how people do strive after it and get it The class of folk that couldn t use to make a round O to save their bones from the pit can write their names now without a sputter of the pen oftentimes without a single blot what do I say why almost without a desk to lean their stomachs and elbows upon True tis amazing what a polish the world have been brought to said Humphrey Why afore I went a soldier in the Bang up Locals as we was called in the year four chimed in Grandfer Cantle brightly I didn t know no more what the world was like than the commonest man among ye And now jown it all I won t say what I bain t fit for hey Couldst sign the book no doubt said Fairway if wast young enough to join hands with a woman again like Wildeve and Mis ess Tamsin which is more than Humph there could do for he follows his father in learning Ah Humph well I can mind when I was married how I zid thy father s mark staring me in the face as I went to put down my name He and your mother were the couple married just afore we were and there stood they father s cross with arms stretched out like a great banging scarecrow What a terrible black cross that was thy father s very likeness in en To save my soul I couldn t help laughing when I zid en though all the time I was as hot as dog days what with the marrying and what with the woman a hanging to me and what with Jack Changley and a lot more chaps grinning at me through church window But the next moment a strawmote would have knocked me down for I called to mind that if thy father and mother had had high words once they d been at it twenty times since they d been man and wife and I zid myself as the next poor stunpoll to get into the same mess Ah well what a day twas Wildeve is older than Tamsin Yeobright by a good few summers A pretty maid too she is A young woman with a home must be a fool to tear her smock for a man like that The speaker a peat or turf cutter who had newly joined the group carried across his shoulder the singular heart shaped spade of large dimensions used in that species of labour and its well whetted edge gleamed like a silver bow in the beams of the fire A hundred maidens would have had him if he d asked em said the wide woman Didst ever know a man neighbour that no woman at all would marry inquired Humphrey I never did said the turf cutter Nor I said another Nor I said Grandfer Cantle Well now I did once said Timothy Fairway adding more firmness to one of his legs I did know of such a man But only once mind He gave his throat a thorough rake round as if it were the duty of every person not to be mistaken through thickness of voice Yes I knew of such a man he said And what ghastly gallicrow might the poor fellow have been like Master Fairway asked the turf cutter Well a was neither a deaf man nor a dumb man nor a blind man What a was I don t say Is he known in these parts said Olly Dowden Hardly said Timothy but I name no name Come keep the fire up there youngsters Whatever is Christian Cantle s teeth a chattering for said a boy from amid the smoke and shades on the other side of the blaze Be ye a cold Christian A thin jibbering voice was heard to reply No not at all Come forward Christian and show yourself I didn t know you were here said Fairway with a humane look across towards that quarter Thus requested a faltering man with reedy hair no shoulders and a great quantity of wrist and ankle beyond his clothes advanced a step or two by his own will and was pushed by the will of others half a dozen steps more He was Grandfer Cantle s youngest son What be ye quaking for Christian said the turf cutter kindly I m the man What man The man no woman will marry The deuce you be said Timothy Fairway enlarging his gaze to cover Christian s whole surface and a great deal more Grandfer Cantle meanwhile staring as a hen stares at the duck she has hatched Yes I be he and it makes me afeard said Christian D ye think twill hurt me I shall always say I don t care and swear to it though I do care all the while Well be damned if this isn t the queerest start ever I know d said mister Fairway I didn t mean you at all There s another in the country then Why did ye reveal yer misfortune Christian Twas to be if twas I suppose I can t help it can I He turned upon them his painfully circular eyes surrounded by concentric lines like targets No that s true But tis a melancholy thing and my blood ran cold when you spoke for I felt there were two poor fellows where I had thought only one Tis a sad thing for ye Christian How saint know the women won t hae thee I ve asked em Sure I should never have thought you had the face Well and what did the last one say to ye Nothing that can t be got over perhaps after all Get out of my sight you slack twisted slim looking maphrotight fool was the woman s words to me Not encouraging I own said Fairway Get out of my sight you slack twisted slim looking maphrotight fool is rather a hard way of saying No But even that might be overcome by time and patience so as to let a few grey hairs show themselves in the hussy s head How old be you Christian Thirty one last tatie digging Mister Fairway Not a boy not a boy Still there s hope yet That s my age by baptism because that s put down in the great book of the Judgment that they keep in church vestry but Mother told me I was born some time afore I was christened Ah But she couldn t tell when to save her life except that there was no moon No moon that s bad Hey neighbours that s bad for him Yes tis bad said Grandfer Cantle shaking his head Mother know d twas no moon for she asked another woman that had an almanac as she did whenever a boy was born to her because of the saying No moon no man which made her afeard every man child she had Do ye really think it serious Mister Fairway that there was no moon Yes No moon no man Tis one of the truest sayings ever spit out The boy never comes to anything that s born at new moon A bad job for thee Christian that you should have showed your nose then of all days in the month I suppose the moon was terrible full when you were born said Christian with a look of hopeless admiration at Fairway Well a was not new mister Fairway replied with a disinterested gaze I d sooner go without drink at Lammas tide than be a man of no moon continued Christian in the same shattered recitative Tis said I be only the rames of a man and no good for my race at all and I suppose that s the cause o t Ay said Grandfer Cantle somewhat subdued in spirit and yet his mother cried for scores of hours when a was a boy for fear he should outgrow hisself and go for a soldier Well there s many just as bad as he said Fairway Wethers must live their time as well as other sheep poor soul So perhaps I shall rub on Ought I to be afeared o nights Master Fairway You ll have to lie alone all your life and tis not to married couples but to single sleepers that a ghost shows himself when a do come One has been seen lately too A very strange one No don t talk about it if tis agreeable of ye not to Twill make my skin crawl when I think of it in bed alone But you will ah you will I know Timothy and I shall dream all night o t A very strange one What sort of a spirit did ye mean when ye said a very strange one Timothy no no don t tell me I don t half believe in spirits myself But I think it ghostly enough what I was told Twas a little boy that zid it What was it like no don t A red one Yes most ghosts be white but this is as if it had been dipped in blood Christian drew a deep breath without letting it expand his body and Humphrey said Where has it been seen Not exactly here but in this same heth But tisn t a thing to talk about What do ye say continued Fairway in brisker tones and turning upon them as if the idea had not been Grandfer Cantle s what do you say to giving the new man and wife a bit of a song tonight afore we go to bed being their wedding day When folks are just married tis as well to look glad o t since looking sorry won t unjoin em I am no drinker as we know but when the womenfolk and youngsters have gone home we can drop down across to the Quiet Woman and strike up a ballet in front of the married folks door Twill please the young wife and that s what I should like to do for many s the skinful I ve had at her hands when she lived with her aunt at Blooms End Hey And so we will said Grandfer Cantle turning so briskly that his copper seals swung extravagantly I m as dry as a kex with biding up here in the wind and I haven t seen the colour of drink since nammet time today Tis said that the last brew at the Woman is very pretty drinking And neighbours if we should be a little late in the finishing why tomorrow s Sunday and we can sleep it off Grandfer Cantle you take things very careless for an old man said the wide woman I take things careless I do too careless to please the women Klk I ll sing the Jovial Crew or any other song when a weak old man would cry his eyes out Jown it I am up for anything The king look d o ver his left shoul der And a grim look look ed hee Earl Mar shal he said but for my oath Or hang ed thou shouldst bee Well that s what we ll do said Fairway We ll give em a song an it please the Lord What s the good of Thomasin s cousin Clym a coming home after the deed s done He should have come afore if so be he wanted to stop it and marry her himself Perhaps he s coming to bide with his mother a little time as she must feel lonely now the maid s gone Now tis very odd but I never feel lonely no not at all said Grandfer Cantle I am as brave in the nighttime as a admiral The bonfire was by this time beginning to sink low for the fuel had not been of that substantial sort which can support a blaze long Most of the other fires within the wide horizon were also dwindling weak Attentive observation of their brightness colour and length of existence would have revealed the quality of the material burnt and through that to some extent the natural produce of the district in which each bonfire was situate The clear kingly effulgence that had characterized the majority expressed a heath and furze country like their own which in one direction extended an unlimited number of miles the rapid flares and extinctions at other points of the compass showed the lightest of fuel straw beanstalks and the usual waste from arable land The most enduring of all steady unaltering eyes like Planets signified wood such as hazel branches thorn faggots and stout billets Fires of the last mentioned materials were rare and though comparatively small in magnitude beside the transient blazes now began to get the best of them by mere long continuance The great ones had perished but these remained They occupied the remotest visible positions sky backed summits rising out of rich coppice and plantation districts to the north where the soil was different and heath foreign and strange Save one and this was the nearest of any the moon of the whole shining throng It lay in a direction precisely opposite to that of the little window in the vale below Its nearness was such that notwithstanding its actual smallness its glow infinitely transcended theirs This quiet eye had attracted attention from time to time and when their own fire had become sunken and dim it attracted more some even of the wood fires more recently lighted had reached their decline but no change was perceptible here To be sure how near that fire is said Fairway Seemingly I can see a fellow of some sort walking round it Little and good must be said of that fire surely I can throw a stone there said the boy And so can I said Grandfer Cantle No no you can t my sonnies That fire is not much less than a mile off for all that a seems so near Tis in the heath but no furze said the turf cutter Tis cleft wood that s what tis said Timothy Fairway Nothing would burn like that except clean timber And tis on the knap afore the old captain s house at Mistover Such a queer mortal as that man is To have a little fire inside your own bank and ditch that nobody else may enjoy it or come anigh it And what a zany an old chap must be to light a bonfire when there s no youngsters to please Cap n Vye has been for a long walk today and is quite tired out said Grandfer Cantle so tisn t likely to be he And he would hardly afford good fuel like that said the wide woman Then it must be his granddaughter said Fairway Not that a body of her age can want a fire much She is very strange in her ways living up there by herself and such things please her said Susan She s a well favoured maid enough said Humphrey the furze cutter especially when she s got one of her dandy gowns on That s true said Fairway Well let her bonfire burn an t will Ours is well nigh out by the look o t How dark tis now the fire s gone down said Christian Cantle looking behind him with his hare eyes Don t ye think we d better get home along neighbours The heth isn t haunted I know but we d better get home Ah what was that Only the wind said the turf cutter I don t think Fifth of Novembers ought to be kept up by night except in towns It should be by day in outstep ill accounted places like this Nonsense Christian Lift up your spirits like a man Susy dear you and I will have a jig hey my honey before tis quite too dark to see how well favoured you be still though so many summers have passed since your husband a son of a witch snapped you up from me This was addressed to Susan Nunsuch and the next circumstance of which the beholders were conscious was a vision of the matron s broad form whisking off towards the space whereon the fire had been kindled She was lifted bodily by mister Fairway s arm which had been flung round her waist before she had become aware of his intention The site of the fire was now merely a circle of ashes flecked with red embers and sparks the furze having burnt completely away Once within the circle he whirled her round and round in a dance She was a woman noisily constructed in addition to her enclosing framework of whalebone and lath she wore pattens summer and winter in wet weather and in dry to preserve her boots from wear and when Fairway began to jump about with her the clicking of the pattens the creaking of the stays and her screams of surprise formed a very audible concert I ll crack thy numskull for thee you mandy chap said missus Nunsuch as she helplessly danced round with him her feet playing like drumsticks among the sparks My ankles were all in a fever before from walking through that prickly furze and now you must make em worse with these vlankers The vagary of Timothy Fairway was infectious The turf cutter seized old Olly Dowden and somewhat more gently poussetted with her likewise The young men were not slow to imitate the example of their elders and seized the maids Grandfer Cantle and his stick jigged in the form of a three legged object among the rest and in half a minute all that could be seen on Rainbarrow was a whirling of dark shapes amid a boiling confusion of sparks which leapt around the dancers as high as their waists The chief noises were women s shrill cries men s laughter Susan s stays and pattens Olly Dowden s heu heu heu and the strumming of the wind upon the furze bushes which formed a kind of tune to the demoniac measure they trod Christian alone stood aloof uneasily rocking himself as he murmured They ought not to do it how the vlankers do fly tis tempting the Wicked one tis What was that said one of the lads stopping Ah where said Christian hastily closing up to the rest The dancers all lessened their speed Twas behind you Christian that I heard it down here Yes tis behind me Christian said Matthew Mark Luke and John bless the bed that I lie on four angels guard Hold your tongue What is it said Fairway Hoi i i i cried a voice from the darkness Halloo o o o said Fairway Is there any cart track up across here to Mis ess Yeobright s of Blooms End came to them in the same voice as a long slim indistinct figure approached the barrow Ought we not to run home as hard as we can neighbours as tis getting late said Christian Not run away from one another you know run close together I mean Scrape up a few stray locks of furze and make a blaze so that we can see who the man is said Fairway When the flame arose it revealed a young man in tight raiment and red from top to toe Is there a track across here to Mis ess Yeobright s house he repeated Ay keep along the path down there I mean a way two horses and a van can travel over Well yes you can get up the vale below here with time The track is rough but if you ve got a light your horses may pick along wi care Have ye brought your cart far up neighbour reddleman I ve left it in the bottom about half a mile back I stepped on in front to make sure of the way as tis night time and I han t been here for so long Oh well you can get up said Fairway What a turn it did give me when I saw him he added to the whole group the reddleman included Lord s sake I thought whatever fiery mommet is this come to trouble us No slight to your looks reddleman for ye bain t bad looking in the groundwork though the finish is queer My meaning is just to say how curious I felt I half thought it twas the devil or the red ghost the boy told of It gied me a turn likewise said Susan Nunsuch for I had a dream last night of a death s head Don t ye talk o t no more said Christian If he had a handkerchief over his head he d look for all the world like the Devil in the picture of the Temptation Well thank you for telling me said the young reddleman smiling faintly And good night t ye all He withdrew from their sight down the barrow I fancy I ve seen that young man s face before said Humphrey But where or how or what his name is I don t know The reddleman had not been gone more than a few minutes when another person approached the partially revived bonfire It proved to be a well known and respected widow of the neighbourhood of a standing which can only be expressed by the word genteel Her face encompassed by the blackness of the receding heath showed whitely and with out half lights like a cameo She was a woman of middle age with well formed features of the type usually found where perspicacity is the chief quality enthroned within At moments she seemed to be regarding issues from a Nebo denied to others around She had something of an estranged mien the solitude exhaled from the heath was concentrated in this face that had risen from it The air with which she looked at the heathmen betokened a certain unconcern at their presence or at what might be their opinions of her for walking in that lonely spot at such an hour thus indirectly implying that in some respect or other they were not up to her level The explanation lay in the fact that though her husband had been a small farmer she herself was a curate s daughter who had once dreamt of doing better things Persons with any weight of character carry like planets their atmospheres along with them in their orbits and the matron who entered now upon the scene could and usually did bring her own tone into a company Her normal manner among the heathfolk had that reticence which results from the consciousness of superior communicative power But the effect of coming into society and light after lonely wandering in darkness is a sociability in the comer above its usual pitch expressed in the features even more than in words Why tis Mis ess Yeobright said Fairway Mis ess Yeobright not ten minutes ago a man was here asking for you a reddleman What did he want said she He didn t tell us Something to sell I suppose what it can be I am at a loss to understand I am glad to hear that your son mister Clym is coming home at Christmas ma am said Sam the turf cutter What a dog he used to be for bonfires Yes I believe he is coming she said He must be a fine fellow by this time said Fairway He is a man now she replied quietly Tis very lonesome for ee in the heth tonight mis ess said Christian coming from the seclusion he had hitherto maintained Mind you don t get lost Egdon Heth is a bad place to get lost in and the winds do huffle queerer tonight than ever I heard em afore Them that know Egdon best have been pixy led here at times Is that you Christian said missus Yeobright What made you hide away from me Twas that I didn t know you in this light mis ess and being a man of the mournfullest make I was scared a little that s all Oftentimes if you could see how terrible down I get in my mind twould make ee quite nervous for fear I should die by my hand You don t take after your father said missus Yeobright looking towards the fire where Grandfer Cantle with some want of originality was dancing by himself among the sparks as the others had done before Now Grandfer said Timothy Fairway we are ashamed of ye A reverent old patriarch man as you be seventy if a day to go hornpiping like that by yourself A harrowing old man Mis ess Yeobright said Christian despondingly I wouldn t live with him a week so playward as he is if I could get away Twould be more seemly in ye to stand still and welcome Mis ess Yeobright and you the venerablest here Grandfer Cantle said the besom woman Faith and so it would said the reveller checking himself repentantly I ve such a bad memory Mis ess Yeobright that I forget how I m looked up to by the rest of em My spirits must be wonderful good you ll say But not always Tis a weight upon a man to be looked up to as commander and I often feel it I am sorry to stop the talk said missus Yeobright But I must be leaving you now I was passing down the Anglebury Road towards my niece s new home who is returning tonight with her husband and seeing the bonfire and hearing Olly s voice among the rest I came up here to learn what was going on I should like her to walk with me as her way is mine Ay sure ma am I m just thinking of moving said Olly Why you ll be safe to meet the reddleman that I told ye of said Fairway He s only gone back to get his van We heard that your niece and her husband were coming straight home as soon as they were married and we are going down there shortly to give em a song o welcome Thank you indeed said missus Yeobright But we shall take a shorter cut through the furze than you can go with long clothes so we won t trouble you to wait Very well are you ready Olly Yes ma am And there s a light shining from your niece s window see It will help to keep us in the path She indicated the faint light at the bottom of the valley which Fairway had pointed out and the two women descended the tumulus four The Halt on the Turnpike Road Down downward they went and yet further down their descent at each step seeming to outmeasure their advance Their skirts were scratched noisily by the furze their shoulders brushed by the ferns which though dead and dry stood erect as when alive no sufficient winter weather having as yet arrived to beat them down Their Tartarean situation might by some have been called an imprudent one for two unattended women But these shaggy recesses were at all seasons a familiar surrounding to Olly and missus Yeobright and the addition of darkness lends no frightfulness to the face of a friend And so Tamsin has married him at last said Olly when the incline had become so much less steep that their foot steps no longer required undivided attention missus Yeobright answered slowly Yes at last How you will miss her living with ee as a daughter as she always have I do miss her Olly though without the tact to perceive when remarks were untimely was saved by her very simplicity from rendering them offensive Questions that would have been resented in others she could ask with impunity This accounted for missus Yeobright s acquiescence in the revival of an evidently sore subject I was quite strook to hear you d agreed to it ma am that I was continued the besom maker You were not more struck by it than I should have been last year this time Olly There are a good many sides to that wedding I could not tell you all of them even if I tried I felt myself that he was hardly solid going enough to mate with your family Keeping an inn what is it But a s clever that s true and they say he was an engineering gentleman once but has come down by being too outwardly given I saw that upon the whole it would be better she should marry where she wished Poor little thing her feelings got the better of her no doubt Tis nature Well they may call him what they will he ve several acres of heth ground broke up here besides the public house and the heth croppers and his manners be quite like a gentleman s And what s done cannot be undone It cannot said missus Yeobright See here s the wagon track at last Now we shall get along better The wedding subject was no further dwelt upon and soon a faint diverging path was reached where they parted company Olly first begging her companion to remind mister Wildeve that he had not sent her sick husband the bottle of wine promised on the occasion of his marriage The besom maker turned to the left towards her own house behind a spur of the hill and missus Yeobright followed the straight track which further on joined the highway by the Quiet Woman Inn whither she supposed her niece to have returned with Wildeve from their wedding at Anglebury that day She first reached Wildeve s Patch as it was called a plot of land redeemed from the heath and after long and laborious years brought into cultivation The man who had discovered that it could be tilled died of the labour the man who succeeded him in possession ruined himself in fertilizing it Wildeve came like Amerigo Vespucci and received the honours due to those who had gone before When missus Yeobright had drawn near to the inn and was about to enter she saw a horse and vehicle some two hundred yards beyond it coming towards her a man walking alongside with a lantern in his hand It was soon evident that this was the reddleman who had inquired for her Instead of entering the inn at once she walked by it and towards the van The conveyance came close and the man was about to pass her with little notice when she turned to him and said I think you have been inquiring for me I am missus Yeobright of Blooms End The reddleman started and held up his finger He stopped the horses and beckoned to her to withdraw with him a few yards aside which she did wondering You don t know me ma am I suppose he said I do not said she Why yes I do You are young Venn your father was a dairyman somewhere here Yes and I knew your niece Miss Tamsin a little I have something bad to tell you About her no She has just come home I believe with her husband They arranged to return this afternoon to the inn beyond here She s not there How do you know Because she s here She s in my van he added slowly What new trouble has come murmured missus Yeobright putting her hand over her eyes I can t explain much ma am All I know is that as I was going along the road this morning about a mile out of Anglebury I heard something trotting after me like a doe and looking round there she was white as death itself Oh Diggory Venn she said I thought twas you will you help me I am in trouble How did she know your Christian name said missus Yeobright doubtingly I had met her as a lad before I went away in this trade She asked then if she might ride and then down she fell in a faint I picked her up and put her in and there she has been ever since She has cried a good deal but she has hardly spoke all she has told me being that she was to have been married this morning I tried to get her to eat something but she couldn t and at last she fell asleep Let me see her at once said missus Yeobright hastening towards the van The reddleman followed with the lantern and stepping up first assisted missus Yeobright to mount beside him On the door being opened she perceived at the end of the van an extemporized couch around which was hung apparently all the drapery that the reddleman possessed to keep the occupant of the little couch from contact with the red materials of his trade A young girl lay thereon covered with a cloak She was asleep and the light of the lantern fell upon her features A fair sweet and honest country face was revealed reposing in a nest of wavy chestnut hair It was between pretty and beautiful Though her eyes were closed one could easily imagine the light necessarily shining in them as the culmination of the luminous workmanship around The groundwork of the face was hopefulness but over it now I ay like a foreign substance a film of anxiety and grief The grief had been there so shortly as to have abstracted nothing of the bloom and had as yet but given a dignity to what it might eventually undermine The scarlet of her lips had not had time to abate and just now it appeared still more intense by the absence of the neighbouring and more transient colour of her cheek The lips frequently parted with a murmur of words She seemed to belong rightly to a madrigal to require viewing through rhyme and harmony One thing at least was obvious she was not made to be looked at thus The reddleman had appeared conscious of as much and while missus Yeobright looked in upon her he cast his eyes aside with a delicacy which well became him The sleeper apparently thought so too for the next moment she opened her own The lips then parted with something of anticipation something more of doubt and her several thoughts and fractions of thoughts as signalled by the changes on her face were exhibited by the light to the utmost nicety An ingenuous transparent life was disclosed as if the flow of her existence could be seen passing within her She understood the scene in a moment O yes it is I Aunt she cried I know how frightened you are and how you cannot believe it but all the same it is I who have come home like this Tamsin Tamsin said missus Yeobright stooping over the young woman and kissing her O my dear girl Thomasin was now on the verge of a sob but by an unexpected self command she uttered no sound With a gentle panting breath she sat upright I did not expect to see you in this state any more than you me she went on quickly Where am I Aunt Nearly home my dear In Egdon Bottom What dreadful thing is it I ll tell you in a moment So near are we Then I will get out and walk I want to go home by the path But this kind man who has done so much will I am sure take you right on to my house said the aunt turning to the reddleman who had withdrawn from the front of the van on the awakening of the girl and stood in the road Why should you think it necessary to ask me I will of course said he He is indeed kind murmured Thomasin I was once acquainted with him Aunt and when I saw him today I thought I should prefer his van to any conveyance of a stranger But I ll walk now Reddleman stop the horses please The man regarded her with tender reluctance but stopped them Aunt and niece then descended from the van missus Yeobright saying to its owner I quite recognize you now What made you change from the nice business your father left you Well I did he said and looked at Thomasin who blushed a little Then you ll not be wanting me any more tonight ma am missus Yeobright glanced around at the dark sky at the hills at the perishing bonfires and at the lighted window of the inn they had neared I think not she said since Thomasin wishes to walk We can soon run up the path and reach home we know it well And after a few further words they parted the reddleman moving onwards with his van and the two women remaining standing in the road As soon as the vehicle and its driver had withdrawn so far as to be beyond all possible reach of her voice missus Yeobright turned to her niece Now Thomasin she said sternly what s the meaning of this disgraceful performance five Perplexity among Honest People Thomasin looked as if quite overcome by her aunt s change of manner It means just what it seems to mean I am not married she replied faintly Excuse me for humiliating you Aunt by this mishap I am sorry for it But I cannot help it Me Think of yourself first It was nobody s fault When we got there the parson wouldn t marry us because of some trifling irregularity in the license What irregularity I don t know mister Wildeve can explain I did not think when I went away this morning that I should come back like this It being dark Thomasin allowed her emotion to escape her by the silent way of tears which could roll down her cheek unseen I could almost say that it serves you right if I did not feel that you don t deserve it continued missus Yeobright who possessing two distinct moods in close contiguity a gentle mood and an angry flew from one to the other without the least warning Remember Thomasin this business was none of my seeking from the very first when you began to feel foolish about that man I warned you he would not make you happy I felt it so strongly that I did what I would never have believed myself capable of doing stood up in the church and made myself the public talk for weeks But having once consented I don t submit to these fancies without good reason Marry him you must after this Do you think I wish to do otherwise for one moment said Thomasin with a heavy sigh I know how wrong it was of me to love him but don t pain me by talking like that Aunt You would not have had me stay there with him would you and your house is the only home I have to return to He says we can be married in a day or two I wish he had never seen you Very well then I will be the miserablest woman in the world and not let him see me again No I won t have him It is too late to speak so Come with me I am going to the inn to see if he has returned Of course I shall get to the bottom of this story at once mister Wildeve must not suppose he can play tricks upon me or any belonging to me It was not that The license was wrong and he couldn t get another the same day He will tell you in a moment how it was if he comes Why didn t he bring you back That was me again sobbed Thomasin When I found we could not be married I didn t like to come back with him and I was very ill Then I saw Diggory Venn and was glad to get him to take me home I cannot explain it any better and you must be angry with me if you will I shall see about that said missus Yeobright and they turned towards the inn known in the neighbourhood as the Quiet Woman the sign of which represented the figure of a matron carrying her head under her arm beneath which gruesome design was written the couplet so well known to frequenters of the inn SINCE THE WOMAN S QUIET LET NO MAN BREED A RIOT one one The inn which really bore this sign and legend stood some miles to the northwest of the present scene wherein the house more immediately referred to is now no longer an inn and the surroundings are much changed But another inn some of whose features are also embodied in this description the RED LION at Winfrith still remains as a haven for the wayfarer nineteen twelve The front of the house was towards the heath and Rainbarrow whose dark shape seemed to threaten it from the sky Upon the door was a neglected brass plate bearing the unexpected inscription mister Wildeve Engineer a useless yet cherished relic from the time when he had been started in that profession in an office at Budmouth by those who had hoped much from him and had been disappointed The garden was at the back and behind this ran a still deep stream forming the margin of the heath in that direction meadow land appearing beyond the stream But the thick obscurity permitted only skylines to be visible of any scene at present The water at the back of the house could be heard idly spinning whirpools in its creep between the rows of dry feather headed reeds which formed a stockade along each bank Their presence was denoted by sounds as of a congregation praying humbly produced by their rubbing against each other in the slow wind The window whence the candlelight had shone up the vale to the eyes of the bonfire group was uncurtained but the sill lay too high for a pedestrian on the outside to look over it into the room A vast shadow in which could be dimly traced portions of a masculine contour blotted half the ceiling He seems to be at home said missus Yeobright Must I come in too Aunt asked Thomasin faintly I suppose not it would be wrong You must come certainly to confront him so that he may make no false representations to me We shall not be five minutes in the house and then we ll walk home Entering the open passage she tapped at the door of the private parlour unfastened it and looked in The back and shoulders of a man came between missus Yeobright s eyes and the fire Wildeve whose form it was immediately turned arose and advanced to meet his visitors He was quite a young man and of the two properties form and motion the latter first attracted the eye in him The grace of his movement was singular it was the pantomimic expression of a lady killing career Next came into notice the more material qualities among which was a profuse crop of hair impending over the top of his face lending to his forehead the high cornered outline of an early Gothic shield and a neck which was smooth and round as a cylinder The lower half of his figure was of light build Altogether he was one in whom no man would have seen anything to admire and in whom no woman would have seen anything to dislike He discerned the young girl s form in the passage and said Thomasin then has reached home How could you leave me in that way darling And turning to missus Yeobright It was useless to argue with her She would go and go alone But what s the meaning of it all demanded missus Yeobright haughtily Take a seat said Wildeve placing chairs for the two women Well it was a very stupid mistake but such mistakes will happen The license was useless at Anglebury It was made out for Budmouth but as I didn t read it I wasn t aware of that But you had been staying at Anglebury No I had been at Budmouth till two days ago and that was where I had intended to take her but when I came to fetch her we decided upon Anglebury forgetting that a new license would be necessary There was not time to get to Budmouth afterwards I think you are very much to blame said missus Yeobright It was quite my fault we chose Anglebury Thomasin pleaded I proposed it because I was not known there I know so well that I am to blame that you need not remind me of it replied Wildeve shortly Such things don t happen for nothing said the aunt It is a great slight to me and my family and when it gets known there will be a very unpleasant time for us How can she look her friends in the face tomorrow It is a very great injury and one I cannot easily forgive It may even reflect on her character Nonsense said Wildeve Thomasin s large eyes had flown from the face of one to the face of the other during this discussion and she now said anxiously Will you allow me Aunt to talk it over alone with Damon for five minutes Will you Damon Certainly dear said Wildeve if your aunt will excuse us He led her into an adjoining room leaving missus Yeobright by the fire As soon as they were alone and the door closed Thomasin said turning up her pale tearful face to him It is killing me this Damon I did not mean to part from you in anger at Anglebury this morning but I was frightened and hardly knew what I said I ve not let Aunt know how much I suffered today and it is so hard to command my face and voice and to smile as if it were a slight thing to me but I try to do so that she may not be still more indignant with you I know you could not help it dear whatever Aunt may think She is very unpleasant Yes Thomasin murmured and I suppose I seem so now Damon what do you mean to do about me Do about you Yes Those who don t like you whisper things which at moments make me doubt you We mean to marry I suppose don t we Of course we do We have only to go to Budmouth on Monday and we marry at once Then do let us go O Damon what you make me say She hid her face in her handkerchief Here am I asking you to marry me when by rights you ought to be on your knees imploring me your cruel mistress not to refuse you and saying it would break your heart if I did I used to think it would be pretty and sweet like that but how different Yes real life is never at all like that But I don t care personally if it never takes place she added with a little dignity no I can live without you It is Aunt I think of She is so proud and thinks so much of her family respectability that she will be cut down with mortification if this story should get abroad before it is done My cousin Clym too will be much wounded Then he will be very unreasonable In fact you are all rather unreasonable Thomasin coloured a little and not with love But whatever the momentary feeling which caused that flush in her it went as it came and she humbly said I never mean to be if I can help it I merely feel that you have my aunt to some extent in your power at last As a matter of justice it is almost due to me said Wildeve Think what I have gone through to win her consent the insult that it is to any man to have the banns forbidden the double insult to a man unlucky enough to be cursed with sensitiveness and blue demons and Heaven knows what as I am I can never forget those banns A harsher man would rejoice now in the power I have of turning upon your aunt by going no further in the business She looked wistfully at him with her sorrowful eyes as he said those words and her aspect showed that more than one person in the room could deplore the possession of sensitiveness Seeing that she was really suffering he seemed disturbed and added This is merely a reflection you know I have not the least intention to refuse to complete the marriage Tamsie mine I could not bear it You could not I know said the fair girl brightening You who cannot bear the sight of pain in even an insect or any disagreeable sound or unpleasant smell even will not long cause pain to me and mine I will not if I can help it Your hand upon it Damon He carelessly gave her his hand Ah by my crown what s that he said suddenly There fell upon their ears the sound of numerous voices singing in front of the house Among these two made themselves prominent by their peculiarity one was a very strong bass the other a wheezy thin piping Thomasin recognized them as belonging to Timothy Fairway and Grandfer Cantle respectively What does it mean it is not skimmity riding I hope she said with a frightened gaze at Wildeve Of course not no it is that the heath folk have come to sing to us a welcome This is intolerable He began pacing about the men outside singing cheerily He told her that she was the joy of his life And if she d con sent he would make her his wife She could not refuse him to church so they went Young Will was forgot and young Sue was content And then was she kiss d and set down on his knee No man in the world was so lov ing as he missus Yeobright burst in from the outer room Thomasin Thomasin she said looking indignantly at Wildeve here s a pretty exposure Let us escape at once Come It was however too late to get away by the passage A rugged knocking had begun upon the door of the front room Wildeve who had gone to the window came back Stop he said imperiously putting his hand upon missus Yeobright s arm We are regularly besieged There are fifty of them out there if there s one You stay in this room with Thomasin I ll go out and face them You must stay now for my sake till they are gone so that it may seem as if all was right Come Tamsie dear don t go making a scene we must marry after this that you can see as well as I Sit still that s all and don t speak much I ll manage them Blundering fools He pressed the agitated girl into a seat returned to the outer room and opened the door Immediately outside in the passage appeared Grandfer Cantle singing in concert with those still standing in front of the house He came into the room and nodded abstractedly to Wildeve his lips still parted and his features excruciatingly strained in the emission of the chorus This being ended he said heartily Here s welcome to the new made couple and God bless em Thank you said Wildeve with dry resentment his face as gloomy as a thunderstorm At the Grandfer s heels now came the rest of the group which included Fairway Christian Sam the turf cutter Humphrey and a dozen others All smiled upon Wildeve and upon his tables and chairs likewise from a general sense of friendliness towards the articles as well as towards their owner We be not here afore missus Yeobright after all said Fairway recognizing the matron s bonnet through the glass partition which divided the public apartment they had entered from the room where the women sat We struck down across d ye see mister Wildeve and she went round by the path And I see the young bride s little head said Grandfer peeping in the same direction and discerning Thomasin who was waiting beside her aunt in a miserable and awkward way Not quite settled in yet well well there s plenty of time Wildeve made no reply and probably feeling that the sooner he treated them the sooner they would go he produced a stone jar which threw a warm halo over matters at once That s a drop of the right sort I can see said Grandfer Cantle with the air of a man too well mannered to show any hurry to taste it Yes said Wildeve tis some old mead I hope you will like it O ay replied the guests in the hearty tones natural when the words demanded by politeness coincide with those of deepest feeling There isn t a prettier drink under the sun I ll take my oath there isn t added Grandfer Cantle All that can be said against mead is that tis rather heady and apt to lie about a man a good while But tomorrow s Sunday thank God I feel d for all the world like some bold soldier after I had had some once said Christian You shall feel so again said Wildeve with condescension Cups or glasses gentlemen Well if you don t mind we ll have the beaker and pass en round tis better than heling it out in dribbles Jown the slippery glasses said Grandfer Cantle What s the good of a thing that you can t put down in the ashes to warm hey neighbours that s what I ask Right Grandfer said Sam and the mead then circulated Well said Timothy Fairway feeling demands upon his praise in some form or other tis a worthy thing to be married mister Wildeve and the woman you ve got is a dimant so says I Yes he continued to Grandfer Cantle raising his voice so as to be heard through the partition her father inclining his head towards the inner room was as good a feller as ever lived He always had his great indignation ready against anything underhand Is that very dangerous said Christian And there were few in these parts that were upsides with him said Sam Whenever a club walked he d play the clarinet in the band that marched before em as if he d never touched anything but a clarinet all his life And then when they got to church door he d throw down the clarinet mount the gallery snatch up the bass viol and rozum away as if he d never played anything but a bass viol Folk would say folk that knowed what a true stave was Surely surely that s never the same man that I saw handling the clarinet so masterly by now I can mind it said the furze cutter Twas a wonderful thing that one body could hold it all and never mix the fingering There was Kingsbere church likewise Fairway recommenced as one opening a new vein of the same mine of interest Wildeve breathed the breath of one intolerably bored and glanced through the partition at the prisoners He used to walk over there of a Sunday afternoon to visit his old acquaintance Andrew Brown the first clarinet there a good man enough but rather screechy in his music if you can mind A was And neighbour Yeobright would take Andrey s place for some part of the service to let Andrey have a bit of a nap as any friend would naturally do As any friend would said Grandfer Cantle the other listeners expressing the same accord by the shorter way of nodding their heads No sooner was Andrey asleep and the first whiff of neighbour Yeobright s wind had got inside Andrey s clarinet than everyone in church feeled in a moment there was a great soul among em All heads would turn and they d say Ah I thought twas he One Sunday I can well mind a bass viol day that time and Yeobright had brought his own Twas the Hundred and thirty third to Lydia and when they d come to Ran down his beard and o er his robes its costly moisture shed neighbour Yeobright who had just warmed to his work drove his bow into them strings that glorious grand that he e en a most sawed the bass viol into two pieces Every winder in church rattled as if twere a thunderstorm Old Pa son Williams lifted his hands in his great holy surplice as natural as if he d been in common clothes and seemed to say hisself O for such a man in our parish But not a soul in Kingsbere could hold a candle to Yeobright Was it quite safe when the winder shook Christian inquired He received no answer all for the moment sitting rapt in admiration of the performance described As with Farinelli s singing before the princesses Sheridan s renowned Begum Speech and other such examples the fortunate condition of its being for ever lost to the world invested the deceased mister Yeobright s tour de force on that memorable afternoon with a cumulative glory which comparative criticism had that been possible might considerably have shorn down He was the last you d have expected to drop off in the prime of life said Humphrey Ah well he was looking for the earth some months afore he went At that time women used to run for smocks and gown pieces at Greenhill Fair and my wife that is now being a long legged slittering maid hardly husband high went with the rest of the maidens for a was a good runner afore she got so heavy When she came home I said we were then just beginning to walk together What have ye got my honey I ve won well I ve won a gown piece says she her colours coming up in a moment Tis a smock for a crown I thought and so it turned out Ay when I think what she ll say to me now without a mossel of red in her face it do seem strange that a wouldn t say such a little thing then However then she went on and that s what made me bring up the story Well whatever clothes I ve won white or figured for eyes to see or for eyes not to see a could do a pretty stroke of modesty in those days I d sooner have lost it than have seen what I have Poor mister Yeobright was took bad directly he reached the fair ground and was forced to go home again That was the last time he ever went out of the parish A faltered on from one day to another and then we heard he was gone D ye think he had great pain when a died said Christian O no quite different Nor any pain of mind He was lucky enough to be God A mighty s own man And other folk d ye think twill be much pain to em Mister Fairway That depends on whether they be afeard I bain t afeard at all I thank God said Christian strenuously I m glad I bain t for then twon t pain me I don t think I be afeard or if I be I can t help it and I don t deserve to suffer I wish I was not afeard at all There was a solemn silence and looking from the window which was unshuttered and unblinded Timothy said Well what a fess little bonfire that one is out by Cap n Vye s Tis burning just the same now as ever upon my life All glances went through the window and nobody noticed that Wildeve disguised a brief telltale look Far away up the sombre valley of heath and to the right of Rainbarrow could indeed be seen the light small but steady and persistent as before It was lighted before ours was Fairway continued and yet every one in the country round is out afore n Perhaps there s meaning in it murmured Christian How meaning said Wildeve sharply Christian was too scattered to reply and Timothy helped him He means sir that the lonesome dark eyed creature up there that some say is a witch ever I should call a fine young woman such a name is always up to some odd conceit or other and so perhaps tis she I d be very glad to ask her in wedlock if she d hae me and take the risk of her wild dark eyes ill wishing me said Grandfer Cantle staunchly Don t ye say it Father implored Christian Well be dazed if he who do marry the maid won t hae an uncommon picture for his best parlour said Fairway in a liquid tone placing down the cup of mead at the end of a good pull And a partner as deep as the North Star said Sam taking up the cup and finishing the little that remained Well really now I think we must be moving said Humphrey observing the emptiness of the vessel But we ll gie em another song said Grandfer Cantle I m as full of notes as a bird Thank you Grandfer said Wildeve But we will not trouble you now Some other day must do for that when I have a party Be jown d if I don t learn ten new songs for t or I won t learn a line said Grandfer Cantle And you may be sure I won t disappoint ye by biding away mister Wildeve I quite believe you said that gentleman All then took their leave wishing their entertainer long life and happiness as a married man with recapitulations which occupied some time Wildeve attended them to the door beyond which the deep dyed upward stretch of heath stood awaiting them an amplitude of darkness reigning from their feet almost to the zenith where a definite form first became visible in the lowering forehead of Rainbarrow Diving into the dense obscurity in a line headed by Sam the turf cutter they pursued their trackless way home When the scratching of the furze against their leggings had fainted upon the ear Wildeve returned to the room where he had left Thomasin and her aunt The women were gone They could only have left the house in one way by the back window and this was open Wildeve laughed to himself remained a moment thinking and idly returned to the front room Here his glance fell upon a bottle of wine which stood on the mantelpiece Ah old Dowden he murmured and going to the kitchen door shouted Is anybody here who can take something to old Dowden There was no reply The room was empty the lad who acted as his factotum having gone to bed Wildeve came back put on his hat took the bottle and left the house turning the key in the door for there was no guest at the inn tonight As soon as he was on the road the little bonfire on Mistover Knap again met his eye Still waiting are you my lady he murmured However he did not proceed that way just then but leaving the hill to the left of him he stumbled over a rutted road that brought him to a cottage which like all other habitations on the heath at this hour was only saved from being visible by a faint shine from its bedroom window This house was the home of Olly Dowden the besom maker and he entered The lower room was in darkness but by feeling his way he found a table whereon he placed the bottle and a minute later emerged again upon the heath He stood and looked northeast at the undying little fire high up above him though not so high as Rainbarrow We have been told what happens when a woman deliberates and the epigram is not always terminable with woman provided that one be in the case and that a fair one Wildeve stood and stood longer and breathed perplexedly and then said to himself with resignation Yes by Heaven I must go to her I suppose Instead of turning in the direction of home he pressed on rapidly by a path under Rainbarrow towards what was evidently a signal light six The Figure against the Sky When the whole Egdon concourse had left the site of the bonfire to its accustomed loneliness a closely wrapped female figure approached the barrow from that quarter of the heath in which the little fire lay Had the reddleman been watching he might have recognized her as the woman who had first stood there so singularly and vanished at the approach of strangers She ascended to her old position at the top where the red coals of the perishing fire greeted her like living eyes in the corpse of day There she stood still around her stretching the vast night atmosphere whose incomplete darkness in comparison with the total darkness of the heath below it might have represented a venial beside a mortal sin That she was tall and straight in build that she was lady like in her movements was all that could be learnt of her just now her form being wrapped in a shawl folded in the old cornerwise fashion and her head in a large kerchief a protection not superfluous at this hour and place Her back was towards the wind which blew from the northwest but whether she had avoided that aspect because of the chilly gusts which played about her exceptional position or because her interest lay in the southeast did not at first appear Her reason for standing so dead still as the pivot of this circle of heath country was just as obscure Her extraordinary fixity her conspicuous loneliness her heedlessness of night betokened among other things an utter absence of fear A tract of country unaltered from that sinister condition which made Caesar anxious every year to get clear of its glooms before the autumnal equinox a kind of landscape and weather which leads travellers from the South to describe our island as Homer s Cimmerian land was not on the face of it friendly to women It might reasonably have been supposed that she was listening to the wind which rose somewhat as the night advanced and laid hold of the attention The wind indeed seemed made for the scene as the scene seemed made for the hour Part of its tone was quite special what was heard there could be heard nowhere else Gusts in innumerable series followed each other from the northwest and when each one of them raced past the sound of its progress resolved into three Treble tenor and bass notes were to be found therein The general ricochet of the whole over pits and prominences had the gravest pitch of the chime Next there could be heard the baritone buzz of a holly tree Below these in force above them in pitch a dwindled voice strove hard at a husky tune which was the peculiar local sound alluded to Thinner and less immediately traceable than the other two it was far more impressive than either In it lay what may be called the linguistic peculiarity of the heath and being audible nowhere on earth off a heath it afforded a shadow of reason for the woman s tenseness which continued as unbroken as ever Throughout the blowing of these plaintive November winds that note bore a great resemblance to the ruins of human song which remain to the throat of fourscore and ten It was a worn whisper dry and papery and it brushed so distinctly across the ear that by the accustomed the material minutiae in which it originated could be realized as by touch It was the united products of infinitesimal vegetable causes and these were neither stems leaves fruit blades prickles lichen nor moss They were the mummied heathbells of the past summer originally tender and purple now washed colourless by Michaelmas rains and dried to dead skins by October suns So low was an individual sound from these that a combination of hundreds only just emerged from silence and the myriads of the whole declivity reached the woman s ear but as a shrivelled and intermittent recitative Yet scarcely a single accent among the many afloat tonight could have such power to impress a listener with thoughts of its origin One inwardly saw the infinity of those combined multitudes and perceived that each of the tiny trumpets was seized on entered scoured and emerged from by the wind as thoroughly as if it were as vast as a crater The spirit moved them A meaning of the phrase forced itself upon the attention and an emotional listener s fetichistic mood might have ended in one of more advanced quality It was not after all that the left hand expanse of old blooms spoke or the right hand or those of the slope in front but it was the single person of something else speaking through each at once Suddenly on the barrow there mingled with all this wild rhetoric of night a sound which modulated so naturally into the rest that its beginning and ending were hardly to be distinguished The bluffs and the bushes and the heather bells had broken silence at last so did the woman and her articulation was but as another phrase of the same discourse as theirs Thrown out on the winds it became twined in with them and with them it flew away What she uttered was a lengthened sighing apparently at something in her mind which had led to her presence here There was a spasmodic abandonment about it as if in allowing herself to utter the sound the woman s brain had authorized what it could not regulate One point was evident in this that she had been existing in a suppressed state and not in one of languor or stagnation Far away down the valley the faint shine from the window of the inn still lasted on and a few additional moments proved that the window or what was within it had more to do with the woman s sigh than had either her own actions or the scene immediately around She lifted her left hand which held a closed telescope This she rapidly extended as if she were well accustomed to the operation and raising it to her eye directed it towards the light beaming from the inn The handkerchief which had hooded her head was now a little thrown back her face being somewhat elevated A profile was visible against the dull monochrome of cloud around her and it was as though side shadows from the features of Sappho and missus Siddons had converged upwards from the tomb to form an image like neither but suggesting both This however was mere superficiality In respect of character a face may make certain admissions by its outline but it fully confesses only in its changes So much is this the case that what is called the play of the features often helps more in understanding a man or woman than the earnest labours of all the other members together Thus the night revealed little of her whose form it was embracing for the mobile parts of her countenance could not be seen At last she gave up her spying attitude closed the telescope and turned to the decaying embers From these no appreciable beams now radiated except when a more than usually smart gust brushed over their faces and raised a fitful glow which came and went like the blush of a girl She stooped over the silent circle and selecting from the brands a piece of stick which bore the largest live coal at its end brought it to where she had been standing before She held the brand to the ground blowing the red coal with her mouth at the same time till it faintly illuminated the sod and revealed a small object which turned out to be an hourglass though she wore a watch She blew long enough to show that the sand had all slipped through Ah she said as if surprised The light raised by her breath had been very fitful and a momentary irradiation of flesh was all that it had disclosed of her face That consisted of two matchless lips and a cheek only her head being still enveloped She threw away the stick took the glass in her hand the telescope under her arm and moved on Along the ridge ran a faint foot track which the lady followed Those who knew it well called it a path and while a mere visitor would have passed it unnoticed even by day the regular haunters of the heath were at no loss for it at midnight The whole secret of following these incipient paths when there was not light enough in the atmosphere to show a turnpike road lay in the development of the sense of touch in the feet which comes with years of night rambling in little trodden spots To a walker practised in such places a difference between impact on maiden herbage and on the crippled stalks of a slight footway is perceptible through the thickest boot or shoe The solitary figure who walked this beat took no notice of the windy tune still played on the dead heathbells She did not turn her head to look at a group of dark creatures further on who fled from her presence as she skirted a ravine where they fed They were about a score of the small wild ponies known as heath croppers They roamed at large on the undulations of Egdon but in numbers too few to detract much from the solitude The pedestrian noticed nothing just now and a clue to her abstraction was afforded by a trivial incident A bramble caught hold of her skirt and checked her progress Instead of putting it off and hastening along she yielded herself up to the pull and stood passively still When she began to extricate herself it was by turning round and round and so unwinding the prickly switch She was in a desponding reverie Her course was in the direction of the small undying fire which had drawn the attention of the men on Rainbarrow and of Wildeve in the valley below A faint illumination from its rays began to glow upon her face and the fire soon revealed itself to be lit not on the level ground but on a salient corner or redan of earth at the junction of two converging bank fences Outside was a ditch dry except immediately under the fire where there was a large pool bearded all round by heather and rushes In the smooth water of the pool the fire appeared upside down The banks meeting behind were bare of a hedge save such as was formed by disconnected tufts of furze standing upon stems along the top like impaled heads above a city wall A white mast fitted up with spars and other nautical tackle could be seen rising against the dark clouds whenever the flames played brightly enough to reach it Altogether the scene had much the appearance of a fortification upon which had been kindled a beacon fire Nobody was visible but ever and anon a whitish something moved above the bank from behind and vanished again This was a small human hand in the act of lifting pieces of fuel into the fire but for all that could be seen the hand like that which troubled Belshazzar was there alone Occasionally an ember rolled off the bank and dropped with a hiss into the pool At one side of the pool rough steps built of clods enabled everyone who wished to do so to mount the bank which the woman did Within was a paddock in an uncultivated state though bearing evidence of having once been tilled but the heath and fern had insidiously crept in and were reasserting their old supremacy Further ahead were dimly visible an irregular dwelling house garden and outbuildings backed by a clump of firs The young lady for youth had revealed its presence in her buoyant bound up the bank walked along the top instead of descending inside and came to the corner where the fire was burning One reason for the permanence of the blaze was now manifest the fuel consisted of hard pieces of wood cleft and sawn the knotty boles of old thorn trees which grew in twos and threes about the hillsides A yet unconsumed pile of these lay in the inner angle of the bank and from this corner the upturned face of a little boy greeted her eyes He was dilatorily throwing up a piece of wood into the fire every now and then a business which seemed to have engaged him a considerable part of the evening for his face was somewhat weary I am glad you have come Miss Eustacia he said with a sigh of relief I don t like biding by myself Nonsense I have only been a little way for a walk I have been gone only twenty minutes It seemed long murmured the sad boy And you have been so many times Why I thought you would be pleased to have a bonfire Are you not much obliged to me for making you one Yes but there s nobody here to play wi me I suppose nobody has come while I ve been away Nobody except your grandfather he looked out of doors once for ee I told him you were walking round upon the hill to look at the other bonfires A good boy I think I hear him coming again miss An old man came into the remoter light of the fire from the direction of the homestead He was the same who had overtaken the reddleman on the road that afternoon He looked wistfully to the top of the bank at the woman who stood there and his teeth which were quite unimpaired showed like parian from his parted lips When are you coming indoors Eustacia he asked Tis almost bedtime I ve been home these two hours and am tired out Surely tis somewhat childish of you to stay out playing at bonfires so long and wasting such fuel My precious thorn roots the rarest of all firing that I laid by on purpose for Christmas you have burnt em nearly all I promised Johnny a bonfire and it pleases him not to let it go out just yet said Eustacia in a way which told at once that she was absolute queen here Grandfather you go in to bed I shall follow you soon You like the fire don t you Johnny The boy looked up doubtfully at her and murmured I don t think I want it any longer Her grandfather had turned back again and did not hear the boy s reply As soon as the white haired man had vanished she said in a tone of pique to the child Ungrateful little boy how can you contradict me Never shall you have a bonfire again unless you keep it up now Come tell me you like to do things for me and don t deny it The repressed child said Yes I do miss and continued to stir the fire perfunctorily Stay a little longer and I will give you a crooked six pence said Eustacia more gently Put in one piece of wood every two or three minutes but not too much at once I am going to walk along the ridge a little longer but I shall keep on coming to you And if you hear a frog jump into the pond with a flounce like a stone thrown in be sure you run and tell me because it is a sign of rain Yes Eustacia Miss Vye sir Miss Vy stacia That will do Now put in one stick more The little slave went on feeding the fire as before He seemed a mere automaton galvanized into moving and speaking by the wayward Eustacia s will He might have been the brass statue which Albertus Magnus is said to have animated just so far as to make it chatter and move and be his servant Before going on her walk again the young girl stood still on the bank for a few instants and listened It was to the full as lonely a place as Rainbarrow though at rather a lower level and it was more sheltered from wind and weather on account of the few firs to the north The bank which enclosed the homestead and protected it from the lawless state of the world without was formed of thick square clods dug from the ditch on the outside and built up with a slight batter or incline which forms no slight defense where hedges will not grow because of the wind and the wilderness and where wall materials are unattainable Otherwise the situation was quite open commanding the whole length of the valley which reached to the river behind Wildeve s house High above this to the right and much nearer thitherward than the Quiet Woman Inn the blurred contour of Rainbarrow obstructed the sky After her attentive survey of the wild slopes and hollow ravines a gesture of impatience escaped Eustacia She vented petulant words every now and then but there were sighs between her words and sudden listenings between her sighs Descending from her perch she again sauntered off towards Rainbarrow though this time she did not go the whole way Twice she reappeared at intervals of a few minutes and each time she said Not any flounce into the pond yet little man No Miss Eustacia the child replied Well she said at last I shall soon be going in and then I will give you the crooked sixpence and let you go home Thank ee Miss Eustacia said the tired stoker breathing more easily And Eustacia again strolled away from the fire but this time not towards Rainbarrow She skirted the bank and went round to the wicket before the house where she stood motionless looking at the scene Fifty yards off rose the corner of the two converging banks with the fire upon it within the bank lifting up to the fire one stick at a time just as before the figure of the little child She idly watched him as he occasionally climbed up in the nook of the bank and stood beside the brands The wind blew the smoke and the child s hair and the corner of his pinafore all in the same direction the breeze died and the pinafore and hair lay still and the smoke went up straight While Eustacia looked on from this distance the boy s form visibly started he slid down the bank and ran across towards the white gate Well said Eustacia A hopfrog have jumped into the pond Yes I heard en Then it is going to rain and you had better go home You will not be afraid She spoke hurriedly as if her heart had leapt into her throat at the boy s words No because I shall hae the crooked sixpence Yes here it is Now run as fast as you can not that way through the garden here No other boy in the heath has had such a bonfire as yours The boy who clearly had had too much of a good thing marched away into the shadows with alacrity When he was gone Eustacia leaving her telescope and hourglass by the gate brushed forward from the wicket towards the angle of the bank under the fire Here screened by the outwork she waited In a few moments a splash was audible from the pond outside Had the child been there he would have said that a second frog had jumped in but by most people the sound would have been likened to the fall of a stone into the water Eustacia stepped upon the bank Yes she said and held her breath Thereupon the contour of a man became dimly visible against the low reaching sky over the valley beyond the outer margin of the pool He came round it and leapt upon the bank beside her A low laugh escaped her the third utterance which the girl had indulged in tonight The first when she stood upon Rainbarrow had expressed anxiety the second on the ridge had expressed impatience the present was one of triumphant pleasure She let her joyous eyes rest upon him without speaking as upon some wondrous thing she had created out of chaos I have come said the man who was Wildeve You give me no peace Why do you not leave me alone I have seen your bonfire all the evening The words were not without emotion and retained their level tone as if by a careful equipoise between imminent extremes At this unexpectedly repressing manner in her lover the girl seemed to repress herself also Of course you have seen my fire she answered with languid calmness artificially maintained Why shouldn t I have a bonfire on the Fifth of November like other denizens of the heath I knew it was meant for me How did you know it I have had no word with you since you you chose her and walked about with her and deserted me entirely as if I had never been yours life and soul so irretrievably Eustacia could I forget that last autumn at this same day of the month and at this same place you lighted exactly such a fire as a signal for me to come and see you Why should there have been a bonfire again by Captain Vye s house if not for the same purpose Yes yes I own it she cried under her breath with a drowsy fervour of manner and tone which was quite peculiar to her Don t begin speaking to me as you did Damon you will drive me to say words I would not wish to say to you I had given you up and resolved not to think of you any more and then I heard the news and I came out and got the fire ready because I thought that you had been faithful to me What have you heard to make you think that said Wildeve astonished That you did not marry her she murmured exultingly And I knew it was because you loved me best and couldn t do it Damon you have been cruel to me to go away and I have said I would never forgive you I do not think I can forgive you entirely even now it is too much for a woman of any spirit to quite overlook If I had known you wished to call me up here only to reproach me I wouldn t have come But I don t mind it and I do forgive you now that you have not married her and have come back to me Who told you that I had not married her My grandfather He took a long walk today and as he was coming home he overtook some person who told him of a broken off wedding he thought it might be yours and I knew it was Does anybody else know I suppose not Now Damon do you see why I lit my signal fire You did not think I would have lit it if I had imagined you to have become the husband of this woman It is insulting my pride to suppose that Wildeve was silent it was evident that he had supposed as much Did you indeed think I believed you were married she again demanded earnestly Then you wronged me and upon my life and heart I can hardly bear to recognize that you have such ill thoughts of me Damon you are not worthy of me I see it and yet I love you Never mind let it go I must bear your mean opinion as best I may It is true is it not she added with ill concealed anxiety on his making no demonstration that you could not bring yourself to give me up and are still going to love me best of all Yes or why should I have come he said touchily Not that fidelity will be any great merit in me after your kind speech about my unworthiness which should have been said by myself if by anybody and comes with an ill grace from you However the curse of inflammability is upon me and I must live under it and take any snub from a woman It has brought me down from engineering to innkeeping what lower stage it has in store for me I have yet to learn He continued to look upon her gloomily She seized the moment and throwing back the shawl so that the firelight shone full upon her face and throat said with a smile Have you seen anything better than that in your travels Eustacia was not one to commit herself to such a position without good ground He said quietly No Not even on the shoulders of Thomasin Thomasin is a pleasing and innocent woman That s nothing to do with it she cried with quick passionateness We will leave her out there are only you and me now to think of After a long look at him she resumed with the old quiescent warmth Must I go on weakly confessing to you things a woman ought to conceal and own that no words can express how gloomy I have been because of that dreadful belief I held till two hours ago that you had quite deserted me I am sorry I caused you that pain But perhaps it is not wholly because of you that I get gloomy she archly added It is in my nature to feel like that It was born in my blood I suppose Hypochondriasis Or else it was coming into this wild heath I was happy enough at Budmouth O the times O the days at Budmouth But Egdon will be brighter again now I hope it will said Wildeve moodily Do you know the consequence of this recall to me my old darling I shall come to see you again as before at Rainbarrow Of course you will And yet I declare that until I got here tonight I intended after this one good bye never to meet you again I don t thank you for that she said turning away while indignation spread through her like subterranean heat You may come again to Rainbarrow if you like but you won t see me and you may call but I shall not listen and you may tempt me but I won t give myself to you any more You have said as much before sweet but such natures as yours don t so easily adhere to their words Neither for the matter of that do such natures as mine This is the pleasure I have won by my trouble she whispered bitterly Why did I try to recall you Damon a strange warring takes place in my mind occasionally I think when I become calm after you woundings Do I embrace a cloud of common fog after all You are a chameleon and now you are at your worst colour Go home or I shall hate you He looked absently towards Rainbarrow while one might have counted twenty and said as if he did not much mind all this Yes I will go home Do you mean to see me again If you own to me that the wedding is broken off because you love me best I don t think it would be good policy said Wildeve smiling You would get to know the extent of your power too clearly But tell me You know Where is she now I don t know I prefer not to speak of her to you I have not yet married her I have come in obedience to your call That is enough I merely lit that fire because I was dull and thought I would get a little excitement by calling you up and triumphing over you as the Witch of Endor called up Samuel I determined you should come and you have come I have shown my power A mile and half hither and a mile and half back again to your home three miles in the dark for me Have I not shown my power He shook his head at her I know you too well my Eustacia I know you too well There isn t a note in you which I don t know and that hot little bosom couldn t play such a cold blooded trick to save its life I saw a woman on Rainbarrow at dusk looking down towards my house I think I drew out you before you drew out me The revived embers of an old passion glowed clearly in Wildeve now and he leant forward as if about to put his face towards her cheek O no she said intractably moving to the other side of the decayed fire What did you mean by that Perhaps I may kiss your hand No you may not Then I may shake your hand No Then I wish you good night without caring for either Good bye good bye She returned no answer and with the bow of a dancing master he vanished on the other side of the pool as he had come Eustacia sighed it was no fragile maiden sigh but a sigh which shook her like a shiver Whenever a flash of reason darted like an electric light upon her lover as it sometimes would and showed his imperfections she shivered thus But it was over in a second and she loved on She knew that he trifled with her but she loved on She scattered the half burnt brands went indoors immediately and up to her bedroom without a light Amid the rustles which denoted her to be undressing in the darkness other heavy breaths frequently came and the same kind of shudder occasionally moved through her when ten minutes later she lay on her bed asleep seven Queen of Night Eustacia Vye was the raw material of a divinity On Olympus she would have done well with a little preparation She had the passions and instincts which make a model goddess that is those which make not quite a model woman Had it been possible for the earth and mankind to be entirely in her grasp for a while she had handled the distaff the spindle and the shears at her own free will few in the world would have noticed the change of government There would have been the same inequality of lot the same heaping up of favours here of contumely there the same generosity before justice the same perpetual dilemmas the same captious alteration of caresses and blows that we endure now She was in person full limbed and somewhat heavy without ruddiness as without pallor and soft to the touch as a cloud To see her hair was to fancy that a whole winter did not contain darkness enough to form its shadow it closed over her forehead like nightfall extinguishing the western glow Her nerves extended into those tresses and her temper could always be softened by stroking them down When her hair was brushed she would instantly sink into stillness and look like the Sphinx If in passing under one of the Egdon banks any of its thick skeins were caught as they sometimes were by a prickly tuft of the large Ulex Europoeus which will act as a sort of hairbrush she would go back a few steps and pass against it a second time She had pagan eyes full of nocturnal mysteries and their light as it came and went and came again was partially hampered by their oppressive lids and lashes and of these the under lid was much fuller than it usually is with English women This enabled her to indulge in reverie without seeming to do so she might have been believed capable of sleeping without closing them up Assuming that the souls of men and women were visible essences you could fancy the colour of Eustacia s soul to be flamelike The sparks from it that rose into her dark pupils gave the same impression The mouth seemed formed less to speak than to quiver less to quiver than to kiss Some might have added less to kiss than to curl Viewed sideways the closing line of her lips formed with almost geometric precision the curve so well known in the arts of design as the cima recta or ogee The sight of such a flexible bend as that on grim Egdon was quite an apparition It was felt at once that the mouth did not come over from Sleswig with a band of Saxon pirates whose lips met like the two halves of a muffin One had fancied that such lip curves were mostly lurking underground in the South as fragments of forgotten marbles So fine were the lines of her lips that though full each corner of her mouth was as clearly cut as the point of a spear This keenness of corner was only blunted when she was given over to sudden fits of gloom one of the phases of the night side of sentiment which she knew too well for her years Her presence brought memories of such things as Bourbon roses rubies and tropical midnight her moods recalled lotus eaters and the march in Athalie her motions the ebb and flow of the sea her voice the viola In a dim light and with a slight rearrangement of her hair her general figure might have stood for that of either of the higher female deities The new moon behind her head an old helmet upon it a diadem of accidental dewdrops round her brow would have been adjuncts sufficient to strike the note of Artemis Athena or Hera respectively with as close an approximation to the antique as that which passes muster on many respected canvases But celestial imperiousness love wrath and fervour had proved to be somewhat thrown away on netherward Egdon Her power was limited and the consciousness of this limitation had biassed her development Egdon was her Hades and since coming there she had imbibed much of what was dark in its tone though inwardly and eternally unreconciled thereto Her appearance accorded well with this smouldering rebelliousness and the shady splendour of her beauty was the real surface of the sad and stifled warmth within her A true Tartarean dignity sat upon her brow and not factitiously or with marks of constraint for it had grown in her with years Across the upper part of her head she wore a thin fillet of black velvet restraining the luxuriance of her shady hair in a way which added much to this class of majesty by irregularly clouding her forehead Nothing can embellish a beautiful face more than a narrow band drawn over the brow says Richter Some of the neighbouring girls wore coloured ribbon for the same purpose and sported metallic ornaments elsewhere but if anyone suggested coloured ribbon and metallic ornaments to Eustacia Vye she laughed and went on Why did a woman of this sort live on Egdon Heath Budmouth was her native place a fashionable seaside resort at that date She was the daughter of the bandmaster of a regiment which had been quartered there a Corfiote by birth and a fine musician who met his future wife during her trip thither with her father the captain a man of good family The marriage was scarcely in accord with the old man s wishes for the bandmaster s pockets were as light as his occupation But the musician did his best adopted his wife s name made England permanently his home took great trouble with his child s education the expenses of which were defrayed by the grandfather and throve as the chief local musician till her mother s death when he left off thriving drank and died also The girl was left to the care of her grandfather who since three of his ribs became broken in a shipwreck had lived in this airy perch on Egdon a spot which had taken his fancy because the house was to be had for next to nothing and because a remote blue tinge on the horizon between the hills visible from the cottage door was traditionally believed to be the English Channel She hated the change she felt like one banished but here she was forced to abide Thus it happened that in Eustacia s brain were juxtaposed the strangest assortment of ideas from old time and from new There was no middle distance in her perspective romantic recollections of sunny afternoons on an esplanade with military bands officers and gallants around stood like gilded letters upon the dark tablet of surrounding Egdon Every bizarre effect that could result from the random intertwining of watering place glitter with the grand solemnity of a heath was to be found in her Seeing nothing of human life now she imagined all the more of what she had seen Where did her dignity come from By a latent vein from Alcinous line her father hailing from Phaeacia s isle or from Fitzalan and De Vere her maternal grandfather having had a cousin in the peerage Perhaps it was the gift of Heaven a happy convergence of natural laws Among other things opportunity had of late years been denied her of learning to be undignified for she lived lonely Isolation on a heath renders vulgarity well nigh impossible It would have been as easy for the heath ponies bats and snakes to be vulgar as for her A narrow life in Budmouth might have completely demeaned her The only way to look queenly without realms or hearts to queen it over is to look as if you had lost them and Eustacia did that to a triumph In the captain s cottage she could suggest mansions she had never seen Perhaps that was because she frequented a vaster mansion than any of them the open hills Like the summer condition of the place around her she was an embodiment of the phrase a populous solitude apparently so listless void and quiet she was really busy and full To be loved to madness such was her great desire Love was to her the one cordial which could drive away the eating loneliness of her days And she seemed to long for the abstraction called passionate love more than for any particular lover She could show a most reproachful look at times but it was directed less against human beings than against certain creatures of her mind the chief of these being Destiny through whose interference she dimly fancied it arose that love alighted only on gliding youth that any love she might win would sink simultaneously with the sand in the glass She thought of it with an ever growing consciousness of cruelty which tended to breed actions of reckless unconventionality framed to snatch a year s a week s even an hour s passion from anywhere while it could be won Through want of it she had sung without being merry possessed without enjoying outshone without triumphing Her loneliness deepened her desire On Egdon coldest and meanest kisses were at famine prices and where was a mouth matching hers to be found Fidelity in love for fidelity s sake had less attraction for her than for most women fidelity because of love s grip had much A blaze of love and extinction was better than a lantern glimmer of the same which should last long years On this head she knew by prevision what most women learn only by experience she had mentally walked round love told the towers thereof considered its palaces and concluded that love was but a doleful joy Yet she desired it as one in a desert would be thankful for brackish water She often repeated her prayers not at particular times but like the unaffectedly devout when she desired to pray Her prayer was always spontaneous and often ran thus O deliver my heart from this fearful gloom and loneliness send me great love from somewhere else I shall die Her high gods were William the Conqueror Strafford and Napoleon Buonaparte as they had appeared in the Lady s History used at the establishment in which she was educated Had she been a mother she would have christened her boys such names as Saul or Sisera in preference to Jacob or David neither of whom she admired At school she had used to side with the Philistines in several battles and had wondered if Pontius Pilate were as handsome as he was frank and fair Thus she was a girl of some forwardness of mind indeed weighed in relation to her situation among the very rearward of thinkers very original Her instincts towards social non comformity were at the root of this In the matter of holidays her mood was that of horses who when turned out to grass enjoy looking upon their kind at work on the highway She only valued rest to herself when it came in the midst of other people s labour Hence she hated Sundays when all was at rest and often said they would be the death of her To see the heathmen in their Sunday condition that is with their hands in their pockets their boots newly oiled and not laced up a particularly Sunday sign walking leisurely among the turves and furze faggots they had cut during the week and kicking them critically as if their use were unknown was a fearful heaviness to her To relieve the tedium of this untimely day she would overhaul the cupboards containing her grandfather s old charts and other rubbish humming Saturday night ballads of the country people the while But on Saturday nights she would frequently sing a psalm and it was always on a weekday that she read the Bible that she might be unoppressed with a sense of doing her duty Such views of life were to some extent the natural begettings of her situation upon her nature To dwell on a heath without studying its meanings was like wedding a foreigner without learning his tongue The subtle beauties of the heath were lost to Eustacia she only caught its vapours An environment which would have made a contented woman a poet a suffering woman a devotee a pious woman a psalmist even a giddy woman thoughtful made a rebellious woman saturnine Eustacia had got beyond the vision of some marriage of inexpressible glory yet though her emotions were in full vigour she cared for no meaner union Thus we see her in a strange state of isolation To have lost the godlike conceit that we may do what we will and not to have acquired a homely zest for doing what we can shows a grandeur of temper which cannot be objected to in the abstract for it denotes a mind that though disappointed forswears compromise But if congenial to philosophy it is apt to be dangerous to the commonwealth In a world where doing means marrying and the commonwealth is one of hearts and hands the same peril attends the condition And so we see our Eustacia for at times she was not altogether unlovable arriving at that stage of enlightenment which feels that nothing is worth while and filling up the spare hours of her existence by idealizing Wildeve for want of a better object This was the sole reason of his ascendency she knew it herself At moments her pride rebelled against her passion for him and she even had longed to be free But there was only one circumstance which could dislodge him and that was the advent of a greater man For the rest she suffered much from depression of spirits and took slow walks to recover them in which she carried her grandfather s telescope and her grandmother s hourglass the latter because of a peculiar pleasure she derived from watching a material representation of time s gradual glide away She seldom schemed but when she did scheme her plans showed rather the comprehensive strategy of a general than the small arts called womanish though she could utter oracles of Delphian ambiguity when she did not choose to be direct In heaven she will probably sit between the Heloises and the Cleopatras eight Those Who Are Found Where There Is Said to Be Nobody As soon as the sad little boy had withdrawn from the fire he clasped the money tight in the palm of his hand as if thereby to fortify his courage and began to run There was really little danger in allowing a child to go home alone on this part of Egdon Heath The distance to the boy s house was not more than three eighths of a mile his father s cottage and one other a few yards further on forming part of the small hamlet of Mistover Knap the third and only remaining house was that of Captain Vye and Eustacia which stood quite away from the small cottages and was the loneliest of lonely houses on these thinly populated slopes He ran until he was out of breath and then becoming more courageous walked leisurely along singing in an old voice a little song about a sailor boy and a fair one and bright gold in store In the middle of this the child stopped from a pit under the hill ahead of him shone a light whence proceeded a cloud of floating dust and a smacking noise Only unusual sights and sounds frightened the boy The shrivelled voice of the heath did not alarm him for that was familiar The thornbushes which arose in his path from time to time were less satisfactory for they whistled gloomily and had a ghastly habit after dark of putting on the shapes of jumping madmen sprawling giants and hideous cripples Lights were not uncommon this evening but the nature of all of them was different from this Discretion rather than terror prompted the boy to turn back instead of passing the light with a view of asking Miss Eustacia Vye to let her servant accompany him home When the boy had reascended to the top of the valley he found the fire to be still burning on the bank though lower than before Beside it instead of Eustacia s solitary form he saw two persons the second being a man The boy crept along under the bank to ascertain from the nature of the proceedings if it would be prudent to interrupt so splendid a creature as Miss Eustacia on his poor trivial account After listening under the bank for some minutes to the talk he turned in a perplexed and doubting manner and began to withdraw as silently as he had come That he did not upon the whole think it advisable to interrupt her conversation with Wildeve without being prepared to bear the whole weight of her displeasure was obvious Here was a Scyllaeo Charybdean position for a poor boy Pausing when again safe from discovery he finally decided to face the pit phenomenon as the lesser evil With a heavy sigh he retraced the slope and followed the path he had followed before The light had gone the rising dust had disappeared he hoped for ever He marched resolutely along and found nothing to alarm him till coming within a few yards of the sandpit he heard a slight noise in front which led him to halt The halt was but momentary for the noise resolved itself into the steady bites of two animals grazing Two he th croppers down here he said aloud I have never known em come down so far afore The animals were in the direct line of his path but that the child thought little of he had played round the fetlocks of horses from his infancy On coming nearer however the boy was somewhat surprised to find that the little creatures did not run off and that each wore a clog to prevent his going astray this signified that they had been broken in He could now see the interior of the pit which being in the side of the hill had a level entrance In the innermost corner the square outline of a van appeared with its back towards him A light came from the interior and threw a moving shadow upon the vertical face of gravel at the further side of the pit into which the vehicle faced The child assumed that this was the cart of a gipsy and his dread of those wanderers reached but to that mild pitch which titillates rather than pains Only a few inches of mud wall kept him and his family from being gipsies themselves He skirted the gravel pit at a respectful distance ascended the slope and came forward upon the brow in order to look into the open door of the van and see the original of the shadow The picture alarmed the boy By a little stove inside the van sat a figure red from head to heels the man who had been Thomasin s friend He was darning a stocking which was red like the rest of him Moreover as he darned he smoked a pipe the stem and bowl of which were red also At this moment one of the heath croppers feeding in the outer shadows was audibly shaking off the clog attached to its foot Aroused by the sound the reddleman laid down his stocking lit a lantern which hung beside him and came out from the van In sticking up the candle he lifted the lantern to his face and the light shone into the whites of his eyes and upon his ivory teeth which in contrast with the red surrounding lent him a startling aspect enough to the gaze of a juvenile The boy knew too well for his peace of mind upon whose lair he had lighted Uglier persons than gipsies were known to cross Egdon at times and a reddleman was one of them How I wish twas only a gipsy he murmured The man was by this time coming back from the horses In his fear of being seen the boy rendered detection certain by nervous motion The heather and peat stratum overhung the brow of the pit in mats hiding the actual verge The boy had stepped beyond the solid ground the heather now gave way and down he rolled over the scarp of grey sand to the very foot of the man The red man opened the lantern and turned it upon the figure of the prostrate boy Who be ye he said Johnny Nunsuch master What were you doing up there I don t know Watching me I suppose Yes master What did you watch me for Because I was coming home from Miss Vye s bonfire Beest hurt No Why yes you be your hand is bleeding Come under my tilt and let me tie it up Please let me look for my sixpence How did you come by that Miss Vye gied it to me for keeping up her bonfire The sixpence was found and the man went to the van the boy behind almost holding his breath The man took a piece of rag from a satchel containing sewing materials tore off a strip which like everything else was tinged red and proceeded to bind up the wound My eyes have got foggy like please may I sit down master said the boy To be sure poor chap Tis enough to make you feel fainty Sit on that bundle The man finished tying up the gash and the boy said I think I ll go home now master You are rather afraid of me Do you know what I be The child surveyed his vermilion figure up and down with much misgiving and finally said Yes Well what The reddleman he faltered Yes that s what I be Though there s more than one You little children think there s only one cuckoo one fox one giant one devil and one reddleman when there s lots of us all Is there You won t carry me off in your bags will ye master Tis said that the reddleman will sometimes Nonsense All that reddlemen do is sell reddle You see all these bags at the back of my cart They are not full of little boys only full of red stuff Was you born a reddleman No I took to it I should be as white as you if I were to give up the trade that is I should be white in time perhaps six months not at first because tis grow d into my skin and won t wash out Now you ll never be afraid of a reddleman again will ye No never Willy Orchard said he seed a red ghost here t other day perhaps that was you I was here t other day Were you making that dusty light I saw by now Oh yes I was beating out some bags And have you had a good bonfire up there I saw the light Why did Miss Vye want a bonfire so bad that she should give you sixpence to keep it up I don t know I was tired but she made me bide and keep up the fire just the same while she kept going up across Rainbarrow way And how long did that last Until a hopfrog jumped into the pond The reddleman suddenly ceased to talk idly A hopfrog he inquired Hopfrogs don t jump into ponds this time of year They do for I heard one Certain sure Yes She told me afore that I should hear n and so I did They say she s clever and deep and perhaps she charmed en to come And what then Then I came down here and I was afeard and I went back but I didn t like to speak to her because of the gentleman and I came on here again A gentleman ah What did she say to him my man Told him she supposed he had not married the other woman because he liked his old sweetheart best and things like that What did the gentleman say to her my sonny He only said he did like her best and how he was coming to see her again under Rainbarrow o nights Ha cried the reddleman slapping his hand against the side of his van so that the whole fabric shook under the blow That s the secret o t The little boy jumped clean from the stool My man don t you be afraid said the dealer in red suddenly becoming gentle I forgot you were here That s only a curious way reddlemen have of going mad for a moment but they don t hurt anybody And what did the lady say then I can t mind Please Master Reddleman may I go home along now Ay to be sure you may I ll go a bit of ways with you He conducted the boy out of the gravel pit and into the path leading to his mother s cottage When the little figure had vanished in the darkness the reddleman returned resumed his seat by the fire and proceeded to darn again nine Love Leads a Shrewd Man into Strategy Reddlemen of the old school are now but seldom seen Since the introduction of railways Wessex farmers have managed to do without these Mephistophelian visitants and the bright pigment so largely used by shepherds in preparing sheep for the fair is obtained by other routes Even those who yet survive are losing the poetry of existence which characterized them when the pursuit of the trade meant periodical journeys to the pit whence the material was dug a regular camping out from month to month except in the depth of winter a peregrination among farms which could be counted by the hundred and in spite of this Arab existence the preservation of that respectability which is insured by the never failing production of a well lined purse Reddle spreads its lively hues over everything it lights on and stamps unmistakably as with the mark of Cain any person who has handled it half an hour A child s first sight of a reddleman was an epoch in his life That blood coloured figure was a sublimation of all the horrid dreams which had afflicted the juvenile spirit since imagination began The reddleman is coming for you had been the formulated threat of Wessex mothers for many generations He was successfully supplanted for a while at the beginning of the present century by Buonaparte but as process of time rendered the latter personage stale and ineffective the older phrase resumed its early prominence And now the reddleman has in his turn followed Buonaparte to the land of worn out bogeys and his place is filled by modern inventions The reddleman lived like a gipsy but gipsies he scorned He was about as thriving as travelling basket and mat makers but he had nothing to do with them He was more decently born and brought up than the cattledrovers who passed and repassed him in his wanderings but they merely nodded to him His stock was more valuable than that of pedlars but they did not think so and passed his cart with eyes straight ahead He was such an unnatural colour to look at that the men of roundabouts and waxwork shows seemed gentlemen beside him but he considered them low company and remained aloof Among all these squatters and folks of the road the reddleman continually found himself yet he was not of them His occupation tended to isolate him and isolated he was mostly seen to be It was sometimes suggested that reddlemen were criminals for whose misdeeds other men wrongfully suffered that in escaping the law they had not escaped their own consciences and had taken to the trade as a lifelong penance Else why should they have chosen it In the present case such a question would have been particularly apposite The reddleman who had entered Egdon that afternoon was an instance of the pleasing being wasted to form the ground work of the singular when an ugly foundation would have done just as well for that purpose The one point that was forbidding about this reddleman was his colour Freed from that he would have been as agreeable a specimen of rustic manhood as one would often see A keen observer might have been inclined to think which was indeed partly the truth that he had relinquished his proper station in life for want of interest in it Moreover after looking at him one would have hazarded the guess that good nature and an acuteness as extreme as it could be without verging on craft formed the framework of his character While he darned the stocking his face became rigid with thought Softer expressions followed this and then again recurred the tender sadness which had sat upon him during his drive along the highway that afternoon Presently his needle stopped He laid down the stocking arose from his seat and took a leathern pouch from a hook in the corner of the van This contained among other articles a brown paper packet which to judge from the hinge like character of its worn folds seemed to have been carefully opened and closed a good many times He sat down on a three legged milking stool that formed the only seat in the van and examining his packet by the light of a candle took thence an old letter and spread it open The writing had originally been traced on white paper but the letter had now assumed a pale red tinge from the accident of its situation and the black strokes of writing thereon looked like the twigs of a winter hedge against a vermilion sunset The letter bore a date some two years previous to that time and was signed Thomasin Yeobright It ran as follows DEAR DIGGORY VENN The question you put when you overtook me coming home from Pond close gave me such a surprise that I am afraid I did not make you exactly understand what I meant Of course if my aunt had not met me I could have explained all then at once but as it was there was no chance I have been quite uneasy since as you know I do not wish to pain you yet I fear I shall be doing so now in contradicting what I seemed to say then I cannot Diggory marry you or think of letting you call me your sweetheart I could not indeed Diggory I hope you will not much mind my saying this and feel in a great pain It makes me very sad when I think it may for I like you very much and I always put you next to my cousin Clym in my mind There are so many reasons why we cannot be married that I can hardly name them all in a letter I did not in the least expect that you were going to speak on such a thing when you followed me because I had never thought of you in the sense of a lover at all You must not becall me for laughing when you spoke you mistook when you thought I laughed at you as a foolish man I laughed because the idea was so odd and not at you at all The great reason with my own personal self for not letting you court me is that I do not feel the things a woman ought to feel who consents to walk with you with the meaning of being your wife It is not as you think that I have another in my mind for I do not encourage anybody and never have in my life Another reason is my aunt She would not I know agree to it even if I wished to have you She likes you very well but she will want me to look a little higher than a small dairy farmer and marry a professional man I hope you will not set your heart against me for writing plainly but I felt you might try to see me again and it is better that we should not meet I shall always think of you as a good man and be anxious for your well doing I send this by Jane Orchard s little maid And remain Diggory your faithful friend THOMASIN YEOBRIGHT To mister VENN Dairy farmer Since the arrival of that letter on a certain autumn morning long ago the reddleman and Thomasin had not met till today During the interval he had shifted his position even further from hers than it had originally been by adopting the reddle trade though he was really in very good circumstances still Indeed seeing that his expenditure was only one fourth of his income he might have been called a prosperous man Rejected suitors take to roaming as naturally as unhived bees and the business to which he had cynically devoted himself was in many ways congenial to Venn But his wanderings by mere stress of old emotions had frequently taken an Egdon direction though he never intruded upon her who attracted him thither To be in Thomasin s heath and near her yet unseen was the one ewe lamb of pleasure left to him Then came the incident of that day and the reddleman still loving her well was excited by this accidental service to her at a critical juncture to vow an active devotion to her cause instead of as hitherto sighing and holding aloof After what had happened it was impossible that he should not doubt the honesty of Wildeve s intentions But her hope was apparently centred upon him and dismissing his regrets Venn determined to aid her to be happy in her own chosen way That this way was of all others the most distressing to himself was awkward enough but the reddleman s love was generous His first active step in watching over Thomasin s interests was taken about seven o clock the next evening and was dictated by the news which he had learnt from the sad boy That Eustacia was somehow the cause of Wildeve s carelessness in relation to the marriage had at once been Venn s conclusion on hearing of the secret meeting between them It did not occur to his mind that Eustacia s love signal to Wildeve was the tender effect upon the deserted beauty of the intelligence which her grandfather had brought home His instinct was to regard her as a conspirator against rather than as an antecedent obstacle to Thomasin s happiness During the day he had been exceedingly anxious to learn the condition of Thomasin but he did not venture to intrude upon a threshold to which he was a stranger particularly at such an unpleasant moment as this He had occupied his time in moving with his ponies and load to a new point in the heath eastward to his previous station and here he selected a nook with a careful eye to shelter from wind and rain which seemed to mean that his stay there was to be a comparatively extended one After this he returned on foot some part of the way that he had come and it being now dark he diverged to the left till he stood behind a holly bush on the edge of a pit not twenty yards from Rainbarrow He watched for a meeting there but he watched in vain Nobody except himself came near the spot that night But the loss of his labour produced little effect upon the reddleman He had stood in the shoes of Tantalus and seemed to look upon a certain mass of disappointment as the natural preface to all realizations without which preface they would give cause for alarm The same hour the next evening found him again at the same place but Eustacia and Wildeve the expected trysters did not appear He pursued precisely the same course yet four nights longer and without success But on the next being the day week of their previous meeting he saw a female shape floating along the ridge and the outline of a young man ascending from the valley They met in the little ditch encircling the tumulus the original excavation from which it had been thrown up by the ancient British people The reddleman stung with suspicion of wrong to Thomasin was aroused to strategy in a moment He instantly left the bush and crept forward on his hands and knees When he had got as close as he might safely venture without discovery he found that owing to a cross wind the conversation of the trysting pair could not be overheard Near him as in divers places about the heath were areas strewn with large turves which lay edgeways and upside down awaiting removal by Timothy Fairway previous to the winter weather He took two of these as he lay and dragged them over him till one covered his head and shoulders the other his back and legs The reddleman would now have been quite invisible even by daylight the turves standing upon him with the heather upwards looked precisely as if they were growing He crept along again and the turves upon his back crept with him Had he approached without any covering the chances are that he would not have been perceived in the dusk approaching thus it was as though he burrowed underground In this manner he came quite close to where the two were standing Wish to consult me on the matter reached his ears in the rich impetuous accents of Eustacia Vye Consult me It is an indignity to me to talk so I won t bear it any longer She began weeping I have loved you and have shown you that I loved you much to my regret and yet you can come and say in that frigid way that you wish to consult with me whether it would not be better to marry Thomasin Better of course it would be Marry her she is nearer to your own position in life than I am Yes yes that s very well said Wildeve peremptorily But we must look at things as they are Whatever blame may attach to me for having brought it about Thomasin s position is at present much worse than yours I simply tell you that I am in a strait But you shall not tell me You must see that it is only harassing me Damon you have not acted well you have sunk in my opinion You have not valued my courtesy the courtesy of a lady in loving you who used to think of far more ambitious things But it was Thomasin s fault She won you away from me and she deserves to suffer for it Where is she staying now Not that I care nor where I am myself Ah if I were dead and gone how glad she would be Where is she I ask Thomasin is now staying at her aunt s shut up in a bedroom and keeping out of everybody s sight he said indifferently I don t think you care much about her even now said Eustacia with sudden joyousness for if you did you wouldn t talk so coolly about her Do you talk so coolly to her about me Ah I expect you do Why did you originally go away from me I don t think I can ever forgive you except on one condition that whenever you desert me you come back again sorry that you served me so I never wish to desert you I do not thank you for that I should hate it to be all smooth Indeed I think I like you to desert me a little once now and then Love is the dismallest thing where the lover is quite honest O it is a shame to say so but it is true She indulged in a little laugh My low spirits begin at the very idea Don t you offer me tame love or away you go I wish Tamsie were not such a confoundedly good little woman said Wildeve so that I could be faithful to you without injuring a worthy person It is I who am the sinner after all I am not worth the little finger of either of you But you must not sacrifice yourself to her from any sense of justice replied Eustacia quickly If you do not love her it is the most merciful thing in the long run to leave her as she is That s always the best way There now I have been unwomanly I suppose When you have left me I am always angry with myself for things that I have said to you Wildeve walked a pace or two among the heather without replying The pause was filled up by the intonation of a pollard thorn a little way to windward the breezes filtering through its unyielding twigs as through a strainer It was as if the night sang dirges with clenched teeth She continued half sorrowfully Since meeting you last it has occurred to me once or twice that perhaps it was not for love of me you did not marry her Tell me Damon I ll try to bear it Had I nothing whatever to do with the matter Do you press me to tell Yes I must know I see I have been too ready to believe in my own power Well the immediate reason was that the license would not do for the place and before I could get another she ran away Up to that point you had nothing to do with it Since then her aunt has spoken to me in a tone which I don t at all like Yes yes I am nothing in it I am nothing in it You only trifle with me Heaven what can I Eustacia Vye be made of to think so much of you Nonsense do not be so passionate Eustacia how we roved among these bushes last year when the hot days had got cool and the shades of the hills kept us almost invisible in the hollows She remained in moody silence till she said Yes and how I used to laugh at you for daring to look up to me But you have well made me suffer for that since Yes you served me cruelly enough until I thought I had found someone fairer than you A blessed find for me Eustacia Do you still think you found somebody fairer Sometimes I do sometimes I don t The scales are balanced so nicely that a feather would turn them But don t you really care whether I meet you or whether I don t she said slowly I care a little but not enough to break my rest replied the young man languidly No all that s past I find there are two flowers where I thought there was only one Perhaps there are three or four or any number as good as the first Mine is a curious fate Who would have thought that all this could happen to me She interrupted with a suppressed fire of which either love or anger seemed an equally possible issue Do you love me now Who can say Tell me I will know it I do and I do not said he mischievously That is I have my times and my seasons One moment you are too tall another moment you are too do nothing another too melancholy another too dark another I don t know what except that you are not the whole world to me that you used to be my dear But you are a pleasant lady to know and nice to meet and I dare say as sweet as ever almost Eustacia was silent and she turned from him till she said in a voice of suspended mightiness I am for a walk and this is my way Well I can do worse than follow you You know you can t do otherwise for all your moods and changes she answered defiantly Say what you will try as you may keep away from me all that you can you will never forget me You will love me all your life long You would jump to marry me So I would said Wildeve Such strange thoughts as I ve had from time to time Eustacia and they come to me this moment You hate the heath as much as ever that I know I do she murmured deeply Tis my cross my shame and will be my death I abhor it too said he How mournfully the wind blows round us now She did not answer Its tone was indeed solemn and pervasive Compound utterances addressed themselves to their senses and it was possible to view by ear the features of the neighbourhood Acoustic pictures were returned from the darkened scenery they could hear where the tracts of heather began and ended where the furze was growing stalky and tall where it had been recently cut in what direction the fir clump lay and how near was the pit in which the hollies grew for these differing features had their voices no less than their shapes and colours God how lonely it is resumed Wildeve What are picturesque ravines and mists to us who see nothing else Why should we stay here Will you go with me to America I have kindred in Wisconsin That wants consideration It seems impossible to do well here unless one were a wild bird or a landscape painter Well Give me time she softly said taking his hand America is so far away Are you going to walk with me a little way As Eustacia uttered the latter words she retired from the base of the barrow and Wildeve followed her so that the reddleman could hear no more He lifted the turves and arose Their black figures sank and disappeared from against the sky They were as two horns which the sluggish heath had put forth from its crown like a mollusc and had now again drawn in The reddleman s walk across the vale and over into the next where his cart lay was not sprightly for a slim young fellow of twenty four His spirit was perturbed to aching The breezes that blew around his mouth in that walk carried off upon them the accents of a commination He entered the van where there was a fire in a stove Without lighting his candle he sat down at once on the three legged stool and pondered on what he had seen and heard touching that still loved one of his He uttered a sound which was neither sigh nor sob but was even more indicative than either of a troubled mind My Tamsie he whispered heavily What can be done Yes I will see that Eustacia Vye ten A Desperate Attempt at Persuasion The next morning at the time when the height of the sun appeared very insignificant from any part of the heath as compared with the altitude of Rainbarrow and when all the little hills in the lower levels were like an archipelago in a fog formed Aegean the reddleman came from the brambled nook which he had adopted as his quarters and ascended the slopes of Mistover Knap Though these shaggy hills were apparently so solitary several keen round eyes were always ready on such a wintry morning as this to converge upon a passer by Feathered species sojourned here in hiding which would have created wonder if found elsewhere A bustard haunted the spot and not many years before this five and twenty might have been seen in Egdon at one time Marsh harriers looked up from the valley by Wildeve s A cream coloured courser had used to visit this hill a bird so rare that not more than a dozen have ever been seen in England but a barbarian rested neither night nor day till he had shot the African truant and after that event cream coloured coursers thought fit to enter Egdon no more A traveller who should walk and observe any of these visitants as Venn observed them now could feel himself to be in direct communication with regions unknown to man Here in front of him was a wild mallard just arrived from the home of the north wind The creature brought within him an amplitude of Northern knowledge Glacial catastrophes snowstorm episodes glittering auroral effects Polaris in the zenith Franklin underfoot the category of his commonplaces was wonderful But the bird like many other philosophers seemed as he looked at the reddleman to think that a present moment of comfortable reality was worth a decade of memories Venn passed on through these towards the house of the isolated beauty who lived up among them and despised them The day was Sunday but as going to church except to be married or buried was exceptional at Egdon this made little difference He had determined upon the bold stroke of asking for an interview with Miss Vye to attack her position as Thomasin s rival either by art or by storm showing therein somewhat too conspicuously the want of gallantry characteristic of a certain astute sort of men from clowns to kings The great Frederick making war on the beautiful Archduchess Napoleon refusing terms to the beautiful Queen of Prussia were not more dead to difference of sex than the reddleman was in his peculiar way in planning the displacement of Eustacia To call at the captain s cottage was always more or less an undertaking for the inferior inhabitants Though occasionally chatty his moods were erratic and nobody could be certain how he would behave at any particular moment Eustacia was reserved and lived very much to herself Except the daughter of one of the cotters who was their servant and a lad who worked in the garden and stable scarcely anyone but themselves ever entered the house They were the only genteel people of the district except the Yeobrights and though far from rich they did not feel that necessity for preserving a friendly face towards every man bird and beast which influenced their poorer neighbours When the reddleman entered the garden the old man was looking through his glass at the stain of blue sea in the distant landscape the little anchors on his buttons twinkling in the sun He recognized Venn as his companion on the highway but made no remark on that circumstance merely saying Ah reddleman you here Have a glass of grog Venn declined on the plea of it being too early and stated that his business was with Miss Vye The captain surveyed him from cap to waistcoat and from waistcoat to leggings for a few moments and finally asked him to go indoors Miss Vye was not to be seen by anybody just then and the reddleman waited in the window bench of the kitchen his hands hanging across his divergent knees and his cap hanging from his hands I suppose the young lady is not up yet he presently said to the servant Not quite yet Folks never call upon ladies at this time of day Then I ll step outside said Venn If she is willing to see me will she please send out word and I ll come in The reddleman left the house and loitered on the hill adjoining A considerable time elapsed and no request for his presence was brought He was beginning to think that his scheme had failed when he beheld the form of Eustacia herself coming leisurely towards him A sense of novelty in giving audience to that singular figure had been sufficient to draw her forth She seemed to feel after a bare look at Diggory Venn that the man had come on a strange errand and that he was not so mean as she had thought him for her close approach did not cause him to writhe uneasily or shift his feet or show any of those little signs which escape an ingenuous rustic at the advent of the uncommon in womankind On his inquiring if he might have a conversation with her she replied Yes walk beside me and continued to move on Before they had gone far it occurred to the perspicacious reddleman that he would have acted more wisely by appearing less unimpressionable and he resolved to correct the error as soon as he could find opportunity I have made so bold miss as to step across and tell you some strange news which has come to my ears about that man Ah what man He jerked his elbow to the southeast the direction of the Quiet Woman Eustacia turned quickly to him Do you mean mister Wildeve Yes there is trouble in a household on account of him and I have come to let you know of it because I believe you might have power to drive it away I What is the trouble It is quite a secret It is that he may refuse to marry Thomasin Yeobright after all Eustacia though set inwardly pulsing by his words was equal to her part in such a drama as this She replied coldly I do not wish to listen to this and you must not expect me to interfere But miss you will hear one word I cannot I am not interested in the marriage and even if I were I could not compel mister Wildeve to do my bidding As the only lady on the heath I think you might said Venn with subtle indirectness This is how the case stands mister Wildeve would marry Thomasin at once and make all matters smooth if so be there were not another woman in the case This other woman is some person he has picked up with and meets on the heath occasionally I believe He will never marry her and yet through her he may never marry the woman who loves him dearly Now if you miss who have so much sway over us menfolk were to insist that he should treat your young neighbour Tamsin with honourable kindness and give up the other woman he would perhaps do it and save her a good deal of misery Ah my life said Eustacia with a laugh which unclosed her lips so that the sun shone into her mouth as into a tulip and lent it a similar scarlet fire You think too much of my influence over menfolk indeed reddleman If I had such a power as you imagine I would go straight and use it for the good of anybody who has been kind to me which Thomasin Yeobright has not particularly to my knowledge Can it be that you really don t know of it how much she had always thought of you I have never heard a word of it Although we live only two miles apart I have never been inside her aunt s house in my life The superciliousness that lurked in her manner told Venn that thus far he had utterly failed He inwardly sighed and felt it necessary to unmask his second argument Well leaving that out of the question tis in your power I assure you Miss Vye to do a great deal of good to another woman She shook her head Your comeliness is law with mister Wildeve It is law with all men who see ee They say This well favoured lady coming what s her name How handsome Handsomer than Thomasin Yeobright the reddleman persisted saying to himself God forgive a rascal for lying And she was handsomer but the reddleman was far from thinking so There was a certain obscurity in Eustacia s beauty and Venn s eye was not trained In her winter dress as now she was like the tiger beetle which when observed in dull situations seems to be of the quietest neutral colour but under a full illumination blazes with dazzling splendour Eustacia could not help replying though conscious that she endangered her dignity thereby Many women are lovelier than Thomasin she said so not much attaches to that The reddleman suffered the wound and went on He is a man who notices the looks of women and you could twist him to your will like withywind if you only had the mind Surely what she cannot do who has been so much with him I cannot do living up here away from him The reddleman wheeled and looked her in the face Miss Vye he said Why do you say that as if you doubted me She spoke faintly and her breathing was quick The idea of your speaking in that tone to me she added with a forced smile of hauteur What could have been in your mind to lead you to speak like that Miss Vye why should you make believe that you don t know this man I know why certainly He is beneath you and you are ashamed You are mistaken What do you mean The reddleman had decided to play the card of truth I was at the meeting by Rainbarrow last night and heard every word he said The woman that stands between Wildeve and Thomasin is yourself It was a disconcerting lift of the curtain and the mortification of Candaules wife glowed in her The moment had arrived when her lip would tremble in spite of herself and when the gasp could no longer be kept down I am unwell she said hurriedly No it is not that I am not in a humour to hear you further Leave me please I must speak Miss Vye in spite of paining you What I would put before you is this However it may come about whether she is to blame or you her case is without doubt worse than yours Your giving up mister Wildeve will be a real advantage to you for how could you marry him Now she cannot get off so easily everybody will blame her if she loses him Then I ask you not because her right is best but because her situation is worst to give him up to her No I won t I won t she said impetuously quite forgetful of her previous manner towards the reddleman as an underling Nobody has ever been served so It was going on well I will not be beaten down by an inferior woman like her It is very well for you to come and plead for her but is she not herself the cause of all her own trouble Am I not to show favour to any person I may choose without asking permission of a parcel of cottagers She has come between me and my inclination and now that she finds herself rightly punished she gets you to plead for her Indeed said Venn earnestly she knows nothing whatever about it It is only I who ask you to give him up It will be better for her and you both People will say bad things if they find out that a lady secretly meets a man who has ill used another woman I have NOT injured her he was mine before he was hers He came back because because he liked me best she said wildly But I lose all self respect in talking to you What am I giving way to I can keep secrets said Venn gently You need not fear I am the only man who knows of your meetings with him There is but one thing more to speak of and then I will be gone I heard you say to him that you hated living here that Egdon Heath was a jail to you I did say so There is a sort of beauty in the scenery I know but it is a jail to me The man you mention does not save me from that feeling though he lives here I should have cared nothing for him had there been a better person near The reddleman looked hopeful after these words from her his third attempt seemed promising As we have now opened our minds a bit miss he said I ll tell you what I have got to propose Since I have taken to the reddle trade I travel a good deal as you know She inclined her head and swept round so that her eyes rested in the misty vale beneath them And in my travels I go near Budmouth Now Budmouth is a wonderful place wonderful a great salt sheening sea bending into the land like a bow thousands of gentlepeople walking up and down bands of music playing officers by sea and officers by land walking among the rest out of every ten folks you meet nine of em in love I know it she said disdainfully I know Budmouth better than you I was born there My father came to be a military musician there from abroad Ah my soul Budmouth I wish I was there now The reddleman was surprised to see how a slow fire could blaze on occasion If you were miss he replied in a week s time you would think no more of Wildeve than of one of those he th croppers that we see yond Now I could get you there How said Eustacia with intense curiosity in her heavy eyes My uncle has been for five and twenty years the trusty man of a rich widow lady who has a beautiful house facing the sea This lady has become old and lame and she wants a young company keeper to read and sing to her but can t get one to her mind to save her life though she ve advertised in the papers and tried half a dozen She would jump to get you and Uncle would make it all easy I should have to work perhaps No not real work you d have a little to do such as reading and that You would not be wanted till New Year s Day I knew it meant work she said drooping to languor again I confess there would be a trifle to do in the way of amusing her but though idle people might call it work working people would call it play Think of the company and the life you d lead miss the gaiety you d see and the gentleman you d marry My uncle is to inquire for a trustworthy young lady from the country as she don t like town girls It is to wear myself out to please her and I won t go O if I could live in a gay town as a lady should and go my own ways and do my own doings I d give the wrinkled half of my life Yes reddleman that would I Help me to get Thomasin happy miss and the chance shall be yours urged her companion Chance tis no chance she said proudly What can a poor man like you offer me indeed I am going indoors I have nothing more to say Don t your horses want feeding or your reddlebags want mending or don t you want to find buyers for your goods that you stay idling here like this Venn spoke not another word With his hands behind him he turned away that she might not see the hopeless disappointment in his face The mental clearness and power he had found in this lonely girl had indeed filled his manner with misgiving even from the first few minutes of close quarters with her Her youth and situation had led him to expect a simplicity quite at the beck of his method But a system of inducement which might have carried weaker country lasses along with it had merely repelled Eustacia As a rule the word Budmouth meant fascination on Egdon That Royal port and watering place if truly mirrored in the minds of the heathfolk must have combined in a charming and indescribable manner a Carthaginian bustle of building with Tarentine luxuriousness and Baian health and beauty Eustacia felt little less extravagantly about the place but she would not sink her independence to get there When Diggory Venn had gone quite away Eustacia walked to the bank and looked down the wild and picturesque vale towards the sun which was also in the direction of Wildeve s The mist had now so far collapsed that the tips of the trees and bushes around his house could just be discerned as if boring upwards through a vast white cobweb which cloaked them from the day There was no doubt that her mind was inclined thitherward indefinitely fancifully twining and untwining about him as the single object within her horizon on which dreams might crystallize The man who had begun by being merely her amusement and would never have been more than her hobby but for his skill in deserting her at the right moments was now again her desire Cessation in his love making had revivified her love Such feeling as Eustacia had idly given to Wildeve was dammed into a flood by Thomasin She had used to tease Wildeve but that was before another had favoured him Often a drop of irony into an indifferent situation renders the whole piquant I will never give him up never she said impetuously The reddleman s hint that rumour might show her to disadvantage had no permanent terror for Eustacia She was as unconcerned at that contingency as a goddess at a lack of linen This did not originate in inherent shamelessness but in her living too far from the world to feel the impact of public opinion Zenobia in the desert could hardly have cared what was said about her at Rome As far as social ethics were concerned Eustacia approached the savage state though in emotion she was all the while an epicure She had advanced to the secret recesses of sensuousness yet had hardly crossed the threshold of conventionality eleven The Dishonesty of an Honest Woman The reddleman had left Eustacia s presence with desponding views on Thomasin s future happiness but he was awakened to the fact that one other channel remained untried by seeing as he followed the way to his van the form of missus Yeobright slowly walking towards the Quiet Woman He went across to her and could almost perceive in her anxious face that this journey of hers to Wildeve was undertaken with the same object as his own to Eustacia She did not conceal the fact Then said the reddleman you may as well leave it alone missus Yeobright I half think so myself she said But nothing else remains to be done besides pressing the question upon him I should like to say a word first said Venn firmly mister Wildeve is not the only man who has asked Thomasin to marry him and why should not another have a chance missus Yeobright I should be glad to marry your niece and would have done it any time these last two years There now it is out and I have never told anybody before but herself missus Yeobright was not demonstrative but her eyes involuntarily glanced towards his singular though shapely figure Looks are not everything said the reddleman noticing the glance There s many a calling that don t bring in so much as mine if it comes to money and perhaps I am not so much worse off than Wildeve There is nobody so poor as these professional fellows who have failed and if you shouldn t like my redness well I am not red by birth you know I only took to this business for a freak and I might turn my hand to something else in good time I am much obliged to you for your interest in my niece but I fear there would be objections More than that she is devoted to this man True or I shouldn t have done what I have this morning Otherwise there would be no pain in the case and you would not see me going to his house now What was Thomasin s answer when you told her of your feelings She wrote that you would object to me and other things She was in a measure right You must not take this unkindly I merely state it as a truth You have been good to her and we do not forget it But as she was unwilling on her own account to be your wife that settles the point without my wishes being concerned Yes But there is a difference between then and now ma am She is distressed now and I have thought that if you were to talk to her about me and think favourably of me yourself there might be a chance of winning her round and getting her quite independent of this Wildeve s backward and forward play and his not knowing whether he ll have her or no missus Yeobright shook her head Thomasin thinks and I think with her that she ought to be Wildeve s wife if she means to appear before the world without a slur upon her name If they marry soon everybody will believe that an accident did really prevent the wedding If not it may cast a shade upon her character at any rate make her ridiculous In short if it is anyhow possible they must marry now I thought that till half an hour ago But after all why should her going off with him to Anglebury for a few hours do her any harm Anybody who knows how pure she is will feel any such thought to be quite unjust I have been trying this morning to help on this marriage with Wildeve yes I ma am in the belief that I ought to do it because she was so wrapped up in him But I much question if I was right after all However nothing came of it And now I offer myself missus Yeobright appeared disinclined to enter further into the question I fear I must go on she said I do not see that anything else can be done And she went on But though this conversation did not divert Thomasin s aunt from her purposed interview with Wildeve it made a considerable difference in her mode of conducting that interview She thanked God for the weapon which the reddleman had put into her hands Wildeve was at home when she reached the inn He showed her silently into the parlour and closed the door missus Yeobright began I have thought it my duty to call today A new proposal has been made to me which has rather astonished me It will affect Thomasin greatly and I have decided that it should at least be mentioned to you Yes What is it he said civilly It is of course in reference to her future You may not be aware that another man has shown himself anxious to marry Thomasin Now though I have not encouraged him yet I cannot conscientiously refuse him a chance any longer I don t wish to be short with you but I must be fair to him and to her Who is the man said Wildeve with surprise One who has been in love with her longer than she has with you He proposed to her two years ago At that time she refused him Well He has seen her lately and has asked me for permission to pay his addresses to her She may not refuse him twice What is his name missus Yeobright declined to say He is a man Thomasin likes she added and one whose constancy she respects at least It seems to me that what she refused then she would be glad to get now She is much annoyed at her awkward position She never once told me of this old lover The gentlest women are not such fools as to show EVERY card Well if she wants him I suppose she must have him It is easy enough to say that but you don t see the difficulty He wants her much more than she wants him and before I can encourage anything of the sort I must have a clear understanding from you that you will not interfere to injure an arrangement which I promote in the belief that it is for the best Suppose when they are engaged and everything is smoothly arranged for their marriage that you should step between them and renew your suit You might not win her back but you might cause much unhappiness Of course I should do no such thing said Wildeve But they are not engaged yet How do you know that Thomasin would accept him That s a question I have carefully put to myself and upon the whole the probabilities are in favour of her accepting him in time I flatter myself that I have some influence over her She is pliable and I can be strong in my recommendations of him And in your disparagement of me at the same time Well you may depend upon my not praising you she said drily And if this seems like manoeuvring you must remember that her position is peculiar and that she has been hardly used I shall also be helped in making the match by her own desire to escape from the humiliation of her present state and a woman s pride in these cases will lead her a very great way A little managing may be required to bring her round but I am equal to that provided that you agree to the one thing indispensable that is to make a distinct declaration that she is to think no more of you as a possible husband That will pique her into accepting him I can hardly say that just now missus Yeobright It is so sudden And so my whole plan is interfered with It is very inconvenient that you refuse to help my family even to the small extent of saying distinctly you will have nothing to do with us Wildeve reflected uncomfortably I confess I was not prepared for this he said Of course I ll give her up if you wish if it is necessary But I thought I might be her husband We have heard that before Now missus Yeobright don t let us disagree Give me a fair time I don t want to stand in the way of any better chance she may have only I wish you had let me know earlier I will write to you or call in a day or two Will that suffice Yes she replied provided you promise not to communicate with Thomasin without my knowledge I promise that he said And the interview then terminated missus Yeobright returning homeward as she had come By far the greatest effect of her simple strategy on that day was as often happens in a quarter quite outside her view when arranging it In the first place her visit sent Wildeve the same evening after dark to Eustacia s house at Mistover At this hour the lonely dwelling was closely blinded and shuttered from the chill and darkness without Wildeve s clandestine plan with her was to take a little gravel in his hand and hold it to the crevice at the top of the window shutter which was on the outside so that it should fall with a gentle rustle resembling that of a mouse between shutter and glass This precaution in attracting her attention was to avoid arousing the suspicions of her grandfather The soft words I hear wait for me in Eustacia s voice from within told him that she was alone He waited in his customary manner by walking round the enclosure and idling by the pool for Wildeve was never asked into the house by his proud though condescending mistress She showed no sign of coming out in a hurry The time wore on and he began to grow impatient In the course of twenty minutes she appeared from round the corner and advanced as if merely taking an airing You would not have kept me so long had you known what I come about he said with bitterness Still you are worth waiting for What has happened said Eustacia I did not know you were in trouble I too am gloomy enough I am not in trouble said he It is merely that affairs have come to a head and I must take a clear course What course is that she asked with attentive interest And can you forget so soon what I proposed to you the other night Why take you from this place and carry you away with me abroad I have not forgotten But why have you come so unexpectedly to repeat the question when you only promised to come next Saturday I thought I was to have plenty of time to consider Yes but the situation is different now Explain to me I don t want to explain for I may pain you But I must know the reason of this hurry It is simply my ardour dear Eustacia Everything is smooth now Then why are you so ruffled I am not aware of it All is as it should be missus Yeobright but she is nothing to us Ah I knew she had something to do with it Come I don t like reserve No she has nothing She only says she wishes me to give up Thomasin because another man is anxious to marry her The woman now she no longer needs me actually shows off Wildeve s vexation has escaped him in spite of himself Eustacia was silent a long while You are in the awkward position of an official who is no longer wanted she said in a changed tone It seems so But I have not yet seen Thomasin And that irritates you Don t deny it Damon You are actually nettled by this slight from an unexpected quarter Well And you come to get me because you cannot get her This is certainly a new position altogether I am to be a stop gap Please remember that I proposed the same thing the other day Eustacia again remained in a sort of stupefied silence What curious feeling was this coming over her Was it really possible that her interest in Wildeve had been so entirely the result of antagonism that the glory and the dream departed from the man with the first sound that he was no longer coveted by her rival She was then secure of him at last Thomasin no longer required him What a humiliating victory He loved her best she thought and yet dared she to murmur such treacherous criticism ever so softly what was the man worth whom a woman inferior to herself did not value The sentiment which lurks more or less in all animate nature that of not desiring the undesired of others was lively as a passion in the supersubtle epicurean heart of Eustacia Her social superiority over him which hitherto had scarcely ever impressed her became unpleasantly insistent and for the first time she felt that she had stooped in loving him Well darling you agree said Wildeve If it could be London or even Budmouth instead of America she murmured languidly Well I will think It is too great a thing for me to decide offhand I wish I hated the heath less or loved you more You can be painfully frank You loved me a month ago warmly enough to go anywhere with me And you loved Thomasin Yes perhaps that was where the reason lay he returned with almost a sneer I don t hate her now Exactly The only thing is that you can no longer get her Come no taunts Eustacia or we shall quarrel If you don t agree to go with me and agree shortly I shall go by myself Or try Thomasin again Damon how strange it seems that you could have married her or me indifferently and only have come to me because I am cheapest Yes yes it is true There was a time when I should have exclaimed against a man of that sort and been quite wild but it is all past now Will you go dearest Come secretly with me to Bristol marry me and turn our backs upon this dog hole of England for ever Say Yes I want to get away from here at almost any cost she said with weariness but I don t like to go with you Give me more time to decide I have already said Wildeve Well I give you one more week A little longer so that I may tell you decisively I have to consider so many things Fancy Thomasin being anxious to get rid of you I cannot forget it Never mind that Say Monday week I will be here precisely at this time Let it be at Rainbarrow said she This is too near home my grandfather may be walking out Thank you dear On Monday week at this time I will be at the Barrow Till then good bye Good bye No no you must not touch me now Shaking hands is enough till I have made up my mind Eustacia watched his shadowy form till it had disappeared She placed her hand to her forehead and breathed heavily and then her rich romantic lips parted under that homely impulse a yawn She was immediately angry at having betrayed even to herself the possible evanescence of her passion for him She could not admit at once that she might have overestimated Wildeve for to perceive his mediocrity now was to admit her own great folly heretofore And the discovery that she was the owner of a disposition so purely that of the dog in the manger had something in it which at first made her ashamed The fruit of missus Yeobright s diplomacy was indeed remarkable though not as yet of the kind she had anticipated It had appreciably influenced Wildeve but it was influencing Eustacia far more Her lover was no longer to her an exciting man whom many women strove for and herself could only retain by striving with them He was a superfluity She went indoors in that peculiar state of misery which is not exactly grief and which especially attends the dawnings of reason in the latter days of an ill judged transient love To be conscious that the end of the dream is approaching and yet has not absolutely come is one of the most wearisome as well as the most curious stages along the course between the beginning of a passion and its end Her grandfather had returned and was busily engaged in pouring some gallons of newly arrived rum into the square bottles of his square cellaret Whenever these home supplies were exhausted he would go to the Quiet Woman and standing with his back to the fire grog in hand tell remarkable stories of how he had lived seven years under the waterline of his ship and other naval wonders to the natives who hoped too earnestly for a treat of ale from the teller to exhibit any doubts of his truth He had been there this evening I suppose you have heard the Egdon news Eustacia he said without looking up from the bottles The men have been talking about it at the Woman as if it were of national importance I have heard none she said Young Clym Yeobright as they call him is coming home next week to spend Christmas with his mother He is a fine fellow by this time it seems I suppose you remember him I never saw him in my life Ah true he left before you came here I well remember him as a promising boy Where has he been living all these years In that rookery of pomp and vanity Paris I believe BOOK TWO THE ARRIVAL

none	none	 On the fine days at this time of the year and earlier 
153-126651-0001	train-other-500	certain ephemeral operations were apt to disturb in their trifling way the majestic calm of Egdon Heath They were activities which beside those of a town a village or even a farm
153-126651-0002	train-other-500	would have appeared as the ferment of stagnation merely a creeping of the flesh of somnolence But here away from comparisons shut in by the stable hills among which mere walking
153-126651-0003	train-other-500	had the novelty of pageantry and where any man could imagine himself to be Adam without the least difficulty they attracted the attention of every bird within eyeshot every reptile not yet asleep
153-126651-0004	train-other-500	and set the surrounding rabbits curiously watching from hillocks at a safe distance The performance was that of bringing together and building into a stack the furze faggots
153-126651-0005	train-other-500	which Humphrey had been cutting for the captain s use during the foregoing fine days The stack was at the end of the dwelling and the men engaged in building it were Humphrey and Sam the old man looking on
153-126651-0006	train-other-500	It was a fine and quiet afternoon about three o clock but the winter solstice having stealthily come on the lowness of the sun caused the hour to seem later than it actually was
153-126651-0007	train-other-500	there being little here to remind an inhabitant that he must unlearn his summer experience of the sky as a dial In the course of many days and weeks
153-126651-0008	train-other-500	sunrise had advanced its quarters from northeast to southeast sunset had receded from northwest to southwest but Egdon had hardly heeded the change
153-126651-0009	train-other-500	Eustacia was indoors in the dining room which was really more like a kitchen having a stone floor and a gaping chimney corner The air was still and while she lingered a moment here alone
153-126651-0010	train-other-500	sounds of voices in conversation came to her ears directly down the chimney She entered the recess and listening looked up the old irregular shaft with its cavernous hollows where the smoke blundered about
153-126651-0011	train-other-500	on its way to the square bit of sky at the top from which the daylight struck down with a pallid glare upon the tatters of soot draping the flue as seaweed drapes a rocky fissure She remembered
153-126651-0012	train-other-500	the furze stack was not far from the chimney and the voices were those of the workers Her grandfather joined in the conversation
none	none	 That lad ought never to have left home His father s occupation would have suited him best and the boy should have followed on 
153-126651-0013	train-other-500	I don t believe in these new moves in families My father was a sailor so was I and so should my son have been if I had had one The place he s been living at is Paris said Humphrey
153-126651-0014	train-other-500	and they tell me tis where the king s head was cut off years ago My poor mother used to tell me about that business Hummy she used to say I was a young maid then
none	none	 and as I was at home ironing Mother s caps one afternoon the parson came in and said 
153-126651-0015	train-other-500	They ve cut the king s head off Jane and what twill be next God knows A good many of us knew as well as He before long said the captain chuckling I lived seven years under water on account of it in my boyhood
153-126651-0016	train-other-500	in that damned surgery of the Triumph seeing men brought down to the cockpit with their legs and arms blown to Jericho And so the young man has settled in Paris Manager to a diamond merchant or some such thing is he not
153-126651-0017	train-other-500	Yes sir that s it Tis a blazing great business that he belongs to so I ve heard his mother say
none	none	 like a king s palace as far as diments go 
153-126651-0018	train-other-500	I can well mind when he left home said Sam Tis a good thing for the feller said Humphrey
none	none	 A sight of times better to be selling diments than nobbling about here It must cost a good few shillings to deal at such a place A good few indeed my man replied the captain Yes you may make away with a deal of money 
153-126651-0019	train-other-500	and be neither drunkard nor glutton They say too that Clym Yeobright is become a real perusing man with the strangest notions about things There that s because he went to school early such as the school was
153-126651-0020	train-other-500	Strange notions has he said the old man Ah there s too much of that sending to school in these days It only does harm
none	none	 Every gatepost and barn s door you come to is sure to have some bad word or other chalked upon it by the young rascals

none	none	 If they d never been taught how to write they wouldn t have been able to scribble such villainy 
153-126651-0022	train-other-500	Their fathers couldn t do it and the country was all the better for it Now I should think Cap n that Miss Eustacia had about as much in her head that comes from books as anybody about here
none	none	 Perhaps if Miss Eustacia too had less romantic nonsense in her head it would be better for her 
153-126651-0023	train-other-500	said the captain shortly after which he walked away I say Sam observed Humphrey when the old man was gone
153-126651-0024	train-other-500	she and Clym Yeobright would make a very pretty pigeon pair hey If they wouldn t I ll be dazed Both of one mind about niceties for certain and learned in print

153-126651-0025	train-other-500	Clym s family is as good as hers
none	none	 His father was a farmer that s true but his mother was a sort of lady as we know 
153-126651-0026	train-other-500	Nothing would please me better than to see them two man and wife They d look very natty arm in crook together and their best clothes on whether or no
none	none	 if he s at all the well favoured fellow he used to be They would Humphrey 
153-126651-0027	train-other-500	Well I should like to see the chap terrible much after so many years
none	none	 If I knew for certain when he was coming I d stroll out three or four miles to meet him 
153-126651-0028	train-other-500	and help carry anything for n though I suppose he s altered from the boy he was They say he can talk French as fast as a maid can eat blackberries and if so depend upon it we who have stayed at home
153-126651-0029	train-other-500	shall seem no more than scroff in his eyes
none	none	 Coming across the water to Budmouth by steamer isn t he Yes but how he s coming from Budmouth I don t know 
153-126651-0030	train-other-500	That s a bad trouble about his cousin Thomasin
none	none	 I wonder such a nice notioned fellow as Clym likes to come home into it 
153-126651-0031	train-other-500	What a nunnywatch we were in to be sure when we heard they weren t married at all
none	none	 after singing to em as man and wife that night Be dazed if I should like a relation of mine to have been made such a fool of by a man It makes the family look small 
153-126651-0032	train-other-500	Yes Poor maid her heart has ached enough about it Her health is suffering from it I hear for she will bide entirely indoors We never see her out now scampering over the furze with a face as red as a rose as she used to do
none	none	 I ve heard she wouldn t have Wildeve now if he asked her 
153-126651-0033	train-other-500	You have Tis news to me While the furze gatherers had desultorily conversed thus Eustacia s face gradually bent to the hearth
153-126651-0034	train-other-500	in a profound reverie her toe unconsciously tapping the dry turf which lay burning at her feet
none	none	 The subject of their discourse had been keenly interesting to her 
153-126651-0035	train-other-500	A young and clever man was coming into that lonely heath from of all contrasting places in the world Paris
none	none	 It was like a man coming from heaven 
153-126651-0036	train-other-500	More singular still the heathmen had instinctively coupled her and this man together in their minds as a pair born for each other
153-126651-0037	train-other-500	That five minutes of overhearing furnished Eustacia with visions enough to fill the whole blank afternoon Such sudden alternations from mental vacuity do sometimes occur
153-126651-0038	train-other-500	thus quietly She could never have believed in the morning that her colourless inner world would before night become as animated as water under a microscope and that without the arrival of a single visitor
153-126651-0039	train-other-500	The words of Sam and Humphrey on the harmony between the unknown and herself had on her mind the effect of the invading Bard s prelude in the Castle of Indolence
153-126651-0040	train-other-500	at which myriads of imprisoned shapes arose where had previously appeared the stillness of a void
none	none	 Involved in these imaginings she knew nothing of time 
153-126651-0041	train-other-500	When she became conscious of externals it was dusk The furze rick was finished the men had gone home Eustacia went upstairs thinking that she would take a walk at this her usual time
153-126651-0042	train-other-500	and she determined that her walk should be in the direction of Blooms End the birthplace of young Yeobright and the present home of his mother She had no reason for walking elsewhere and
153-126651-0043	train-other-500	why should she not go that way The scene of the daydream is sufficient for a pilgrimage at nineteen To look at the palings before the Yeobrights house had the dignity of a necessary performance
153-126651-0044	train-other-500	Strange that such a piece of idling should have seemed an important errand She put on her bonnet and leaving the house descended the hill on the side towards Blooms End
none	none	 where she walked slowly along the valley for a distance 
153-126651-0045	train-other-500	of a mile and a half This brought her to a spot in which the green bottom of the dale began to widen
none	none	 the furze bushes to recede yet further from the path on each side 
153-126651-0046	train-other-500	till they were diminished to an isolated one here and there by the increasing fertility of the soil
none	none	 Beyond the irregular carpet of grass was a row of white palings 
153-126651-0047	train-other-500	which marked the verge of the heath in this latitude They showed upon the dusky scene that they bordered as distinctly as white lace on velvet Behind the white palings was a little garden behind the garden
153-126651-0048	train-other-500	an old irregular thatched house facing the heath and commanding a full view of the valley This was the obscure removed spot to which was about to return a man whose latter life
153-126651-0049	train-other-500	had been passed in the French capital the centre and vortex
none	none	 of the fashionable world two The People at Blooms End Make Ready 
153-126652-0000	train-other-500	All that afternoon the expected arrival of the subject of Eustacia s ruminations created a bustle of preparation at Blooms End Thomasin had been persuaded by her aunt
153-126652-0001	train-other-500	and by an instinctive impulse of loyalty towards her cousin Clym to bestir herself on his account with an alacrity unusual in her during these most sorrowful days of her life
153-126652-0002	train-other-500	At the time that Eustacia was listening to the rick makers conversation on Clym s return Thomasin was climbing into a loft over her aunt s fuelhouse where the store apples were kept
153-126652-0003	train-other-500	to search out the best and largest of them for the coming holiday time The loft was lighted by a semicircular hole through which the pigeons crept to their lodgings in the same high quarters of the premises
153-126652-0004	train-other-500	and from this hole the sun shone in a bright yellow patch upon the figure of the maiden as she knelt and plunged her naked arms into the soft brown fern which from its abundance
153-126652-0005	train-other-500	was used on Egdon in packing away stores of all kinds The pigeons were flying about her head with the greatest unconcern and the face of her aunt was just visible above the floor of the loft
153-126652-0006	train-other-500	lit by a few stray motes of light as she stood halfway up the ladder looking at a spot into which she was not climber enough to venture Now a few russets Tamsin
153-126652-0007	train-other-500	He used to like them almost as well as ribstones Thomasin turned and rolled aside the fern from another nook where more mellow fruit greeted her with its ripe smell Before picking them out
153-126652-0008	train-other-500	she stopped a moment Dear Clym I wonder how your face looks now she said gazing abstractedly at the pigeon hole
153-126652-0009	train-other-500	which admitted the sunlight so directly upon her brown hair and transparent tissues that it almost seemed to shine through her If he could have been dear to you in another way said missus Yeobright from the ladder
153-126652-0010	train-other-500	this might have been a happy meeting Is there any use in saying what can do no good Aunt Yes said her aunt with some warmth To thoroughly fill the air with the past misfortune
153-126652-0011	train-other-500	so that other girls may take warning and keep clear of it Thomasin lowered her face to the apples again I am a warning to others just as thieves and drunkards and gamblers are
153-126652-0012	train-other-500	she said in a low voice What a class to belong to Do I really belong to them Tis absurd Yet why Aunt does everybody keep on making me think that I do by the way they behave towards me
153-126652-0013	train-other-500	Why don t people judge me by my acts Now look at me as I kneel here picking up these apples do I look like a lost woman I wish all good women were as good as I she
none	none	 added vehemently 
153-126652-0014	train-other-500	Strangers don t see you as I do said missus Yeobright they judge from false report Well it is a silly job and I am partly to blame How quickly a rash thing can be done
153-126652-0015	train-other-500	replied the girl Her lips were quivering and tears so crowded themselves into her eyes that she could hardly distinguish apples from fern as she continued industriously searching to hide her weakness
none	none	 As soon as you have finished getting the apples her aunt said descending the ladder 
153-126652-0016	train-other-500	come down and we ll go for the holly There is nobody on the heath this afternoon and you need not fear being stared at We must get some berries or Clym will never believe in our preparations
153-126652-0017	train-other-500	Thomasin came down when the apples were collected and together they went through the white palings to the heath beyond The open hills were airy and clear and the remote atmosphere appeared
153-126652-0018	train-other-500	as it often appears on a fine winter day in distinct planes of illumination independently toned the rays which lit the nearer tracts of landscape
none	none	 streaming visibly across those further off 
153-126652-0019	train-other-500	a stratum of ensaffroned light was imposed on a stratum of deep blue and behind these lay still remoter scenes wrapped in frigid grey
153-126652-0020	train-other-500	They reached the place where the hollies grew which was in a conical pit so that the tops of the trees were not much above the general level of the ground Thomasin stepped up into a fork of one of the bushes
153-126652-0021	train-other-500	as she had done under happier circumstances on many similar occasions and with a small chopper that they had brought she began to lop off the heavily berried boughs Don t scratch your face
153-126652-0022	train-other-500	said her aunt who stood at the edge of the pit
none	none	 regarding the girl as she held on amid the glistening green and scarlet masses of the tree 
153-126652-0023	train-other-500	Will you walk with me to meet him this evening I should like to Else it would seem as if I had forgotten him said Thomasin tossing out a bough Not that that would matter much
153-126652-0024	train-other-500	I belong to one man nothing can alter that
none	none	 And that man I must marry for my pride s sake I am afraid began missus Yeobright Ah you think 
153-126652-0025	train-other-500	That weak girl how is she going to get a man to marry her when she chooses But let me tell you one thing Aunt
none	none	 mister Wildeve is not a profligate man 
153-126652-0026	train-other-500	any more than I am an improper woman He has an unfortunate manner and doesn t try to make people like him if they don t wish to do it of their own accord Thomasin
153-126652-0027	train-other-500	said missus Yeobright quietly fixing her eye upon her niece
none	none	 do you think you deceive me in your defence of mister Wildeve 
153-126652-0028	train-other-500	How do you mean I have long had a suspicion that your love for him has changed its colour
none	none	 since you have found him not to be the saint you thought him 
153-126652-0029	train-other-500	and that you act a part to me He wished to marry me
none	none	 and I wish to marry him 
153-126652-0030	train-other-500	Now I put it to you would you at this present moment agree to be his wife if that had not happened to entangle you with him Thomasin looked into the tree and appeared much disturbed
153-126652-0031	train-other-500	Aunt she said presently I have I think a right to refuse to answer that question Yes you have
153-126652-0032	train-other-500	You may think what you choose I have never implied to you by word or deed that I have grown to think otherwise of him and I never will And I shall marry him Well wait till he repeats his offer
153-126652-0033	train-other-500	I think he may do it now that he knows something I told him I don t for a moment dispute that it is the most proper thing for you to marry him Much as I have objected to him in bygone days I agree with you now you may be sure
153-126652-0034	train-other-500	It is the only way out of a false position and a very galling one What did you tell him That he was standing in the way of another lover of yours Aunt
153-126652-0035	train-other-500	said Thomasin with round eyes what DO you mean Don t be alarmed it was my duty
none	none	 I can say no more about it now but when it is over I will tell you exactly what I said and why I said it 
153-126652-0036	train-other-500	Thomasin was perforce content And you will keep the secret of my would be marriage from Clym for the present she next asked
none	none	 I have given my word to 
153-126652-0037	train-other-500	But what is the use of it He must soon know what has happened A mere look at your face will show him that something is wrong Thomasin turned and regarded her aunt from the tree
153-126652-0038	train-other-500	Now hearken to me she said her delicate voice expanding into firmness by a force which was other than physical Tell him nothing
none	none	 If he finds out that I am not worthy to be his cousin 
153-126652-0039	train-other-500	let him But since he loved me once we will not pain him by telling him my trouble too soon The air is full of the story I know but gossips will not dare to speak of it to him for the first few days His closeness to me
153-126652-0040	train-other-500	is the very thing that will hinder the tale from reaching him early If I am not made safe from sneers in a week or two I will tell him myself The earnestness with which Thomasin spoke prevented further objections
153-126652-0041	train-other-500	Her aunt simply said Very well He should by rights have been told at the time that the wedding was going to be He will never forgive you for your secrecy Yes he will when he knows it was because I wished to spare him
153-126652-0042	train-other-500	and that I did not expect him home so soon And you must not let me stand in the way of your Christmas party Putting it off would only make matters worse Of course I shall not I do not wish to show myself beaten before all Egdon
none	none	 and the sport of a man like Wildeve We have enough berries now I think and we had better take them home By the time we have decked the house with this and hung up the mistletoe we must think of starting to meet him 
153-126652-0043	train-other-500	Thomasin came out of the tree shook from her hair and dress the loose berries which had fallen thereon and went down the hill with her aunt each woman bearing half the gathered boughs
153-126652-0044	train-other-500	It was now nearly four o clock and the sunlight was leaving the vales When the west grew red the two relatives came again from the house and plunged into the heath in a different direction from the first
none	none	 towards a point in the distant highway along which the expected man was to return three How a Little Sound Produced a Great Dream Eustacia stood just within the heath straining her eyes in the direction of missus Yeobright s house and premises No light sound or movement was perceptible there The evening was chilly the spot was dark and lonely She inferred that the guest had not yet come and after lingering ten or fifteen minutes she turned again towards home She had not far retraced her steps when sounds in front of her betokened the approach of persons in conversation along the same path Soon their heads became visible against the sky They were walking slowly and though it was too dark for much discovery of character from aspect the gait of them showed that they were not workers on the heath Eustacia stepped a little out of the foot track to let them pass They were two women and a man and the voices of the women were those of missus Yeobright and Thomasin They went by her and at the moment of passing appeared to discern her dusky form There came to her ears in a masculine voice Good night She murmured a reply glided by them and turned round She could not for a moment believe that chance unrequested had brought into her presence the soul of the house she had gone to inspect the man without whom her inspection would not have been thought of She strained her eyes to see them but was unable Such was her intentness however that it seemed as if her ears were performing the functions of seeing as well as hearing This extension of power can almost be believed in at such moments The deaf doctor Kitto was probably under the influence of a parallel fancy when he described his body as having become by long endeavour so sensitive to vibrations that he had gained the power of perceiving by it as by ears She could follow every word that the ramblers uttered They were talking no secrets They were merely indulging in the ordinary vivacious chat of relatives who have long been parted in person though not in soul But it was not to the words that Eustacia listened she could not even have recalled a few minutes later what the words were It was to the alternating voice that gave out about one tenth of them the voice that had wished her good night Sometimes this throat uttered Yes sometimes it uttered No sometimes it made inquiries about a time worn denizen of the place Once it surprised her notions by remarking upon the friendliness and geniality written in the faces of the hills around The three voices passed on and decayed and died out upon her ear Thus much had been granted her and all besides withheld No event could have been more exciting During the greater part of the afternoon she had been entrancing herself by imagining the fascination which must attend a man come direct from beautiful Paris laden with its atmosphere familiar with its charms And this man had greeted her With the departure of the figures the profuse articulations of the women wasted away from her memory but the accents of the other stayed on Was there anything in the voice of missus Yeobright s son for Clym it was startling as a sound No it was simply comprehensive All emotional things were possible to the speaker of that good night Eustacia s imagination supplied the rest except the solution to one riddle What COULD the tastes of that man be who saw friendliness and geniality in these shaggy hills On such occasions as this a thousand ideas pass through a highly charged woman s head and they indicate themselves on her face but the changes though actual are minute Eustacia s features went through a rhythmical succession of them She glowed remembering the mendacity of the imagination she flagged then she freshened then she fired then she cooled again It was a cycle of aspects produced by a cycle of visions Eustacia entered her own house she was excited Her grandfather was enjoying himself over the fire raking about the ashes and exposing the red hot surface of the turves so that their lurid glare irradiated the chimney corner with the hues of a furnace Why is it that we are never friendly with the Yeobrights she said coming forward and stretching her soft hands over the warmth I wish we were They seem to be very nice people Be hanged if I know why said the captain I liked the old man well enough though he was as rough as a hedge But you would never have cared to go there even if you might have I am well sure Why shouldn t I Your town tastes would find them far too countrified They sit in the kitchen drink mead and elder wine and sand the floor to keep it clean A sensible way of life but how would you like it I thought missus Yeobright was a ladylike woman A curate s daughter was she not Yes but she was obliged to live as her husband did and I suppose she has taken kindly to it by this time Ah I recollect that I once accidentally offended her and I have never seen her since That night was an eventful one to Eustacia s brain and one which she hardly ever forgot She dreamt a dream and few human beings from Nebuchadnezzar to the Swaffham tinker ever dreamt a more remarkable one Such an elaborately developed perplexing exciting dream was certainly never dreamed by a girl in Eustacia s situation before It had as many ramifications as the Cretan labyrinth as many fluctuations as the northern lights as much colour as a parterre in June and was as crowded with figures as a coronation To Queen Scheherazade the dream might have seemed not far removed from commonplace and to a girl just returned from all the courts of Europe it might have seemed not more than interesting But amid the circumstances of Eustacia s life it was as wonderful as a dream could be There was however gradually evolved from its transformation scenes a less extravagant episode in which the heath dimly appeared behind the general brilliancy of the action She was dancing to wondrous music and her partner was the man in silver armour who had accompanied her through the previous fantastic changes the visor of his helmet being closed The mazes of the dance were ecstatic Soft whispering came into her ear from under the radiant helmet and she felt like a woman in Paradise Suddenly these two wheeled out from the mass of dancers dived into one of the pools of the heath and came out somewhere into an iridescent hollow arched with rainbows It must be here said the voice by her side and blushingly looking up she saw him removing his casque to kiss her At that moment there was a cracking noise and his figure fell into fragments like a pack of cards She cried aloud O that I had seen his face Eustacia awoke The cracking had been that of the window shutter downstairs which the maid servant was opening to let in the day now slowly increasing to Nature s meagre allowance at this sickly time of the year O that I had seen his face she said again Twas meant for mister Yeobright When she became cooler she perceived that many of the phases of the dream had naturally arisen out of the images and fancies of the day before But this detracted little from its interest which lay in the excellent fuel it provided for newly kindled fervour She was at the modulating point between indifference and love at the stage called having a fancy for It occurs once in the history of the most gigantic passions and it is a period when they are in the hands of the weakest will The perfervid woman was by this time half in love with a vision The fantastic nature of her passion which lowered her as an intellect raised her as a soul If she had had a little more self control she would have attenuated the emotion to nothing by sheer reasoning and so have killed it off If she had had a little less pride she might have gone and circumambulated the Yeobrights premises at Blooms End at any maidenly sacrifice until she had seen him But Eustacia did neither of these things She acted as the most exemplary might have acted being so influenced she took an airing twice or thrice a day upon the Egdon hills and kept her eyes employed The first occasion passed and he did not come that way She promenaded a second time and was again the sole wanderer there The third time there was a dense fog she looked around but without much hope Even if he had been walking within twenty yards of her she could not have seen him At the fourth attempt to encounter him it began to rain in torrents and she turned back The fifth sally was in the afternoon it was fine and she remained out long walking to the very top of the valley in which Blooms End lay She saw the white paling about half a mile off but he did not appear It was almost with heart sickness that she came home and with a sense of shame at her weakness She resolved to look for the man from Paris no more But Providence is nothing if not coquettish and no sooner had Eustacia formed this resolve than the opportunity came which while sought had been entirely withholden four Eustacia Is Led on to an Adventure In the evening of this last day of expectation which was the twenty third of December Eustacia was at home alone She had passed the recent hour in lamenting over a rumour newly come to her ears that Yeobright s visit to his mother was to be of short duration and would end some time the next week Naturally she said to herself A man in the full swing of his activities in a gay city could not afford to linger long on Egdon Heath That she would behold face to face the owner of the awakening voice within the limits of such a holiday was most unlikely unless she were to haunt the environs of his mother s house like a robin to do which was difficult and unseemly The customary expedient of provincial girls and men in such circumstances is churchgoing In an ordinary village or country town one can safely calculate that either on Christmas day or the Sunday contiguous any native home for the holidays who has not through age or ennui lost the appetite for seeing and being seen will turn up in some pew or other shining with hope self consciousness and new clothes Thus the congregation on Christmas morning is mostly a Tussaud collection of celebrities who have been born in the neighbourhood Hither the mistress left neglected at home all the year can steal and observe the development of the returned lover who has forgotten her and think as she watches him over her prayer book that he may throb with a renewed fidelity when novelties have lost their charm And hither a comparatively recent settler like Eustacia may betake herself to scrutinize the person of a native son who left home before her advent upon the scene and consider if the friendship of his parents be worth cultivating during his next absence in order to secure a knowledge of him on his next return But these tender schemes were not feasible among the scattered inhabitants of Egdon Heath In name they were parishioners but virtually they belonged to no parish at all People who came to these few isolated houses to keep Christmas with their friends remained in their friends chimney corners drinking mead and other comforting liquors till they left again for good and all Rain snow ice mud everywhere around they did not care to trudge two or three miles to sit wet footed and splashed to the nape of their necks among those who though in some measure neighbours lived close to the church and entered it clean and dry Eustacia knew it was ten to one that Clym Yeobright would go to no church at all during his few days of leave and that it would be a waste of labour for her to go driving the pony and gig over a bad road in hope to see him there It was dusk and she was sitting by the fire in the dining room or hall which they occupied at this time of the year in preference to the parlour because of its large hearth constructed for turf fires a fuel the captain was partial to in the winter season The only visible articles in the room were those on the window sill which showed their shapes against the low sky the middle article being the old hourglass and the other two a pair of ancient British urns which had been dug from a barrow near and were used as flowerpots for two razor leaved cactuses Somebody knocked at the door The servant was out so was her grandfather The person after waiting a minute came in and tapped at the door of the room Who s there said Eustacia Please Cap n Vye will you let us Eustacia arose and went to the door I cannot allow you to come in so boldly You should have waited The cap n said I might come in without any fuss was answered in a lad s pleasant voice Oh did he said Eustacia more gently What do you want Charley Please will your grandfather lend us his fuelhouse to try over our parts in tonight at seven o clock What are you one of the Egdon mummers for this year Yes miss The cap n used to let the old mummers practise here I know it Yes you may use the fuelhouse if you like said Eustacia languidly The choice of Captain Vye s fuelhouse as the scene of rehearsal was dictated by the fact that his dwelling was nearly in the centre of the heath The fuelhouse was as roomy as a barn and was a most desirable place for such a purpose The lads who formed the company of players lived at different scattered points around and by meeting in this spot the distances to be traversed by all the comers would be about equally proportioned For mummers and mumming Eustacia had the greatest contempt The mummers themselves were not afflicted with any such feeling for their art though at the same time they were not enthusiastic A traditional pastime is to be distinguished from a mere revival in no more striking feature than in this that while in the revival all is excitement and fervour the survival is carried on with a stolidity and absence of stir which sets one wondering why a thing that is done so perfunctorily should be kept up at all Like Balaam and other unwilling prophets the agents seem moved by an inner compulsion to say and do their allotted parts whether they will or no This unweeting manner of performance is the true ring by which in this refurbishing age a fossilized survival may be known from a spurious reproduction The piece was the well known play of Saint George and all who were behind the scenes assisted in the preparations including the women of each household Without the company operation of sisters and sweethearts the dresses were likely to be a failure but on the other hand this class of assistance was not without its drawbacks The girls could never be brought to respect tradition in designing and decorating the armour they insisted on attaching loops and bows of silk and velvet in any situation pleasing to their taste Gorget gusset basinet cuirass gauntlet sleeve all alike in the view of these feminine eyes were practicable spaces whereon to sew scraps of fluttering colour It might be that Joe who fought on the side of Christendom had a sweetheart and that Jim who fought on the side of the Moslem had one likewise During the making of the costumes it would come to the knowledge of Joe s sweetheart that Jim s was putting brilliant silk scallops at the bottom of her lover s surcoat in addition to the ribbons of the visor the bars of which being invariably formed of coloured strips about half an inch wide hanging before the face were mostly of that material Joe s sweetheart straight way placed brilliant silk on the scallops of the hem in question and going a little further added ribbon tufts to the shoulder pieces Jim s not to be outdone would affix bows and rosettes everywhere The result was that in the end the Valiant Soldier of the Christian army was distinguished by no peculiarity of accoutrement from the Turkish Knight and what was worse on a casual view Saint George himself might be mistaken for his deadly enemy the Saracen The guisers themselves though inwardly regretting this confusion of persons could not afford to offend those by whose assistance they so largely profited and the innovations were allowed to stand There was it is true a limit to this tendency to uniformity The Leech or Doctor preserved his character intact his darker habiliments peculiar hat and the bottle of physic slung under his arm could never be mistaken And the same might be said of the conventional figure of Father Christmas with his gigantic club an older man who accompanied the band as general protector in long night journeys from parish to parish and was bearer of the purse Seven o clock the hour of the rehearsal came round and in a short time Eustacia could hear voices in the fuelhouse To dissipate in some trifling measure her abiding sense of the murkiness of human life she went to the linhay or lean to shed which formed the root store of their dwelling and abutted on the fuelhouse Here was a small rough hole in the mud wall originally made for pigeons through which the interior of the next shed could be viewed A light came from it now and Eustacia stepped upon a stool to look in upon the scene On a ledge in the fuelhouse stood three tall rushlights and by the light of them seven or eight lads were marching about haranguing and confusing each other in endeavours to perfect themselves in the play Humphrey and Sam the furze and turf cutters were there looking on so also was Timothy Fairway who leant against the wall and prompted the boys from memory interspersing among the set words remarks and anecdotes of the superior days when he and others were the Egdon mummers elect that these lads were now Well ye be as well up to it as ever ye will be he said Not that such mumming would have passed in our time Harry as the Saracen should strut a bit more and John needn t holler his inside out Beyond that perhaps you ll do Have you got all your clothes ready We shall by Monday Your first outing will be Monday night I suppose Yes At missus Yeobright s Oh missus Yeobright s What makes her want to see ye I should think a middle aged woman was tired of mumming She s got up a bit of a party because tis the first Christmas that her son Clym has been home for a long time To be sure to be sure her party I am going myself I almost forgot it upon my life Eustacia s face flagged There was to be a party at the Yeobrights she naturally had nothing to do with it She was a stranger to all such local gatherings and had always held them as scarcely appertaining to her sphere But had she been going what an opportunity would have been afforded her of seeing the man whose influence was penetrating her like summer sun To increase that influence was coveted excitement to cast it off might be to regain serenity to leave it as it stood was tantalizing The lads and men prepared to leave the premises and Eustacia returned to her fireside She was immersed in thought but not for long In a few minutes the lad Charley who had come to ask permission to use the place returned with the key to the kitchen Eustacia heard him and opening the door into the passage said Charley come here The lad was surprised He entered the front room not without blushing for he like many had felt the power of this girl s face and form She pointed to a seat by the fire and entered the other side of the chimney corner herself It could be seen in her face that whatever motive she might have had in asking the youth indoors would soon appear Which part do you play Charley the Turkish Knight do you not inquired the beauty looking across the smoke of the fire to him on the other side Yes miss the Turkish Knight he replied diffidently Is yours a long part Nine speeches about Can you repeat them to me If so I should like to hear them The lad smiled into the glowing turf and began Here come I a Turkish Knight Who learnt in Turkish land to fight continuing the discourse throughout the scenes to the concluding catastrophe of his fall by the hand of Saint George Eustacia had occasionally heard the part recited before When the lad ended she began precisely in the same words and ranted on without hitch or divergence till she too reached the end It was the same thing yet how different Like in form it had the added softness and finish of a Raffaelle after Perugino which while faithfully reproducing the original subject entirely distances the original art Charley s eyes rounded with surprise Well you be a clever lady he said in admiration I ve been three weeks learning mine I have heard it before she quietly observed Now would you do anything to please me Charley I d do a good deal miss Would you let me play your part for one night Oh miss But your woman s gown you couldn t I can get boy s clothes at least all that would be wanted besides the mumming dress What should I have to give you to lend me your things to let me take your place for an hour or two on Monday night and on no account to say a word about who or what I am You would of course have to excuse yourself from playing that night and to say that somebody a cousin of Miss Vye s would act for you The other mummers have never spoken to me in their lives so that it would be safe enough and if it were not I should not mind Now what must I give you to agree to this Half a crown The youth shook his head Five shillings He shook his head again Money won t do it he said brushing the iron head of the firedog with the hollow of his hand What will then Charley said Eustacia in a disappointed tone You know what you forbade me at the Maypoling miss murmured the lad without looking at her and still stroking the firedog s head Yes said Eustacia with a little more hauteur You wanted to join hands with me in the ring if I recollect Half an hour of that and I ll agree miss Eustacia regarded the youth steadfastly He was three years younger than herself but apparently not backward for his age Half an hour of what she said though she guessed what Holding your hand in mine She was silent Make it a quarter of an hour she said Yes Miss Eustacia I will if I may kiss it too A quarter of an hour And I ll swear to do the best I can to let you take my place without anybody knowing Don t you think somebody might know your tongue miss It is possible But I will put a pebble in my mouth to make is less likely Very well you shall be allowed to have my hand as soon as you bring the dress and your sword and staff I don t want you any longer now Charley departed and Eustacia felt more and more interest in life Here was something to do here was some one to see and a charmingly adventurous way to see him Ah she said to herself want of an object to live for that s all is the matter with me Eustacia s manner was as a rule of a slumberous sort her passions being of the massive rather than the vivacious kind But when aroused she would make a dash which just for the time was not unlike the move of a naturally lively person On the question of recognition she was somewhat indifferent By the acting lads themselves she was not likely to be known With the guests who might be assembled she was hardly so secure Yet detection after all would be no such dreadful thing The fact only could be detected her true motive never It would be instantly set down as the passing freak of a girl whose ways were already considered singular That she was doing for an earnest reason what would most naturally be done in jest was at any rate a safe secret The next evening Eustacia stood punctually at the fuelhouse door waiting for the dusk which was to bring Charley with the trappings Her grandfather was at home tonight and she would be unable to ask her confederate indoors He appeared on the dark ridge of heathland like a fly on a Negro bearing the articles with him and came up breathless with his walk Here are the things he whispered placing them upon the threshold And now Miss Eustacia The payment It is quite ready I am as good as my word She leant against the door post and gave him her hand Charley took it in both his own with a tenderness beyond description unless it was like that of a child holding a captured sparrow Why there s a glove on it he said in a deprecating way I have been walking she observed But miss Well it is hardly fair She pulled off the glove and gave him her bare hand They stood together minute after minute without further speech each looking at the blackening scene and each thinking his and her own thoughts I think I won t use it all up tonight said Charley devotedly when six or eight minutes had been passed by him caressing her hand May I have the other few minutes another time As you like said she without the least emotion But it must be over in a week Now there is only one thing I want you to do to wait while I put on the dress and then to see if I do my part properly But let me look first indoors She vanished for a minute or two and went in Her grandfather was safely asleep in his chair Now then she said on returning walk down the garden a little way and when I am ready I ll call you Charley walked and waited and presently heard a soft whistle He returned to the fuelhouse door Did you whistle Miss Vye Yes come in reached him in Eustacia s voice from a back quarter I must not strike a light till the door is shut or it may be seen shining Push your hat into the hole through to the wash house if you can feel your way across Charley did as commanded and she struck the light revealing herself to be changed in sex brilliant in colours and armed from top to toe Perhaps she quailed a little under Charley s vigorous gaze but whether any shyness at her male attire appeared upon her countenance could not be seen by reason of the strips of ribbon which used to cover the face in mumming costumes representing the barred visor of the mediaeval helmet It fits pretty well she said looking down at the white overalls except that the tunic or whatever you call it is long in the sleeve The bottom of the overalls I can turn up inside Now pay attention Eustacia then proceeded in her delivery striking the sword against the staff or lance at the minatory phrases in the orthodox mumming manner and strutting up and down Charley seasoned his admiration with criticism of the gentlest kind for the touch of Eustacia s hand yet remained with him And now for your excuse to the others she said Where do you meet before you go to missus Yeobright s We thought of meeting here miss if you have nothing to say against it At eight o clock so as to get there by nine Yes Well you of course must not appear I will march in about five minutes late ready dressed and tell them that you can t come I have decided that the best plan will be for you to be sent somewhere by me to make a real thing of the excuse Our two heath croppers are in the habit of straying into the meads and tomorrow evening you can go and see if they are gone there I ll manage the rest Now you may leave me Yes miss But I think I ll have one minute more of what I am owed if you don t mind Eustacia gave him her hand as before One minute she said and counted on till she reached seven or eight minutes Hand and person she then withdrew to a distance of several feet and recovered some of her old dignity The contract completed she raised between them a barrier impenetrable as a wall There tis all gone and I didn t mean quite all he said with a sigh You had good measure said she turning away Yes miss Well tis over and now I ll get home along five Through the Moonlight The next evening the mummers were assembled in the same spot awaiting the entrance of the Turkish Knight Twenty minutes after eight by the Quiet Woman and Charley not come Ten minutes past by Blooms End It wants ten minutes to by Grandfer Cantle s watch And tis five minutes past by the captain s clock On Egdon there was no absolute hour of the day The time at any moment was a number of varying doctrines professed by the different hamlets some of them having originally grown up from a common root and then become divided by secession some having been alien from the beginning West Egdon believed in Blooms End time East Egdon in the time of the Quiet Woman Inn Grandfer Cantle s watch had numbered many followers in years gone by but since he had grown older faiths were shaken Thus the mummers having gathered hither from scattered points each came with his own tenets on early and late and they waited a little longer as a compromise Eustacia had watched the assemblage through the hole and seeing that now was the proper moment to enter she went from the linhay and boldly pulled the bobbin of the fuelhouse door Her grandfather was safe at the Quiet Woman Here s Charley at last How late you be Charley Tis not Charley said the Turkish Knight from within his visor Tis a cousin of Miss Vye s come to take Charley s place from curiosity He was obliged to go and look for the heath croppers that have got into the meads and I agreed to take his place as he knew he couldn t come back here again tonight I know the part as well as he Her graceful gait elegant figure and dignified manner in general won the mummers to the opinion that they had gained by the exchange if the newcomer were perfect in his part It don t matter if you be not too young said Saint George Eustacia s voice had sounded somewhat more juvenile and fluty than Charley s I know every word of it I tell you said Eustacia decisively Dash being all that was required to carry her triumphantly through she adopted as much as was necessary Go ahead lads with the try over I ll challenge any of you to find a mistake in me The play was hastily rehearsed whereupon the other mummers were delighted with the new knight They extinguished the candles at half past eight and set out upon the heath in the direction of missus Yeobright s house at Bloom s End There was a slight hoarfrost that night and the moon though not more than half full threw a spirited and enticing brightness upon the fantastic figures of the mumming band whose plumes and ribbons rustled in their walk like autumn leaves Their path was not over Rainbarrow now but down a valley which left that ancient elevation a little to the east The bottom of the vale was green to a width of ten yards or thereabouts and the shining facets of frost upon the blades of grass seemed to move on with the shadows of those they surrounded The masses of furze and heath to the right and left were dark as ever a mere half moon was powerless to silver such sable features as theirs Half an hour of walking and talking brought them to the spot in the valley where the grass riband widened and led down to the front of the house At sight of the place Eustacia who had felt a few passing doubts during her walk with the youths again was glad that the adventure had been undertaken She had come out to see a man who might possibly have the power to deliver her soul from a most deadly oppression What was Wildeve Interesting but inadequate Perhaps she would see a sufficient hero tonight As they drew nearer to the front of the house the mummers became aware that music and dancing were briskly flourishing within Every now and then a long low note from the serpent which was the chief wind instrument played at these times advanced further into the heath than the thin treble part and reached their ears alone and next a more than usual loud tread from a dancer would come the same way With nearer approach these fragmentary sounds became pieced together and were found to be the salient points of the tune called Nancy s Fancy He was there of course Who was she that he danced with Perhaps some unknown woman far beneath herself in culture was by the most subtle of lures sealing his fate this very instant To dance with a man is to concentrate a twelvemonth s regulation fire upon him in the fragment of an hour To pass to courtship without acquaintance to pass to marriage without courtship is a skipping of terms reserved for those alone who tread this royal road She would see how his heart lay by keen observation of them all The enterprising lady followed the mumming company through the gate in the white paling and stood before the open porch The house was encrusted with heavy thatchings which dropped between the upper windows the front upon which the moonbeams directly played had originally been white but a huge pyracanth now darkened the greater portion It became at once evident that the dance was proceeding immediately within the surface of the door no apartment intervening The brushing of skirts and elbows sometimes the bumping of shoulders could be heard against the very panels Eustacia though living within two miles of the place had never seen the interior of this quaint old habitation Between Captain Vye and the Yeobrights there had never existed much acquaintance the former having come as a stranger and purchased the long empty house at Mistover Knap not long before the death of missus Yeobright s husband and with that event and the departure of her son such friendship as had grown up became quite broken off Is there no passage inside the door then asked Eustacia as they stood within the porch No said the lad who played the Saracen The door opens right upon the front sitting room where the spree s going on So that we cannot open the door without stopping the dance That s it Here we must bide till they have done for they always bolt the back door after dark They won t be much longer said Father Christmas This assertion however was hardly borne out by the event Again the instruments ended the tune again they recommenced with as much fire and pathos as if it were the first strain The air was now that one without any particular beginning middle or end which perhaps among all the dances which throng an inspired fiddler s fancy best conveys the idea of the interminable the celebrated Devil s Dream The fury of personal movement that was kindled by the fury of the notes could be approximately imagined by these outsiders under the moon from the occasional kicks of toes and heels against the door whenever the whirl round had been of more than customary velocity The first five minutes of listening was interesting enough to the mummers The five minutes extended to ten minutes and these to a quarter of an hour but no signs of ceasing were audible in the lively Dream The bumping against the door the laughter the stamping were all as vigorous as ever and the pleasure in being outside lessened considerably Why does missus Yeobright give parties of this sort Eustacia asked a little surprised to hear merriment so pronounced It is not one of her bettermost parlour parties She s asked the plain neighbours and workpeople without drawing any lines just to give em a good supper and such like Her son and she wait upon the folks I see said Eustacia Tis the last strain I think said Saint George with his ear to the panel A young man and woman have just swung into this corner and he s saying to her Ah the pity tis over for us this time my own Thank God said the Turkish Knight stamping and taking from the wall the conventional lance that each of the mummers carried Her boots being thinner than those of the young men the hoar had damped her feet and made them cold Upon my song tis another ten minutes for us said the Valiant Soldier looking through the keyhole as the tune modulated into another without stopping Grandfer Cantle is standing in this corner waiting his turn Twon t be long tis a six handed reel said the Doctor Why not go in dancing or no They sent for us said the Saracen Certainly not said Eustacia authoritatively as she paced smartly up and down from door to gate to warm herself We should burst into the middle of them and stop the dance and that would be unmannerly He thinks himself somebody because he has had a bit more schooling than we said the Doctor You may go to the deuce said Eustacia There was a whispered conversation between three or four of them and one turned to her Will you tell us one thing he said not without gentleness Be you Miss Vye We think you must be You may think what you like said Eustacia slowly But honourable lads will not tell tales upon a lady We ll say nothing miss That s upon our honour Thank you she replied At this moment the fiddles finished off with a screech and the serpent emitted a last note that nearly lifted the roof When from the comparative quiet within the mummers judged that the dancers had taken their seats Father Christmas advanced lifted the latch and put his head inside the door Ah the mummers the mummers cried several guests at once Clear a space for the mummers Humpbacked Father Christmas then made a complete entry swinging his huge club and in a general way clearing the stage for the actors proper while he informed the company in smart verse that he was come welcome or welcome not concluding his speech with Make room make room my gallant boys And give us space to rhyme We ve come to show Saint George s play Upon this Christmas time The guests were now arranging themselves at one end of the room the fiddler was mending a string the serpent player was emptying his mouthpiece and the play began First of those outside the Valiant Soldier entered in the interest of Saint George Here come I the Valiant Soldier Slasher is my name and so on This speech concluded with a challenge to the infidel at the end of which it was Eustacia s duty to enter as the Turkish Knight She with the rest who were not yet on had hitherto remained in the moonlight which streamed under the porch With no apparent effort or backwardness she came in beginning Here come I a Turkish Knight Who learnt in Turkish land to fight I ll fight this man with courage bold If his blood s hot I ll make it cold During her declamation Eustacia held her head erect and spoke as roughly as she could feeling pretty secure from observation But the concentration upon her part necessary to prevent discovery the newness of the scene the shine of the candles and the confusing effect upon her vision of the ribboned visor which hid her features left her absolutely unable to perceive who were present as spectators On the further side of a table bearing candles she could faintly discern faces and that was all Meanwhile Jim Starks as the Valiant Soldier had come forward and with a glare upon the Turk replied If then thou art that Turkish Knight Draw out thy sword and let us fight And fight they did the issue of the combat being that the Valiant Soldier was slain by a preternaturally inadequate thrust from Eustacia Jim in his ardour for genuine histrionic art coming down like a log upon the stone floor with force enough to dislocate his shoulder Then after more words from the Turkish Knight rather too faintly delivered and statements that he d fight Saint George and all his crew Saint George himself magnificently entered with the well known flourish Here come I Saint George the valiant man With naked sword and spear in hand Who fought the dragon and brought him to the slaughter And by this won fair Sabra the King of Egypt s daughter What mortal man would dare to stand Before me with my sword in hand This was the lad who had first recognized Eustacia and when she now as the Turk replied with suitable defiance and at once began the combat the young fellow took especial care to use his sword as gently as possible Being wounded the Knight fell upon one knee according to the direction The Doctor now entered restored the Knight by giving him a draught from the bottle which he carried and the fight was again resumed the Turk sinking by degrees until quite overcome dying as hard in this venerable drama as he is said to do at the present day This gradual sinking to the earth was in fact one reason why Eustacia had thought that the part of the Turkish Knight though not the shortest would suit her best A direct fall from upright to horizontal which was the end of the other fighting characters was not an elegant or decorous part for a girl But it was easy to die like a Turk by a dogged decline Eustacia was now among the number of the slain though not on the floor for she had managed to sink into a sloping position against the clock case so that her head was well elevated The play proceeded between Saint George the Saracen the Doctor and Father Christmas and Eustacia having no more to do for the first time found leisure to observe the scene round and to search for the form that had drawn her hither six The Two Stand Face to Face The room had been arranged with a view to the dancing the large oak table having been moved back till it stood as a breastwork to the fireplace At each end behind and in the chimney corner were grouped the guests many of them being warm faced and panting among whom Eustacia cursorily recognized some well to do persons from beyond the heath Thomasin as she had expected was not visible and Eustacia recollected that a light had shone from an upper window when they were outside the window probably of Thomasin s room A nose chin hands knees and toes projected from the seat within the chimney opening which members she found to unite in the person of Grandfer Cantle missus Yeobright s occasional assistant in the garden and therefore one of the invited The smoke went up from an Etna of peat in front of him played round the notches of the chimney crook struck against the salt box and got lost among the flitches Another part of the room soon riveted her gaze At the other side of the chimney stood the settle which is the necessary supplement to a fire so open that nothing less than a strong breeze will carry up the smoke It is to the hearths of old fashioned cavernous fireplaces what the east belt of trees is to the exposed country estate or the north wall to the garden Outside the settle candles gutter locks of hair wave young women shiver and old men sneeze Inside is Paradise Not a symptom of a draught disturbs the air the sitters backs are as warm as their faces and songs and old tales are drawn from the occupants by the comfortable heat like fruit from melon plants in a frame It was however not with those who sat in the settle that Eustacia was concerned A face showed itself with marked distinctness against the dark tanned wood of the upper part The owner who was leaning against the settle s outer end was Clement Yeobright or Clym as he was called here she knew it could be nobody else The spectacle constituted an area of two feet in Rembrandt s intensest manner A strange power in the lounger s appearance lay in the fact that though his whole figure was visible the observer s eye was only aware of his face To one of middle age the countenance was that of a young man though a youth might hardly have seen any necessity for the term of immaturity But it was really one of those faces which convey less the idea of so many years as its age than of so much experience as its store The number of their years may have adequately summed up Jared Mahalaleel and the rest of the antediluvians but the age of a modern man is to be measured by the intensity of his history The face was well shaped even excellently But the mind within was beginning to use it as a mere waste tablet whereon to trace its idiosyncrasies as they developed themselves The beauty here visible would in no long time be ruthlessly over run by its parasite thought which might just as well have fed upon a plainer exterior where there was nothing it could harm Had Heaven preserved Yeobright from a wearing habit of meditation people would have said A handsome man Had his brain unfolded under sharper contours they would have said A thoughtful man But an inner strenuousness was preying upon an outer symmetry and they rated his look as singular Hence people who began by beholding him ended by perusing him His countenance was overlaid with legible meanings Without being thought worn he yet had certain marks derived from a perception of his surroundings such as are not unfrequently found on men at the end of the four or five years of endeavour which follow the close of placid pupilage He already showed that thought is a disease of flesh and indirectly bore evidence that ideal physical beauty is incompatible with emotional development and a full recognition of the coil of things Mental luminousness must be fed with the oil of life even though there is already a physical need for it and the pitiful sight of two demands on one supply was just showing itself here When standing before certain men the philosopher regrets that thinkers are but perishable tissue the artist that perishable tissue has to think Thus to deplore each from his point of view the mutually destructive interdependence of spirit and flesh would have been instinctive with these in critically observing Yeobright As for his look it was a natural cheerfulness striving against depression from without and not quite succeeding The look suggested isolation but it revealed something more As is usual with bright natures the deity that lies ignominiously chained within an ephemeral human carcase shone out of him like a ray The effect upon Eustacia was palpable The extraordinary pitch of excitement that she had reached beforehand would indeed have caused her to be influenced by the most commonplace man She was troubled at Yeobright s presence The remainder of the play ended the Saracen s head was cut off and Saint George stood as victor Nobody commented any more than they would have commented on the fact of mushrooms coming in autumn or snowdrops in spring They took the piece as phlegmatically as did the actors themselves It was a phase of cheerfulness which was as a matter of course to be passed through every Christmas and there was no more to be said They sang the plaintive chant which follows the play during which all the dead men rise to their feet in a silent and awful manner like the ghosts of Napoleon s soldiers in the Midnight Review Afterwards the door opened and Fairway appeared on the threshold accompanied by Christian and another They had been waiting outside for the conclusion of the play as the players had waited for the conclusion of the dance Come in come in said missus Yeobright and Clym went forward to welcome them How is it you are so late Grandfer Cantle has been here ever so long and we thought you d have come with him as you live so near one another Well I should have come earlier mister Fairway said and paused to look along the beam of the ceiling for a nail to hang his hat on but finding his accustomed one to be occupied by the mistletoe and all the nails in the walls to be burdened with bunches of holly he at last relieved himself of the hat by ticklishly balancing it between the candle box and the head of the clock case I should have come earlier ma am he resumed with a more composed air but I know what parties be and how there s none too much room in folks houses at such times so I thought I wouldn t come till you d got settled a bit And I thought so too missus Yeobright said Christian earnestly but Father there was so eager that he had no manners at all and left home almost afore twas dark I told him twas barely decent in a old man to come so oversoon but words be wind Klk I wasn t going to bide waiting about till half the game was over I m as light as a kite when anything s going on crowed Grandfer Cantle from the chimneyseat Fairway had meanwhile concluded a critical gaze at Yeobright Now you may not believe it he said to the rest of the room but I should never have knowed this gentleman if I had met him anywhere off his own he th he s altered so much You too have altered and for the better I think Timothy said Yeobright surveying the firm figure of Fairway Master Yeobright look me over too I have altered for the better haven t I hey said Grandfer Cantle rising and placing himself something above half a foot from Clym s eye to induce the most searching criticism To be sure we will said Fairway taking the candle and moving it over the surface of the Grandfer s countenance the subject of his scrutiny irradiating himself with light and pleasant smiles and giving himself jerks of juvenility You haven t changed much said Yeobright If there s any difference Grandfer is younger appended Fairway decisively And yet not my own doing and I feel no pride in it said the pleased ancient But I can t be cured of my vagaries them I plead guilty to Yes Master Cantle always was that as we know But I am nothing by the side of you Mister Clym Nor any o us said Humphrey in a low rich tone of admiration not intended to reach anybody s ears Really there would have been nobody here who could have stood as decent second to him or even third if I hadn t been a soldier in the Bang up Locals as we was called for our smartness said Grandfer Cantle And even as tis we all look a little scammish beside him But in the year four twas said there wasn t a finer figure in the whole South Wessex than I as I looked when dashing past the shop winders with the rest of our company on the day we ran out o Budmouth because it was thoughted that Boney had landed round the point There was I straight as a young poplar wi my firelock and my bagnet and my spatterdashes and my stock sawing my jaws off and my accoutrements sheening like the seven stars Yes neighbours I was a pretty sight in my soldiering days You ought to have seen me in four Tis his mother s side where Master Clym s figure comes from bless ye said Timothy I know d her brothers well Longer coffins were never made in the whole country of South Wessex and tis said that poor George s knees were crumpled up a little e en as twas Coffins where inquired Christian drawing nearer Have the ghost of one appeared to anybody Master Fairway No no Don t let your mind so mislead your ears Christian and be a man said Timothy reproachfully I will said Christian But now I think o t my shadder last night seemed just the shape of a coffin What is it a sign of when your shade s like a coffin neighbours It can t be nothing to be afeared of I suppose Afeared no said the Grandfer Faith I was never afeard of nothing except Boney or I shouldn t ha been the soldier I was Yes tis a thousand pities you didn t see me in four By this time the mummers were preparing to leave but missus Yeobright stopped them by asking them to sit down and have a little supper To this invitation Father Christmas in the name of them all readily agreed Eustacia was happy in the opportunity of staying a little longer The cold and frosty night without was doubly frigid to her But the lingering was not without its difficulties missus Yeobright for want of room in the larger apartment placed a bench for the mummers halfway through the pantry door which opened from the sitting room Here they seated themselves in a row the door being left open thus they were still virtually in the same apartment missus Yeobright now murmured a few words to her son who crossed the room to the pantry door striking his head against the mistletoe as he passed and brought the mummers beef and bread cake pastry mead and elder wine the waiting being done by him and his mother that the little maid servant might sit as guest The mummers doffed their helmets and began to eat and drink But you will surely have some said Clym to the Turkish Knight as he stood before that warrior tray in hand She had refused and still sat covered only the sparkle of her eyes being visible between the ribbons which covered her face None thank you replied Eustacia He s quite a youngster said the Saracen apologetically and you must excuse him He s not one of the old set but have jined us because t other couldn t come But he will take something persisted Yeobright Try a glass of mead or elder wine Yes you had better try that said the Saracen It will keep the cold out going home along Though Eustacia could not eat without uncovering her face she could drink easily enough beneath her disguise The elder wine was accordingly accepted and the glass vanished inside the ribbons At moments during this performance Eustacia was half in doubt about the security of her position yet it had a fearful joy A series of attentions paid to her and yet not to her but to some imaginary person by the first man she had ever been inclined to adore complicated her emotions indescribably She had loved him partly because he was exceptional in this scene partly because she had determined to love him chiefly because she was in desperate need of loving somebody after wearying of Wildeve Believing that she must love him in spite of herself she had been influenced after the fashion of the second Lord Lyttleton and other persons who have dreamed that they were to die on a certain day and by stress of a morbid imagination have actually brought about that event Once let a maiden admit the possibility of her being stricken with love for someone at a certain hour and place and the thing is as good as done Did anything at this moment suggest to Yeobright the sex of the creature whom that fantastic guise inclosed how extended was her scope both in feeling and in making others feel and how far her compass transcended that of her companions in the band When the disguised Queen of Love appeared before Aeneas a preternatural perfume accompanied her presence and betrayed her quality If such a mysterious emanation ever was projected by the emotions of an earthly woman upon their object it must have signified Eustacia s presence to Yeobright now He looked at her wistfully then seemed to fall into a reverie as if he were forgetting what he observed The momentary situation ended he passed on and Eustacia sipped her wine without knowing what she drank The man for whom she had pre determined to nourish a passion went into the small room and across it to the further extremity The mummers as has been stated were seated on a bench one end of which extended into the small apartment or pantry for want of space in the outer room Eustacia partly from shyness had chosen the midmost seat which thus commanded a view of the interior of the pantry as well as the room containing the guests When Clym passed down the pantry her eyes followed him in the gloom which prevailed there At the remote end was a door which just as he was about to open it for himself was opened by somebody within and light streamed forth The person was Thomasin with a candle looking anxious pale and interesting Yeobright appeared glad to see her and pressed her hand That s right Tamsie he said heartily as though recalled to himself by the sight of her you have decided to come down I am glad of it Hush no no she said quickly I only came to speak to you But why not join us I cannot At least I would rather not I am not well enough and we shall have plenty of time together now you are going to be home a good long holiday It isn t nearly so pleasant without you Are you really ill Just a little my old cousin here she said playfully sweeping her hand across her heart Ah Mother should have asked somebody else to be present tonight perhaps O no indeed I merely stepped down Clym to ask you Here he followed her through the doorway into the private room beyond and the door closing Eustacia and the mummer who sat next to her the only other witness of the performance saw and heard no more The heat flew to Eustacia s head and cheeks She instantly guessed that Clym having been home only these two or three days had not as yet been made acquainted with Thomasin s painful situation with regard to Wildeve and seeing her living there just as she had been living before he left home he naturally suspected nothing Eustacia felt a wild jealousy of Thomasin on the instant Though Thomasin might possibly have tender sentiments towards another man as yet how long could they be expected to last when she was shut up here with this interesting and travelled cousin of hers There was no knowing what affection might not soon break out between the two so constantly in each other s society and not a distracting object near Clym s boyish love for her might have languished but it might easily be revived again Eustacia was nettled by her own contrivances What a sheer waste of herself to be dressed thus while another was shining to advantage Had she known the full effect of the encounter she would have moved heaven and earth to get here in a natural manner The power of her face all lost the charm of her emotions all disguised the fascinations of her coquetry denied existence nothing but a voice left to her she had a sense of the doom of Echo Nobody here respects me she said She had overlooked the fact that in coming as a boy among other boys she would be treated as a boy The slight though of her own causing and self explanatory she was unable to dismiss as unwittingly shown so sensitive had the situation made her Women have done much for themselves in histrionic dress To look far below those who like a certain fair personator of Polly Peachum early in the last century and another of Lydia Languish early in this one have won not only love but ducal coronets into the bargain whole shoals of them have reached to the initial satisfaction of getting love almost whence they would But the Turkish Knight was denied even the chance of achieving this by the fluttering ribbons which she dared not brush aside one Written in eighteen seventy seven Yeobright returned to the room without his cousin When within two or three feet of Eustacia he stopped as if again arrested by a thought He was gazing at her She looked another way disconcerted and wondered how long this purgatory was to last After lingering a few seconds he passed on again To court their own discomfiture by love is a common instinct with certain perfervid women Conflicting sensations of love fear and shame reduced Eustacia to a state of the utmost uneasiness To escape was her great and immediate desire The other mummers appeared to be in no hurry to leave and murmuring to the lad who sat next to her that she preferred waiting for them outside the house she moved to the door as imperceptibly as possible opened it and slipped out The calm lone scene reassured her She went forward to the palings and leant over them looking at the moon She had stood thus but a little time when the door again opened Expecting to see the remainder of the band Eustacia turned but no Clym Yeobright came out as softly as she had done and closed the door behind him He advanced and stood beside her I have an odd opinion he said and should like to ask you a question Are you a woman or am I wrong I am a woman His eyes lingered on her with great interest Do girls often play as mummers now They never used to They don t now Why did you To get excitement and shake off depression she said in low tones What depressed you Life That s a cause of depression a good many have to put up with Yes A long silence And do you find excitement asked Clym at last At this moment perhaps Then you are vexed at being discovered Yes though I thought I might be I would gladly have asked you to our party had I known you wished to come Have I ever been acquainted with you in my youth Never Won t you come in again and stay as long as you like No I wish not to be further recognized Well you are safe with me After remaining in thought a minute he added gently I will not intrude upon you longer It is a strange way of meeting and I will not ask why I find a cultivated woman playing such a part as this She did not volunteer the reason which he seemed to hope for and he wished her good night going thence round to the back of the house where he walked up and down by himself for some time before re entering Eustacia warmed with an inner fire could not wait for her companions after this She flung back the ribbons from her face opened the gate and at once struck into the heath She did not hasten along Her grandfather was in bed at this hour for she so frequently walked upon the hills on moonlight nights that he took no notice of her comings and goings and enjoying himself in his own way left her to do likewise A more important subject than that of getting indoors now engrossed her Yeobright if he had the least curiosity would infallibly discover her name What then She first felt a sort of exultation at the way in which the adventure had terminated even though at moments between her exultations she was abashed and blushful Then this consideration recurred to chill her What was the use of her exploit She was at present a total stranger to the Yeobright family The unreasonable nimbus of romance with which she had encircled that man might be her misery How could she allow herself to become so infatuated with a stranger And to fill the cup of her sorrow there would be Thomasin living day after day in inflammable proximity to him for she had just learnt that contrary to her first belief he was going to stay at home some considerable time She reached the wicket at Mistover Knap but before opening it she turned and faced the heath once more The form of Rainbarrow stood above the hills and the moon stood above Rainbarrow The air was charged with silence and frost The scene reminded Eustacia of a circumstance which till that moment she had totally forgotten She had promised to meet Wildeve by the Barrow this very night at eight to give a final answer to his pleading for an elopement She herself had fixed the evening and the hour He had probably come to the spot waited there in the cold and been greatly disappointed Well so much the better it did not hurt him she said serenely Wildeve had at present the rayless outline of the sun through smoked glass and she could say such things as that with the greatest facility She remained deeply pondering and Thomasin s winning manner towards her cousin arose again upon Eustacia s mind O that she had been married to Damon before this she said And she would if it hadn t been for me If I had only known if I had only known Eustacia once more lifted her deep stormy eyes to the moonlight and sighing that tragic sigh of hers which was so much like a shudder entered the shadow of the roof She threw off her trappings in the outhouse rolled them up and went indoors to her chamber seven A Coalition between Beauty and Oddness The old captain s prevailing indifference to his granddaughter s movements left her free as a bird to follow her own courses but it so happened that he did take upon himself the next morning to ask her why she had walked out so late Only in search of events Grandfather she said looking out of the window with that drowsy latency of manner which discovered so much force behind it whenever the trigger was pressed Search of events one would think you were one of the bucks I knew at one and twenty It is lonely here So much the better If I were living in a town my whole time would be taken up in looking after you I fully expected you would have been home when I returned from the Woman I won t conceal what I did I wanted an adventure and I went with the mummers I played the part of the Turkish Knight No never Ha ha Good gad I didn t expect it of you Eustacia It was my first performance and it certainly will be my last Now I have told you and remember it is a secret Of course But Eustacia you never did ha ha Dammy how twould have pleased me forty years ago But remember no more of it my girl You may walk on the heath night or day as you choose so that you don t bother me but no figuring in breeches again You need have no fear for me Grandpapa Here the conversation ceased Eustacia s moral training never exceeding in severity a dialogue of this sort which if it ever became profitable to good works would be a result not dear at the price But her thoughts soon strayed far from her own personality and full of a passionate and indescribable solicitude for one to whom she was not even a name she went forth into the amplitude of tanned wild around her restless as Ahasuerus the Jew She was about half a mile from her residence when she beheld a sinister redness arising from a ravine a little way in advance dull and lurid like a flame in sunlight and she guessed it to signify Diggory Venn When the farmers who had wished to buy in a new stock of reddle during the last month had inquired where Venn was to be found people replied On Egdon Heath Day after day the answer was the same Now since Egdon was populated with heath croppers and furze cutters rather than with sheep and shepherds and the downs where most of the latter were to be found lay some to the north some to the west of Egdon his reason for camping about there like Israel in Zin was not apparent The position was central and occasionally desirable But the sale of reddle was not Diggory s primary object in remaining on the heath particularly at so late a period of the year when most travellers of his class had gone into winter quarters Eustacia looked at the lonely man Wildeve had told her at their last meeting that Venn had been thrust forward by missus Yeobright as one ready and anxious to take his place as Thomasin s betrothed His figure was perfect his face young and well outlined his eye bright his intelligence keen and his position one which he could readily better if he chose But in spite of possibilities it was not likely that Thomasin would accept this Ishmaelitish creature while she had a cousin like Yeobright at her elbow and Wildeve at the same time not absolutely indifferent Eustacia was not long in guessing that poor missus Yeobright in her anxiety for her niece s future had mentioned this lover to stimulate the zeal of the other Eustacia was on the side of the Yeobrights now and entered into the spirit of the aunt s desire Good morning miss said the reddleman taking off his cap of hareskin and apparently bearing her no ill will from recollection of their last meeting Good morning reddleman she said hardly troubling to lift her heavily shaded eyes to his I did not know you were so near Is your van here too Venn moved his elbow towards a hollow in which a dense brake of purple stemmed brambles had grown to such vast dimensions as almost to form a dell Brambles though churlish when handled are kindly shelter in early winter being the latest of the deciduous bushes to lose their leaves The roof and chimney of Venn s caravan showed behind the tracery and tangles of the brake You remain near this part she asked with more interest Yes I have business here Not altogether the selling of reddle It has nothing to do with that It has to do with Miss Yeobright Her face seemed to ask for an armed peace and he therefore said frankly Yes miss it is on account of her On account of your approaching marriage with her Venn flushed through his stain Don t make sport of me Miss Vye he said It isn t true Certainly not She was thus convinced that the reddleman was a mere pis aller in missus Yeobright s mind one moreover who had not even been informed of his promotion to that lowly standing It was a mere notion of mine she said quietly and was about to pass by without further speech when looking round to the right she saw a painfully well known figure serpentining upwards by one of the little paths which led to the top where she stood Owing to the necessary windings of his course his back was at present towards them She glanced quickly round to escape that man there was only one way Turning to Venn she said Would you allow me to rest a few minutes in your van The banks are damp for sitting on Certainly miss I ll make a place for you She followed him behind the dell of brambles to his wheeled dwelling into which Venn mounted placing the three legged stool just within the door That is the best I can do for you he said stepping down and retiring to the path where he resumed the smoking of his pipe as he walked up and down Eustacia bounded into the vehicle and sat on the stool ensconced from view on the side towards the trackway Soon she heard the brushing of other feet than the reddleman s a not very friendly Good day uttered by two men in passing each other and then the dwindling of the foot fall of one of them in a direction onwards Eustacia stretched her neck forward till she caught a glimpse of a receding back and shoulders and she felt a wretched twinge of misery she knew not why It was the sickening feeling which if the changed heart has any generosity at all in its composition accompanies the sudden sight of a once loved one who is beloved no more When Eustacia descended to proceed on her way the reddleman came near That was mister Wildeve who passed miss he said slowly and expressed by his face that he expected her to feel vexed at having been sitting unseen Yes I saw him coming up the hill replied Eustacia Why should you tell me that It was a bold question considering the reddleman s knowledge of her past love but her undemonstrative manner had power to repress the opinions of those she treated as remote from her I am glad to hear that you can ask it said the reddleman bluntly And now I think of it it agrees with what I saw last night Ah what was that Eustacia wished to leave him but wished to know mister Wildeve stayed at Rainbarrow a long time waiting for a lady who didn t come You waited too it seems Yes I always do I was glad to see him disappointed He will be there again tonight To be again disappointed The truth is reddleman that that lady so far from wishing to stand in the way of Thomasin s marriage with mister Wildeve would be very glad to promote it Venn felt much astonishment at this avowal though he did not show it clearly that exhibition may greet remarks which are one remove from expectation but it is usually withheld in complicated cases of two removes and upwards Indeed miss he replied How do you know that mister Wildeve will come to Rainbarrow again tonight she asked I heard him say to himself that he would He s in a regular temper Eustacia looked for a moment what she felt and she murmured lifting her deep dark eyes anxiously to his I wish I knew what to do I don t want to be uncivil to him but I don t wish to see him again and I have some few little things to return to him If you choose to send em by me miss and a note to tell him that you wish to say no more to him I ll take it for you quite privately That would be the most straightforward way of letting him know your mind Very well said Eustacia Come towards my house and I will bring it out to you She went on and as the path was an infinitely small parting in the shaggy locks of the heath the reddleman followed exactly in her trail She saw from a distance that the captain was on the bank sweeping the horizon with his telescope and bidding Venn to wait where he stood she entered the house alone In ten minutes she returned with a parcel and a note and said in placing them in his hand Why are you so ready to take these for me Can you ask that I suppose you think to serve Thomasin in some way by it Are you as anxious as ever to help on her marriage Venn was a little moved I would sooner have married her myself he said in a low voice But what I feel is that if she cannot be happy without him I will do my duty in helping her to get him as a man ought Eustacia looked curiously at the singular man who spoke thus What a strange sort of love to be entirely free from that quality of selfishness which is frequently the chief constituent of the passion and sometimes its only one The reddleman s disinterestedness was so well deserving of respect that it overshot respect by being barely comprehended and she almost thought it absurd Then we are both of one mind at last she said Yes replied Venn gloomily But if you would tell me miss why you take such an interest in her I should be easier It is so sudden and strange Eustacia appeared at a loss I cannot tell you that reddleman she said coldly Venn said no more He pocketed the letter and bowing to Eustacia went away Rainbarrow had again become blended with night when Wildeve ascended the long acclivity at its base On his reaching the top a shape grew up from the earth immediately behind him It was that of Eustacia s emissary He slapped Wildeve on the shoulder The feverish young inn keeper and ex engineer started like Satan at the touch of Ithuriel s spear The meeting is always at eight o clock at this place said Venn and here we are we three We three said Wildeve looking quickly round Yes you and I and she This is she He held up the letter and parcel Wildeve took them wonderingly I don t quite see what this means he said How do you come here There must be some mistake It will be cleared from your mind when you have read the letter Lanterns for one The reddleman struck a light kindled an inch of tallow candle which he had brought and sheltered it with his cap Who are you said Wildeve discerning by the candle light an obscure rubicundity of person in his companion You are the reddleman I saw on the hill this morning why you are the man who Please read the letter If you had come from the other one I shouldn t have been surprised murmured Wildeve as he opened the letter and read His face grew serious TO mister WILDEVE After some thought I have decided once and for all that we must hold no further communication The more I consider the matter the more I am convinced that there must be an end to our acquaintance Had you been uniformly faithful to me throughout these two years you might now have some ground for accusing me of heartlessness but if you calmly consider what I bore during the period of your desertion and how I passively put up with your courtship of another without once interfering you will I think own that I have a right to consult my own feelings when you come back to me again That these are not what they were towards you may perhaps be a fault in me but it is one which you can scarcely reproach me for when you remember how you left me for Thomasin The little articles you gave me in the early part of our friendship are returned by the bearer of this letter They should rightly have been sent back when I first heard of your engagement to her EUSTACIA By the time that Wildeve reached her name the blankness with which he had read the first half of the letter intensified to mortification I am made a great fool of one way and another he said pettishly Do you know what is in this letter The reddleman hummed a tune Can t you answer me asked Wildeve warmly Ru um tum tum sang the reddleman Wildeve stood looking on the ground beside Venn s feet till he allowed his eyes to travel upwards over Diggory s form as illuminated by the candle to his head and face Ha ha Well I suppose I deserve it considering how I have played with them both he said at last as much to himself as to Venn But of all the odd things that ever I knew the oddest is that you should so run counter to your own interests as to bring this to me My interests Certainly Twas your interest not to do anything which would send me courting Thomasin again now she has accepted you or something like it missus Yeobright says you are to marry her Tisn t true then Good Lord I heard of this before but didn t believe it When did she say so Wildeve began humming as the reddleman had done I don t believe it now cried Venn Ru um tum tum sang Wildeve O Lord how we can imitate said Venn contemptuously I ll have this out I ll go straight to her Diggory withdrew with an emphatic step Wildeve s eye passing over his form in withering derision as if he were no more than a heath cropper When the reddleman s figure could no longer be seen Wildeve himself descended and plunged into the rayless hollow of the vale To lose the two women he who had been the well beloved of both was too ironical an issue to be endured He could only decently save himself by Thomasin and once he became her husband Eustacia s repentance he thought would set in for a long and bitter term It was no wonder that Wildeve ignorant of the new man at the back of the scene should have supposed Eustacia to be playing a part To believe that the letter was not the result of some momentary pique to infer that she really gave him up to Thomasin would have required previous knowledge of her transfiguration by that man s influence Who was to know that she had grown generous in the greediness of a new passion that in coveting one cousin she was dealing liberally with another that in her eagerness to appropriate she gave way Full of this resolve to marry in haste and wring the heart of the proud girl Wildeve went his way Meanwhile Diggory Venn had returned to his van where he stood looking thoughtfully into the stove A new vista was opened up to him But however promising missus Yeobright s views of him might be as a candidate for her niece s hand one condition was indispensable to the favour of Thomasin herself and that was a renunciation of his present wild mode of life In this he saw little difficulty He could not afford to wait till the next day before seeing Thomasin and detailing his plan He speedily plunged himself into toilet operations pulled a suit of cloth clothes from a box and in about twenty minutes stood before the van lantern as a reddleman in nothing but his face the vermilion shades of which were not to be removed in a day Closing the door and fastening it with a padlock Venn set off towards Blooms End He had reached the white palings and laid his hand upon the gate when the door of the house opened and quickly closed again A female form had glided in At the same time a man who had seemingly been standing with the woman in the porch came forward from the house till he was face to face with Venn It was Wildeve again Man alive you ve been quick at it said Diggory sarcastically And you slow as you will find said Wildeve And lowering his voice you may as well go back again now I ve claimed her and got her Good night reddleman Thereupon Wildeve walked away Venn s heart sank within him though it had not risen unduly high He stood leaning over the palings in an indecisive mood for nearly a quarter of an hour Then he went up the garden path knocked and asked for missus Yeobright Instead of requesting him to enter she came to the porch A discourse was carried on between them in low measured tones for the space of ten minutes or more At the end of the time missus Yeobright went in and Venn sadly retraced his steps into the heath When he had again regained his van he lit the lantern and with an apathetic face at once began to pull off his best clothes till in the course of a few minutes he reappeared as the confirmed and irretrievable reddleman that he had seemed before eight Firmness Is Discovered in a Gentle Heart On that evening the interior of Blooms End though cosy and comfortable had been rather silent Clym Yeobright was not at home Since the Christmas party he had gone on a few days visit to a friend about ten miles off The shadowy form seen by Venn to part from Wildeve in the porch and quickly withdraw into the house was Thomasin s On entering she threw down a cloak which had been carelessly wrapped round her and came forward to the light where missus Yeobright sat at her work table drawn up within the settle so that part of it projected into the chimney corner I don t like your going out after dark alone Tamsin said her aunt quietly without looking up from her work I have only been just outside the door Well inquired missus Yeobright struck by a change in the tone of Thomasin s voice and observing her Thomasin s cheek was flushed to a pitch far beyond that which it had reached before her troubles and her eyes glittered It was HE who knocked she said I thought as much He wishes the marriage to be at once Indeed What is he anxious missus Yeobright directed a searching look upon her niece Why did not mister Wildeve come in He did not wish to You are not friends with him he says He would like the wedding to be the day after tomorrow quite privately at the church of his parish not at ours Oh And what did you say I agreed to it Thomasin answered firmly I am a practical woman now I don t believe in hearts at all I would marry him under any circumstances since since Clym s letter A letter was lying on missus Yeobright s work basket and at Thomasin s words her aunt reopened it and silently read for the tenth time that day What is the meaning of this silly story that people are circulating about Thomasin and mister Wildeve I should call such a scandal humiliating if there was the least chance of its being true How could such a gross falsehood have arisen It is said that one should go abroad to hear news of home and I appear to have done it Of course I contradict the tale everywhere but it is very vexing and I wonder how it could have originated It is too ridiculous that such a girl as Thomasin could so mortify us as to get jilted on the wedding day What has she done Yes missus Yeobright said sadly putting down the letter If you think you can marry him do so And since mister Wildeve wishes it to be unceremonious let it be that too I can do nothing It is all in your own hands now My power over your welfare came to an end when you left this house to go with him to Anglebury She continued half in bitterness I may almost ask why do you consult me in the matter at all If you had gone and married him without saying a word to me I could hardly have been angry simply because poor girl you can t do a better thing Don t say that and dishearten me You are right I will not I do not plead for him Aunt Human nature is weak and I am not a blind woman to insist that he is perfect I did think so but I don t now But I know my course and you know that I know it I hope for the best And so do I and we will both continue to said missus Yeobright rising and kissing her Then the wedding if it comes off will be on the morning of the very day Clym comes home Yes I decided that it ought to be over before he came After that you can look him in the face and so can I Our concealments will matter nothing missus Yeobright moved her head in thoughtful assent and presently said Do you wish me to give you away I am willing to undertake that you know if you wish as I was last time After once forbidding the banns I think I can do no less I don t think I will ask you to come said Thomasin reluctantly but with decision It would be unpleasant I am almost sure Better let there be only strangers present and none of my relations at all I would rather have it so I do not wish to do anything which may touch your credit and I feel that I should be uncomfortable if you were there after what has passed I am only your niece and there is no necessity why you should concern yourself more about me Well he has beaten us her aunt said It really seems as if he had been playing with you in this way in revenge for my humbling him as I did by standing up against him at first O no Aunt murmured Thomasin They said no more on the subject then Diggory Venn s knock came soon after and missus Yeobright on returning from her interview with him in the porch carelessly observed Another lover has come to ask for you No Yes that queer young man Venn Asks to pay his addresses to me Yes and I told him he was too late Thomasin looked silently into the candle flame Poor Diggory she said and then aroused herself to other things The next day was passed in mere mechanical deeds of preparation both the women being anxious to immerse themselves in these to escape the emotional aspect of the situation Some wearing apparel and other articles were collected anew for Thomasin and remarks on domestic details were frequently made so as to obscure any inner misgivings about her future as Wildeve s wife The appointed morning came The arrangement with Wildeve was that he should meet her at the church to guard against any unpleasant curiosity which might have affected them had they been seen walking off together in the usual country way Aunt and niece stood together in the bedroom where the bride was dressing The sun where it could catch it made a mirror of Thomasin s hair which she always wore braided It was braided according to a calendar system the more important the day the more numerous the strands in the braid On ordinary working days she braided it in threes on ordinary Sundays in fours at Maypolings gipsyings and the like she braided it in fives Years ago she had said that when she married she would braid it in sevens She had braided it in sevens today I have been thinking that I will wear my blue silk after all she said It is my wedding day even though there may be something sad about the time I mean she added anxious to correct any wrong impression not sad in itself but in its having had great disappointment and trouble before it missus Yeobright breathed in a way which might have been called a sigh I almost wish Clym had been at home she said Of course you chose the time because of his absence Partly I have felt that I acted unfairly to him in not telling him all but as it was done not to grieve him I thought I would carry out the plan to its end and tell the whole story when the sky was clear You are a practical little woman said missus Yeobright smiling I wish you and he no I don t wish anything There it is nine o clock she interrupted hearing a whizz and a dinging downstairs I told Damon I would leave at nine said Thomasin hastening out of the room Her aunt followed When Thomasin was going up the little walk from the door to the wicket gate missus Yeobright looked reluctantly at her and said It is a shame to let you go alone It is necessary said Thomasin At any rate added her aunt with forced cheerfulness I shall call upon you this afternoon and bring the cake with me If Clym has returned by that time he will perhaps come too I wish to show mister Wildeve that I bear him no ill will Let the past be forgotten Well God bless you There I don t believe in old superstitions but I ll do it She threw a slipper at the retreating figure of the girl who turned smiled and went on again A few steps further and she looked back Did you call me Aunt she tremulously inquired Good bye Moved by an uncontrollable feeling as she looked upon missus Yeobright s worn wet face she ran back when her aunt came forward and they met again O Tamsie said the elder weeping I don t like to let you go I I am Thomasin began giving way likewise But quelling her grief she said Good bye again and went on Then missus Yeobright saw a little figure wending its way between the scratching furze bushes and diminishing far up the valley a pale blue spot in a vast field of neutral brown solitary and undefended except by the power of her own hope But the worst feature in the case was one which did not appear in the landscape it was the man The hour chosen for the ceremony by Thomasin and Wildeve had been so timed as to enable her to escape the awkwardness of meeting her cousin Clym who was returning the same morning To own to the partial truth of what he had heard would be distressing as long as the humiliating position resulting from the event was unimproved It was only after a second and successful journey to the altar that she could lift up her head and prove the failure of the first attempt a pure accident She had not been gone from Blooms End more than half an hour when Yeobright came by the meads from the other direction and entered the house I had an early breakfast he said to his mother after greeting her Now I could eat a little more They sat down to the repeated meal and he went on in a low anxious voice apparently imagining that Thomasin had not yet come downstairs What s this I have heard about Thomasin and mister Wildeve It is true in many points said missus Yeobright quietly but it is all right now I hope She looked at the clock True Thomasin is gone to him today Clym pushed away his breakfast Then there is a scandal of some sort and that s what s the matter with Thomasin Was it this that made her ill Yes Not a scandal a misfortune I will tell you all about it Clym You must not be angry but you must listen and you ll find that what we have done has been done for the best She then told him the circumstances All that he had known of the affair before he returned from Paris was that there had existed an attachment between Thomasin and Wildeve which his mother had at first discountenanced but had since owing to the arguments of Thomasin looked upon in a little more favourable light When she therefore proceeded to explain all he was greatly surprised and troubled And she determined that the wedding should be over before you came back said missus Yeobright that there might be no chance of her meeting you and having a very painful time of it That s why she has gone to him they have arranged to be married this morning But I can t understand it said Yeobright rising Tis so unlike her I can see why you did not write to me after her unfortunate return home But why didn t you let me know when the wedding was going to be the first time Well I felt vexed with her just then She seemed to me to be obstinate and when I found that you were nothing in her mind I vowed that she should be nothing in yours I felt that she was only my niece after all I told her she might marry but that I should take no interest in it and should not bother you about it either It wouldn t have been bothering me Mother you did wrong I thought it might disturb you in your business and that you might throw up your situation or injure your prospects in some way because of it so I said nothing Of course if they had married at that time in a proper manner I should have told you at once Tamsin actually being married while we are sitting here Yes Unless some accident happens again as it did the first time It may considering he s the same man Yes and I believe it will Was it right to let her go Suppose Wildeve is really a bad fellow Then he won t come and she ll come home again You should have looked more into it It is useless to say that his mother answered with an impatient look of sorrow You don t know how bad it has been here with us all these weeks Clym You don t know what a mortification anything of that sort is to a woman You don t know the sleepless nights we ve had in this house and the almost bitter words that have passed between us since that Fifth of November I hope never to pass seven such weeks again Tamsin has not gone outside the door and I have been ashamed to look anybody in the face and now you blame me for letting her do the only thing that can be done to set that trouble straight No he said slowly Upon the whole I don t blame you But just consider how sudden it seems to me Here was I knowing nothing and then I am told all at once that Tamsie is gone to be married Well I suppose there was nothing better to do Do you know Mother he continued after a moment or two looking suddenly interested in his own past history I once thought of Tamsin as a sweetheart Yes I did How odd boys are And when I came home and saw her this time she seemed so much more affectionate than usual that I was quite reminded of those days particularly on the night of the party when she was unwell We had the party just the same was not that rather cruel to her It made no difference I had arranged to give one and it was not worth while to make more gloom than necessary To begin by shutting ourselves up and telling you of Tamsin s misfortunes would have been a poor sort of welcome Clym remained thinking I almost wish you had not had that party he said and for other reasons But I will tell you in a day or two We must think of Tamsin now They lapsed into silence I ll tell you what said Yeobright again in a tone which showed some slumbering feeling still I don t think it kind to Tamsin to let her be married like this and neither of us there to keep up her spirits or care a bit about her She hasn t disgraced herself or done anything to deserve that It is bad enough that the wedding should be so hurried and unceremonious without our keeping away from it in addition Upon my soul tis almost a shame I ll go It is over by this time said his mother with a sigh unless they were late or he Then I shall be soon enough to see them come out I don t quite like your keeping me in ignorance Mother after all Really I half hope he has failed to meet her And ruined her character Nonsense that wouldn t ruin Thomasin He took up his hat and hastily left the house missus Yeobright looked rather unhappy and sat still deep in thought But she was not long left alone A few minutes later Clym came back again and in his company came Diggory Venn I find there isn t time for me to get there said Clym Is she married missus Yeobright inquired turning to the reddleman a face in which a strange strife of wishes for and against was apparent Venn bowed She is ma am How strange it sounds murmured Clym And he didn t disappoint her this time said missus Yeobright He did not And there is now no slight on her name I was hastening ath art to tell you at once as I saw you were not there How came you to be there How did you know it she asked I have been in that neighbourhood for some time and I saw them go in said the reddleman Wildeve came up to the door punctual as the clock I didn t expect it of him He did not add as he might have added that how he came to be in that neighbourhood was not by accident that since Wildeve s resumption of his right to Thomasin Venn with the thoroughness which was part of his character had determined to see the end of the episode Who was there said missus Yeobright Nobody hardly I stood right out of the way and she did not see me The reddleman spoke huskily and looked into the garden Who gave her away Miss Vye How very remarkable Miss Vye It is to be considered an honour I suppose Who s Miss Vye said Clym Captain Vye s granddaughter of Mistover Knap A proud girl from Budmouth said missus Yeobright One not much to my liking People say she s a witch but of course that s absurd The reddleman kept to himself his acquaintance with that fair personage and also that Eustacia was there because he went to fetch her in accordance with a promise he had given as soon as he learnt that the marriage was to take place He merely said in continuation of the story I was sitting on the churchyard wall when they came up one from one way the other from the other and Miss Vye was walking thereabouts looking at the headstones As soon as they had gone in I went to the door feeling I should like to see it as I knew her so well I pulled off my boots because they were so noisy and went up into the gallery I saw then that the parson and clerk were already there How came Miss Vye to have anything to do with it if she was only on a walk that way Because there was nobody else She had gone into the church just before me not into the gallery The parson looked round before beginning and as she was the only one near he beckoned to her and she went up to the rails After that when it came to signing the book she pushed up her veil and signed and Tamsin seemed to thank her for her kindness The reddleman told the tale thoughtfully for there lingered upon his vision the changing colour of Wildeve when Eustacia lifted the thick veil which had concealed her from recognition and looked calmly into his face And then said Diggory sadly I came away for her history as Tamsin Yeobright was over I offered to go said missus Yeobright regretfully But she said it was not necessary Well it is no matter said the reddleman The thing is done at last as it was meant to be at first and God send her happiness Now I ll wish you good morning He placed his cap on his head and went out From that instant of leaving missus Yeobright s door the reddleman was seen no more in or about Egdon Heath for a space of many months He vanished entirely The nook among the brambles where his van had been standing was as vacant as ever the next morning and scarcely a sign remained to show that he had been there excepting a few straws and a little redness on the turf which was washed away by the next storm of rain The report that Diggory had brought of the wedding correct as far as it went was deficient in one significant particular which had escaped him through his being at some distance back in the church When Thomasin was tremblingly engaged in signing her name Wildeve had flung towards Eustacia a glance that said plainly I have punished you now She had replied in a low tone and he little thought how truly You mistake it gives me sincerest pleasure to see her your wife today BOOK THREE THE FASCINATION one My Mind to Me a Kingdom Is In Clym Yeobright s face could be dimly seen the typical countenance of the future Should there be a classic period to art hereafter its Pheidias may produce such faces The view of life as a thing to be put up with replacing that zest for existence which was so intense in early civilizations must ultimately enter so thoroughly into the constitution of the advanced races that its facial expression will become accepted as a new artistic departure People already feel that a man who lives without disturbing a curve of feature or setting a mark of mental concern anywhere upon himself is too far removed from modern perceptiveness to be a modern type Physically beautiful men the glory of the race when it was young are almost an anachronism now and we may wonder whether at some time or other physically beautiful women may not be an anachronism likewise The truth seems to be that a long line of disillusive centuries has permanently displaced the Hellenic idea of life or whatever it may be called What the Greeks only suspected we know well what their Aeschylus imagined our nursery children feel That old fashioned revelling in the general situation grows less and less possible as we uncover the defects of natural laws and see the quandary that man is in by their operation The lineaments which will get embodied in ideals based upon this new recognition will probably be akin to those of Yeobright The observer s eye was arrested not by his face as a picture but by his face as a page not by what it was but by what it recorded His features were attractive in the light of symbols as sounds intrinsically common become attractive in language and as shapes intrinsically simple become interesting in writing He had been a lad of whom something was expected Beyond this all had been chaos That he would be successful in an original way or that he would go to the dogs in an original way seemed equally probable The only absolute certainty about him was that he would not stand still in the circumstances amid which he was born Hence when his name was casually mentioned by neighbouring yeomen the listener said Ah Clym Yeobright what is he doing now When the instinctive question about a person is What is he doing it is felt that he will be found to be like most of us doing nothing in particular There is an indefinite sense that he must be invading some region of singularity good or bad The devout hope is that he is doing well The secret faith is that he is making a mess of it Half a dozen comfortable market men who were habitual callers at the Quiet Woman as they passed by in their carts were partial to the topic In fact though they were not Egdon men they could hardly avoid it while they sucked their long clay tubes and regarded the heath through the window Clym had been so inwoven with the heath in his boyhood that hardly anybody could look upon it without thinking of him So the subject recurred if he were making a fortune and a name so much the better for him if he were making a tragical figure in the world so much the better for a narrative The fact was that Yeobright s fame had spread to an awkward extent before he left home It is bad when your fame outruns your means said the Spanish Jesuit Gracian At the age of six he had asked a Scripture riddle Who was the first man known to wear breeches and applause had resounded from the very verge of the heath At seven he painted the Battle of Waterloo with tiger lily pollen and black currant juice in the absence of water colours By the time he reached twelve he had in this manner been heard of as artist and scholar for at least two miles round An individual whose fame spreads three or four thousand yards in the time taken by the fame of others similarly situated to travel six or eight hundred must of necessity have something in him Possibly Clym s fame like Homer s owed something to the accidents of his situation nevertheless famous he was He grew up and was helped out in life That waggery of fate which started Clive as a writing clerk Gay as a linen draper Keats as a surgeon and a thousand others in a thousand other odd ways banished the wild and ascetic heath lad to a trade whose sole concern was with the especial symbols of self indulgence and vainglory The details of this choice of a business for him it is not necessary to give At the death of his father a neighbouring gentleman had kindly undertaken to give the boy a start and this assumed the form of sending him to Budmouth Yeobright did not wish to go there but it was the only feasible opening Thence he went to London and thence shortly after to Paris where he had remained till now Something being expected of him he had not been at home many days before a great curiosity as to why he stayed on so long began to arise in the heath The natural term of a holiday had passed yet he still remained On the Sunday morning following the week of Thomasin s marriage a discussion on this subject was in progress at a hair cutting before Fairway s house Here the local barbering was always done at this hour on this day to be followed by the great Sunday wash of the inhabitants at noon which in its turn was followed by the great Sunday dressing an hour later On Egdon Heath Sunday proper did not begin till dinner time and even then it was a somewhat battered specimen of the day These Sunday morning hair cuttings were performed by Fairway the victim sitting on a chopping block in front of the house without a coat and the neighbours gossiping around idly observing the locks of hair as they rose upon the wind after the snip and flew away out of sight to the four quarters of the heavens Summer and winter the scene was the same unless the wind were more than usually blusterous when the stool was shifted a few feet round the corner To complain of cold in sitting out of doors hatless and coatless while Fairway told true stories between the cuts of the scissors would have been to pronounce yourself no man at once To flinch exclaim or move a muscle of the face at the small stabs under the ear received from those instruments or at scarifications of the neck by the comb would have been thought a gross breach of good manners considering that Fairway did it all for nothing A bleeding about the poll on Sunday afternoons was amply accounted for by the explanation I have had my hair cut you know The conversation on Yeobright had been started by a distant view of the young man rambling leisurely across the heath before them A man who is doing well elsewhere wouldn t bide here two or three weeks for nothing said Fairway He s got some project in s head depend upon that Well a can t keep a diment shop here said Sam I don t see why he should have had them two heavy boxes home if he had not been going to bide and what there is for him to do here the Lord in heaven knows Before many more surmises could be indulged in Yeobright had come near and seeing the hair cutting group he turned aside to join them Marching up and looking critically at their faces for a moment he said without introduction Now folks let me guess what you have been talking about Ay sure if you will said Sam About me Now it is a thing I shouldn t have dreamed of doing otherwise said Fairway in a tone of integrity but since you have named it Master Yeobright I ll own that we was talking about ee We were wondering what could keep you home here mollyhorning about when you have made such a world wide name for yourself in the nick nack trade now that s the truth o t I ll tell you said Yeobright with unexpected earnestness I am not sorry to have the opportunity I ve come home because all things considered I can be a trifle less useless here than anywhere else But I have only lately found this out When I first got away from home I thought this place was not worth troubling about I thought our life here was contemptible To oil your boots instead of blacking them to dust your coat with a switch instead of a brush was there ever anything more ridiculous I said So tis so tis No no you are wrong it isn t Beg your pardon we thought that was your maning Well as my views changed my course became very depressing I found that I was trying to be like people who had hardly anything in common with myself I was endeavouring to put off one sort of life for another sort of life which was not better than the life I had known before It was simply different True a sight different said Fairway Yes Paris must be a taking place said Humphrey Grand shop winders trumpets and drums and here be we out of doors in all winds and weathers But you mistake me pleaded Clym All this was very depressing But not so depressing as something I next perceived that my business was the idlest vainest most effeminate business that ever a man could be put to That decided me I would give it up and try to follow some rational occupation among the people I knew best and to whom I could be of most use I have come home and this is how I mean to carry out my plan I shall keep a school as near to Egdon as possible so as to be able to walk over here and have a night school in my mother s house But I must study a little at first to get properly qualified Now neighbours I must go And Clym resumed his walk across the heath He ll never carry it out in the world said Fairway In a few weeks he ll learn to see things otherwise Tis good hearted of the young man said another But for my part I think he had better mind his business two The New Course Causes Disappointment Yeobright loved his kind He had a conviction that the want of most men was knowledge of a sort which brings wisdom rather than affluence He wished to raise the class at the expense of individuals rather than individuals at the expense of the class What was more he was ready at once to be the first unit sacrificed In passing from the bucolic to the intellectual life the intermediate stages are usually two at least frequently many more and one of those stages is almost sure to be worldly advanced We can hardly imagine bucolic placidity quickening to intellectual aims without imagining social aims as the transitional phase Yeobright s local peculiarity was that in striving at high thinking he still cleaved to plain living nay wild and meagre living in many respects and brotherliness with clowns He was a John the Baptist who took ennoblement rather than repentance for his text Mentally he was in a provincial future that is he was in many points abreast with the central town thinkers of his date Much of this development he may have owed to his studious life in Paris where he had become acquainted with ethical systems popular at the time In consequence of this relatively advanced position Yeobright might have been called unfortunate The rural world was not ripe for him A man should be only partially before his time to be completely to the vanward in aspirations is fatal to fame Had Philip s warlike son been intellectually so far ahead as to have attempted civilization without bloodshed he would have been twice the godlike hero that he seemed but nobody would have heard of an Alexander In the interests of renown the forwardness should lie chiefly in the capacity to handle things Successful propagandists have succeeded because the doctrine they bring into form is that which their listeners have for some time felt without being able to shape A man who advocates aesthetic effort and deprecates social effort is only likely to be understood by a class to which social effort has become a stale matter To argue upon the possibility of culture before luxury to the bucolic world may be to argue truly but it is an attempt to disturb a sequence to which humanity has been long accustomed Yeobright preaching to the Egdon eremites that they might rise to a serene comprehensiveness without going through the process of enriching themselves was not unlike arguing to ancient Chaldeans that in ascending from earth to the pure empyrean it was not necessary to pass first into the intervening heaven of ether Was Yeobright s mind well proportioned No A well proportioned mind is one which shows no particular bias one of which we may safely say that it will never cause its owner to be confined as a madman tortured as a heretic or crucified as a blasphemer Also on the other hand that it will never cause him to be applauded as a prophet revered as a priest or exalted as a king Its usual blessings are happiness and mediocrity It produces the poetry of Rogers the paintings of West the statecraft of North the spiritual guidance of Tomline enabling its possessors to find their way to wealth to wind up well to step with dignity off the stage to die comfortably in their beds and to get the decent monument which in many cases they deserve It never would have allowed Yeobright to do such a ridiculous thing as throw up his business to benefit his fellow creatures He walked along towards home without attending to paths If anyone knew the heath well it was Clym He was permeated with its scenes with its substance and with its odours He might be said to be its product His eyes had first opened thereon with its appearance all the first images of his memory were mingled his estimate of life had been coloured by it his toys had been the flint knives and arrow heads which he found there wondering why stones should grow to such odd shapes his flowers the purple bells and yellow furze his animal kingdom the snakes and croppers his society its human haunters Take all the varying hates felt by Eustacia Vye towards the heath and translate them into loves and you have the heart of Clym He gazed upon the wide prospect as he walked and was glad To many persons this Egdon was a place which had slipped out of its century generations ago to intrude as an uncouth object into this It was an obsolete thing and few cared to study it How could this be otherwise in the days of square fields plashed hedges and meadows watered on a plan so rectangular that on a fine day they looked like silver gridirons The farmer in his ride who could smile at artificial grasses look with solicitude at the coming corn and sigh with sadness at the fly eaten turnips bestowed upon the distant upland of heath nothing better than a frown But as for Yeobright when he looked from the heights on his way he could not help indulging in a barbarous satisfaction at observing that in some of the attempts at reclamation from the waste tillage after holding on for a year or two had receded again in despair the ferns and furze tufts stubbornly reasserting themselves He descended into the valley and soon reached his home at Blooms End His mother was snipping dead leaves from the window plants She looked up at him as if she did not understand the meaning of his long stay with her her face had worn that look for several days He could perceive that the curiosity which had been shown by the hair cutting group amounted in his mother to concern But she had asked no question with her lips even when the arrival of his trunk suggested that he was not going to leave her soon Her silence besought an explanation of him more loudly than words I am not going back to Paris again Mother he said At least in my old capacity I have given up the business missus Yeobright turned in pained surprise I thought something was amiss because of the boxes I wonder you did not tell me sooner I ought to have done it But I have been in doubt whether you would be pleased with my plan I was not quite clear on a few points myself I am going to take an entirely new course I am astonished Clym How can you want to do better than you ve been doing Very easily But I shall not do better in the way you mean I suppose it will be called doing worse But I hate that business of mine and I want to do some worthy thing before I die As a schoolmaster I think to do it a school master to the poor and ignorant to teach them what nobody else will After all the trouble that has been taken to give you a start and when there is nothing to do but to keep straight on towards affluence you say you will be a poor man s schoolmaster Your fancies will be your ruin Clym missus Yeobright spoke calmly but the force of feeling behind the words was but too apparent to one who knew her as well as her son did He did not answer There was in his face that hopelessness of being understood which comes when the objector is constitutionally beyond the reach of a logic that even under favouring conditions is almost too coarse a vehicle for the subtlety of the argument No more was said on the subject till the end of dinner His mother then began as if there had been no interval since the morning It disturbs me Clym to find that you have come home with such thoughts as those I hadn t the least idea that you meant to go backward in the world by your own free choice Of course I have always supposed you were going to push straight on as other men do all who deserve the name when they have been put in a good way of doing well I cannot help it said Clym in a troubled tone Mother I hate the flashy business Talk about men who deserve the name can any man deserving the name waste his time in that effeminate way when he sees half the world going to ruin for want of somebody to buckle to and teach them how to breast the misery they are born to I get up every morning and see the whole creation groaning and travailing in pain as saint Paul says and yet there am I trafficking in glittering splendours with wealthy women and titled libertines and pandering to the meanest vanities I who have health and strength enough for anything I have been troubled in my mind about it all the year and the end is that I cannot do it any more Why can t you do it as well as others I don t know except that there are many things other people care for which I don t and that s partly why I think I ought to do this For one thing my body does not require much of me I cannot enjoy delicacies good things are wasted upon me Well I ought to turn that defect to advantage and by being able to do without what other people require I can spend what such things cost upon anybody else Now Yeobright having inherited some of these very instincts from the woman before him could not fail to awaken a reciprocity in her through her feelings if not by arguments disguise it as she might for his good She spoke with less assurance And yet you might have been a wealthy man if you had only persevered Manager to that large diamond establishment what better can a man wish for What a post of trust and respect I suppose you will be like your father like him you are getting weary of doing well No said her son I am not weary of that though I am weary of what you mean by it Mother what is doing well missus Yeobright was far too thoughtful a woman to be content with ready definitions and like the What is wisdom of Plato s Socrates and the What is truth of Pontius Pilate Yeobright s burning question received no answer The silence was broken by the clash of the garden gate a tap at the door and its opening Christian Cantle appeared in the room in his Sunday clothes It was the custom on Egdon to begin the preface to a story before absolutely entering the house so as to be well in for the body of the narrative by the time visitor and visited stood face to face Christian had been saying to them while the door was leaving its latch To think that I who go from home but once in a while and hardly then should have been there this morning Tis news you have brought us then Christian said missus Yeobright Ay sure about a witch and ye must overlook my time o day for says I I must go and tell em though they won t have half done dinner I assure ye it made me shake like a driven leaf Do ye think any harm will come o t Well what This morning at church we was all standing up and the pa son said Let us pray Well thinks I one may as well kneel as stand so down I went and more than that all the rest were as willing to oblige the man as I We hadn t been hard at it for more than a minute when a most terrible screech sounded through church as if somebody had just gied up their heart s blood All the folk jumped up and then we found that Susan Nunsuch had pricked Miss Vye with a long stocking needle as she had threatened to do as soon as ever she could get the young lady to church where she don t come very often She ve waited for this chance for weeks so as to draw her blood and put an end to the bewitching of Susan s children that has been carried on so long Sue followed her into church sat next to her and as soon as she could find a chance in went the stocking needle into my lady s arm Good heaven how horrid said missus Yeobright Sue pricked her that deep that the maid fainted away and as I was afeard there might be some tumult among us I got behind the bass viol and didn t see no more But they carried her out into the air tis said but when they looked round for Sue she was gone What a scream that girl gied poor thing There were the pa son in his surplice holding up his hand and saying Sit down my good people sit down But the deuce a bit would they sit down O and what d ye think I found out missus Yeobright The pa son wears a suit of clothes under his surplice I could see his black sleeves when he held up his arm Tis a cruel thing said Yeobright Yes said his mother The nation ought to look into it said Christian Here s Humphrey coming I think In came Humphrey Well have ye heard the news But I see you have Tis a very strange thing that whenever one of Egdon folk goes to church some rum job or other is sure to be doing The last time one of us was there was when neighbour Fairway went in the fall and that was the day you forbad the banns missus Yeobright Has this cruelly treated girl been able to walk home said Clym They say she got better and went home very well And now I ve told it I must be moving homeward myself And I said Humphrey Truly now we shall see if there s anything in what folks say about her When they were gone into the heath again Yeobright said quietly to his mother Do you think I have turned teacher too soon It is right that there should be schoolmasters and missionaries and all such men she replied But it is right too that I should try to lift you out of this life into something richer and that you should not come back again and be as if I had not tried at all Later in the day Sam the turf cutter entered I ve come a borrowing missus Yeobright I suppose you have heard what s been happening to the beauty on the hill Yes Sam half a dozen have been telling us Beauty said Clym Yes tolerably well favoured Sam replied Lord all the country owns that tis one of the strangest things in the world that such a woman should have come to live up there Dark or fair Now though I ve seen her twenty times that s a thing I cannot call to mind Darker than Tamsin murmured missus Yeobright A woman who seems to care for nothing at all as you may say She is melancholy then inquired Clym She mopes about by herself and don t mix in with the people Is she a young lady inclined for adventures Not to my knowledge Doesn t join in with the lads in their games to get some sort of excitement in this lonely place No Mumming for instance No Her notions be different I should rather say her thoughts were far away from here with lords and ladies she ll never know and mansions she ll never see again Observing that Clym appeared singularly interested missus Yeobright said rather uneasily to Sam You see more in her than most of us do Miss Vye is to my mind too idle to be charming I have never heard that she is of any use to herself or to other people Good girls don t get treated as witches even on Egdon Nonsense that proves nothing either way said Yeobright Well of course I don t understand such niceties said Sam withdrawing from a possibly unpleasant argument and what she is we must wait for time to tell us The business that I have really called about is this to borrow the longest and strongest rope you have The captain s bucket has dropped into the well and they are in want of water and as all the chaps are at home today we think we can get it out for him We have three cart ropes already but they won t reach to the bottom missus Yeobright told him that he might have whatever ropes he could find in the outhouse and Sam went out to search When he passed by the door Clym joined him and accompanied him to the gate Is this young witch lady going to stay long at Mistover he asked I should say so What a cruel shame to ill use her She must have suffered greatly more in mind than in body Twas a graceless trick such a handsome girl too You ought to see her mister Yeobright being a young man come from far and with a little more to show for your years than most of us Do you think she would like to teach children said Clym Sam shook his head Quite a different sort of body from that I reckon O it was merely something which occurred to me It would of course be necessary to see her and talk it over not an easy thing by the way for my family and hers are not very friendly I ll tell you how you mid see her mister Yeobright said Sam We are going to grapple for the bucket at six o clock tonight at her house and you could lend a hand There s five or six coming but the well is deep and another might be useful if you don t mind appearing in that shape She s sure to be walking round I ll think of it said Yeobright and they parted He thought of it a good deal but nothing more was said about Eustacia inside the house at that time Whether this romantic martyr to superstition and the melancholy mummer he had conversed with under the full moon were one and the same person remained as yet a problem three The First Act in a Timeworn Drama The afternoon was fine and Yeobright walked on the heath for an hour with his mother When they reached the lofty ridge which divided the valley of Blooms End from the adjoining valley they stood still and looked round The Quiet Woman Inn was visible on the low margin of the heath in one direction and afar on the other hand rose Mistover Knap You mean to call on Thomasin he inquired Yes But you need not come this time said his mother In that case I ll branch off here Mother I am going to Mistover missus Yeobright turned to him inquiringly I am going to help them get the bucket out of the captain s well he continued As it is so very deep I may be useful And I should like to see this Miss Vye not so much for her good looks as for another reason Must you go his mother asked I thought to And they parted There is no help for it murmured Clym s mother gloomily as he withdrew They are sure to see each other I wish Sam would carry his news to other houses than mine Clym s retreating figure got smaller and smaller as it rose and fell over the hillocks on his way He is tender hearted said missus Yeobright to herself while she watched him otherwise it would matter little How he s going on He was indeed walking with a will over the furze as straight as a line as if his life depended upon it His mother drew a long breath and abandoning the visit to Thomasin turned back The evening films began to make nebulous pictures of the valleys but the high lands still were raked by the declining rays of the winter sun which glanced on Clym as he walked forward eyed by every rabbit and field fare around a long shadow advancing in front of him On drawing near to the furze covered bank and ditch which fortified the captain s dwelling he could hear voices within signifying that operations had been already begun At the side entrance gate he stopped and looked over Half a dozen able bodied men were standing in a line from the well mouth holding a rope which passed over the well roller into the depths below Fairway with a piece of smaller rope round his body made fast to one of the standards to guard against accidents was leaning over the opening his right hand clasping the vertical rope that descended into the well Now silence folks said Fairway The talking ceased and Fairway gave a circular motion to the rope as if he were stirring batter At the end of a minute a dull splashing reverberated from the bottom of the well the helical twist he had imparted to the rope had reached the grapnel below Haul said Fairway and the men who held the rope began to gather it over the wheel I think we ve got sommat said one of the haulers in Then pull steady said Fairway They gathered up more and more till a regular dripping into the well could be heard below It grew smarter with the increasing height of the bucket and presently a hundred and fifty feet of rope had been pulled in Fairway then lit a lantern tied it to another cord and began lowering it into the well beside the first Clym came forward and looked down Strange humid leaves which knew nothing of the seasons of the year and quaint natured mosses were revealed on the wellside as the lantern descended till its rays fell upon a confused mass of rope and bucket dangling in the dank dark air We ve only got en by the edge of the hoop steady for God s sake said Fairway They pulled with the greatest gentleness till the wet bucket appeared about two yards below them like a dead friend come to earth again Three or four hands were stretched out then jerk went the rope whizz went the wheel the two foremost haulers fell backward the beating of a falling body was heard receding down the sides of the well and a thunderous uproar arose at the bottom The bucket was gone again Damn the bucket said Fairway Lower again said Sam I m as stiff as a ram s horn stooping so long said Fairway standing up and stretching himself till his joints creaked Rest a few minutes Timothy said Yeobright I ll take your place The grapnel was again lowered Its smart impact upon the distant water reached their ears like a kiss whereupon Yeobright knelt down and leaning over the well began dragging the grapnel round and round as Fairway had done Tie a rope round him it is dangerous cried a soft and anxious voice somewhere above them Everybody turned The speaker was a woman gazing down upon the group from an upper window whose panes blazed in the ruddy glare from the west Her lips were parted and she appeared for the moment to forget where she was The rope was accordingly tied round his waist and the work proceeded At the next haul the weight was not heavy and it was discovered that they had only secured a coil of the rope detached from the bucket The tangled mass was thrown into the background Humphrey took Yeobright s place and the grapnel was lowered again Yeobright retired to the heap of recovered rope in a meditative mood Of the identity between the lady s voice and that of the melancholy mummer he had not a moment s doubt How thoughtful of her he said to himself Eustacia who had reddened when she perceived the effect of her exclamation upon the group below was no longer to be seen at the window though Yeobright scanned it wistfully While he stood there the men at the well succeeded in getting up the bucket without a mishap One of them went to inquire for the captain to learn what orders he wished to give for mending the well tackle The captain proved to be away from home and Eustacia appeared at the door and came out She had lapsed into an easy and dignified calm far removed from the intensity of life in her words of solicitude for Clym s safety Will it be possible to draw water here tonight she inquired No miss the bottom of the bucket is clean knocked out And as we can do no more now we ll leave off and come again tomorrow morning No water she murmured turning away I can send you up some from Blooms End said Clym coming forward and raising his hat as the men retired Yeobright and Eustacia looked at each other for one instant as if each had in mind those few moments during which a certain moonlight scene was common to both With the glance the calm fixity of her features sublimed itself to an expression of refinement and warmth it was like garish noon rising to the dignity of sunset in a couple of seconds Thank you it will hardly be necessary she replied But if you have no water Well it is what I call no water she said blushing and lifting her long lashed eyelids as if to lift them were a work requiring consideration But my grandfather calls it water enough I ll show you what I mean She moved away a few yards and Clym followed When she reached the corner of the enclosure where the steps were formed for mounting the boundary bank she sprang up with a lightness which seemed strange after her listless movement towards the well It incidentally showed that her apparent languor did not arise from lack of force Clym ascended behind her and noticed a circular burnt patch at the top of the bank Ashes he said Yes said Eustacia We had a little bonfire here last Fifth of November and those are the marks of it On that spot had stood the fire she had kindled to attract Wildeve That s the only kind of water we have she continued tossing a stone into the pool which lay on the outside of the bank like the white of an eye without its pupil The stone fell with a flounce but no Wildeve appeared on the other side as on a previous occasion there My grandfather says he lived for more than twenty years at sea on water twice as bad as that she went on and considers it quite good enough for us here on an emergency Well as a matter of fact there are no impurities in the water of these pools at this time of the year It has only just rained into them She shook her head I am managing to exist in a wilderness but I cannot drink from a pond she said Clym looked towards the well which was now deserted the men having gone home It is a long way to send for spring water he said after a silence But since you don t like this in the pond I ll try to get you some myself He went back to the well Yes I think I could do it by tying on this pail But since I would not trouble the men to get it I cannot in conscience let you I don t mind the trouble at all He made fast the pail to the long coil of rope put it over the wheel and allowed it to descend by letting the rope slip through his hands Before it had gone far however he checked it I must make fast the end first or we may lose the whole he said to Eustacia who had drawn near Could you hold this a moment while I do it or shall I call your servant I can hold it said Eustacia and he placed the rope in her hands going then to search for the end I suppose I may let it slip down she inquired I would advise you not to let it go far said Clym It will get much heavier you will find However Eustacia had begun to pay out While he was tying she cried I cannot stop it Clym ran to her side and found he could only check the rope by twisting the loose part round the upright post when it stopped with a jerk Has it hurt you Yes she replied Very much No I think not She opened her hands One of them was bleeding the rope had dragged off the skin Eustacia wrapped it in her handkerchief You should have let go said Yeobright Why didn t you You said I was to hold on This is the second time I have been wounded today Ah yes I have heard of it I blush for my native Egdon Was it a serious injury you received in church Miss Vye There was such an abundance of sympathy in Clym s tone that Eustacia slowly drew up her sleeve and disclosed her round white arm A bright red spot appeared on its smooth surface like a ruby on Parian marble There it is she said putting her finger against the spot It was dastardly of the woman said Clym Will not Captain Vye get her punished He is gone from home on that very business I did not know that I had such a magic reputation And you fainted said Clym looking at the scarlet little puncture as if he would like to kiss it and make it well Yes it frightened me I had not been to church for a long time And now I shall not go again for ever so long perhaps never I cannot face their eyes after this Don t you think it dreadfully humiliating I wished I was dead for hours after but I don t mind now I have come to clean away these cobwebs said Yeobright Would you like to help me by high class teaching We might benefit them much I don t quite feel anxious to I have not much love for my fellow creatures Sometimes I quite hate them Still I think that if you were to hear my scheme you might take an interest in it There is no use in hating people if you hate anything you should hate what produced them Do you mean Nature I hate her already But I shall be glad to hear your scheme at any time The situation had now worked itself out and the next natural thing was for them to part Clym knew this well enough and Eustacia made a move of conclusion yet he looked at her as if he had one word more to say Perhaps if he had not lived in Paris it would never have been uttered We have met before he said regarding her with rather more interest than was necessary I do not own it said Eustacia with a repressed still look But I may think what I like Yes You are lonely here I cannot endure the heath except in its purple season The heath is a cruel taskmaster to me Can you say so he asked To my mind it is most exhilarating and strengthening and soothing I would rather live on these hills than anywhere else in the world It is well enough for artists but I never would learn to draw And there is a very curious druidical stone just out there He threw a pebble in the direction signified Do you often go to see it I was not even aware there existed any such curious druidical stone I am aware that there are boulevards in Paris Yeobright looked thoughtfully on the ground That means much he said It does indeed said Eustacia I remember when I had the same longing for town bustle Five years of a great city would be a perfect cure for that Heaven send me such a cure Now mister Yeobright I will go indoors and plaster my wounded hand They separated and Eustacia vanished in the increasing shade She seemed full of many things Her past was a blank her life had begun The effect upon Clym of this meeting he did not fully discover till some time after During his walk home his most intelligible sensation was that his scheme had somehow become glorified A beautiful woman had been intertwined with it On reaching the house he went up to the room which was to be made his study and occupied himself during the evening in unpacking his books from the boxes and arranging them on shelves From another box he drew a lamp and a can of oil He trimmed the lamp arranged his table and said Now I am ready to begin He rose early the next morning read two hours before breakfast by the light of his lamp read all the morning all the afternoon Just when the sun was going down his eyes felt weary and he leant back in his chair His room overlooked the front of the premises and the valley of the heath beyond The lowest beams of the winter sun threw the shadow of the house over the palings across the grass margin of the heath and far up the vale where the chimney outlines and those of the surrounding tree tops stretched forth in long dark prongs Having been seated at work all day he decided to take a turn upon the hills before it got dark and going out forthwith he struck across the heath towards Mistover It was an hour and a half later when he again appeared at the garden gate The shutters of the house were closed and Christian Cantle who had been wheeling manure about the garden all day had gone home On entering he found that his mother after waiting a long time for him had finished her meal Where have you been Clym she immediately said Why didn t you tell me that you were going away at this time I have been on the heath You ll meet Eustacia Vye if you go up there Clym paused a minute Yes I met her this evening he said as though it were spoken under the sheer necessity of preserving honesty I wondered if you had It was no appointment No such meetings never are But you are not angry Mother I can hardly say that I am not Angry No But when I consider the usual nature of the drag which causes men of promise to disappoint the world I feel uneasy You deserve credit for the feeling Mother But I can assure you that you need not be disturbed by it on my account When I think of you and your new crotchets said missus Yeobright with some emphasis I naturally don t feel so comfortable as I did a twelvemonth ago It is incredible to me that a man accustomed to the attractive women of Paris and elsewhere should be so easily worked upon by a girl in a heath You could just as well have walked another way I had been studying all day Well yes she added more hopefully I have been thinking that you might get on as a schoolmaster and rise that way since you really are determined to hate the course you were pursuing Yeobright was unwilling to disturb this idea though his scheme was far enough removed from one wherein the education of youth should be made a mere channel of social ascent He had no desires of that sort He had reached the stage in a young man s life when the grimness of the general human situation first becomes clear and the realization of this causes ambition to halt awhile In France it is not uncustomary to commit suicide at this stage in England we do much better or much worse as the case may be The love between the young man and his mother was strangely invisible now Of love it may be said the less earthly the less demonstrative In its absolutely indestructible form it reaches a profundity in which all exhibition of itself is painful It was so with these Had conversations between them been overheard people would have said How cold they are to each other His theory and his wishes about devoting his future to teaching had made an impression on missus Yeobright Indeed how could it be otherwise when he was a part of her when their discourses were as if carried on between the right and the left hands of the same body He had despaired of reaching her by argument and it was almost as a discovery to him that he could reach her by a magnetism which was as superior to words as words are to yells Strangely enough he began to feel now that it would not be so hard to persuade her who was his best friend that comparative poverty was essentially the higher course for him as to reconcile to his feelings the act of persuading her From every provident point of view his mother was so undoubtedly right that he was not without a sickness of heart in finding he could shake her She had a singular insight into life considering that she had never mixed with it There are instances of persons who without clear ideas of the things they criticize have yet had clear ideas of the relations of those things Blacklock a poet blind from his birth could describe visual objects with accuracy Professor Sanderson who was also blind gave excellent lectures on colour and taught others the theory of ideas which they had and he had not In the social sphere these gifted ones are mostly women they can watch a world which they never saw and estimate forces of which they have only heard We call it intuition What was the great world to missus Yeobright A multitude whose tendencies could be perceived though not its essences Communities were seen by her as from a distance she saw them as we see the throngs which cover the canvases of Sallaert Van Alsloot and others of that school vast masses of beings jostling zigzagging and processioning in definite directions but whose features are indistinguishable by the very comprehensiveness of the view One could see that as far as it had gone her life was very complete on its reflective side The philosophy of her nature and its limitation by circumstances was almost written in her movements They had a majestic foundation though they were far from being majestic and they had a ground work of assurance but they were not assured As her once elastic walk had become deadened by time so had her natural pride of life been hindered in its blooming by her necessities The next slight touch in the shaping of Clym s destiny occurred a few days after A barrow was opened on the heath and Yeobright attended the operation remaining away from his study during several hours In the afternoon Christian returned from a journey in the same direction and missus Yeobright questioned him They have dug a hole and they have found things like flowerpots upside down Mis ess Yeobright and inside these be real charnel bones They have carried em off to men s houses but I shouldn t like to sleep where they will bide Dead folks have been known to come and claim their own mister Yeobright had got one pot of the bones and was going to bring em home real skellington bones but twas ordered otherwise You ll be relieved to hear that he gave away his pot and all on second thoughts and a blessed thing for ye Mis ess Yeobright considering the wind o nights Gave it away Yes To Miss Vye She has a cannibal taste for such churchyard furniture seemingly Miss Vye was there too Ay a b lieve she was When Clym came home which was shortly after his mother said in a curious tone The urn you had meant for me you gave away Yeobright made no reply the current of her feeling was too pronounced to admit it The early weeks of the year passed on Yeobright certainly studied at home but he also walked much abroad and the direction of his walk was always towards some point of a line between Mistover and Rainbarrow The month of March arrived and the heath showed its first signs of awakening from winter trance The awakening was almost feline in its stealthiness The pool outside the bank by Eustacia s dwelling which seemed as dead and desolate as ever to an observer who moved and made noises in his observation would gradually disclose a state of great animation when silently watched awhile A timid animal world had come to life for the season Little tadpoles and efts began to bubble up through the water and to race along beneath it toads made noises like very young ducks and advanced to the margin in twos and threes overhead bumblebees flew hither and thither in the thickening light their drone coming and going like the sound of a gong On an evening such as this Yeobright descended into the Blooms End valley from beside that very pool where he had been standing with another person quite silently and quite long enough to hear all this puny stir of resurrection in nature yet he had not heard it His walk was rapid as he came down and he went with a springy trend Before entering upon his mother s premises he stopped and breathed The light which shone forth on him from the window revealed that his face was flushed and his eye bright What it did not show was something which lingered upon his lips like a seal set there The abiding presence of this impress was so real that he hardly dared to enter the house for it seemed as if his mother might say What red spot is that glowing upon your mouth so vividly But he entered soon after The tea was ready and he sat down opposite his mother She did not speak many words and as for him something had been just done and some words had been just said on the hill which prevented him from beginning a desultory chat His mother s taciturnity was not without ominousness but he appeared not to care He knew why she said so little but he could not remove the cause of her bearing towards him These half silent sittings were far from uncommon with them now At last Yeobright made a beginning of what was intended to strike at the whole root of the matter Five days have we sat like this at meals with scarcely a word What s the use of it Mother None said she in a heart swollen tone But there is only too good a reason Not when you know all I have been wanting to speak about this and I am glad the subject is begun The reason of course is Eustacia Vye Well I confess I have seen her lately and have seen her a good many times Yes yes and I know what that amounts to It troubles me Clym You are wasting your life here and it is solely on account of her If it had not been for that woman you would never have entertained this teaching scheme at all Clym looked hard at his mother You know that is not it he said Well I know you had decided to attempt it before you saw her but that would have ended in intentions It was very well to talk of but ridiculous to put in practice I fully expected that in the course of a month or two you would have seen the folly of such self sacrifice and would have been by this time back again to Paris in some business or other I can understand objections to the diamond trade I really was thinking that it might be inadequate to the life of a man like you even though it might have made you a millionaire But now I see how mistaken you are about this girl I doubt if you could be correct about other things How am I mistaken in her She is lazy and dissatisfied But that is not all of it Supposing her to be as good a woman as any you can find which she certainly is not why do you wish to connect yourself with anybody at present Well there are practical reasons Clym began and then almost broke off under an overpowering sense of the weight of argument which could be brought against his statement If I take a school an educated woman would be invaluable as a help to me What you really mean to marry her It would be premature to state that plainly But consider what obvious advantages there would be in doing it She Don t suppose she has any money She hasn t a farthing She is excellently educated and would make a good matron in a boarding school I candidly own that I have modified my views a little in deference to you and it should satisfy you I no longer adhere to my intention of giving with my own mouth rudimentary education to the lowest class I can do better I can establish a good private school for farmers sons and without stopping the school I can manage to pass examinations By this means and by the assistance of a wife like her Oh Clym I shall ultimately I hope be at the head of one of the best schools in the county Yeobright had enunciated the word her with a fervour which in conversation with a mother was absurdly indiscreet Hardly a maternal heart within the four seas could in such circumstances have helped being irritated at that ill timed betrayal of feeling for a new woman You are blinded Clym she said warmly It was a bad day for you when you first set eyes on her And your scheme is merely a castle in the air built on purpose to justify this folly which has seized you and to salve your conscience on the irrational situation you are in Mother that s not true he firmly answered Can you maintain that I sit and tell untruths when all I wish to do is to save you from sorrow For shame Clym But it is all through that woman a hussy Clym reddened like fire and rose He placed his hand upon his mother s shoulder and said in a tone which hung strangely between entreaty and command I won t hear it I may be led to answer you in a way which we shall both regret His mother parted her lips to begin some other vehement truth but on looking at him she saw that in his face which led her to leave the words unsaid Yeobright walked once or twice across the room and then suddenly went out of the house It was eleven o clock when he came in though he had not been further than the precincts of the garden His mother was gone to bed A light was left burning on the table and supper was spread Without stopping for any food he secured the doors and went upstairs four An Hour of Bliss and Many Hours of Sadness The next day was gloomy enough at Blooms End Yeobright remained in his study sitting over the open books but the work of those hours was miserably scant Determined that there should be nothing in his conduct towards his mother resembling sullenness he had occasionally spoken to her on passing matters and would take no notice of the brevity of her replies With the same resolve to keep up a show of conversation he said about seven o clock in the evening There s an eclipse of the moon tonight I am going out to see it And putting on his overcoat he left her The low moon was not as yet visible from the front of the house and Yeobright climbed out of the valley until he stood in the full flood of her light But even now he walked on and his steps were in the direction of Rainbarrow In half an hour he stood at the top The sky was clear from verge to verge and the moon flung her rays over the whole heath but without sensibly lighting it except where paths and water courses had laid bare the white flints and glistening quartz sand which made streaks upon the general shade After standing awhile he stooped and felt the heather It was dry and he flung himself down upon the barrow his face towards the moon which depicted a small image of herself in each of his eyes He had often come up here without stating his purpose to his mother but this was the first time that he had been ostensibly frank as to his purpose while really concealing it It was a moral situation which three months earlier he could hardly have credited of himself In returning to labour in this sequestered spot he had anticipated an escape from the chafing of social necessities yet behold they were here also More than ever he longed to be in some world where personal ambition was not the only recognized form of progress such perhaps as might have been the case at some time or other in the silvery globe then shining upon him His eye travelled over the length and breadth of that distant country over the Bay of Rainbows the sombre Sea of Crises the Ocean of Storms the Lake of Dreams the vast Walled Plains and the wondrous Ring Mountains till he almost felt himself to be voyaging bodily through its wild scenes standing on its hollow hills traversing its deserts descending its vales and old sea bottoms or mounting to the edges of its craters While he watched the far removed landscape a tawny stain grew into being on the lower verge the eclipse had begun This marked a preconcerted moment for the remote celestial phenomenon had been pressed into sublunary service as a lover s signal Yeobright s mind flew back to earth at the sight he arose shook himself and listened Minute after minute passed by perhaps ten minutes passed and the shadow on the moon perceptibly widened He heard a rustling on his left hand a cloaked figure with an upturned face appeared at the base of the Barrow and Clym descended In a moment the figure was in his arms and his lips upon hers My Eustacia Clym dearest Such a situation had less than three months brought forth They remained long without a single utterance for no language could reach the level of their condition words were as the rusty implements of a by gone barbarous epoch and only to be occasionally tolerated I began to wonder why you did not come said Yeobright when she had withdrawn a little from his embrace You said ten minutes after the first mark of shade on the edge of the moon and that s what it is now Well let us only think that here we are Then holding each other s hand they were again silent and the shadow on the moon s disc grew a little larger Has it seemed long since you last saw me she asked It has seemed sad And not long That s because you occupy yourself and so blind yourself to my absence To me who can do nothing it has been like living under stagnant water I would rather bear tediousness dear than have time made short by such means as have shortened mine In what way is that You have been thinking you wished you did not love me How can a man wish that and yet love on No Eustacia Men can women cannot Well whatever I may have thought one thing is certain I do love you past all compass and description I love you to oppressiveness I who have never before felt more than a pleasant passing fancy for any woman I have ever seen Let me look right into your moonlit face and dwell on every line and curve in it Only a few hairbreadths make the difference between this face and faces I have seen many times before I knew you yet what a difference the difference between everything and nothing at all One touch on that mouth again there and there and there Your eyes seem heavy Eustacia No it is my general way of looking I think it arises from my feeling sometimes an agonizing pity for myself that I ever was born You don t feel it now No Yet I know that we shall not love like this always Nothing can ensure the continuance of love It will evaporate like a spirit and so I feel full of fears You need not Ah you don t know You have seen more than I and have been into cities and among people that I have only heard of and have lived more years than I but yet I am older at this than you I loved another man once and now I love you In God s mercy don t talk so Eustacia But I do not think I shall be the one who wearies first It will I fear end in this way your mother will find out that you meet me and she will influence you against me That can never be She knows of these meetings already And she speaks against me I will not say There go away Obey her I shall ruin you It is foolish of you to meet me like this Kiss me and go away forever Forever do you hear forever Not I It is your only chance Many a man s love has been a curse to him You are desperate full of fancies and wilful and you misunderstand I have an additional reason for seeing you tonight besides love of you For though unlike you I feel our affection may be eternal I feel with you in this that our present mode of existence cannot last Oh tis your mother Yes that s it I knew it Never mind what it is Believe this I cannot let myself lose you I must have you always with me This very evening I do not like to let you go There is only one cure for this anxiety dearest you must be my wife She started then endeavoured to say calmly Cynics say that cures the anxiety by curing the love But you must answer me Shall I claim you some day I don t mean at once I must think Eustacia murmured At present speak of Paris to me Is there any place like it on earth It is very beautiful But will you be mine I will be nobody else s in the world does that satisfy you Yes for the present Now tell me of the Tuileries and the Louvre she continued evasively I hate talking of Paris Well I remember one sunny room in the Louvre which would make a fitting place for you to live in the Galerie d Apollon Its windows are mainly east and in the early morning when the sun is bright the whole apartment is in a perfect blaze of splendour The rays bristle and dart from the encrustations of gilding to the magnificent inlaid coffers from the coffers to the gold and silver plate from the plate to the jewels and precious stones from these to the enamels till there is a perfect network of light which quite dazzles the eye But now about our marriage And Versailles the King s Gallery is some such gorgeous room is it not Yes But what s the use of talking of gorgeous rooms By the way the Little Trianon would suit us beautifully to live in and you might walk in the gardens in the moonlight and think you were in some English shrubbery It is laid out in English fashion I should hate to think that Then you could keep to the lawn in front of the Grand Palace All about there you would doubtless feel in a world of historical romance He went on since it was all new to her and described Fontainebleau saint Cloud the Bois and many other familiar haunts of the Parisians till she said When used you to go to these places On Sundays Ah yes I dislike English Sundays How I should chime in with their manners over there Dear Clym you ll go back again Clym shook his head and looked at the eclipse If you ll go back again I ll be something she said tenderly putting her head near his breast If you ll agree I ll give my promise without making you wait a minute longer How extraordinary that you and my mother should be of one mind about this said Yeobright I have vowed not to go back Eustacia It is not the place I dislike it is the occupation But you can go in some other capacity No Besides it would interfere with my scheme Don t press that Eustacia Will you marry me I cannot tell Now never mind Paris it is no better than other spots Promise sweet You will never adhere to your education plan I am quite sure and then it will be all right for me and so I promise to be yours for ever and ever Clym brought her face towards his by a gentle pressure of the hand and kissed her Ah but you don t know what you have got in me she said Sometimes I think there is not that in Eustacia Vye which will make a good homespun wife Well let it go see how our time is slipping slipping slipping She pointed towards the half eclipsed moon You are too mournful No Only I dread to think of anything beyond the present What is we know We are together now and it is unknown how long we shall be so the unknown always fills my mind with terrible possibilities even when I may reasonably expect it to be cheerful Clym the eclipsed moonlight shines upon your face with a strange foreign colour and shows its shape as if it were cut out in gold That means that you should be doing better things than this You are ambitious Eustacia no not exactly ambitious luxurious I ought to be of the same vein to make you happy I suppose And yet far from that I could live and die in a hermitage here with proper work to do There was that in his tone which implied distrust of his position as a solicitous lover a doubt if he were acting fairly towards one whose tastes touched his own only at rare and infrequent points She saw his meaning and whispered in a low full accent of eager assurance Don t mistake me Clym though I should like Paris I love you for yourself alone To be your wife and live in Paris would be heaven to me but I would rather live with you in a hermitage here than not be yours at all It is gain to me either way and very great gain There s my too candid confession Spoken like a woman And now I must soon leave you I ll walk with you towards your house But must you go home yet she asked Yes the sand has nearly slipped away I see and the eclipse is creeping on more and more Don t go yet Stop till the hour has run itself out then I will not press you any more You will go home and sleep well I keep sighing in my sleep Do you ever dream of me I cannot recollect a clear dream of you I see your face in every scene of my dreams and hear your voice in every sound I wish I did not It is too much what I feel They say such love never lasts But it must And yet once I remember I saw an officer of the Hussars ride down the street at Budmouth and though he was a total stranger and never spoke to me I loved him till I thought I should really die of love but I didn t die and at last I left off caring for him How terrible it would be if a time should come when I could not love you my Clym Please don t say such reckless things When we see such a time at hand we will say I have outlived my faith and purpose and die There the hour has expired now let us walk on Hand in hand they went along the path towards Mistover When they were near the house he said It is too late for me to see your grandfather tonight Do you think he will object to it I will speak to him I am so accustomed to be my own mistress that it did not occur to me that we should have to ask him Then they lingeringly separated and Clym descended towards Blooms End And as he walked further and further from the charmed atmosphere of his Olympian girl his face grew sad with a new sort of sadness A perception of the dilemma in which his love had placed him came back in full force In spite of Eustacia s apparent willingness to wait through the period of an unpromising engagement till he should be established in his new pursuit he could not but perceive at moments that she loved him rather as a visitant from a gay world to which she rightly belonged than as a man with a purpose opposed to that recent past of his which so interested her It meant that though she made no conditions as to his return to the French capital this was what she secretly longed for in the event of marriage and it robbed him of many an otherwise pleasant hour Along with that came the widening breach between himself and his mother Whenever any little occurrence had brought into more prominence than usual the disappointment that he was causing her it had sent him on lone and moody walks or he was kept awake a great part of the night by the turmoil of spirit which such a recognition created If missus Yeobright could only have been led to see what a sound and worthy purpose this purpose of his was and how little it was being affected by his devotions to Eustacia how differently would she regard him Thus as his sight grew accustomed to the first blinding halo kindled about him by love and beauty Yeobright began to perceive what a strait he was in Sometimes he wished that he had never known Eustacia immediately to retract the wish as brutal Three antagonistic growths had to be kept alive his mother s trust in him his plan for becoming a teacher and Eustacia s happiness His fervid nature could not afford to relinquish one of these though two of the three were as many as he could hope to preserve Though his love was as chaste as that of Petrarch for his Laura it had made fetters of what previously was only a difficulty A position which was not too simple when he stood whole hearted had become indescribably complicated by the addition of Eustacia Just when his mother was beginning to tolerate one scheme he had introduced another still bitterer than the first and the combination was more than she could bear 
366-126663-0000	train-other-500	five Sharp Words Are Spoken and a Crisis Ensues When Yeobright was not with Eustacia he was sitting slavishly over his books when he was not reading he was meeting her
366-126663-0001	train-other-500	These meetings were carried on with the greatest secrecy One afternoon his mother came home from a morning visit to Thomasin
none	none	 He could see from a disturbance in the lines of her face that something had happened 
366-126663-0002	train-other-500	I have been told an incomprehensible thing she said mournfully The captain has let out at the Woman that you and Eustacia Vye are engaged to be married We are said Yeobright But it may not be yet for a very long time
none	none	 I should hardly think it WOULD be yet for a very long time 
366-126663-0003	train-other-500	You will take her to Paris I suppose She spoke with weary hopelessness
none	none	 I am not going back to Paris What will you do with a wife then 
366-126663-0004	train-other-500	Keep a school in Budmouth as I have told you That s incredible The place is overrun with schoolmasters You have no special qualifications What possible chance is there for such as you
366-126663-0005	train-other-500	There is no chance of getting rich But with my system of education which is as new as it is true I shall do a great deal of good to my fellow creatures Dreams dreams
366-126663-0006	train-other-500	If there had been any system left to be invented they would have found it out at the universities long before this time Never Mother They cannot find it out because their teachers don t come in contact with the class which demands such a system
366-126663-0007	train-other-500	that is those who have had no preliminary training My plan is one for instilling high knowledge into empty minds without first cramming them with what has to be uncrammed again before true study begins
366-126663-0008	train-other-500	I might have believed you if you had kept yourself free from entanglements but this woman if she had been a good girl it would have been bad enough but being She is a good girl So you think A Corfu bandmaster s daughter
366-126663-0009	train-other-500	What has her life been Her surname even is not her true one She is Captain Vye s granddaughter and her father merely took her mother s name And she is a lady by instinct
366-126663-0010	train-other-500	They call him captain but anybody is captain He was in the Royal Navy No doubt he has been to sea in some tub or other Why doesn t he look after her
none	none	 No lady would rove about the heath at all hours of the day and night as she does 
366-126663-0011	train-other-500	But that s not all of it There was something queer between her and Thomasin s husband at one time I am as sure of it as that I stand here Eustacia has told me He did pay her a little attention a year ago but there s no harm in that
none	none	 I like her all the better Clym said his mother with firmness I have no proofs against her unfortunately But if she makes you a good wife there has never been a bad one Believe me you are almost exasperating said Yeobright vehemently And this very day I had intended to arrange a meeting between you But you give me no peace you try to thwart my wishes in everything I hate the thought of any son of mine marrying badly I wish I had never lived to see this it is too much for me it is more than I dreamt She turned to the window Her breath was coming quickly and her lips were pale parted and trembling Mother said Clym 
366-126663-0012	train-other-500	whatever you do you will always be dear to me that you know But one thing I have a right to say which is that at my age I am old enough to know what is best for me missus Yeobright remained for some time silent and shaken as if she could say no more
366-126663-0013	train-other-500	Then she replied Best Is it best for you to injure your prospects for such a voluptuous idle woman as that Don t you see that by the very fact of your choosing her you prove that you do not know what is best for you
366-126663-0014	train-other-500	You give up your whole thought you set your whole soul to please a woman I do And that woman is you How can you treat me so flippantly said his mother turning again to him with a tearful look
366-126663-0015	train-other-500	You are unnatural Clym and I did not expect it Very likely said he cheerlessly You did not know the measure you were going to mete me and therefore did not know the measure that would be returned to you again
366-126663-0016	train-other-500	You answer me you think only of her You stick to her in all things That proves her to be worthy I have never yet supported what is bad And I do not care only for her I care for you
none	none	 and for myself and for anything that is good 
366-126663-0017	train-other-500	When a woman once dislikes another she is merciless O Clym please don t go setting down as my fault what is your obstinate wrongheadedness If you wished to connect yourself with an unworthy person why did you come home here to do it
none	none	 Why didn t you do it in Paris it is more the fashion there 
366-126663-0018	train-other-500	You have come only to distress me a lonely woman and shorten my days I wish that you would bestow your presence where you bestow your love Clym said huskily You are my mother I will say no more beyond this
none	none	 that I beg your pardon for having thought this my home I will no longer inflict myself upon you I ll go And he went out with tears in his eyes It was a sunny afternoon at the beginning of summer 
366-126663-0019	train-other-500	and the moist hollows of the heath had passed from their brown to their green stage Yeobright walked to the edge of the basin which extended down from Mistover and Rainbarrow By this time he was calm and he looked over the landscape
366-126663-0020	train-other-500	In the minor valleys between the hillocks which diversified the contour of the vale the fresh young ferns were luxuriantly growing up ultimately to reach a height of five or six feet He descended a little way
366-126663-0021	train-other-500	flung himself down in a spot where a path emerged from one of the small hollows and waited Hither it was that he had promised Eustacia to bring his mother this afternoon that they might meet and be friends His attempt had utterly failed
366-126663-0022	train-other-500	He was in a nest of vivid green The ferny vegetation round him though so abundant was quite uniform it was a grove of machine made foliage a world of green triangles with saw edges and not a single flower
366-126663-0023	train-other-500	The air was warm with a vaporous warmth and the stillness was unbroken
none	none	 Lizards grasshoppers and ants were the only living things to be beheld The scene seemed to belong to the ancient world of the carboniferous period when the forms of plants were few and of the fern kind when there was neither bud nor blossom nothing but a monotonous extent of leafage amid which no bird sang When he had reclined for some considerable time 
366-126663-0024	train-other-500	gloomily pondering he discerned above the ferns a drawn bonnet of white silk approaching from the left and Yeobright knew directly that it covered the head of her he loved His heart awoke from its apathy to a warm excitement and jumping to his feet he said aloud
366-126663-0025	train-other-500	I knew she was sure to come She vanished in a hollow for a few moments and then her whole form unfolded itself from the brake Only you here she exclaimed with a disappointed air whose hollowness was proved by her rising redness and her half guilty low laugh
366-126663-0026	train-other-500	Where is missus Yeobright She has not come he replied in a subdued tone I wish I had known that you would be here alone she said seriously and that we were going to have such an idle pleasant time as this
366-126663-0027	train-other-500	Pleasure not known beforehand is half wasted to anticipate it is to double it I have not thought once today of having you all to myself this afternoon and the actual moment of a thing is so soon gone It is indeed
366-126663-0028	train-other-500	Poor Clym she continued looking tenderly into his face You are sad Something has happened at your home Never mind what is let us only look at what seems
366-126663-0029	train-other-500	But darling what shall we do said he Still go on as we do now just live on from meeting to meeting never minding about another day You I know are always thinking of that I can see you are
366-126663-0030	train-other-500	But you must not will you dear Clym You are just like all women They are ever content to build their lives on any incidental position that offers itself whilst men would fain make a globe to suit them
none	none	 Listen to this Eustacia There is a subject I have determined to put off no longer Your sentiment on the wisdom of Carpe diem does not impress me today Our present mode of life must shortly be brought to an end It is your mother It is I love you none the less in telling you it is only right you should know 
366-126663-0031	train-other-500	I have feared my bliss she said with the merest motion of her lips It has been too intense and consuming There is hope yet There are forty years of work in me yet and why should you despair
366-126663-0032	train-other-500	I am only at an awkward turning I wish people wouldn t be so ready to think that there is no progress without uniformity Ah your mind runs off to the philosophical side of it Well
366-126663-0033	train-other-500	these sad and hopeless obstacles are welcome in one sense for they enable us to look with indifference upon the cruel satires that Fate loves to indulge in
none	none	 I have heard of people who 
366-126663-0034	train-other-500	upon coming suddenly into happiness have died from anxiety lest they should not live to enjoy it I felt myself in that whimsical state of uneasiness lately but I shall be spared it now Let us walk on
366-126663-0035	train-other-500	Clym took the hand which was already bared for him it was a favourite way with them to walk bare hand in bare hand and led her through the ferns They formed a very comely picture of love at full flush as they walked along the valley that late afternoon
366-126663-0036	train-other-500	the sun sloping down on their right and throwing their thin spectral shadows tall as poplar trees far out across the furze and fern
none	none	 Eustacia went with her head thrown back fancifully 
366-126663-0037	train-other-500	a certain glad and voluptuous air of triumph pervading her eyes at having won by her own unaided self a man who was her perfect complement in attainment appearance and age On the young man s part
none	none	 the paleness of face which he had brought with him from Paris 
366-126663-0038	train-other-500	and the incipient marks of time and thought were less perceptible than when he returned the healthful and energetic sturdiness which was his by nature having partially recovered its original proportions They wandered onward till they reached the nether margin of the heath
none	none	 where it became marshy and merged in moorland I must part from you here Clym said Eustacia 
366-126663-0039	train-other-500	They stood still and prepared to bid each other farewell Everything before them was on a perfect level The sun resting on the horizon line streamed across the ground from between copper coloured and lilac clouds
366-126663-0040	train-other-500	stretched out in flats beneath a sky of pale soft green All dark objects on the earth that lay towards the sun were overspread by a purple haze against which groups of wailing gnats shone out
366-126663-0041	train-other-500	rising upwards and dancing about like sparks of fire O
none	none	 this leaving you is too hard to bear exclaimed Eustacia in a sudden whisper of anguish 
366-126663-0042	train-other-500	Your mother will influence you too much I shall not be judged fairly
none	none	 it will get afloat that I am not a good girl and the witch story will be added to make me blacker 
366-126663-0043	train-other-500	They cannot Nobody dares to speak disrespectfully of you or of me Oh how I wish I was sure of never losing you that you could not be able to desert me anyhow Clym stood silent a moment
366-126663-0044	train-other-500	His feelings were high the moment was passionate and he cut the knot You shall be sure of me darling he said folding her in his arms We will be married at once O Clym Do you agree to it
366-126663-0045	train-other-500	If if we can We certainly can both being of full age And I have not followed my occupation all these years without having accumulated money and if you will agree to live in a tiny cottage somewhere on the heath
none	none	 until I take a house in Budmouth for the school we can do it at a very little expense How long shall we have to live in the tiny cottage Clym About six months At the end of that time I shall have finished my reading yes we will do it and this heart aching will be over We shall of course live in absolute seclusion and our married life will only begin to outward view when we take the house in Budmouth where I have already addressed a letter on the matter 
366-126663-0046	train-other-500	Would your grandfather allow you I think he would on the understanding that it should not last longer than six months I will guarantee that if no misfortune happens If no misfortune happens
366-126663-0047	train-other-500	she repeated slowly Which is not likely Dearest fix the exact day And then they consulted on the question and the day was chosen It was to be a fortnight from that time
none	none	 This was the end of their talk and Eustacia left him Clym watched her as she retired towards the sun 
366-126663-0048	train-other-500	The luminous rays wrapped her up with her increasing distance and the rustle of her dress over the sprouting sedge and grass died away As he watched the dead flat of the scenery overpowered him
none	none	 though he was fully alive to the beauty of that untarnished early summer green which was worn for the nonce by the poorest blade 
366-126663-0049	train-other-500	There was something in its oppressive horizontality which too much reminded him of the arena of life it gave him a sense of bare equality with and no superiority to a single living thing under the sun
none	none	 Eustacia was now no longer the goddess but the woman to him 
366-126663-0050	train-other-500	a being to fight for support help be maligned for
none	none	 Now that he had reached a cooler moment he would have preferred a less hasty marriage but the card was laid and he determined to abide by the game Whether Eustacia was to add one other to the list of those who love too hotly to love long and well the forthcoming event was certainly a ready way of proving six Yeobright Goes and the Breach Is Complete All that evening smart sounds denoting an active packing up came from Yeobright s room to the ears of his mother downstairs Next morning he departed from the house and again proceeded across the heath A long day s march was before him his object being to secure a dwelling to which he might take Eustacia when she became his wife Such a house small secluded and with its windows boarded up he had casually observed a month earlier about two miles beyond the village of East Egdon and six miles distant altogether and thither he directed his steps today The weather was far different from that of the evening before The yellow and vapoury sunset which had wrapped up Eustacia from his parting gaze had presaged change It was one of those not infrequent days of an English June which are as wet and boisterous as November The cold clouds hastened on in a body as if painted on a moving slide Vapours from other continents arrived upon the wind which curled and parted round him as he walked on At length Clym reached the margin of a fir and beech plantation that had been enclosed from heath land in the year of his birth Here the trees laden heavily with their new and humid leaves were now suffering more damage than during the highest winds of winter when the boughs are especially disencumbered to do battle with the storm The wet young beeches were undergoing amputations bruises cripplings and harsh lacerations from which the wasting sap would bleed for many a day to come and which would leave scars visible till the day of their burning Each stem was wrenched at the root where it moved like a bone in its socket and at every onset of the gale convulsive sounds came from the branches as if pain were felt In a neighbouring brake a finch was trying to sing but the wind blew under his feathers till they stood on end twisted round his little tail and made him give up his song Yet a few yards to Yeobright s left on the open heath how ineffectively gnashed the storm Those gusts which tore the trees merely waved the furze and heather in a light caress Egdon was made for such times as these Yeobright reached the empty house about midday It was almost as lonely as that of Eustacia s grandfather but the fact that it stood near a heath was disguised by a belt of firs which almost enclosed the premises He journeyed on about a mile further to the village in which the owner lived and returning with him to the house arrangements were completed and the man undertook that one room at least should be ready for occupation the next day Clym s intention was to live there alone until Eustacia should join him on their wedding day Then he turned to pursue his way homeward through the drizzle that had so greatly transformed the scene The ferns among which he had lain in comfort yesterday were dripping moisture from every frond wetting his legs through as he brushed past and the fur of the rabbits leaping before him was clotted into dark locks by the same watery surrounding He reached home damp and weary enough after his ten mile walk It had hardly been a propitious beginning but he had chosen his course and would show no swerving The evening and the following morning were spent in concluding arrangements for his departure To stay at home a minute longer than necessary after having once come to his determination would be he felt only to give new pain to his mother by some word look or deed He had hired a conveyance and sent off his goods by two o clock that day The next step was to get some furniture which after serving for temporary use in the cottage would be available for the house at Budmouth when increased by goods of a better description A mart extensive enough for the purpose existed at Anglebury some miles beyond the spot chosen for his residence and there he resolved to pass the coming night It now only remained to wish his mother good bye She was sitting by the window as usual when he came downstairs Mother I am going to leave you he said holding out his hand I thought you were by your packing replied missus Yeobright in a voice from which every particle of emotion was painfully excluded And you will part friends with me Certainly Clym I am going to be married on the twenty fifth I thought you were going to be married And then and then you must come and see us You will understand me better after that and our situation will not be so wretched as it is now I do not think it likely I shall come to see you Then it will not be my fault or Eustacia s Mother Good bye He kissed her cheek and departed in great misery which was several hours in lessening itself to a controllable level The position had been such that nothing more could be said without in the first place breaking down a barrier and that was not to be done No sooner had Yeobright gone from his mother s house than her face changed its rigid aspect for one of blank despair After a while she wept and her tears brought some relief During the rest of the day she did nothing but walk up and down the garden path in a state bordering on stupefaction Night came and with it but little rest The next day with an instinct to do something which should reduce prostration to mournfulness she went to her son s room and with her own hands arranged it in order for an imaginary time when he should return again She gave some attention to her flowers but it was perfunctorily bestowed for they no longer charmed her It was a great relief when early in the afternoon Thomasin paid her an unexpected visit This was not the first meeting between the relatives since Thomasin s marriage and past blunders having been in a rough way rectified they could always greet each other with pleasure and ease The oblique band of sunlight which followed her through the door became the young wife well It illuminated her as her presence illuminated the heath In her movements in her gaze she reminded the beholder of the feathered creatures who lived around her home All similes and allegories concerning her began and ended with birds There was as much variety in her motions as in their flight When she was musing she was a kestrel which hangs in the air by an invisible motion of its wings When she was in a high wind her light body was blown against trees and banks like a heron s When she was frightened she darted noiselessly like a kingfisher When she was serene she skimmed like a swallow and that is how she was moving now You are looking very blithe upon my word Tamsie said missus Yeobright with a sad smile How is Damon He is very well Is he kind to you Thomasin And missus Yeobright observed her narrowly Pretty fairly Is that honestly said Yes Aunt I would tell you if he were unkind She added blushing and with hesitation He I don t know if I ought to complain to you about this but I am not quite sure what to do I want some money you know Aunt some to buy little things for myself and he doesn t give me any I don t like to ask him and yet perhaps he doesn t give it me because he doesn t know Ought I to mention it to him Aunt Of course you ought Have you never said a word on the matter You see I had some of my own said Thomasin evasively and I have not wanted any of his until lately I did just say something about it last week but he seems not to remember He must be made to remember You are aware that I have a little box full of spade guineas which your uncle put into my hands to divide between yourself and Clym whenever I chose Perhaps the time has come when it should be done They can be turned into sovereigns at any moment I think I should like to have my share that is if you don t mind You shall if necessary But it is only proper that you should first tell your husband distinctly that you are without any and see what he will do Very well I will Aunt I have heard about Clym I know you are in trouble about him and that s why I have come missus Yeobright turned away and her features worked in her attempt to conceal her feelings Then she ceased to make any attempt and said weeping O Thomasin do you think he hates me How can he bear to grieve me so when I have lived only for him through all these years Hate you no said Thomasin soothingly It is only that he loves her too well Look at it quietly do It is not so very bad of him Do you know I thought it not the worst match he could have made Miss Vye s family is a good one on her mother s side and her father was a romantic wanderer a sort of Greek Ulysses It is no use Thomasin it is no use Your intention is good but I will not trouble you to argue I have gone through the whole that can be said on either side times and many times Clym and I have not parted in anger we have parted in a worse way It is not a passionate quarrel that would have broken my heart it is the steady opposition and persistence in going wrong that he has shown O Thomasin he was so good as a little boy so tender and kind He was I know I did not think one whom I called mine would grow up to treat me like this He spoke to me as if I opposed him to injure him As though I could wish him ill There are worse women in the world than Eustacia Vye There are too many better that s the agony of it It was she Thomasin and she only who led your husband to act as he did I would swear it No said Thomasin eagerly It was before he knew me that he thought of her and it was nothing but a mere flirtation Very well we will let it be so There is little use in unravelling that now Sons must be blind if they will Why is it that a woman can see from a distance what a man cannot see close Clym must do as he will he is nothing more to me And this is maternity to give one s best years and best love to ensure the fate of being despised You are too unyielding Think how many mothers there are whose sons have brought them to public shame by real crimes before you feel so deeply a case like this Thomasin don t lecture me I can t have it It is the excess above what we expect that makes the force of the blow and that may not be greater in their case than in mine they may have foreseen the worst I am wrongly made Thomasin she added with a mournful smile Some widows can guard against the wounds their children give them by turning their hearts to another husband and beginning life again But I always was a poor weak one idea d creature I had not the compass of heart nor the enterprise for that Just as forlorn and stupefied as I was when my husband s spirit flew away I have sat ever since never attempting to mend matters at all I was comparatively a young woman then and I might have had another family by this time and have been comforted by them for the failure of this one son It is more noble in you that you did not The more noble the less wise Forget it and be soothed dear Aunt And I shall not leave you alone for long I shall come and see you every day And for one week Thomasin literally fulfilled her word She endeavoured to make light of the wedding and brought news of the preparations and that she was invited to be present The next week she was rather unwell and did not appear Nothing had as yet been done about the guineas for Thomasin feared to address her husband again on the subject and missus Yeobright had insisted upon this One day just before this time Wildeve was standing at the door of the Quiet Woman In addition to the upward path through the heath to Rainbarrow and Mistover there was a road which branched from the highway a short distance below the inn and ascended to Mistover by a circuitous and easy incline This was the only route on that side for vehicles to the captain s retreat A light cart from the nearest town descended the road and the lad who was driving pulled up in front of the inn for something to drink You come from Mistover said Wildeve Yes They are taking in good things up there Going to be a wedding And the driver buried his face in his mug Wildeve had not received an inkling of the fact before and a sudden expression of pain overspread his face He turned for a moment into the passage to hide it Then he came back again Do you mean Miss Vye he said How is it that she can be married so soon By the will of God and a ready young man I suppose You don t mean mister Yeobright Yes He has been creeping about with her all the spring I suppose she was immensely taken with him She is crazy about him so their general servant of all work tells me And that lad Charley that looks after the horse is all in a daze about it The stun poll has got fond like of her Is she lively is she glad Going to be married so soon well It isn t so very soon No not so very soon Wildeve went indoors to the empty room a curious heartache within him He rested his elbow upon the mantelpiece and his face upon his hand When Thomasin entered the room he did not tell her of what he had heard The old longing for Eustacia had reappeared in his soul and it was mainly because he had discovered that it was another man s intention to possess her To be yearning for the difficult to be weary of that offered to care for the remote to dislike the near it was Wildeve s nature always This is the true mark of the man of sentiment Though Wildeve s fevered feeling had not been elaborated to real poetical compass it was of the standard sort His might have been called the Rousseau of Egdon seven The Morning and the Evening of a Day The wedding morning came Nobody would have imagined from appearances that Blooms End had any interest in Mistover that day A solemn stillness prevailed around the house of Clym s mother and there was no more animation indoors missus Yeobright who had declined to attend the ceremony sat by the breakfast table in the old room which communicated immediately with the porch her eyes listlessly directed towards the open door It was the room in which six months earlier the merry Christmas party had met to which Eustacia came secretly and as a stranger The only living thing that entered now was a sparrow and seeing no movements to cause alarm he hopped boldly round the room endeavoured to go out by the window and fluttered among the pot flowers This roused the lonely sitter who got up released the bird and went to the door She was expecting Thomasin who had written the night before to state that the time had come when she would wish to have the money and that she would if possible call this day Yet Thomasin occupied missus Yeobright s thoughts but slightly as she looked up the valley of the heath alive with butterflies and with grasshoppers whose husky noises on every side formed a whispered chorus A domestic drama for which the preparations were now being made a mile or two off was but little less vividly present to her eyes than if enacted before her She tried to dismiss the vision and walked about the garden plot but her eyes ever and anon sought out the direction of the parish church to which Mistover belonged and her excited fancy clove the hills which divided the building from her eyes The morning wore away Eleven o clock struck could it be that the wedding was then in progress It must be so She went on imagining the scene at the church which he had by this time approached with his bride She pictured the little group of children by the gate as the pony carriage drove up in which as Thomasin had learnt they were going to perform the short journey Then she saw them enter and proceed to the chancel and kneel and the service seemed to go on She covered her face with her hands O it is a mistake she groaned And he will rue it some day and think of me While she remained thus overcome by her forebodings the old clock indoors whizzed forth twelve strokes Soon after faint sounds floated to her ear from afar over the hills The breeze came from that quarter and it had brought with it the notes of distant bells gaily starting off in a peal one two three four five The ringers at East Egdon were announcing the nuptials of Eustacia and her son Then it is over she murmured Well well and life too will be over soon And why should I go on scalding my face like this Cry about one thing in life cry about all one thread runs through the whole piece And yet we say a time to laugh Towards evening Wildeve came Since Thomasin s marriage missus Yeobright had shown him that grim friendliness which at last arises in all such cases of undesired affinity The vision of what ought to have been is thrown aside in sheer weariness and browbeaten human endeavour listlessly makes the best of the fact that is Wildeve to do him justice had behaved very courteously to his wife s aunt and it was with no surprise that she saw him enter now Thomasin has not been able to come as she promised to do he replied to her inquiry which had been anxious for she knew that her niece was badly in want of money The captain came down last night and personally pressed her to join them today So not to be unpleasant she determined to go They fetched her in the pony chaise and are going to bring her back Then it is done said missus Yeobright Have they gone to their new home I don t know I have had no news from Mistover since Thomasin left to go You did not go with her said she as if there might be good reasons why I could not said Wildeve reddening slightly We could not both leave the house it was rather a busy morning on account of Anglebury Great Market I believe you have something to give to Thomasin If you like I will take it missus Yeobright hesitated and wondered if Wildeve knew what the something was Did she tell you of this she inquired Not particularly She casually dropped a remark about having arranged to fetch some article or other It is hardly necessary to send it She can have it whenever she chooses to come That won t be yet In the present state of her health she must not go on walking so much as she has done He added with a faint twang of sarcasm What wonderful thing is it that I cannot be trusted to take Nothing worth troubling you with One would think you doubted my honesty he said with a laugh though his colour rose in a quick resentfulness frequent with him You need think no such thing said she drily It is simply that I in common with the rest of the world feel that there are certain things which had better be done by certain people than by others As you like as you like said Wildeve laconically It is not worth arguing about Well I think I must turn homeward again as the inn must not be left long in charge of the lad and the maid only He went his way his farewell being scarcely so courteous as his greeting But missus Yeobright knew him thoroughly by this time and took little notice of his manner good or bad When Wildeve was gone missus Yeobright stood and considered what would be the best course to adopt with regard to the guineas which she had not liked to entrust to Wildeve It was hardly credible that Thomasin had told him to ask for them when the necessity for them had arisen from the difficulty of obtaining money at his hands At the same time Thomasin really wanted them and might be unable to come to Blooms End for another week at least To take or send the money to her at the inn would be impolite since Wildeve would pretty surely be present or would discover the transaction and if as her aunt suspected he treated her less kindly than she deserved to be treated he might then get the whole sum out of her gentle hands But on this particular evening Thomasin was at Mistover and anything might be conveyed to her there without the knowledge of her husband Upon the whole the opportunity was worth taking advantage of Her son too was there and was now married There could be no more proper moment to render him his share of the money than the present And the chance that would be afforded her by sending him this gift of showing how far she was from bearing him ill will cheered the sad mother s heart She went upstairs and took from a locked drawer a little box out of which she poured a hoard of broad unworn guineas that had lain there many a year There were a hundred in all and she divided them into two heaps fifty in each Tying up these in small canvas bags she went down to the garden and called to Christian Cantle who was loitering about in hope of a supper which was not really owed him missus Yeobright gave him the moneybags charged him to go to Mistover and on no account to deliver them into any one s hands save her son s and Thomasin s On further thought she deemed it advisable to tell Christian precisely what the two bags contained that he might be fully impressed with their importance Christian pocketed the moneybags promised the greatest carefulness and set out on his way You need not hurry said missus Yeobright It will be better not to get there till after dusk and then nobody will notice you Come back here to supper if it is not too late It was nearly nine o clock when he began to ascend the vale towards Mistover but the long days of summer being at their climax the first obscurity of evening had only just begun to tan the landscape At this point of his journey Christian heard voices and found that they proceeded from a company of men and women who were traversing a hollow ahead of him the tops only of their heads being visible He paused and thought of the money he carried It was almost too early even for Christian seriously to fear robbery nevertheless he took a precaution which ever since his boyhood he had adopted whenever he carried more than two or three shillings upon his person a precaution somewhat like that of the owner of the Pitt Diamond when filled with similar misgivings He took off his boots untied the guineas and emptied the contents of one little bag into the right boot and of the other into the left spreading them as flatly as possible over the bottom of each which was really a spacious coffer by no means limited to the size of the foot Pulling them on again and lacing them to the very top he proceeded on his way more easy in his head than under his soles His path converged towards that of the noisy company and on coming nearer he found to his relief that they were several Egdon people whom he knew very well while with them walked Fairway of Blooms End What Christian going too said Fairway as soon as he recognized the newcomer You ve got no young woman nor wife to your name to gie a gown piece to I m sure What d ye mean said Christian Why the raffle The one we go to every year Going to the raffle as well as ourselves Never knew a word o t Is it like cudgel playing or other sportful forms of bloodshed I don t want to go thank you Mister Fairway and no offence Christian don t know the fun o t and twould be a fine sight for him said a buxom woman There s no danger at all Christian Every man puts in a shilling apiece and one wins a gown piece for his wife or sweetheart if he s got one Well as that s not my fortune there s no meaning in it to me But I should like to see the fun if there s nothing of the black art in it and if a man may look on without cost or getting into any dangerous wrangle There will be no uproar at all said Timothy Sure Christian if you d like to come we ll see there s no harm done And no ba dy gaieties I suppose You see neighbours if so it would be setting father a bad example as he is so light moral d But a gown piece for a shilling and no black art tis worth looking in to see and it wouldn t hinder me half an hour Yes I ll come if you ll step a little way towards Mistover with me afterwards supposing night should have closed in and nobody else is going that way One or two promised and Christian diverging from his direct path turned round to the right with his companions towards the Quiet Woman When they entered the large common room of the inn they found assembled there about ten men from among the neighbouring population and the group was increased by the new contingent to double that number Most of them were sitting round the room in seats divided by wooden elbows like those of crude cathedral stalls which were carved with the initials of many an illustrious drunkard of former times who had passed his days and his nights between them and now lay as an alcoholic cinder in the nearest churchyard Among the cups on the long table before the sitters lay an open parcel of light drapery the gown piece as it was called which was to be raffled for Wildeve was standing with his back to the fireplace smoking a cigar and the promoter of the raffle a packman from a distant town was expatiating upon the value of the fabric as material for a summer dress Now gentlemen he continued as the newcomers drew up to the table there s five have entered and we want four more to make up the number I think by the faces of those gentlemen who have just come in that they are shrewd enough to take advantage of this rare opportunity of beautifying their ladies at a very trifling expense Fairway Sam and another placed their shillings on the table and the man turned to Christian No sir said Christian drawing back with a quick gaze of misgiving I am only a poor chap come to look on an it please ye sir I don t so much as know how you do it If so be I was sure of getting it I would put down the shilling but I couldn t otherwise I think you might almost be sure said the pedlar In fact now I look into your face even if I can t say you are sure to win I can say that I never saw anything look more like winning in my life You ll anyhow have the same chance as the rest of us said Sam And the extra luck of being the last comer said another And I was born wi a caul and perhaps can be no more ruined than drowned Christian added beginning to give way Ultimately Christian laid down his shilling the raffle began and the dice went round When it came to Christian s turn he took the box with a trembling hand shook it fearfully and threw a pair royal Three of the others had thrown common low pairs and all the rest mere points The gentleman looked like winning as I said observed the chapman blandly Take it sir the article is yours Haw haw haw said Fairway I m damned if this isn t the quarest start that ever I knowed Mine asked Christian with a vacant stare from his target eyes I I haven t got neither maid wife nor widder belonging to me at all and I m afeard it will make me laughed at to ha e it Master Traveller What with being curious to join in I never thought of that What shall I do wi a woman s clothes in MY bedroom and not lose my decency Keep em to be sure said Fairway if it is only for luck Perhaps twill tempt some woman that thy poor carcase had no power over when standing empty handed Keep it certainly said Wildeve who had idly watched the scene from a distance The table was then cleared of the articles and the men began to drink Well to be sure said Christian half to himself To think I should have been born so lucky as this and not have found it out until now What curious creatures these dice be powerful rulers of us all and yet at my command I am sure I never need be afeared of anything after this He handled the dice fondly one by one Why sir he said in a confidential whisper to Wildeve who was near his left hand if I could only use this power that s in me of multiplying money I might do some good to a near relation of yours seeing what I ve got about me of hers eh He tapped one of his money laden boots upon the floor What do you mean said Wildeve That s a secret Well I must be going now He looked anxiously towards Fairway Where are you going Wildeve asked To Mistover Knap I have to see missus Thomasin there that s all I am going there too to fetch missus Wildeve We can walk together Wildeve became lost in thought and a look of inward illumination came into his eyes It was money for his wife that missus Yeobright could not trust him with Yet she could trust this fellow he said to himself Why doesn t that which belongs to the wife belong to the husband too He called to the pot boy to bring him his hat and said Now Christian I am ready mister Wildeve said Christian timidly as he turned to leave the room would you mind lending me them wonderful little things that carry my luck inside em that I might practise a bit by myself you know He looked wistfully at the dice and box lying on the mantlepiece Certainly said Wildeve carelessly They were only cut out by some lad with his knife and are worth nothing And Christian went back and privately pocketed them Wildeve opened the door and looked out The night was warm and cloudy By Gad tis dark he continued But I suppose we shall find our way If we should lose the path it might be awkward said Christian A lantern is the only shield that will make it safe for us Let s have a lantern by all means The stable lantern was fetched and lighted Christian took up his gownpiece and the two set out to ascend the hill Within the room the men fell into chat till their attention was for a moment drawn to the chimney corner This was large and in addition to its proper recess contained within its jambs like many on Egdon a receding seat so that a person might sit there absolutely unobserved provided there was no fire to light him up as was the case now and throughout the summer From the niche a single object protruded into the light from the candles on the table It was a clay pipe and its colour was reddish The men had been attracted to this object by a voice behind the pipe asking for a light Upon my life it fairly startled me when the man spoke said Fairway handing a candle Oh tis the reddleman You ve kept a quiet tongue young man Yes I had nothing to say observed Venn In a few minutes he arose and wished the company good night Meanwhile Wildeve and Christian had plunged into the heath It was a stagnant warm and misty night full of all the heavy perfumes of new vegetation not yet dried by hot sun and among these particularly the scent of the fern The lantern dangling from Christian s hand brushed the feathery fronds in passing by disturbing moths and other winged insects which flew out and alighted upon its horny panes So you have money to carry to missus Wildeve said Christian s companion after a silence Don t you think it very odd that it shouldn t be given to me As man and wife be one flesh twould have been all the same I should think said Christian But my strict documents was to give the money into missus Wildeve s hand and tis well to do things right No doubt said Wildeve Any person who had known the circumstances might have perceived that Wildeve was mortified by the discovery that the matter in transit was money and not as he had supposed when at Blooms End some fancy nick nack which only interested the two women themselves missus Yeobright s refusal implied that his honour was not considered to be of sufficiently good quality to make him a safer bearer of his wife s property How very warm it is tonight Christian he said panting when they were nearly under Rainbarrow Let us sit down for a few minutes for Heaven s sake Wildeve flung himself down on the soft ferns and Christian placing the lantern and parcel on the ground perched himself in a cramped position hard by his knees almost touching his chin He presently thrust one hand into his coat pocket and began shaking it about What are you rattling in there said Wildeve Only the dice sir said Christian quickly withdrawing his hand What magical machines these little things be mister Wildeve Tis a game I should never get tired of Would you mind my taking em out and looking at em for a minute to see how they are made I didn t like to look close before the other men for fear they should think it bad manners in me Christian took them out and examined them in the hollow of his hand by the lantern light That these little things should carry such luck and such charm and such a spell and such power in em passes all I ever heard or zeed he went on with a fascinated gaze at the dice which as is frequently the case in country places were made of wood the points being burnt upon each face with the end of a wire They are a great deal in a small compass You think Yes Do ye suppose they really be the devil s playthings mister Wildeve If so tis no good sign that I be such a lucky man You ought to win some money now that you ve got them Any woman would marry you then Now is your time Christian and I would recommend you not to let it slip Some men are born to luck some are not I belong to the latter class Did you ever know anybody who was born to it besides myself O yes I once heard of an Italian who sat down at a gaming table with only a louis that s a foreign sovereign in his pocket He played on for twenty four hours and won ten thousand pounds stripping the bank he had played against Then there was another man who had lost a thousand pounds and went to the broker s next day to sell stock that he might pay the debt The man to whom he owed the money went with him in a hackney coach and to pass the time they tossed who should pay the fare The ruined man won and the other was tempted to continue the game and they played all the way When the coachman stopped he was told to drive home again the whole thousand pounds had been won back by the man who was going to sell Ha ha splendid exclaimed Christian Go on go on Then there was a man of London who was only a waiter at White s clubhouse He began playing first half crown stakes and then higher and higher till he became very rich got an appointment in India and rose to be Governor of Madras His daughter married a member of Parliament and the Bishop of Carlisle stood godfather to one of the children Wonderfull wonderfull And once there was a young man in America who gambled till he had lost his last dollar He staked his watch and chain and lost as before staked his umbrella lost again staked his hat lost again staked his coat and stood in his shirt sleeves lost again Began taking off his breeches and then a looker on gave him a trifle for his pluck With this he won Won back his coat won back his hat won back his umbrella his watch his money and went out of the door a rich man Oh tis too good it takes away my breath mister Wildeve I think I will try another shilling with you as I am one of that sort no danger can come o t and you can afford to lose Very well said Wildeve rising Searching about with the lantern he found a large flat stone which he placed between himself and Christian and sat down again The lantern was opened to give more light and it s rays directed upon the stone Christian put down a shilling Wildeve another and each threw Christian won They played for two Christian won again Let us try four said Wildeve They played for four This time the stakes were won by Wildeve Ah those little accidents will of course sometimes happen to the luckiest man he observed And now I have no more money explained Christian excitedly And yet if I could go on I should get it back again and more I wish this was mine He struck his boot upon the ground so that the guineas chinked within What you have not put missus Wildeve s money there Yes Tis for safety Is it any harm to raffle with a married lady s money when if I win I shall only keep my winnings and give her her own all the same and if t other man wins her money will go to the lawful owner None at all Wildeve had been brooding ever since they started on the mean estimation in which he was held by his wife s friends and it cut his heart severely As the minutes passed he had gradually drifted into a revengeful intention without knowing the precise moment of forming it This was to teach missus Yeobright a lesson as he considered it to be in other words to show her if he could that her niece s husband was the proper guardian of her niece s money Well here goes said Christian beginning to unlace one boot I shall dream of it nights and nights I suppose but I shall always swear my flesh don t crawl when I think o t He thrust his hand into the boot and withdrew one of poor Thomasin s precious guineas piping hot Wildeve had already placed a sovereign on the stone The game was then resumed Wildeve won first and Christian ventured another winning himself this time The game fluctuated but the average was in Wildeve s favour Both men became so absorbed in the game that they took no heed of anything but the pigmy objects immediately beneath their eyes the flat stone the open lantern the dice and the few illuminated fern leaves which lay under the light were the whole world to them At length Christian lost rapidly and presently to his horror the whole fifty guineas belonging to Thomasin had been handed over to his adversary I don t care I don t care he moaned and desperately set about untying his left boot to get at the other fifty The devil will toss me into the flames on his three pronged fork for this night s work I know But perhaps I shall win yet and then I ll get a wife to sit up with me o nights and I won t be afeard I won t Here s another for ee my man He slapped another guinea down upon the stone and the dice box was rattled again Time passed on Wildeve began to be as excited as Christian himself When commencing the game his intention had been nothing further than a bitter practical joke on missus Yeobright To win the money fairly or otherwise and to hand it contemptuously to Thomasin in her aunt s presence had been the dim outline of his purpose But men are drawn from their intentions even in the course of carrying them out and it was extremely doubtful by the time the twentieth guinea had been reached whether Wildeve was conscious of any other intention than that of winning for his own personal benefit Moreover he was now no longer gambling for his wife s money but for Yeobright s though of this fact Christian in his apprehensiveness did not inform him till afterwards It was nearly eleven o clock when with almost a shriek Christian placed Yeobright s last gleaming guinea upon the stone In thirty seconds it had gone the way of its companions Christian turned and flung himself on the ferns in a convulsion of remorse O what shall I do with my wretched self he groaned What shall I do Will any good Heaven hae mercy upon my wicked soul Do Live on just the same I won t live on just the same I ll die I say you are a a A man sharper than my neighbour Yes a man sharper than my neighbour a regular sharper Poor chips in porridge you are very unmannerly I don t know about that And I say you be unmannerly You ve got money that isn t your own Half the guineas are poor mister Clym s How s that Because I had to gie fifty of em to him missus Yeobright said so Oh Well twould have been more graceful of her to have given them to his wife Eustacia But they are in my hands now Christian pulled on his boots and with heavy breathings which could be heard to some distance dragged his limbs together arose and tottered away out of sight Wildeve set about shutting the lantern to return to the house for he deemed it too late to go to Mistover to meet his wife who was to be driven home in the captain s four wheel While he was closing the little horn door a figure rose from behind a neighbouring bush and came forward into the lantern light It was the reddleman approaching eight A New Force Disturbs the Current Wildeve stared Venn looked coolly towards Wildeve and without a word being spoken he deliberately sat himself down where Christian had been seated thrust his hand into his pocket drew out a sovereign and laid it on the stone You have been watching us from behind that bush said Wildeve The reddleman nodded Down with your stake he said Or haven t you pluck enough to go on Now gambling is a species of amusement which is much more easily begun with full pockets than left off with the same and though Wildeve in a cooler temper might have prudently declined this invitation the excitement of his recent success carried him completely away He placed one of the guineas on a slab beside the reddleman s sovereign Mine is a guinea he said A guinea that s not your own said Venn sarcastically It is my own answered Wildeve haughtily It is my wife s and what is hers is mine Very well let s make a beginning He shook the box and threw eight ten and nine the three casts amounted to twenty seven This encouraged Wildeve He took the box and his three casts amounted to forty five Down went another of the reddleman s sovereigns against his first one which Wildeve laid This time Wildeve threw fifty one points but no pair The reddleman looked grim threw a raffle of aces and pocketed the stakes Here you are again said Wildeve contemptuously Double the stakes He laid two of Thomasin s guineas and the reddleman his two pounds Venn won again New stakes were laid on the stone and the gamblers proceeded as before Wildeve was a nervous and excitable man and the game was beginning to tell upon his temper He writhed fumed shifted his seat and the beating of his heart was almost audible Venn sat with lips impassively closed and eyes reduced to a pair of unimportant twinkles he scarcely appeared to breathe He might have been an Arab or an automaton he would have been like a red sandstone statue but for the motion of his arm with the dice box The game fluctuated now in favour of one now in favour of the other without any great advantage on the side of either Nearly twenty minutes were passed thus The light of the candle had by this time attracted heath flies moths and other winged creatures of night which floated round the lantern flew into the flame or beat about the faces of the two players But neither of the men paid much attention to these things their eyes being concentrated upon the little flat stone which to them was an arena vast and important as a battlefield By this time a change had come over the game the reddleman won continually At length sixty guineas Thomasin s fifty and ten of Clym s had passed into his hands Wildeve was reckless frantic exasperated Won back his coat said Venn slily Another throw and the money went the same way Won back his hat continued Venn Oh oh said Wildeve Won back his watch won back his money and went out of the door a rich man added Venn sentence by sentence as stake after stake passed over to him Five more shouted Wildeve dashing down the money And three casts be hanged one shall decide The red automaton opposite lapsed into silence nodded and followed his example Wildeve rattled the box and threw a pair of sixes and five points He clapped his hands I have done it this time hurrah There are two playing and only one has thrown said the reddleman quietly bringing down the box The eyes of each were then so intently converged upon the stone that one could fancy their beams were visible like rays in a fog Venn lifted the box and behold a triplet of sixes was disclosed Wildeve was full of fury While the reddleman was grasping the stakes Wildeve seized the dice and hurled them box and all into the darkness uttering a fearful imprecation Then he arose and began stamping up and down like a madman It is all over then said Venn No no cried Wildeve I mean to have another chance yet I must But my good man what have you done with the dice I threw them away it was a momentary irritation What a fool I am Here come and help me to look for them we must find them again Wildeve snatched up the lantern and began anxiously prowling among the furze and fern You are not likely to find them there said Venn following What did you do such a crazy thing as that for Here s the box The dice can t be far off Wildeve turned the light eagerly upon the spot where Venn had found the box and mauled the herbage right and left In the course of a few minutes one of the dice was found They searched on for some time but no other was to be seen Never mind said Wildeve let s play with one Agreed said Venn Down they sat again and recommenced with single guinea stakes and the play went on smartly But Fortune had unmistakably fallen in love with the reddleman tonight He won steadily till he was the owner of fourteen more of the gold pieces Seventy nine of the hundred guineas were his Wildeve possessing only twenty one The aspect of the two opponents was now singular Apart from motions a complete diorama of the fluctuations of the game went on in their eyes A diminutive candle flame was mirrored in each pupil and it would have been possible to distinguish therein between the moods of hope and the moods of abandonment even as regards the reddleman though his facial muscles betrayed nothing at all Wildeve played on with the recklessness of despair What s that he suddenly exclaimed hearing a rustle and they both looked up They were surrounded by dusky forms between four and five feet high standing a few paces beyond the rays of the lantern A moment s inspection revealed that the encircling figures were heath croppers their heads being all towards the players at whom they gazed intently Hoosh said Wildeve and the whole forty or fifty animals at once turned and galloped away Play was again resumed Ten minutes passed away Then a large death s head moth advanced from the obscure outer air wheeled twice round the lantern flew straight at the candle and extinguished it by the force of the blow Wildeve had just thrown but had not lifted the box to see what he had cast and now it was impossible What the infernal he shrieked Now what shall we do Perhaps I have thrown six have you any matches None said Venn Christian had some I wonder where he is Christian But there was no reply to Wildeve s shout save a mournful whining from the herons which were nesting lower down the vale Both men looked blankly round without rising As their eyes grew accustomed to the darkness they perceived faint greenish points of light among the grass and fern These lights dotted the hillside like stars of a low magnitude Ah glowworms said Wildeve Wait a minute We can continue the game Venn sat still and his companion went hither and thither till he had gathered thirteen glowworms as many as he could find in a space of four or five minutes upon a fox glove leaf which he pulled for the purpose The reddleman vented a low humorous laugh when he saw his adversary return with these Determined to go on then he said drily I always am said Wildeve angrily And shaking the glowworms from the leaf he ranged them with a trembling hand in a circle on the stone leaving a space in the middle for the descent of the dice box over which the thirteen tiny lamps threw a pale phosphoric shine The game was again renewed It happened to be that season of the year at which glowworms put forth their greatest brilliancy and the light they yielded was more than ample for the purpose since it is possible on such nights to read the handwriting of a letter by the light of two or three The incongruity between the men s deeds and their environment was great Amid the soft juicy vegetation of the hollow in which they sat the motionless and the uninhabited solitude intruded the chink of guineas the rattle of dice the exclamations of the reckless players Wildeve had lifted the box as soon as the lights were obtained and the solitary die proclaimed that the game was still against him I won t play any more you ve been tampering with the dice he shouted How when they were your own said the reddleman We ll change the game the lowest point shall win the stake it may cut off my ill luck Do you refuse No go on said Venn O there they are again damn them cried Wildeve looking up The heath croppers had returned noiselessly and were looking on with erect heads just as before their timid eyes fixed upon the scene as if they were wondering what mankind and candlelight could have to do in these haunts at this untoward hour What a plague those creatures are staring at me so he said and flung a stone which scattered them when the game was continued as before Wildeve had now ten guineas left and each laid five Wildeve threw three points Venn two and raked in the coins The other seized the die and clenched his teeth upon it in sheer rage as if he would bite it in pieces Never give in here are my last five he cried throwing them down Hang the glowworms they are going out Why don t you burn you little fools Stir them up with a thorn He probed the glowworms with a bit of stick and rolled them over till the bright side of their tails was upwards There s light enough Throw on said Venn Wildeve brought down the box within the shining circle and looked eagerly He had thrown ace Well done I said it would turn and it has turned Venn said nothing but his hand shook slightly He threw ace also O said Wildeve Curse me The die smacked the stone a second time It was ace again Venn looked gloomy threw the die was seen to be lying in two pieces the cleft sides uppermost I ve thrown nothing at all he said Serves me right I split the die with my teeth Here take your money Blank is less than one I don t wish it Take it I say you ve won it And Wildeve threw the stakes against the reddleman s chest Venn gathered them up arose and withdrew from the hollow Wildeve sitting stupefied When he had come to himself he also arose and with the extinguished lantern in his hand went towards the highroad On reaching it he stood still The silence of night pervaded the whole heath except in one direction and that was towards Mistover There he could hear the noise of light wheels and presently saw two carriagelamps descending the hill Wildeve screened himself under a bush and waited The vehicle came on and passed before him It was a hired carriage and behind the coachman were two persons whom he knew well There sat Eustacia and Yeobright the arm of the latter being round her waist They turned the sharp corner at the bottom towards the temporary home which Clym had hired and furnished about five miles to the eastward Wildeve forgot the loss of the money at the sight of his lost love whose preciousness in his eyes was increasing in geometrical progression with each new incident that reminded him of their hopeless division Brimming with the subtilized misery that he was capable of feeling he followed the opposite way towards the inn About the same moment that Wildeve stepped into the highway Venn also had reached it at a point a hundred yards further on and he hearing the same wheels likewise waited till the carriage should come up When he saw who sat therein he seemed to be disappointed Reflecting a minute or two during which interval the carriage rolled on he crossed the road and took a short cut through the furze and heath to a point where the turnpike road bent round in ascending a hill He was now again in front of the carriage which presently came up at a walking pace Venn stepped forward and showed himself Eustacia started when the lamp shone upon him and Clym s arm was involuntarily withdrawn from her waist He said What Diggory You are having a lonely walk Yes I beg your pardon for stopping you said Venn But I am waiting about for missus Wildeve I have something to give her from missus Yeobright Can you tell me if she s gone home from the party yet No But she will be leaving soon You may possibly meet her at the corner Venn made a farewell obeisance and walked back to his former position where the byroad from Mistover joined the highway Here he remained fixed for nearly half an hour and then another pair of lights came down the hill It was the old fashioned wheeled nondescript belonging to the captain and Thomasin sat in it alone driven by Charley The reddleman came up as they slowly turned the corner I beg pardon for stopping you missus Wildeve he said But I have something to give you privately from missus Yeobright He handed a small parcel it consisted of the hundred guineas he had just won roughly twisted up in a piece of paper Thomasin recovered from her surprise and took the packet That s all ma am I wish you good night he said and vanished from her view Thus Venn in his anxiety to rectify matters had placed in Thomasin s hands not only the fifty guineas which rightly belonged to her but also the fifty intended for her cousin Clym His mistake had been based upon Wildeve s words at the opening of the game when he indignantly denied that the guinea was not his own It had not been comprehended by the reddleman that at halfway through the performance the game was continued with the money of another person and it was an error which afterwards helped to cause more misfortune than treble the loss in money value could have done The night was now somewhat advanced and Venn plunged deeper into the heath till he came to a ravine where his van was standing a spot not more than two hundred yards from the site of the gambling bout He entered this movable home of his lit his lantern and before closing his door for the night stood reflecting on the circumstances of the preceding hours While he stood the dawn grew visible in the northeast quarter of the heavens which the clouds having cleared off was bright with a soft sheen at this midsummer time though it was only between one and two o clock Venn thoroughly weary then shut his door and flung himself down to sleep BOOK FOUR THE CLOSED DOOR one The Rencounter by the Pool The July sun shone over Egdon and fired its crimson heather to scarlet It was the one season of the year and the one weather of the season in which the heath was gorgeous This flowering period represented the second or noontide division in the cycle of those superficial changes which alone were possible here it followed the green or young fern period representing the morn and preceded the brown period when the heathbells and ferns would wear the russet tinges of evening to be in turn displaced by the dark hue of the winter period representing night Clym and Eustacia in their little house at Alderworth beyond East Egdon were living on with a monotony which was delightful to them The heath and changes of weather were quite blotted out from their eyes for the present They were enclosed in a sort of luminous mist which hid from them surroundings of any inharmonious colour and gave to all things the character of light When it rained they were charmed because they could remain indoors together all day with such a show of reason when it was fine they were charmed because they could sit together on the hills They were like those double stars which revolve round and round each other and from a distance appear to be one The absolute solitude in which they lived intensified their reciprocal thoughts yet some might have said that it had the disadvantage of consuming their mutual affections at a fearfully prodigal rate Yeobright did not fear for his own part but recollection of Eustacia s old speech about the evanescence of love now apparently forgotten by her sometimes caused him to ask himself a question and he recoiled at the thought that the quality of finiteness was not foreign to Eden When three or four weeks had been passed thus Yeobright resumed his reading in earnest To make up for lost time he studied indefatigably for he wished to enter his new profession with the least possible delay Now Eustacia s dream had always been that once married to Clym she would have the power of inducing him to return to Paris He had carefully withheld all promise to do so but would he be proof against her coaxing and argument She had calculated to such a degree on the probability of success that she had represented Paris and not Budmouth to her grandfather as in all likelihood their future home Her hopes were bound up in this dream In the quiet days since their marriage when Yeobright had been poring over her lips her eyes and the lines of her face she had mused and mused on the subject even while in the act of returning his gaze and now the sight of the books indicating a future which was antagonistic to her dream struck her with a positively painful jar She was hoping for the time when as the mistress of some pretty establishment however small near a Parisian Boulevard she would be passing her days on the skirts at least of the gay world and catching stray wafts from those town pleasures she was so well fitted to enjoy Yet Yeobright was as firm in the contrary intention as if the tendency of marriage were rather to develop the fantasies of young philanthropy than to sweep them away Her anxiety reached a high pitch but there was something in Clym s undeviating manner which made her hesitate before sounding him on the subject At this point in their experience however an incident helped her It occurred one evening about six weeks after their union and arose entirely out of the unconscious misapplication of Venn of the fifty guineas intended for Yeobright A day or two after the receipt of the money Thomasin had sent a note to her aunt to thank her She had been surprised at the largeness of the amount but as no sum had ever been mentioned she set that down to her late uncle s generosity She had been strictly charged by her aunt to say nothing to her husband of this gift and Wildeve as was natural enough had not brought himself to mention to his wife a single particular of the midnight scene in the heath Christian s terror in like manner had tied his tongue on the share he took in that proceeding and hoping that by some means or other the money had gone to its proper destination he simply asserted as much without giving details Therefore when a week or two had passed away missus Yeobright began to wonder why she never heard from her son of the receipt of the present and to add gloom to her perplexity came the possibility that resentment might be the cause of his silence She could hardly believe as much but why did he not write She questioned Christian and the confusion in his answers would at once have led her to believe that something was wrong had not one half of his story been corroborated by Thomasin s note missus Yeobright was in this state of uncertainty when she was informed one morning that her son s wife was visiting her grandfather at Mistover She determined to walk up the hill see Eustacia and ascertain from her daughter in law s lips whether the family guineas which were to missus Yeobright what family jewels are to wealthier dowagers had miscarried or not When Christian learnt where she was going his concern reached its height At the moment of her departure he could prevaricate no longer and confessing to the gambling told her the truth as far as he knew it that the guineas had been won by Wildeve What is he going to keep them missus Yeobright cried I hope and trust not moaned Christian He s a good man and perhaps will do right things He said you ought to have gied mister Clym s share to Eustacia and that s perhaps what he ll do himself To missus Yeobright as soon as she could calmly reflect there was much likelihood in this for she could hardly believe that Wildeve would really appropriate money belonging to her son The intermediate course of giving it to Eustacia was the sort of thing to please Wildeve s fancy But it filled the mother with anger none the less That Wildeve should have got command of the guineas after all and should rearrange the disposal of them placing Clym s share in Clym s wife s hands because she had been his own sweetheart and might be so still was as irritating a pain as any that missus Yeobright had ever borne She instantly dismissed the wretched Christian from her employ for his conduct in the affair but feeling quite helpless and unable to do without him told him afterwards that he might stay a little longer if he chose Then she hastened off to Eustacia moved by a much less promising emotion towards her daughter in law than she had felt half an hour earlier when planning her journey At that time it was to inquire in a friendly spirit if there had been any accidental loss now it was to ask plainly if Wildeve had privately given her money which had been intended as a sacred gift to Clym She started at two o clock and her meeting with Eustacia was hastened by the appearance of the young lady beside the pool and bank which bordered her grandfather s premises where she stood surveying the scene and perhaps thinking of the romantic enactments it had witnessed in past days When missus Yeobright approached Eustacia surveyed her with the calm stare of a stranger The mother in law was the first to speak I was coming to see you she said Indeed said Eustacia with surprise for missus Yeobright much to the girl s mortification had refused to be present at the wedding I did not at all expect you I was coming on business only said the visitor more coldly than at first Will you excuse my asking this Have you received a gift from Thomasin s husband A gift I mean money What I myself Well I meant yourself privately though I was not going to put it in that way Money from mister Wildeve No never Madam what do you mean by that Eustacia fired up all too quickly for her own consciousness of the old attachment between herself and Wildeve led her to jump to the conclusion that missus Yeobright also knew of it and might have come to accuse her of receiving dishonourable presents from him now I simply ask the question said missus Yeobright I have been You ought to have better opinions of me I feared you were against me from the first exclaimed Eustacia No I was simply for Clym replied missus Yeobright with too much emphasis in her earnestness It is the instinct of everyone to look after their own How can you imply that he required guarding against me cried Eustacia passionate tears in her eyes I have not injured him by marrying him What sin have I done that you should think so ill of me You had no right to speak against me to him when I have never wronged you I only did what was fair under the circumstances said missus Yeobright more softly I would rather not have gone into this question at present but you compel me I am not ashamed to tell you the honest truth I was firmly convinced that he ought not to marry you therefore I tried to dissuade him by all the means in my power But it is done now and I have no idea of complaining any more I am ready to welcome you Ah yes it is very well to see things in that business point of view murmured Eustacia with a smothered fire of feeling But why should you think there is anything between me and mister Wildeve I have a spirit as well as you I am indignant and so would any woman be It was a condescension in me to be Clym s wife and not a manoeuvre let me remind you and therefore I will not be treated as a schemer whom it becomes necessary to bear with because she has crept into the family Oh said missus Yeobright vainly endeavouring to control her anger I have never heard anything to show that my son s lineage is not as good as the Vyes perhaps better It is amusing to hear you talk of condescension It was condescension nevertheless said Eustacia vehemently And if I had known then what I know now that I should be living in this wild heath a month after my marriage I I should have thought twice before agreeing It would be better not to say that it might not sound truthful I am not aware that any deception was used on his part I know there was not whatever might have been the case on the other side This is too exasperating answered the younger woman huskily her face crimsoning and her eyes darting light How can you dare to speak to me like that I insist upon repeating to you that had I known that my life would from my marriage up to this time have been as it is I should have said NO I don t complain I have never uttered a sound of such a thing to him but it is true I hope therefore that in the future you will be silent on my eagerness If you injure me now you injure yourself Injure you Do you think I am an evil disposed person You injured me before my marriage and you have now suspected me of secretly favouring another man for money I could not help what I thought But I have never spoken of you outside my house You spoke of me within it to Clym and you could not do worse I did my duty And I ll do mine A part of which will possibly be to set him against his mother It is always so But why should I not bear it as others have borne it before me I understand you said Eustacia breathless with emotion You think me capable of every bad thing Who can be worse than a wife who encourages a lover and poisons her husband s mind against his relative Yet that is now the character given to me Will you not come and drag him out of my hands missus Yeobright gave back heat for heat Don t rage at me madam It ill becomes your beauty and I am not worth the injury you may do it on my account I assure you I am only a poor old woman who has lost a son If you had treated me honourably you would have had him still Eustacia said while scalding tears trickled from her eyes You have brought yourself to folly you have caused a division which can never be healed I have done nothing This audacity from a young woman is more than I can bear It was asked for you have suspected me and you have made me speak of my husband in a way I would not have done You will let him know that I have spoken thus and it will cause misery between us Will you go away from me You are no friend I will go when I have spoken a word If anyone says I have come here to question you without good grounds for it that person speaks untruly If anyone says that I attempted to stop your marriage by any but honest means that person too does not speak the truth I have fallen on an evil time God has been unjust to me in letting you insult me Probably my son s happiness does not lie on this side of the grave for he is a foolish man who neglects the advice of his parent You Eustacia stand on the edge of a precipice without knowing it Only show my son one half the temper you have shown me today and you may before long and you will find that though he is as gentle as a child with you now he can be as hard as steel The excited mother then withdrew and Eustacia panting stood looking into the pool two He Is Set upon by Adversities but He Sings a Song The result of that unpropitious interview was that Eustacia instead of passing the afternoon with her grandfather hastily returned home to Clym where she arrived three hours earlier than she had been expected She came indoors with her face flushed and her eyes still showing traces of her recent excitement Yeobright looked up astonished he had never seen her in any way approaching to that state before She passed him by and would have gone upstairs unnoticed but Clym was so concerned that he immediately followed her What is the matter Eustacia he said She was standing on the hearthrug in the bedroom looking upon the floor her hands clasped in front of her her bonnet yet unremoved For a moment she did not answer and then she replied in a low voice I have seen your mother and I will never see her again A weight fell like a stone upon Clym That same morning when Eustacia had arranged to go and see her grandfather Clym had expressed a wish that she would drive down to Blooms End and inquire for her mother in law or adopt any other means she might think fit to bring about a reconciliation She had set out gaily and he had hoped for much Why is this he asked I cannot tell I cannot remember I met your mother And I will never meet her again Why What do I know about mister Wildeve now I won t have wicked opinions passed on me by anybody O it was too humiliating to be asked if I had received any money from him or encouraged him or something of the sort I don t exactly know what How could she have asked you that She did Then there must have been some meaning in it What did my mother say besides I don t know what she said except in so far as this that we both said words which can never be forgiven Oh there must be some misapprehension Whose fault was it that her meaning was not made clear I would rather not say It may have been the fault of the circumstances which were awkward at the very least O Clym I cannot help expressing it this is an unpleasant position that you have placed me in But you must improve it yes say you will for I hate it all now Yes take me to Paris and go on with your old occupation Clym I don t mind how humbly we live there at first if it can only be Paris and not Egdon Heath But I have quite given up that idea said Yeobright with surprise Surely I never led you to expect such a thing I own it Yet there are thoughts which cannot be kept out of mind and that one was mine Must I not have a voice in the matter now I am your wife and the sharer of your doom Well there are things which are placed beyond the pale of discussion and I thought this was specially so and by mutual agreement Clym I am unhappy at what I hear she said in a low voice and her eyes drooped and she turned away This indication of an unexpected mine of hope in Eustacia s bosom disconcerted her husband It was the first time that he had confronted the fact of the indirectness of a woman s movement towards her desire But his intention was unshaken though he loved Eustacia well All the effect that her remark had upon him was a resolve to chain himself more closely than ever to his books so as to be the sooner enabled to appeal to substantial results from another course in arguing against her whim Next day the mystery of the guineas was explained Thomasin paid them a hurried visit and Clym s share was delivered up to him by her own hands Eustacia was not present at the time Then this is what my mother meant exclaimed Clym Thomasin do you know that they have had a bitter quarrel There was a little more reticence now than formerly in Thomasin s manner towards her cousin It is the effect of marriage to engender in several directions some of the reserve it annihilates in one Your mother told me she said quietly She came back to my house after seeing Eustacia The worst thing I dreaded has come to pass Was Mother much disturbed when she came to you Thomasin Yes Very much indeed Yes Clym leant his elbow upon the post of the garden gate and covered his eyes with his hand Don t trouble about it Clym They may get to be friends He shook his head Not two people with inflammable natures like theirs Well what must be will be One thing is cheerful in it the guineas are not lost I would rather have lost them twice over than have had this happen Amid these jarring events Yeobright felt one thing to be indispensable that he should speedily make some show of progress in his scholastic plans With this view he read far into the small hours during many nights One morning after a severer strain than usual he awoke with a strange sensation in his eyes The sun was shining directly upon the window blind and at his first glance thitherward a sharp pain obliged him to close his eyelids quickly At every new attempt to look about him the same morbid sensibility to light was manifested and excoriating tears ran down his cheeks He was obliged to tie a bandage over his brow while dressing and during the day it could not be abandoned Eustacia was thoroughly alarmed On finding that the case was no better the next morning they decided to send to Anglebury for a surgeon Towards evening he arrived and pronounced the disease to be acute inflammation induced by Clym s night studies continued in spite of a cold previously caught which had weakened his eyes for the time Fretting with impatience at this interruption to a task he was so anxious to hasten Clym was transformed into an invalid He was shut up in a room from which all light was excluded and his condition would have been one of absolute misery had not Eustacia read to him by the glimmer of a shaded lamp He hoped that the worst would soon be over but at the surgeon s third visit he learnt to his dismay that although he might venture out of doors with shaded eyes in the course of a month all thought of pursuing his work or of reading print of any description would have to be given up for a long time to come One week and another week wore on and nothing seemed to lighten the gloom of the young couple Dreadful imaginings occurred to Eustacia but she carefully refrained from uttering them to her husband Suppose he should become blind or at all events never recover sufficient strength of sight to engage in an occupation which would be congenial to her feelings and conduce to her removal from this lonely dwelling among the hills That dream of beautiful Paris was not likely to cohere into substance in the presence of this misfortune As day after day passed by and he got no better her mind ran more and more in this mournful groove and she would go away from him into the garden and weep despairing tears Yeobright thought he would send for his mother and then he thought he would not Knowledge of his state could only make her the more unhappy and the seclusion of their life was such that she would hardly be likely to learn the news except through a special messenger Endeavouring to take the trouble as philosophically as possible he waited on till the third week had arrived when he went into the open air for the first time since the attack The surgeon visited him again at this stage and Clym urged him to express a distinct opinion The young man learnt with added surprise that the date at which he might expect to resume his labours was as uncertain as ever his eyes being in that peculiar state which though affording him sight enough for walking about would not admit of their being strained upon any definite object without incurring the risk of reproducing ophthalmia in its acute form Clym was very grave at the intelligence but not despairing A quiet firmness and even cheerfulness took possession of him He was not to be blind that was enough To be doomed to behold the world through smoked glass for an indefinite period was bad enough and fatal to any kind of advance but Yeobright was an absolute stoic in the face of mishaps which only affected his social standing and apart from Eustacia the humblest walk of life would satisfy him if it could be made to work in with some form of his culture scheme To keep a cottage night school was one such form and his affliction did not master his spirit as it might otherwise have done He walked through the warm sun westward into those tracts of Egdon with which he was best acquainted being those lying nearer to his old home He saw before him in one of the valleys the gleaming of whetted iron and advancing dimly perceived that the shine came from the tool of a man who was cutting furze The worker recognized Clym and Yeobright learnt from the voice that the speaker was Humphrey Humphrey expressed his sorrow at Clym s condition and added Now if yours was low class work like mine you could go on with it just the same Yes I could said Yeobright musingly How much do you get for cutting these faggots Half a crown a hundred and in these long days I can live very well on the wages During the whole of Yeobright s walk home to Alderworth he was lost in reflections which were not of an unpleasant kind On his coming up to the house Eustacia spoke to him from the open window and he went across to her Darling he said I am much happier And if my mother were reconciled to me and to you I should I think be happy quite I fear that will never be she said looking afar with her beautiful stormy eyes How CAN you say I am happier and nothing changed It arises from my having at last discovered something I can do and get a living at in this time of misfortune Yes I am going to be a furze and turf cutter No Clym she said the slight hopefulness previously apparent in her face going off again and leaving her worse than before Surely I shall Is it not very unwise in us to go on spending the little money we ve got when I can keep down expenditures by an honest occupation The outdoor exercise will do me good and who knows but that in a few months I shall be able to go on with my reading again But my grandfather offers to assist us if we require assistance We don t require it If I go furze cutting we shall be fairly well off In comparison with slaves and the Israelites in Egypt and such people A bitter tear rolled down Eustacia s face which he did not see There had been nonchalance in his tone showing her that he felt no absolute grief at a consummation which to her was a positive horror The very next day Yeobright went to Humphrey s cottage and borrowed of him leggings gloves a whetstone and a hook to use till he should be able to purchase some for himself Then he sallied forth with his new fellow labourer and old acquaintance and selecting a spot where the furze grew thickest he struck the first blow in his adopted calling His sight like the wings in Rasselas though useless to him for his grand purpose sufficed for this strait and he found that when a little practice should have hardened his palms against blistering he would be able to work with ease Day after day he rose with the sun buckled on his leggings and went off to the rendezvous with Humphrey His custom was to work from four o clock in the morning till noon then when the heat of the day was at its highest to go home and sleep for an hour or two afterwards coming out again and working till dusk at nine This man from Paris was now so disguised by his leather accoutrements and by the goggles he was obliged to wear over his eyes that his closest friend might have passed by without recognizing him He was a brown spot in the midst of an expanse of olive green gorse and nothing more Though frequently depressed in spirit when not actually at work owing to thoughts of Eustacia s position and his mother s estrangement when in the full swing of labour he was cheerfully disposed and calm His daily life was of a curious microscopic sort his whole world being limited to a circuit of a few feet from his person His familiars were creeping and winged things and they seemed to enroll him in their band Bees hummed around his ears with an intimate air and tugged at the heath and furze flowers at his side in such numbers as to weigh them down to the sod The strange amber coloured butterflies which Egdon produced and which were never seen elsewhere quivered in the breath of his lips alighted upon his bowed back and sported with the glittering point of his hook as he flourished it up and down Tribes of emerald green grasshoppers leaped over his feet falling awkwardly on their backs heads or hips like unskilful acrobats as chance might rule or engaged themselves in noisy flirtations under the fern fronds with silent ones of homely hue Huge flies ignorant of larders and wire netting and quite in a savage state buzzed about him without knowing that he was a man In and out of the fern dells snakes glided in their most brilliant blue and yellow guise it being the season immediately following the shedding of their old skins when their colours are brightest Litters of young rabbits came out from their forms to sun themselves upon hillocks the hot beams blazing through the delicate tissue of each thin fleshed ear and firing it to a blood red transparency in which the veins could be seen None of them feared him The monotony of his occupation soothed him and was in itself a pleasure A forced limitation of effort offered a justification of homely courses to an unambitious man whose conscience would hardly have allowed him to remain in such obscurity while his powers were unimpeded Hence Yeobright sometimes sang to himself and when obliged to accompany Humphrey in search of brambles for faggot bonds he would amuse his companion with sketches of Parisian life and character and so while away the time On one of these warm afternoons Eustacia walked out alone in the direction of Yeobright s place of work He was busily chopping away at the furze a long row of faggots which stretched downward from his position representing the labour of the day He did not observe her approach and she stood close to him and heard his undercurrent of song It shocked her To see him there a poor afflicted man earning money by the sweat of his brow had at first moved her to tears but to hear him sing and not at all rebel against an occupation which however satisfactory to himself was degrading to her as an educated lady wife wounded her through Unconscious of her presence he still went on singing Le point du jour A nos bosquets rend toute leur parure Flore est plus belle a son retour L oiseau reprend doux chant d amour Tout celebre dans la nature Le point du jour Le point du jour Cause parfois cause douleur extreme Que l espace des nuits est court Pour le berger brulant d amour Force de quitter ce qu il aime Au point du jour It was bitterly plain to Eustacia that he did not care much about social failure and the proud fair woman bowed her head and wept in sick despair at thought of the blasting effect upon her own life of that mood and condition in him Then she came forward I would starve rather than do it she exclaimed vehemently And you can sing I will go and live with my grandfather again Eustacia I did not see you though I noticed something moving he said gently He came forward pulled off his huge leather glove and took her hand Why do you speak in such a strange way It is only a little old song which struck my fancy when I was in Paris and now just applies to my life with you Has your love for me all died then because my appearance is no longer that of a fine gentleman Dearest you must not question me unpleasantly or it may make me not love you Do you believe it possible that I would run the risk of doing that Well you follow out your own ideas and won t give in to mine when I wish you to leave off this shameful labour Is there anything you dislike in me that you act so contrarily to my wishes I am your wife and why will you not listen Yes I am your wife indeed I know what that tone means What tone The tone in which you said Your wife indeed It meant Your wife worse luck It is hard in you to probe me with that remark A woman may have reason though she is not without heart and if I felt worse luck it was no ignoble feeling it was only too natural There you see that at any rate I do not attempt untruths Do you remember how before we were married I warned you that I had not good wifely qualities You mock me to say that now On that point at least the only noble course would be to hold your tongue for you are still queen of me Eustacia though I may no longer be king of you You are my husband Does not that content you Not unless you are my wife without regret I cannot answer you I remember saying that I should be a serious matter on your hands Yes I saw that Then you were too quick to see No true lover would have seen any such thing you are too severe upon me Clym I won t like your speaking so at all Well I married you in spite of it and don t regret doing so How cold you seem this afternoon and yet I used to think there never was a warmer heart than yours Yes I fear we are cooling I see it as well as you she sighed mournfully And how madly we loved two months ago You were never tired of contemplating me nor I of contemplating you Who could have thought then that by this time my eyes would not seem so very bright to yours nor your lips so very sweet to mine Two months is it possible Yes tis too true You sigh dear as if you were sorry for it and that s a hopeful sign No I don t sigh for that There are other things for me to sigh for or any other woman in my place That your chances in life are ruined by marrying in haste an unfortunate man Why will you force me Clym to say bitter things I deserve pity as much as you As much I think I deserve it more For you can sing It would be a strange hour which should catch me singing under such a cloud as this Believe me sweet I could weep to a degree that would astonish and confound such an elastic mind as yours Even had you felt careless about your own affliction you might have refrained from singing out of sheer pity for mine God if I were a man in such a position I would curse rather than sing Yeobright placed his hand upon her arm Now don t you suppose my inexperienced girl that I cannot rebel in high Promethean fashion against the gods and fate as well as you I have felt more steam and smoke of that sort than you have ever heard of But the more I see of life the more do I perceive that there is nothing particularly great in its greatest walks and therefore nothing particularly small in mine of furze cutting If I feel that the greatest blessings vouchsafed to us are not very valuable how can I feel it to be any great hardship when they are taken away So I sing to pass the time Have you indeed lost all tenderness for me that you begrudge me a few cheerful moments I have still some tenderness left for you Your words have no longer their old flavour And so love dies with good fortune I cannot listen to this Clym it will end bitterly she said in a broken voice I will go home three She Goes Out to Battle against Depression A few days later before the month of August has expired Eustacia and Yeobright sat together at their early dinner Eustacia s manner had become of late almost apathetic There was a forlorn look about her beautiful eyes which whether she deserved it or not would have excited pity in the breast of anyone who had known her during the full flush of her love for Clym The feelings of husband and wife varied in some measure inversely with their positions Clym the afflicted man was cheerful and he even tried to comfort her who had never felt a moment of physical suffering in her whole life Come brighten up dearest we shall be all right again Some day perhaps I shall see as well as ever And I solemnly promise that I ll leave off cutting furze as soon as I have the power to do anything better You cannot seriously wish me to stay idling at home all day But it is so dreadful a furze cutter and you a man who have lived about the world and speak French and German and who are fit for what is so much better than this I suppose when you first saw me and heard about me I was wrapped in a sort of golden halo to your eyes a man who knew glorious things and had mixed in brilliant scenes in short an adorable delightful distracting hero Yes she said sobbing And now I am a poor fellow in brown leather Don t taunt me But enough of this I will not be depressed any more I am going from home this afternoon unless you greatly object There is to be a village picnic a gipsying they call it at East Egdon and I shall go To dance Why not You can sing Well well as you will Must I come to fetch you If you return soon enough from your work But do not inconvenience yourself about it I know the way home and the heath has no terror for me And can you cling to gaiety so eagerly as to walk all the way to a village festival in search of it Now you don t like my going alone Clym you are not jealous No But I would come with you if it could give you any pleasure though as things stand perhaps you have too much of me already Still I somehow wish that you did not want to go Yes perhaps I am jealous and who could be jealous with more reason than I a half blind man over such a woman as you Don t think like it Let me go and don t take all my spirits away I would rather lose all my own my sweet wife Go and do whatever you like Who can forbid your indulgence in any whim You have all my heart yet I believe and because you bear with me who am in truth a drag upon you I owe you thanks Yes go alone and shine As for me I will stick to my doom At that kind of meeting people would shun me My hook and gloves are like the saint Lazarus rattle of the leper warning the world to get out of the way of a sight that would sadden them He kissed her put on his leggings and went out When he was gone she rested her head upon her hands and said to herself Two wasted lives his and mine And I am come to this Will it drive me out of my mind She cast about for any possible course which offered the least improvement on the existing state of things and could find none She imagined how all those Budmouth ones who should learn what had become of her would say Look at the girl for whom nobody was good enough To Eustacia the situation seemed such a mockery of her hopes that death appeared the only door of relief if the satire of Heaven should go much further Suddenly she aroused herself and exclaimed But I ll shake it off Yes I WILL shake it off No one shall know my suffering I ll be bitterly merry and ironically gay and I ll laugh in derision And I ll begin by going to this dance on the green She ascended to her bedroom and dressed herself with scrupulous care To an onlooker her beauty would have made her feelings almost seem reasonable The gloomy corner into which accident as much as indiscretion had brought this woman might have led even a moderate partisan to feel that she had cogent reasons for asking the Supreme Power by what right a being of such exquisite finish had been placed in circumstances calculated to make of her charms a curse rather than a blessing It was five in the afternoon when she came out from the house ready for her walk There was material enough in the picture for twenty new conquests The rebellious sadness that was rather too apparent when she sat indoors without a bonnet was cloaked and softened by her outdoor attire which always had a sort of nebulousness about it devoid of harsh edges anywhere so that her face looked from its environment as from a cloud with no noticeable lines of demarcation between flesh and clothes The heat of the day had scarcely declined as yet and she went along the sunny hills at a leisurely pace there being ample time for her idle expedition Tall ferns buried her in their leafage whenever her path lay through them which now formed miniature forests though not one stem of them would remain to bud the next year The site chosen for the village festivity was one of the lawnlike oases which were occasionally yet not often met with on the plateaux of the heath district The brakes of furze and fern terminated abruptly round the margin and the grass was unbroken A green cattletrack skirted the spot without however emerging from the screen of fern and this path Eustacia followed in order to reconnoitre the group before joining it The lusty notes of the East Egdon band had directed her unerringly and she now beheld the musicians themselves sitting in a blue wagon with red wheels scrubbed as bright as new and arched with sticks to which boughs and flowers were tied In front of this was the grand central dance of fifteen or twenty couples flanked by minor dances of inferior individuals whose gyrations were not always in strict keeping with the tune The young men wore blue and white rosettes and with a flush on their faces footed it to the girls who with the excitement and the exercise blushed deeper than the pink of their numerous ribbons Fair ones with long curls fair ones with short curls fair ones with lovelocks fair ones with braids flew round and round and a beholder might well have wondered how such a prepossessing set of young women of like size age and disposition could have been collected together where there were only one or two villages to choose from In the background was one happy man dancing by himself with closed eyes totally oblivious of all the rest A fire was burning under a pollard thorn a few paces off over which three kettles hung in a row Hard by was a table where elderly dames prepared tea but Eustacia looked among them in vain for the cattle dealer s wife who had suggested that she should come and had promised to obtain a courteous welcome for her This unexpected absence of the only local resident whom Eustacia knew considerably damaged her scheme for an afternoon of reckless gaiety Joining in became a matter of difficulty notwithstanding that were she to advance cheerful dames would come forward with cups of tea and make much of her as a stranger of superior grace and knowledge to themselves Having watched the company through the figures of two dances she decided to walk a little further to a cottage where she might get some refreshment and then return homeward in the shady time of evening This she did and by the time that she retraced her steps towards the scene of the gipsying which it was necessary to repass on her way to Alderworth the sun was going down The air was now so still that she could hear the band afar off and it seemed to be playing with more spirit if that were possible than when she had come away On reaching the hill the sun had quite disappeared but this made little difference either to Eustacia or to the revellers for a round yellow moon was rising before her though its rays had not yet outmastered those from the west The dance was going on just the same but strangers had arrived and formed a ring around the figure so that Eustacia could stand among these without a chance of being recognized A whole village full of sensuous emotion scattered abroad all the year long surged here in a focus for an hour The forty hearts of those waving couples were beating as they had not done since twelve months before they had come together in similar jollity For the time paganism was revived in their hearts the pride of life was all in all and they adored none other than themselves How many of those impassioned but temporary embraces were destined to become perpetual was possibly the wonder of some of those who indulged in them as well as of Eustacia who looked on She began to envy those pirouetters to hunger for the hope and happiness which the fascination of the dance seemed to engender within them Desperately fond of dancing herself one of Eustacia s expectations of Paris had been the opportunity it might afford her of indulgence in this favourite pastime Unhappily that expectation was now extinct within her for ever Whilst she abstractedly watched them spinning and fluctuating in the increasing moonlight she suddenly heard her name whispered by a voice over her shoulder Turning in surprise she beheld at her elbow one whose presence instantly caused her to flush to the temples It was Wildeve Till this moment he had not met her eye since the morning of his marriage when she had been loitering in the church and had startled him by lifting her veil and coming forward to sign the register as witness Yet why the sight of him should have instigated that sudden rush of blood she could not tell Before she could speak he whispered Do you like dancing as much as ever I think I do she replied in a low voice Will you dance with me It would be a great change for me but will it not seem strange What strangeness can there be in relations dancing together Ah yes relations Perhaps none Still if you don t like to be seen pull down your veil though there is not much risk of being known by this light Lots of strangers are here She did as he suggested and the act was a tacit acknowledgment that she accepted his offer Wildeve gave her his arm and took her down on the outside of the ring to the bottom of the dance which they entered In two minutes more they were involved in the figure and began working their way upwards to the top Till they had advanced halfway thither Eustacia wished more than once that she had not yielded to his request from the middle to the top she felt that since she had come out to seek pleasure she was only doing a natural thing to obtain it Fairly launched into the ceaseless glides and whirls which their new position as top couple opened up to them Eustacia s pulses began to move too quickly for long rumination of any kind Through the length of five and twenty couples they threaded their giddy way and a new vitality entered her form The pale ray of evening lent a fascination to the experience There is a certain degree and tone of light which tends to disturb the equilibrium of the senses and to promote dangerously the tenderer moods added to movement it drives the emotions to rankness the reason becoming sleepy and unperceiving in inverse proportion and this light fell now upon these two from the disc of the moon All the dancing girls felt the symptoms but Eustacia most of all The grass under their feet became trodden away and the hard beaten surface of the sod when viewed aslant towards the moonlight shone like a polished table The air became quite still the flag above the wagon which held the musicians clung to the pole and the players appeared only in outline against the sky except when the circular mouths of the trombone ophicleide and French horn gleamed out like huge eyes from the shade of their figures The pretty dresses of the maids lost their subtler day colours and showed more or less of a misty white Eustacia floated round and round on Wildeve s arm her face rapt and statuesque her soul had passed away from and forgotten her features which were left empty and quiescent as they always are when feeling goes beyond their register How near she was to Wildeve it was terrible to think of She could feel his breathing and he of course could feel hers How badly she had treated him yet here they were treading one measure The enchantment of the dance surprised her A clear line of difference divided like a tangible fence her experience within this maze of motion from her experience without it Her beginning to dance had been like a change of atmosphere outside she had been steeped in arctic frigidity by comparison with the tropical sensations here She had entered the dance from the troubled hours of her late life as one might enter a brilliant chamber after a night walk in a wood Wildeve by himself would have been merely an agitation Wildeve added to the dance and the moonlight and the secrecy began to be a delight Whether his personality supplied the greater part of this sweetly compounded feeling or whether the dance and the scene weighed the more therein was a nice point upon which Eustacia herself was entirely in a cloud People began to say Who are they but no invidious inquiries were made Had Eustacia mingled with the other girls in their ordinary daily walks the case would have been different here she was not inconvenienced by excessive inspection for all were wrought to their brightest grace by the occasion Like the planet Mercury surrounded by the lustre of sunset her permanent brilliancy passed without much notice in the temporary glory of the situation As for Wildeve his feelings are easy to guess Obstacles were a ripening sun to his love and he was at this moment in a delirium of exquisite misery To clasp as his for five minutes what was another man s through all the rest of the year was a kind of thing he of all men could appreciate He had long since begun to sigh again for Eustacia indeed it may be asserted that signing the marriage register with Thomasin was the natural signal to his heart to return to its first quarters and that the extra complication of Eustacia s marriage was the one addition required to make that return compulsory Thus for different reasons what was to the rest an exhilarating movement was to these two a riding upon the whirlwind The dance had come like an irresistible attack upon whatever sense of social order there was in their minds to drive them back into old paths which were now doubly irregular Through three dances in succession they spun their way and then fatigued with the incessant motion Eustacia turned to quit the circle in which she had already remained too long Wildeve led her to a grassy mound a few yards distant where she sat down her partner standing beside her From the time that he addressed her at the beginning of the dance till now they had not exchanged a word The dance and the walking have tired you he said tenderly No not greatly It is strange that we should have met here of all places after missing each other so long We have missed because we tried to miss I suppose Yes But you began that proceeding by breaking a promise It is scarcely worth while to talk of that now We have formed other ties since then you no less than I I am sorry to hear that your husband is ill He is not ill only incapacitated Yes that is what I mean I sincerely sympathize with you in your trouble Fate has treated you cruelly She was silent awhile Have you heard that he has chosen to work as a furze cutter she said in a low mournful voice It has been mentioned to me answered Wildeve hesitatingly But I hardly believed it It is true What do you think of me as a furze cutter s wife I think the same as ever of you Eustacia Nothing of that sort can degrade you you ennoble the occupation of your husband I wish I could feel it Is there any chance of mister Yeobright getting better He thinks so I doubt it I was quite surprised to hear that he had taken a cottage I thought in common with other people that he would have taken you off to a home in Paris immediately after you had married him What a gay bright future she has before her I thought He will I suppose return there with you if his sight gets strong again Observing that she did not reply he regarded her more closely She was almost weeping Images of a future never to be enjoyed the revived sense of her bitter disappointment the picture of the neighbour s suspended ridicule which was raised by Wildeve s words had been too much for proud Eustacia s equanimity Wildeve could hardly control his own too forward feelings when he saw her silent perturbation But he affected not to notice this and she soon recovered her calmness You do not intend to walk home by yourself he asked O yes said Eustacia What could hurt me on this heath who have nothing By diverging a little I can make my way home the same as yours I shall be glad to keep you company as far as Throope Corner Seeing that Eustacia sat on in hesitation he added Perhaps you think it unwise to be seen in the same road with me after the events of last summer Indeed I think no such thing she said haughtily I shall accept whose company I choose for all that may be said by the miserable inhabitants of Egdon Then let us walk on if you are ready Our nearest way is towards that holly bush with the dark shadow that you see down there Eustacia arose and walked beside him in the direction signified brushing her way over the damping heath and fern and followed by the strains of the merrymakers who still kept up the dance The moon had now waxed bright and silvery but the heath was proof against such illumination and there was to be observed the striking scene of a dark rayless tract of country under an atmosphere charged from its zenith to its extremities with whitest light To an eye above them their two faces would have appeared amid the expanse like two pearls on a table of ebony On this account the irregularities of the path were not visible and Wildeve occasionally stumbled whilst Eustacia found it necessary to perform some graceful feats of balancing whenever a small tuft of heather or root of furze protruded itself through the grass of the narrow track and entangled her feet At these junctures in her progress a hand was invariably stretched forward to steady her holding her firmly until smooth ground was again reached when the hand was again withdrawn to a respectful distance They performed the journey for the most part in silence and drew near to Throope Corner a few hundred yards from which a short path branched away to Eustacia s house By degrees they discerned coming towards them a pair of human figures apparently of the male sex When they came a little nearer Eustacia broke the silence by saying One of those men is my husband He promised to come to meet me And the other is my greatest enemy said Wildeve It looks like Diggory Venn That is the man It is an awkward meeting said she but such is my fortune He knows too much about me unless he could know more and so prove to himself that what he now knows counts for nothing Well let it be you must deliver me up to them You will think twice before you direct me to do that Here is a man who has not forgotten an item in our meetings at Rainbarrow he is in company with your husband Which of them seeing us together here will believe that our meeting and dancing at the gipsy party was by chance Very well she whispered gloomily Leave me before they come up Wildeve bade her a tender farewell and plunged across the fern and furze Eustacia slowly walking on In two or three minutes she met her husband and his companion My journey ends here for tonight reddleman said Yeobright as soon as he perceived her I turn back with this lady Good night Good night mister Yeobright said Venn I hope to see you better soon The moonlight shone directly upon Venn s face as he spoke and revealed all its lines to Eustacia He was looking suspiciously at her That Venn s keen eye had discerned what Yeobright s feeble vision had not a man in the act of withdrawing from Eustacia s side was within the limits of the probable If Eustacia had been able to follow the reddleman she would soon have found striking confirmation of her thought No sooner had Clym given her his arm and led her off the scene than the reddleman turned back from the beaten track towards East Egdon whither he had been strolling merely to accompany Clym in his walk Diggory s van being again in the neighbourhood Stretching out his long legs he crossed the pathless portion of the heath somewhat in the direction which Wildeve had taken Only a man accustomed to nocturnal rambles could at this hour have descended those shaggy slopes with Venn s velocity without falling headlong into a pit or snapping off his leg by jamming his foot into some rabbit burrow But Venn went on without much inconvenience to himself and the course of his scamper was towards the Quiet Woman Inn This place he reached in about half an hour and he was well aware that no person who had been near Throope Corner when he started could have got down here before him The lonely inn was not yet closed though scarcely an individual was there the business done being chiefly with travellers who passed the inn on long journeys and these had now gone on their way Venn went to the public room called for a mug of ale and inquired of the maid in an indifferent tone if mister Wildeve was at home Thomasin sat in an inner room and heard Venn s voice When customers were present she seldom showed herself owing to her inherent dislike for the business but perceiving that no one else was there tonight she came out He is not at home yet Diggory she said pleasantly But I expected him sooner He has been to East Egdon to buy a horse Did he wear a light wideawake Yes Then I saw him at Throope Corner leading one home said Venn drily A beauty with a white face and a mane as black as night He will soon be here no doubt Rising and looking for a moment at the pure sweet face of Thomasin over which a shadow of sadness had passed since the time when he had last seen her he ventured to add mister Wildeve seems to be often away at this time O yes cried Thomasin in what was intended to be a tone of gaiety Husbands will play the truant you know I wish you could tell me of some secret plan that would help me to keep him home at my will in the evenings I will consider if I know of one replied Venn in that same light tone which meant no lightness And then he bowed in a manner of his own invention and moved to go Thomasin offered him her hand and without a sigh though with food for many the reddleman went out When Wildeve returned a quarter of an hour later Thomasin said simply and in the abashed manner usual with her now Where is the horse Damon O I have not bought it after all The man asks too much But somebody saw you at Throope Corner leading it home a beauty with a white face and a mane as black as night Ah said Wildeve fixing his eyes upon her who told you that Venn the reddleman The expression of Wildeve s face became curiously condensed That is a mistake it must have been someone else he said slowly and testily for he perceived that Venn s countermoves had begun again four Rough Coercion Is Employed Those words of Thomasin which seemed so little but meant so much remained in the ears of Diggory Venn Help me to keep him home in the evenings On this occasion Venn had arrived on Egdon Heath only to cross to the other side he had no further connection with the interests of the Yeobright family and he had a business of his own to attend to Yet he suddenly began to feel himself drifting into the old track of manoeuvring on Thomasin s account He sat in his van and considered From Thomasin s words and manner he had plainly gathered that Wildeve neglected her For whom could he neglect her if not for Eustacia Yet it was scarcely credible that things had come to such a head as to indicate that Eustacia systematically encouraged him Venn resolved to reconnoitre somewhat carefully the lonely road which led along the vale from Wildeve s dwelling to Clym s house at Alderworth At this time as has been seen Wildeve was quite innocent of any predetermined act of intrigue and except at the dance on the green he had not once met Eustacia since her marriage But that the spirit of intrigue was in him had been shown by a recent romantic habit of his a habit of going out after dark and strolling towards Alderworth there looking at the moon and stars looking at Eustacia s house and walking back at leisure Accordingly when watching on the night after the festival the reddleman saw him ascend by the little path lean over the front gate of Clym s garden sigh and turn to go back again It was plain that Wildeve s intrigue was rather ideal than real Venn retreated before him down the hill to a place where the path was merely a deep groove between the heather here he mysteriously bent over the ground for a few minutes and retired When Wildeve came on to that spot his ankle was caught by something and he fell headlong As soon as he had recovered the power of respiration he sat up and listened There was not a sound in the gloom beyond the spiritless stir of the summer wind Feeling about for the obstacle which had flung him down he discovered that two tufts of heath had been tied together across the path forming a loop which to a traveller was certain overthrow Wildeve pulled off the string that bound them and went on with tolerable quickness On reaching home he found the cord to be of a reddish colour It was just what he had expected Although his weaknesses were not specially those akin to physical fear this species of coup de Jarnac from one he knew too well troubled the mind of Wildeve But his movements were unaltered thereby A night or two later he again went along the vale to Alderworth taking the precaution of keeping out of any path The sense that he was watched that craft was employed to circumvent his errant tastes added piquancy to a journey so entirely sentimental so long as the danger was of no fearful sort He imagined that Venn and missus Yeobright were in league and felt that there was a certain legitimacy in combating such a coalition The heath tonight appeared to be totally deserted and Wildeve after looking over Eustacia s garden gate for some little time with a cigar in his mouth was tempted by the fascination that emotional smuggling had for his nature to advance towards the window which was not quite closed the blind being only partly drawn down He could see into the room and Eustacia was sitting there alone Wildeve contemplated her for a minute and then retreating into the heath beat the ferns lightly whereupon moths flew out alarmed Securing one he returned to the window and holding the moth to the chink opened his hand The moth made towards the candle upon Eustacia s table hovered round it two or three times and flew into the flame Eustacia started up This had been a well known signal in old times when Wildeve had used to come secretly wooing to Mistover She at once knew that Wildeve was outside but before she could consider what to do her husband came in from upstairs Eustacia s face burnt crimson at the unexpected collision of incidents and filled it with an animation that it too frequently lacked You have a very high colour dearest said Yeobright when he came close enough to see it Your appearance would be no worse if it were always so I am warm said Eustacia I think I will go into the air for a few minutes Shall I go with you O no I am only going to the gate She arose but before she had time to get out of the room a loud rapping began upon the front door I ll go I ll go said Eustacia in an unusually quick tone for her and she glanced eagerly towards the window whence the moth had flown but nothing appeared there You had better not at this time of the evening he said Clym stepped before her into the passage and Eustacia waited her somnolent manner covering her inner heat and agitation She listened and Clym opened the door No words were uttered outside and presently he closed it and came back saying Nobody was there I wonder what that could have meant He was left to wonder during the rest of the evening for no explanation offered itself and Eustacia said nothing the additional fact that she knew of only adding more mystery to the performance Meanwhile a little drama had been acted outside which saved Eustacia from all possibility of compromising herself that evening at least Whilst Wildeve had been preparing his moth signal another person had come behind him up to the gate This man who carried a gun in his hand looked on for a moment at the other s operation by the window walked up to the house knocked at the door and then vanished round the corner and over the hedge Damn him said Wildeve He has been watching me again As his signal had been rendered futile by this uproarious rapping Wildeve withdrew passed out at the gate and walked quickly down the path without thinking of anything except getting away unnoticed Halfway down the hill the path ran near a knot of stunted hollies which in the general darkness of the scene stood as the pupil in a black eye When Wildeve reached this point a report startled his ear and a few spent gunshots fell among the leaves around him There was no doubt that he himself was the cause of that gun s discharge and he rushed into the clump of hollies beating the bushes furiously with his stick but nobody was there This attack was a more serious matter than the last and it was some time before Wildeve recovered his equanimity A new and most unpleasant system of menace had begun and the intent appeared to be to do him grievous bodily harm Wildeve had looked upon Venn s first attempt as a species of horseplay which the reddleman had indulged in for want of knowing better but now the boundary line was passed which divides the annoying from the perilous Had Wildeve known how thoroughly in earnest Venn had become he might have been still more alarmed The reddleman had been almost exasperated by the sight of Wildeve outside Clym s house and he was prepared to go to any lengths short of absolutely shooting him to terrify the young innkeeper out of his recalcitrant impulses The doubtful legitimacy of such rough coercion did not disturb the mind of Venn It troubles few such minds in such cases and sometimes this is not to be regretted From the impeachment of Strafford to Farmer Lynch s short way with the scamps of Virginia there have been many triumphs of justice which are mockeries of law About half a mile below Clym s secluded dwelling lay a hamlet where lived one of the two constables who preserved the peace in the parish of Alderworth and Wildeve went straight to the constable s cottage Almost the first thing that he saw on opening the door was the constable s truncheon hanging to a nail as if to assure him that here were the means to his purpose On inquiry however of the constable s wife he learnt that the constable was not at home Wildeve said he would wait The minutes ticked on and the constable did not arrive Wildeve cooled down from his state of high indignation to a restless dissatisfaction with himself the scene the constable s wife and the whole set of circumstances He arose and left the house Altogether the experience of that evening had had a cooling not to say a chilling effect on misdirected tenderness and Wildeve was in no mood to ramble again to Alderworth after nightfall in hope of a stray glance from Eustacia Thus far the reddleman had been tolerably successful in his rude contrivances for keeping down Wildeve s inclination to rove in the evening He had nipped in the bud the possible meeting between Eustacia and her old lover this very night But he had not anticipated that the tendency of his action would be to divert Wildeve s movement rather than to stop it The gambling with the guineas had not conduced to make him a welcome guest to Clym but to call upon his wife s relative was natural and he was determined to see Eustacia It was necessary to choose some less untoward hour than ten o clock at night Since it is unsafe to go in the evening he said I ll go by day Meanwhile Venn had left the heath and gone to call upon missus Yeobright with whom he had been on friendly terms since she had learnt what a providential countermove he had made towards the restitution of the family guineas She wondered at the lateness of his call but had no objection to see him He gave her a full account of Clym s affliction and of the state in which he was living then referring to Thomasin touched gently upon the apparent sadness of her days Now ma am depend upon it he said you couldn t do a better thing for either of em than to make yourself at home in their houses even if there should be a little rebuff at first Both she and my son disobeyed me in marrying therefore I have no interest in their households Their troubles are of their own making missus Yeobright tried to speak severely but the account of her son s state had moved her more than she cared to show Your visits would make Wildeve walk straighter than he is inclined to do and might prevent unhappiness down the heath What do you mean I saw something tonight out there which I didn t like at all I wish your son s house and mister Wildeve s were a hundred miles apart instead of four or five Then there WAS an understanding between him and Clym s wife when he made a fool of Thomasin We ll hope there s no understanding now And our hope will probably be very vain O Clym O Thomasin There s no harm done yet In fact I ve persuaded Wildeve to mind his own business How O not by talking by a plan of mine called the silent system I hope you ll succeed I shall if you help me by calling and making friends with your son You ll have a chance then of using your eyes Well since it has come to this said missus Yeobright sadly I will own to you reddleman that I thought of going I should be much happier if we were reconciled The marriage is unalterable my life may be cut short and I should wish to die in peace He is my only son and since sons are made of such stuff I am not sorry I have no other As for Thomasin I never expected much from her and she has not disappointed me But I forgave her long ago and I forgive him now I ll go At this very time of the reddleman s conversation with missus Yeobright at Blooms End another conversation on the same subject was languidly proceeding at Alderworth All the day Clym had borne himself as if his mind were too full of its own matter to allow him to care about outward things and his words now showed what had occupied his thoughts It was just after the mysterious knocking that he began the theme Since I have been away today Eustacia I have considered that something must be done to heal up this ghastly breach between my dear mother and myself It troubles me What do you propose to do said Eustacia abstractedly for she could not clear away from her the excitement caused by Wildeve s recent manoeuvre for an interview You seem to take a very mild interest in what I propose little or much said Clym with tolerable warmth You mistake me she answered reviving at his reproach I am only thinking What of Partly of that moth whose skeleton is getting burnt up in the wick of the candle she said slowly But you know I always take an interest in what you say Very well dear Then I think I must go and call upon her He went on with tender feeling It is a thing I am not at all too proud to do and only a fear that I might irritate her has kept me away so long But I must do something It is wrong in me to allow this sort of thing to go on What have you to blame yourself about She is getting old and her life is lonely and I am her only son She has Thomasin Thomasin is not her daughter and if she were that would not excuse me But this is beside the point I have made up my mind to go to her and all I wish to ask you is whether you will do your best to help me that is forget the past and if she shows her willingness to be reconciled meet her halfway by welcoming her to our house or by accepting a welcome to hers At first Eustacia closed her lips as if she would rather do anything on the whole globe than what he suggested But the lines of her mouth softened with thought though not so far as they might have softened and she said I will put nothing in your way but after what has passed it is asking too much that I go and make advances You never distinctly told me what did pass between you I could not do it then nor can I now Sometimes more bitterness is sown in five minutes than can be got rid of in a whole life and that may be the case here She paused a few moments and added If you had never returned to your native place Clym what a blessing it would have been for you It has altered the destinies of Three people Five Eustacia thought but she kept that in five

153-126671-0004	train-other-500	in conformity with her words to the reddleman She had hoped to be well advanced in her walk before the heat of the day was at its highest but after setting out she found that this was not to be done

153-126671-0019	train-other-500	They were evidently intended for furze faggot bonds which he meant to collect on his return The silent being who thus occupied himself seemed to be of no more account in life
153-126671-0020	train-other-500	than an insect He appeared as a mere parasite of the heath
none	none	 fretting its surface in his daily labour 
153-126671-0021	train-other-500	as a moth frets a garment entirely engrossed with its products having no knowledge of anything in the world but fern furze heath lichens and moss
153-126671-0022	train-other-500	The furze cutter was so absorbed in the business of his journey that he never turned his head and his leather legged and gauntleted form at length became to her as nothing more than a moving handpost to show her the way
153-126671-0023	train-other-500	Suddenly she was attracted to his individuality by observing peculiarities in his walk It was a gait she had seen somewhere before and the gait revealed the man to her as the gait of Ahimaaz in the distant plain
153-126671-0024	train-other-500	made him known to the watchman of the king His walk is exactly as my husband s used to be she said and then the thought burst upon her that the furze cutter was her son
153-126671-0025	train-other-500	She was scarcely able to familiarize herself with this strange reality She had been told that Clym was in the habit of cutting furze but she had supposed that he occupied himself with the labour
153-126671-0026	train-other-500	only at odd times by way of useful pastime yet she now beheld him as a furze cutter and nothing more wearing the regulation dress of the craft
153-126671-0027	train-other-500	and thinking the regulation thoughts to judge by his motions Planning a dozen hasty schemes for at once preserving him and Eustacia from this mode of life she throbbingly followed the way and saw him
153-126671-0028	train-other-500	enter his own door At one side of Clym s house was a knoll and on the top of the knoll a clump of fir trees so highly thrust up into the sky that their foliage from a distance appeared
153-126671-0029	train-other-500	as a black spot in the air above the crown of the hill On reaching this place missus Yeobright felt distressingly agitated weary and unwell She ascended
153-126671-0030	train-other-500	and sat down under their shade to recover herself and to consider how best to break the ground with Eustacia so as not to irritate a woman underneath whose apparent indolence lurked passions
153-126671-0031	train-other-500	even stronger and more active than her own The trees beneath which she sat were singularly battered rude and wild and for a few minutes missus Yeobright dismissed thoughts of her own storm broken
153-126671-0032	train-other-500	and exhausted state to contemplate theirs Not a bough in the nine trees which composed the group but was splintered lopped and distorted by the fierce weather that there held them at its mercy
153-126671-0033	train-other-500	whenever it prevailed Some were blasted and split as if by lightning black stains as from fire marking their sides while the ground at their feet was strewn with dead fir needles and heaps of cones
153-126671-0034	train-other-500	blown down in the gales of past years The place was called the Devil s Bellows and it was only necessary to come there on a March or November night to discover the forcible reasons for that name
153-126671-0035	train-other-500	On the present heated afternoon when no perceptible wind was blowing the trees kept up a perpetual moan which one could hardly believe to be caused by the air
153-126671-0036	train-other-500	Here she sat for twenty minutes or more ere she could summon resolution to go down to the door her courage being lowered to zero by her physical lassitude
153-126671-0037	train-other-500	To any other person than a mother it might have seemed a little humiliating that she the elder of the two women should be the first to make advances But missus Yeobright had well considered all that and she only thought
153-126671-0038	train-other-500	how best to make her visit appear to Eustacia not abject but wise From her elevated position the exhausted woman could perceive the roof of the house below and the garden
153-126671-0039	train-other-500	and the whole enclosure of the little domicile And now at the moment of rising she saw a second man approaching the gate His manner was peculiar hesitating
153-126671-0040	train-other-500	and not that of a person come on business or by invitation He surveyed the house with interest and then walked round and scanned the outer boundary of the garden as one might have done had it been the birthplace of Shakespeare
153-126671-0041	train-other-500	the prison of Mary Stuart or the Chateau of Hougomont After passing round and again reaching the gate he went in
none	none	 missus Yeobright was vexed at this having reckoned on finding her son and his wife by themselves 
153-126671-0042	train-other-500	but a moment s thought showed her that the presence of an acquaintance would take off the awkwardness of her first appearance in the house by confining the talk to general matters until she had begun to feel comfortable with them
153-126671-0043	train-other-500	She came down the hill to the gate and looked into the hot garden There lay the cat asleep on the bare gravel of the path as if beds rugs and carpets were unendurable
153-126671-0044	train-other-500	The leaves of the hollyhocks hung like half closed umbrellas the sap almost simmered in the stems and foliage with a smooth surface glared like metallic mirrors
153-126671-0045	train-other-500	A small apple tree of the sort called Ratheripe grew just inside the gate the only one which throve in the garden by reason of the lightness of the soil and among the fallen apples on the ground beneath
153-126671-0046	train-other-500	were wasps rolling drunk with the juice or creeping about the little caves in each fruit which they had eaten out before stupefied by its sweetness By the door lay Clym s furze hook
none	none	 and the last handful of faggot bonds she had seen him gather they had plainly been thrown down there as he entered the house six A Conjuncture and Its Result upon the Pedestrian Wildeve as has been stated was determined to visit Eustacia boldly by day and on the easy terms of a relation since the reddleman had spied out and spoilt his walks to her by night The spell that she had thrown over him in the moonlight dance made it impossible for a man having no strong puritanic force within him to keep away altogether He merely calculated on meeting her and her husband in an ordinary manner chatting a little while and leaving again Every outward sign was to be conventional but the one great fact would be there to satisfy him he would see her He did not even desire Clym s absence since it was just possible that Eustacia might resent any situation which could compromise her dignity as a wife whatever the state of her heart towards him Women were often so He went accordingly and it happened that the time of his arrival coincided with that of missus Yeobright s pause on the hill near the house When he had looked round the premises in the manner she had noticed he went and knocked at the door There was a few minutes interval and then the key turned in the lock the door opened and Eustacia herself confronted him Nobody could have imagined from her bearing now that here stood the woman who had joined with him in the impassioned dance of the week before unless indeed he could have penetrated below the surface and gauged the real depth of that still stream I hope you reached home safely said Wildeve O yes she carelessly returned And were you not tired the next day I feared you might be I was rather You need not speak low nobody will over hear us My small servant is gone on an errand to the village Then Clym is not at home Yes he is O I thought that perhaps you had locked the door because you were alone and were afraid of tramps No here is my husband They had been standing in the entry Closing the front door and turning the key as before she threw open the door of the adjoining room and asked him to walk in Wildeve entered the room appearing to be empty but as soon as he had advanced a few steps he started On the hearthrug lay Clym asleep Beside him were the leggings thick boots leather gloves and sleeve waistcoat in which he worked You may go in you will not disturb him she said following behind My reason for fastening the door is that he may not be intruded upon by any chance comer while lying here if I should be in the garden or upstairs Why is he sleeping there said Wildeve in low tones He is very weary He went out at half past four this morning and has been working ever since He cuts furze because it is the only thing he can do that does not put any strain upon his poor eyes The contrast between the sleeper s appearance and Wildeve s at this moment was painfully apparent to Eustacia Wildeve being elegantly dressed in a new summer suit and light hat and she continued Ah you don t know how differently he appeared when I first met him though it is such a little while ago His hands were as white and soft as mine and look at them now how rough and brown they are His complexion is by nature fair and that rusty look he has now all of a colour with his leather clothes is caused by the burning of the sun Why does he go out at all Wildeve whispered Because he hates to be idle though what he earns doesn t add much to our exchequer However he says that when people are living upon their capital they must keep down current expenses by turning a penny where they can The fates have not been kind to you Eustacia Yeobright I have nothing to thank them for Nor has he except for their one great gift to him What s that Wildeve looked her in the eyes Eustacia blushed for the first time that day Well I am a questionable gift she said quietly I thought you meant the gift of content which he has and I have not I can understand content in such a case though how the outward situation can attract him puzzles me That s because you don t know him He s an enthusiast about ideas and careless about outward things He often reminds me of the Apostle Paul I am glad to hear that he s so grand in character as that Yes but the worst of it is that though Paul was excellent as a man in the Bible he would hardly have done in real life Their voices had instinctively dropped lower though at first they had taken no particular care to avoid awakening Clym Well if that means that your marriage is a misfortune to you you know who is to blame said Wildeve The marriage is no misfortune in itself she retorted with some little petulance It is simply the accident which has happened since that has been the cause of my ruin I have certainly got thistles for figs in a worldly sense but how could I tell what time would bring forth Sometimes Eustacia I think it is a judgment upon you You rightly belonged to me you know and I had no idea of losing you No it was not my fault Two could not belong to you and remember that before I was aware you turned aside to another woman It was cruel levity in you to do that I never dreamt of playing such a game on my side till you began it on yours I meant nothing by it replied Wildeve It was a mere interlude Men are given to the trick of having a passing fancy for somebody else in the midst of a permanent love which reasserts itself afterwards just as before On account of your rebellious manner to me I was tempted to go further than I should have done and when you still would keep playing the same tantalizing part I went further still and married her Turning and looking again at the unconscious form of Clym he murmured I am afraid that you don t value your prize Clym He ought to be happier than I in one thing at least He may know what it is to come down in the world and to be afflicted with a great personal calamity but he probably doesn t know what it is to lose the woman he loved He is not ungrateful for winning her whispered Eustacia and in that respect he is a good man Many women would go far for such a husband But do I desire unreasonably much in wanting what is called life music poetry passion war and all the beating and pulsing that are going on in the great arteries of the world That was the shape of my youthful dream but I did not get it Yet I thought I saw the way to it in my Clym And you only married him on that account There you mistake me I married him because I loved him but I won t say that I didn t love him partly because I thought I saw a promise of that life in him You have dropped into your old mournful key But I am not going to be depressed she cried perversely I began a new system by going to that dance and I mean to stick to it Clym can sing merrily why should not I Wildeve looked thoughtfully at her It is easier to say you will sing than to do it though if I could I would encourage you in your attempt But as life means nothing to me without one thing which is now impossible you will forgive me for not being able to encourage you Damon what is the matter with you that you speak like that she asked raising her deep shady eyes to his That s a thing I shall never tell plainly and perhaps if I try to tell you in riddles you will not care to guess them Eustacia remained silent for a minute and she said We are in a strange relationship today You mince matters to an uncommon nicety You mean Damon that you still love me Well that gives me sorrow for I am not made so entirely happy by my marriage that I am willing to spurn you for the information as I ought to do But we have said too much about this Do you mean to wait until my husband is awake I thought to speak to him but it is unnecessary Eustacia if I offend you by not forgetting you you are right to mention it but do not talk of spurning She did not reply and they stood looking musingly at Clym as he slept on in that profound sleep which is the result of physical labour carried on in circumstances that wake no nervous fear God how I envy him that sweet sleep said Wildeve I have not slept like that since I was a boy years and years ago While they thus watched him a click at the gate was audible and a knock came to the door Eustacia went to a window and looked out Her countenance changed First she became crimson and then the red subsided till it even partially left her lips Shall I go away said Wildeve standing up I hardly know Who is it missus Yeobright O what she said to me that day I cannot understand this visit what does she mean And she suspects that past time of ours I am in your hands If you think she had better not see me here I ll go into the next room Well yes go Wildeve at once withdrew but before he had been half a minute in the adjoining apartment Eustacia came after him No she said we won t have any of this If she comes in she must see you and think if she likes there s something wrong But how can I open the door to her when she dislikes me wishes to see not me but her son I won t open the door missus Yeobright knocked again more loudly Her knocking will in all likelihood awaken him continued Eustacia and then he will let her in himself Ah listen They could hear Clym moving in the other room as if disturbed by the knocking and he uttered the word Mother Yes he is awake he will go to the door she said with a breath of relief Come this way I have a bad name with her and you must not be seen Thus I am obliged to act by stealth not because I do ill but because others are pleased to say so By this time she had taken him to the back door which was open disclosing a path leading down the garden Now one word Damon she remarked as he stepped forth This is your first visit here let it be your last We have been hot lovers in our time but it won t do now Good bye Good bye said Wildeve I have had all I came for and I am satisfied What was it A sight of you Upon my eternal honour I came for no more Wildeve kissed his hand to the beautiful girl he addressed and passed into the garden where she watched him down the path over the stile at the end and into the ferns outside which brushed his hips as he went along till he became lost in their thickets When he had quite gone she slowly turned and directed her attention to the interior of the house But it was possible that her presence might not be desired by Clym and his mother at this moment of their first meeting or that it would be superfluous At all events she was in no hurry to meet missus Yeobright She resolved to wait till Clym came to look for her and glided back into the garden Here she idly occupied herself for a few minutes till finding no notice was taken of her she retraced her steps through the house to the front where she listened for voices in the parlour But hearing none she opened the door and went in To her astonishment Clym lay precisely as Wildeve and herself had left him his sleep apparently unbroken He had been disturbed and made to dream and murmur by the knocking but he had not awakened Eustacia hastened to the door and in spite of her reluctance to open it to a woman who had spoken of her so bitterly she unfastened it and looked out Nobody was to be seen There by the scraper lay Clym s hook and the handful of faggot bonds he had brought home in front of her were the empty path the garden gate standing slightly ajar and beyond the great valley of purple heath thrilling silently in the sun missus Yeobright was gone Clym s mother was at this time following a path which lay hidden from Eustacia by a shoulder of the hill Her walk thither from the garden gate had been hasty and determined as of a woman who was now no less anxious to escape from the scene than she had previously been to enter it Her eyes were fixed on the ground within her two sights were graven that of Clym s hook and brambles at the door and that of a woman s face at a window Her lips trembled becoming unnaturally thin as she murmured Tis too much Clym how can he bear to do it He is at home and yet he lets her shut the door against me In her anxiety to get out of the direct view of the house she had diverged from the straightest path homeward and while looking about to regain it she came upon a little boy gathering whortleberries in a hollow The boy was Johnny Nunsuch who had been Eustacia s stoker at the bonfire and with the tendency of a minute body to gravitate towards a greater he began hovering round missus Yeobright as soon as she appeared and trotted on beside her without perceptible consciousness of his act missus Yeobright spoke to him as one in a mesmeric sleep Tis a long way home my child and we shall not get there till evening I shall said her small companion I am going to play marnels afore supper and we go to supper at six o clock because Father comes home Does your father come home at six too No he never comes nor my son either nor anybody What have made you so down Have you seen a ooser I have seen what s worse a woman s face looking at me through a windowpane Is that a bad sight Yes It is always a bad sight to see a woman looking out at a weary wayfarer and not letting her in Once when I went to Throope Great Pond to catch effets I seed myself looking up at myself and I was frightened and jumped back like anything If they had only shown signs of meeting my advances halfway how well it might have been done But there is no chance Shut out She must have set him against me Can there be beautiful bodies without hearts inside I think so I would not have done it against a neighbour s cat on such a fiery day as this What is it you say Never again never Not even if they send for me You must be a very curious woman to talk like that O no not at all she said returning to the boy s prattle Most people who grow up and have children talk as I do When you grow up your mother will talk as I do too I hope she won t because tis very bad to talk nonsense Yes child it is nonsense I suppose Are you not nearly spent with the heat Yes But not so much as you be How do you know Your face is white and wet and your head is hanging down like Ah I am exhausted from inside Why do you every time you take a step go like this The child in speaking gave to his motion the jerk and limp of an invalid Because I have a burden which is more than I can bear The little boy remained silently pondering and they tottered on side by side until more than a quarter of an hour had elapsed when missus Yeobright whose weakness plainly increased said to him I must sit down here to rest When she had seated herself he looked long in her face and said How funny you draw your breath like a lamb when you drive him till he s nearly done for Do you always draw your breath like that Not always Her voice was now so low as to be scarcely above a whisper You will go to sleep there I suppose won t you You have shut your eyes already No I shall not sleep much till another day and then I hope to have a long long one very long Now can you tell me if Rimsmoor Pond is dry this summer Rimsmoor Pond is but Oker s Pool isn t because he is deep and is never dry tis just over there Is the water clear Yes middling except where the heath croppers walk into it Then take this and go as fast as you can and dip me up the clearest you can find I am very faint She drew from the small willow reticule that she carried in her hand an old fashioned china teacup without a handle it was one of half a dozen of the same sort lying in the reticule which she had preserved ever since her childhood and had brought with her today as a small present for Clym and Eustacia The boy started on his errand and soon came back with the water such as it was missus Yeobright attempted to drink but it was so warm as to give her nausea and she threw it away Afterwards she still remained sitting with her eyes closed The boy waited played near her caught several of the little brown butterflies which abounded and then said as he waited again I like going on better than biding still Will you soon start again I don t know I wish I might go on by myself he resumed fearing apparently that he was to be pressed into some unpleasant service Do you want me any more please missus Yeobright made no reply What shall I tell Mother the boy continued Tell her you have seen a broken hearted woman cast off by her son Before quite leaving her he threw upon her face a wistful glance as if he had misgivings on the generosity of forsaking her thus He gazed into her face in a vague wondering manner like that of one examining some strange old manuscript the key to whose characters is undiscoverable He was not so young as to be absolutely without a sense that sympathy was demanded he was not old enough to be free from the terror felt in childhood at beholding misery in adult quarters hither to deemed impregnable and whether she were in a position to cause trouble or to suffer from it whether she and her affliction were something to pity or something to fear it was beyond him to decide He lowered his eyes and went on without another word Before he had gone half a mile he had forgotten all about her except that she was a woman who had sat down to rest missus Yeobright s exertions physical and emotional had well nigh prostrated her but she continued to creep along in short stages with long breaks between The sun had now got far to the west of south and stood directly in her face like some merciless incendiary brand in hand waiting to consume her With the departure of the boy all visible animation disappeared from the landscape though the intermittent husky notes of the male grasshoppers from every tuft of furze were enough to show that amid the prostration of the larger animal species an unseen insect world was busy in all the fullness of life In two hours she reached a slope about three fourths the whole distance from Alderworth to her own home where a little patch of shepherd s thyme intruded upon the path and she sat down upon the perfumed mat it formed there In front of her a colony of ants had established a thoroughfare across the way where they toiled a never ending and heavy laden throng To look down upon them was like observing a city street from the top of a tower She remembered that this bustle of ants had been in progress for years at the same spot doubtless those of the old times were the ancestors of these which walked there now She leant back to obtain more thorough rest and the soft eastern portion of the sky was as great a relief to her eyes as the thyme was to her head While she looked a heron arose on that side of the sky and flew on with his face towards the sun He had come dripping wet from some pool in the valleys and as he flew the edges and lining of his wings his thighs and his breast were so caught by the bright sunbeams that he appeared as if formed of burnished silver Up in the zenith where he was seemed a free and happy place away from all contact with the earthly ball to which she was pinioned and she wished that she could arise uncrushed from its surface and fly as he flew then But being a mother it was inevitable that she should soon cease to ruminate upon her own condition Had the track of her next thought been marked by a streak in the air like the path of a meteor it would have shown a direction contrary to the heron s and have descended to the eastward upon the roof of Clym s house seven The Tragic Meeting of Two Old Friends He in the meantime had aroused himself from sleep sat up and looked around Eustacia was sitting in a chair hard by him and though she held a book in her hand she had not looked into it for some time Well indeed said Clym brushing his eyes with his hands How soundly I have slept I have had such a tremendous dream too one I shall never forget I thought you had been dreaming said she Yes It was about my mother I dreamt that I took you to her house to make up differences and when we got there we couldn t get in though she kept on crying to us for help However dreams are dreams What o clock is it Eustacia Half past two So late is it I didn t mean to stay so long By the time I have had something to eat it will be after three Ann is not come back from the village and I thought I would let you sleep on till she returned Clym went to the window and looked out Presently he said musingly Week after week passes and yet Mother does not come I thought I should have heard something from her long before this Misgiving regret fear resolution ran their swift course of expression in Eustacia s dark eyes She was face to face with a monstrous difficulty and she resolved to get free of it by postponement I must certainly go to Blooms End soon he continued and I think I had better go alone He picked up his leggings and gloves threw them down again and added As dinner will be so late today I will not go back to the heath but work in the garden till the evening and then when it will be cooler I will walk to Blooms End I am quite sure that if I make a little advance Mother will be willing to forget all It will be rather late before I can get home as I shall not be able to do the distance either way in less than an hour and a half But you will not mind for one evening dear What are you thinking of to make you look so abstracted I cannot tell you she said heavily I wish we didn t live here Clym The world seems all wrong in this place Well if we make it so I wonder if Thomasin has been to Blooms End lately I hope so But probably not as she is I believe expecting to be confined in a month or so I wish I had thought of that before Poor Mother must indeed be very lonely I don t like you going tonight Why not tonight Something may be said which will terribly injure me My mother is not vindictive said Clym his colour faintly rising But I wish you would not go Eustacia repeated in a low tone If you agree not to go tonight I promise to go by myself to her house tomorrow and make it up with her and wait till you fetch me Why do you want to do that at this particular time when at every previous time that I have proposed it you have refused I cannot explain further than that I should like to see her alone before you go she answered with an impatient move of her head and looking at him with an anxiety more frequently seen upon those of a sanguine temperament than upon such as herself Well it is very odd that just when I had decided to go myself you should want to do what I proposed long ago If I wait for you to go tomorrow another day will be lost and I know I shall be unable to rest another night without having been I want to get this settled and will You must visit her afterwards it will be all the same I could even go with you now You could scarcely walk there and back without a longer rest than I shall take No not tonight Eustacia Let it be as you say then she replied in the quiet way of one who though willing to ward off evil consequences by a mild effort would let events fall out as they might sooner than wrestle hard to direct them Clym then went into the garden and a thoughtful languor stole over Eustacia for the remainder of the afternoon which her husband attributed to the heat of the weather In the evening he set out on the journey Although the heat of summer was yet intense the days had considerably shortened and before he had advanced a mile on his way all the heath purples browns and greens had merged in a uniform dress without airiness or graduation and broken only by touches of white where the little heaps of clean quartz sand showed the entrance to a rabbit burrow or where the white flints of a footpath lay like a thread over the slopes In almost every one of the isolated and stunted thorns which grew here and there a nighthawk revealed his presence by whirring like the clack of a mill as long as he could hold his breath then stopping flapping his wings wheeling round the bush alighting and after a silent interval of listening beginning to whirr again At each brushing of Clym s feet white millermoths flew into the air just high enough to catch upon their dusty wings the mellowed light from the west which now shone across the depressions and levels of the ground without falling thereon to light them up Yeobright walked on amid this quiet scene with a hope that all would soon be well Three miles on he came to a spot where a soft perfume was wafted across his path and he stood still for a moment to inhale the familiar scent It was the place at which four hours earlier his mother had sat down exhausted on the knoll covered with shepherd s thyme While he stood a sound between a breathing and a moan suddenly reached his ears He looked to where the sound came from but nothing appeared there save the verge of the hillock stretching against the sky in an unbroken line He moved a few steps in that direction and now he perceived a recumbent figure almost close to his feet Among the different possibilities as to the person s individuality there did not for a moment occur to Yeobright that it might be one of his own family Sometimes furze cutters had been known to sleep out of doors at these times to save a long journey homeward and back again but Clym remembered the moan and looked closer and saw that the form was feminine and a distress came over him like cold air from a cave But he was not absolutely certain that the woman was his mother till he stooped and beheld her face pallid and with closed eyes His breath went as it were out of his body and the cry of anguish which would have escaped him died upon his lips During the momentary interval that elapsed before he became conscious that something must be done all sense of time and place left him and it seemed as if he and his mother were as when he was a child with her many years ago on this heath at hours similar to the present Then he awoke to activity and bending yet lower he found that she still breathed and that her breath though feeble was regular except when disturbed by an occasional gasp O what is it Mother are you very ill you are not dying he cried pressing his lips to her face I am your Clym How did you come here What does it all mean At that moment the chasm in their lives which his love for Eustacia had caused was not remembered by Yeobright and to him the present joined continuously with that friendly past that had been their experience before the division She moved her lips appeared to know him but could not speak and then Clym strove to consider how best to move her as it would be necessary to get her away from the spot before the dews were intense He was able bodied and his mother was thin He clasped his arms round her lifted her a little and said Does that hurt you She shook her head and he lifted her up then at a slow pace went onward with his load The air was now completely cool but whenever he passed over a sandy patch of ground uncarpeted with vegetation there was reflected from its surface into his face the heat which it had imbibed during the day At the beginning of his undertaking he had thought but little of the distance which yet would have to be traversed before Blooms End could be reached but though he had slept that afternoon he soon began to feel the weight of his burden Thus he proceeded like Aeneas with his father the bats circling round his head nightjars flapping their wings within a yard of his face and not a human being within call While he was yet nearly a mile from the house his mother exhibited signs of restlessness under the constraint of being borne along as if his arms were irksome to her He lowered her upon his knees and looked around The point they had now reached though far from any road was not more than a mile from the Blooms End cottages occupied by Fairway Sam Humphrey and the Cantles Moreover fifty yards off stood a hut built of clods and covered with thin turves but now entirely disused The simple outline of the lonely shed was visible and thither he determined to direct his steps As soon as he arrived he laid her down carefully by the entrance and then ran and cut with his pocketknife an armful of the dryest fern Spreading this within the shed which was entirely open on one side he placed his mother thereon then he ran with all his might towards the dwelling of Fairway Nearly a quarter of an hour had passed disturbed only by the broken breathing of the sufferer when moving figures began to animate the line between heath and sky In a few moments Clym arrived with Fairway Humphrey and Susan Nunsuch Olly Dowden who had chanced to be at Fairway s Christian and Grandfer Cantle following helter skelter behind They had brought a lantern and matches water a pillow and a few other articles which had occurred to their minds in the hurry of the moment Sam had been despatched back again for brandy and a boy brought Fairway s pony upon which he rode off to the nearest medical man with directions to call at Wildeve s on his way and inform Thomasin that her aunt was unwell Sam and the brandy soon arrived and it was administered by the light of the lantern after which she became sufficiently conscious to signify by signs that something was wrong with her foot Olly Dowden at length understood her meaning and examined the foot indicated It was swollen and red Even as they watched the red began to assume a more livid colour in the midst of which appeared a scarlet speck smaller than a pea and it was found to consist of a drop of blood which rose above the smooth flesh of her ankle in a hemisphere I know what it is cried Sam She has been stung by an adder Yes said Clym instantly I remember when I was a child seeing just such a bite O my poor mother It was my father who was bit said Sam And there s only one way to cure it You must rub the place with the fat of other adders and the only way to get that is by frying them That s what they did for him Tis an old remedy said Clym distrustfully and I have doubts about it But we can do nothing else till the doctor comes Tis a sure cure said Olly Dowden with emphasis I ve used it when I used to go out nursing Then we must pray for daylight to catch them said Clym gloomily I will see what I can do said Sam He took a green hazel which he had used as a walking stick split it at the end inserted a small pebble and with the lantern in his hand went out into the heath Clym had by this time lit a small fire and despatched Susan Nunsuch for a frying pan Before she had returned Sam came in with three adders one briskly coiling and uncoiling in the cleft of the stick and the other two hanging dead across it I have only been able to get one alive and fresh as he ought to be said Sam These limp ones are two I killed today at work but as they don t die till the sun goes down they can t be very stale meat The live adder regarded the assembled group with a sinister look in its small black eye and the beautiful brown and jet pattern on its back seemed to intensify with indignation missus Yeobright saw the creature and the creature saw her she quivered throughout and averted her eyes Look at that murmured Christian Cantle Neighbours how do we know but that something of the old serpent in God s garden that gied the apple to the young woman with no clothes lives on in adders and snakes still Look at his eye for all the world like a villainous sort of black currant Tis to be hoped he can t ill wish us There s folks in heath who ve been overlooked already I will never kill another adder as long as I live Well tis right to be afeard of things if folks can t help it said Grandfer Cantle Twould have saved me many a brave danger in my time I fancy I heard something outside the shed said Christian I wish troubles would come in the daytime for then a man could show his courage and hardly beg for mercy of the most broomstick old woman he should see if he was a brave man and able to run out of her sight Even such an ignorant fellow as I should know better than do that said Sam Well there s calamities where we least expect it whether or no Neighbours if missus Yeobright were to die d ye think we should be took up and tried for the manslaughter of a woman No they couldn t bring it in as that said Sam unless they could prove we had been poachers at some time of our lives But she ll fetch round Now if I had been stung by ten adders I should hardly have lost a day s work for t said Grandfer Cantle Such is my spirit when I am on my mettle But perhaps tis natural in a man trained for war Yes I ve gone through a good deal but nothing ever came amiss to me after I joined the Locals in four He shook his head and smiled at a mental picture of himself in uniform I was always first in the most galliantest scrapes in my younger days I suppose that was because they always used to put the biggest fool afore said Fairway from the fire beside which he knelt blowing it with his breath D ye think so Timothy said Grandfer Cantle coming forward to Fairway s side with sudden depression in his face Then a man may feel for years that he is good solid company and be wrong about himself after all Never mind that question Grandfer Stir your stumps and get some more sticks Tis very nonsense of an old man to prattle so when life and death s in mangling Yes yes said Grandfer Cantle with melancholy conviction Well this is a bad night altogether for them that have done well in their time and if I were ever such a dab at the hautboy or tenor viol I shouldn t have the heart to play tunes upon em now Susan now arrived with the frying pan when the live adder was killed and the heads of the three taken off The remainders being cut into lengths and split open were tossed into the pan which began hissing and crackling over the fire Soon a rill of clear oil trickled from the carcases whereupon Clym dipped the corner of his handkerchief into the liquid and anointed the wound eight Eustacia Hears of Good Fortune and Beholds Evil In the meantime Eustacia left alone in her cottage at Alderworth had become considerably depressed by the posture of affairs The consequences which might result from Clym s discovery that his mother had been turned from his door that day were likely to be disagreeable and this was a quality in events which she hated as much as the dreadful To be left to pass the evening by herself was irksome to her at any time and this evening it was more irksome than usual by reason of the excitements of the past hours The two visits had stirred her into restlessness She was not wrought to any great pitch of uneasiness by the probability of appearing in an ill light in the discussion between Clym and his mother but she was wrought to vexation and her slumbering activities were quickened to the extent of wishing that she had opened the door She had certainly believed that Clym was awake and the excuse would be an honest one as far as it went but nothing could save her from censure in refusing to answer at the first knock Yet instead of blaming herself for the issue she laid the fault upon the shoulders of some indistinct colossal Prince of the World who had framed her situation and ruled her lot At this time of the year it was pleasanter to walk by night than by day and when Clym had been absent about an hour she suddenly resolved to go out in the direction of Blooms End on the chance of meeting him on his return When she reached the garden gate she heard wheels approaching and looking round beheld her grandfather coming up in his car I can t stay a minute thank ye he answered to her greeting I am driving to East Egdon but I came round here just to tell you the news Perhaps you have heard about mister Wildeve s fortune No said Eustacia blankly Well he has come into a fortune of eleven thousand pounds uncle died in Canada just after hearing that all his family whom he was sending home had gone to the bottom in the Cassiopeia so Wildeve has come into everything without in the least expecting it Eustacia stood motionless awhile How long has he known of this she asked Well it was known to him this morning early for I knew it at ten o clock when Charley came back Now he is what I call a lucky man What a fool you were Eustacia In what way she said lifting her eyes in apparent calmness Why in not sticking to him when you had him Had him indeed I did not know there had ever been anything between you till lately and faith I should have been hot and strong against it if I had known but since it seems that there was some sniffing between ye why the deuce didn t you stick to him Eustacia made no reply but she looked as if she could say as much upon that subject as he if she chose And how is your poor purblind husband continued the old man Not a bad fellow either as far as he goes He is quite well It is a good thing for his cousin what d ye call her By George you ought to have been in that galley my girl Now I must drive on Do you want any assistance What s mine is yours you know Thank you Grandfather we are not in want at present she said coldly Clym cuts furze but he does it mostly as a useful pastime because he can do nothing else He is paid for his pastime isn t he Three shillings a hundred I heard Clym has money she said colouring but he likes to earn a little Very well good night And the captain drove on When her grandfather was gone Eustacia went on her way mechanically but her thoughts were no longer concerning her mother in law and Clym Wildeve notwithstanding his complaints against his fate had been seized upon by destiny and placed in the sunshine once more Eleven thousand pounds From every Egdon point of view he was a rich man In Eustacia s eyes too it was an ample sum one sufficient to supply those wants of hers which had been stigmatized by Clym in his more austere moods as vain and luxurious Though she was no lover of money she loved what money could bring and the new accessories she imagined around him clothed Wildeve with a great deal of interest She recollected now how quietly well dressed he had been that morning he had probably put on his newest suit regardless of damage by briars and thorns And then she thought of his manner towards herself O I see it I see it she said How much he wishes he had me now that he might give me all I desire In recalling the details of his glances and words at the time scarcely regarded it became plain to her how greatly they had been dictated by his knowledge of this new event Had he been a man to bear a jilt ill will he would have told me of his good fortune in crowing tones instead of doing that he mentioned not a word in deference to my misfortunes and merely implied that he loved me still as one superior to him Wildeve s silence that day on what had happened to him was just the kind of behaviour calculated to make an impression on such a woman Those delicate touches of good taste were in fact one of the strong points in his demeanour towards the other sex The peculiarity of Wildeve was that while at one time passionate upbraiding and resentful towards a woman at another he would treat her with such unparalleled grace as to make previous neglect appear as no discourtesy injury as no insult interference as a delicate attention and the ruin of her honour as excess of chivalry This man whose admiration today Eustacia had disregarded whose good wishes she had scarcely taken the trouble to accept whom she had shown out of the house by the back door was the possessor of eleven thousand pounds a man of fair professional education and one who had served his articles with a civil engineer So intent was Eustacia upon Wildeve s fortunes that she forgot how much closer to her own course were those of Clym and instead of walking on to meet him at once she sat down upon a stone She was disturbed in her reverie by a voice behind and turning her head beheld the old lover and fortunate inheritor of wealth immediately beside her She remained sitting though the fluctuation in her look might have told any man who knew her so well as Wildeve that she was thinking of him How did you come here she said in her clear low tone I thought you were at home I went on to the village after leaving your garden and now I have come back again that s all Which way are you walking may I ask She waved her hand in the direction of Blooms End I am going to meet my husband I think I may possibly have got into trouble whilst you were with me today How could that be By not letting in missus Yeobright I hope that visit of mine did you no harm None It was not your fault she said quietly By this time she had risen and they involuntarily sauntered on together without speaking for two or three minutes when Eustacia broke silence by saying I assume I must congratulate you On what O yes on my eleven thousand pounds you mean Well since I didn t get something else I must be content with getting that You seem very indifferent about it Why didn t you tell me today when you came she said in the tone of a neglected person I heard of it quite by accident I did mean to tell you said Wildeve But I well I will speak frankly I did not like to mention it when I saw Eustacia that your star was not high The sight of a man lying wearied out with hard work as your husband lay made me feel that to brag of my own fortune to you would be greatly out of place Yet as you stood there beside him I could not help feeling too that in many respects he was a richer man than I At this Eustacia said with slumbering mischievousness What would you exchange with him your fortune for me I certainly would said Wildeve As we are imagining what is impossible and absurd suppose we change the subject Very well and I will tell you of my plans for the future if you care to hear them I shall permanently invest nine thousand pounds keep one thousand as ready money and with the remaining thousand travel for a year or so Travel What a bright idea Where will you go to From here to Paris where I shall pass the winter and spring Then I shall go to Italy Greece Egypt and Palestine before the hot weather comes on In the summer I shall go to America and then by a plan not yet settled I shall go to Australia and round to India By that time I shall have begun to have had enough of it Then I shall probably come back to Paris again and there I shall stay as long as I can afford to Back to Paris again she murmured in a voice that was nearly a sigh She had never once told Wildeve of the Parisian desires which Clym s description had sown in her yet here was he involuntarily in a position to gratify them You think a good deal of Paris she added Yes In my opinion it is the central beauty spot of the world And in mine And Thomasin will go with you Yes if she cares to She may prefer to stay at home So you will be going about and I shall be staying here I suppose you will But we know whose fault that is I am not blaming you she said quickly Oh I thought you were If ever you SHOULD be inclined to blame me think of a certain evening by Rainbarrow when you promised to meet me and did not You sent me a letter and my heart ached to read that as I hope yours never will That was one point of divergence I then did something in haste But she is a good woman and I will say no more I know that the blame was on my side that time said Eustacia But it had not always been so However it is my misfortune to be too sudden in feeling O Damon don t reproach me any more I can t bear that They went on silently for a distance of two or three miles when Eustacia said suddenly Haven t you come out of your way mister Wildeve My way is anywhere tonight I will go with you as far as the hill on which we can see Blooms End as it is getting late for you to be alone Don t trouble I am not obliged to be out at all I think I would rather you did not accompany me further This sort of thing would have an odd look if known Very well I will leave you He took her hand unexpectedly and kissed it for the first time since her marriage What light is that on the hill he added as it were to hide the caress She looked and saw a flickering firelight proceeding from the open side of a hovel a little way before them The hovel which she had hitherto always found empty seemed to be inhabited now Since you have come so far said Eustacia will you see me safely past that hut I thought I should have met Clym somewhere about here but as he doesn t appear I will hasten on and get to Blooms End before he leaves They advanced to the turf shed and when they got near it the firelight and the lantern inside showed distinctly enough the form of a woman reclining on a bed of fern a group of heath men and women standing around her Eustacia did not recognize missus Yeobright in the reclining figure nor Clym as one of the standers by till she came close Then she quickly pressed her hand up on Wildeve s arm and signified to him to come back from the open side of the shed into the shadow It is my husband and his mother she whispered in an agitated voice What can it mean Will you step forward and tell me Wildeve left her side and went to the back wall of the hut Presently Eustacia perceived that he was beckoning to her and she advanced and joined him It is a serious case said Wildeve From their position they could hear what was proceeding inside I cannot think where she could have been going said Clym to someone She had evidently walked a long way but even when she was able to speak just now she would not tell me where What do you really think of her There is a great deal to fear was gravely answered in a voice which Eustacia recognized as that of the only surgeon in the district She has suffered somewhat from the bite of the adder but it is exhaustion which has overpowered her My impression is that her walk must have been exceptionally long I used to tell her not to overwalk herself this weather said Clym with distress Do you think we did well in using the adder s fat Well it is a very ancient remedy the old remedy of the viper catchers I believe replied the doctor It is mentioned as an infallible ointment by Hoffman Mead and I think the Abbe Fontana Undoubtedly it was as good a thing as you could do though I question if some other oils would not have been equally efficacious Come here come here was then rapidly said in anxious female tones and Clym and the doctor could be heard rushing forward from the back part of the shed to where missus Yeobright lay Oh what is it whispered Eustacia Twas Thomasin who spoke said Wildeve Then they have fetched her I wonder if I had better go in yet it might do harm For a long time there was utter silence among the group within and it was broken at last by Clym saying in an agonized voice O Doctor what does it mean The doctor did not reply at once ultimately he said She is sinking fast Her heart was previously affected and physical exhaustion has dealt the finishing blow Then there was a weeping of women then waiting then hushed exclamations then a strange gasping sound then a painful stillness It is all over said the doctor Further back in the hut the cotters whispered missus Yeobright is dead Almost at the same moment the two watchers observed the form of a small old fashioned child entering at the open side of the shed Susan Nunsuch whose boy it was went forward to the opening and silently beckoned to him to go back I ve got something to tell ee Mother he cried in a shrill tone That woman asleep there walked along with me today and she said I was to say that I had seed her and she was a broken hearted woman and cast off by her son and then I came on home A confused sob as from a man was heard within upon which Eustacia gasped faintly That s Clym I must go to him yet dare I do it No come away When they had withdrawn from the neighbourhood of the shed she said huskily I am to blame for this There is evil in store for me Was she not admitted to your house after all Wildeve inquired No and that s where it all lies Oh what shall I do I shall not intrude upon them I shall go straight home Damon good bye I cannot speak to you any more now They parted company and when Eustacia had reached the next hill she looked back A melancholy procession was wending its way by the light of the lantern from the hut towards Blooms End Wildeve was nowhere to be seen BOOK FIVE THE DISCOVERY one Wherefore Is Light Given to Him That Is in Misery One evening about three weeks after the funeral of missus Yeobright when the silver face of the moon sent a bundle of beams directly upon the floor of Clym s house at Alderworth a woman came forth from within She reclined over the garden gate as if to refresh herself awhile The pale lunar touches which make beauties of hags lent divinity to this face already beautiful She had not long been there when a man came up the road and with some hesitation said to her How is he tonight ma am if you please He is better though still very unwell Humphrey replied Eustacia Is he light headed ma am No He is quite sensible now Do he rave about his mother just the same poor fellow continued Humphrey Just as much though not quite so wildly she said in a low voice It was very unfortunate ma am that the boy Johnny should ever ha told him his mother s dying words about her being broken hearted and cast off by her son Twas enough to upset any man alive Eustacia made no reply beyond that of a slight catch in her breath as of one who fain would speak but could not and Humphrey declining her invitation to come in went away Eustacia turned entered the house and ascended to the front bedroom where a shaded light was burning In the bed lay Clym pale haggard wide awake tossing to one side and to the other his eyes lit by a hot light as if the fire in their pupils were burning up their substance Is it you Eustacia he said as she sat down Yes Clym I have been down to the gate The moon is shining beautifully and there is not a leaf stirring Shining is it What s the moon to a man like me Let it shine let anything be so that I never see another day Eustacia I don t know where to look my thoughts go through me like swords O if any man wants to make himself immortal by painting a picture of wretchedness let him come here Why do you say so I cannot help feeling that I did my best to kill her No Clym Yes it was so it is useless to excuse me My conduct to her was too hideous I made no advances and she could not bring herself to forgive me Now she is dead If I had only shown myself willing to make it up with her sooner and we had been friends and then she had died it wouldn t be so hard to bear But I never went near her house so she never came near mine and didn t know how welcome she would have been that s what troubles me She did not know I was going to her house that very night for she was too insensible to understand me If she had only come to see me I longed that she would But it was not to be There escaped from Eustacia one of those shivering sighs which used to shake her like a pestilent blast She had not yet told But Yeobright was too deeply absorbed in the ramblings incidental to his remorseful state to notice her During his illness he had been continually talking thus Despair had been added to his original grief by the unfortunate disclosure of the boy who had received the last words of missus Yeobright words too bitterly uttered in an hour of misapprehension Then his distress had overwhelmed him and he longed for death as a field labourer longs for the shade It was the pitiful sight of a man standing in the very focus of sorrow He continually bewailed his tardy journey to his mother s house because it was an error which could never be rectified and insisted that he must have been horribly perverted by some fiend not to have thought before that it was his duty to go to her since she did not come to him He would ask Eustacia to agree with him in his self condemnation and when she seared inwardly by a secret she dared not tell declared that she could not give an opinion he would say That s because you didn t know my mother s nature She was always ready to forgive if asked to do so but I seemed to her to be as an obstinate child and that made her unyielding Yet not unyielding she was proud and reserved no more Yes I can understand why she held out against me so long She was waiting for me I dare say she said a hundred times in her sorrow What a return he makes for all the sacrifices I have made for him I never went to her When I set out to visit her it was too late To think of that is nearly intolerable Sometimes his condition had been one of utter remorse unsoftened by a single tear of pure sorrow and then he writhed as he lay fevered far more by thought than by physical ills If I could only get one assurance that she did not die in a belief that I was resentful he said one day when in this mood it would be better to think of than a hope of heaven But that I cannot do You give yourself up too much to this wearying despair said Eustacia Other men s mothers have died That doesn t make the loss of mine less Yet it is less the loss than the circumstances of the loss I sinned against her and on that account there is no light for me She sinned against you I think No she did not I committed the guilt and may the whole burden be upon my head I think you might consider twice before you say that Eustacia replied Single men have no doubt a right to curse themselves as much as they please but men with wives involve two in the doom they pray down I am in too sorry a state to understand what you are refining on said the wretched man Day and night shout at me You have helped to kill her But in loathing myself I may I own be unjust to you my poor wife Forgive me for it Eustacia for I scarcely know what I do Eustacia was always anxious to avoid the sight of her husband in such a state as this which had become as dreadful to her as the trial scene was to Judas Iscariot It brought before her eyes the spectre of a worn out woman knocking at a door which she would not open and she shrank from contemplating it Yet it was better for Yeobright himself when he spoke openly of his sharp regret for in silence he endured infinitely more and would sometimes remain so long in a tense brooding mood consuming himself by the gnawing of his thought that it was imperatively necessary to make him talk aloud that his grief might in some degree expend itself in the effort Eustacia had not been long indoors after her look at the moonlight when a soft footstep came up to the house and Thomasin was announced by the woman downstairs Ah Thomasin Thank you for coming tonight said Clym when she entered the room Here am I you see Such a wretched spectacle am I that I shrink from being seen by a single friend and almost from you You must not shrink from me dear Clym said Thomasin earnestly in that sweet voice of hers which came to a sufferer like fresh air into a Black Hole Nothing in you can ever shock me or drive me away I have been here before but you don t remember it Yes I do I am not delirious Thomasin nor have I been so at all Don t you believe that if they say so I am only in great misery at what I have done and that with the weakness makes me seem mad But it has not upset my reason Do you think I should remember all about my mother s death if I were out of my mind No such good luck Two months and a half Thomasin the last of her life did my poor mother live alone distracted and mourning because of me yet she was unvisited by me though I was living only six miles off Two months and a half seventy five days did the sun rise and set upon her in that deserted state which a dog didn t deserve Poor people who had nothing in common with her would have cared for her and visited her had they known her sickness and loneliness but I who should have been all to her stayed away like a cur If there is any justice in God let Him kill me now He has nearly blinded me but that is not enough If He would only strike me with more pain I would believe in Him forever Hush hush O pray Clym don t don t say it implored Thomasin affrighted into sobs and tears while Eustacia at the other side of the room though her pale face remained calm writhed in her chair Clym went on without heeding his cousin But I am not worth receiving further proof even of Heaven s reprobation Do you think Thomasin that she knew me that she did not die in that horrid mistaken notion about my not forgiving her which I can t tell you how she acquired If you could only assure me of that Do you think so Eustacia Do speak to me I think I can assure you that she knew better at last said Thomasin The pallid Eustacia said nothing Why didn t she come to my house I would have taken her in and showed her how I loved her in spite of all But she never came and I didn t go to her and she died on the heath like an animal kicked out nobody to help her till it was too late If you could have seen her Thomasin as I saw her a poor dying woman lying in the dark upon the bare ground moaning nobody near believing she was utterly deserted by all the world it would have moved you to anguish it would have moved a brute And this poor woman my mother No wonder she said to the child You have seen a broken hearted woman What a state she must have been brought to to say that and who can have done it but I It is too dreadful to think of and I wish I could be punished more heavily than I am How long was I what they called out of my senses A week I think And then I became calm Yes for four days And now I have left off being calm But try to be quiet please do and you will soon be strong If you could remove that impression from your mind Yes yes he said impatiently But I don t want to get strong What s the use of my getting well It would be better for me if I die and it would certainly be better for Eustacia Is Eustacia there Yes It would be better for you Eustacia if I were to die Don t press such a question dear Clym Well it really is but a shadowy supposition for unfortunately I am going to live I feel myself getting better Thomasin how long are you going to stay at the inn now that all this money has come to your husband Another month or two probably until my illness is over We cannot get off till then I think it will be a month or more Yes yes Of course Ah Cousin Tamsie you will get over your trouble one little month will take you through it and bring something to console you but I shall never get over mine and no consolation will come Clym you are unjust to yourself Depend upon it Aunt thought kindly of you I know that if she had lived you would have been reconciled with her But she didn t come to see me though I asked her before I married if she would come Had she come or had I gone there she would never have died saying I am a broken hearted woman cast off by my son My door has always been open to her a welcome here has always awaited her But that she never came to see You had better not talk any more now Clym said Eustacia faintly from the other part of the room for the scene was growing intolerable to her Let me talk to you instead for the little time I shall be here Thomasin said soothingly Consider what a one sided way you have of looking at the matter Clym When she said that to the little boy you had not found her and taken her into your arms and it might have been uttered in a moment of bitterness It was rather like Aunt to say things in haste She sometimes used to speak so to me Though she did not come I am convinced that she thought of coming to see you Do you suppose a man s mother could live two or three months without one forgiving thought She forgave me and why should she not have forgiven you You laboured to win her round I did nothing I who was going to teach people the higher secrets of happiness did not know how to keep out of that gross misery which the most untaught are wise enough to avoid How did you get here tonight Thomasin said Eustacia Damon set me down at the end of the lane He has driven into East Egdon on business and he will come and pick me up by and by Accordingly they soon after heard the noise of wheels Wildeve had come and was waiting outside with his horse and gig Send out and tell him I will be down in two minutes said Thomasin I will run down myself said Eustacia She went down Wildeve had alighted and was standing before the horse s head when Eustacia opened the door He did not turn for a moment thinking the comer Thomasin Then he looked startled ever so little and said one word Well I have not yet told him she replied in a whisper Then don t do so till he is well it will be fatal You are ill yourself I am wretched O Damon she said bursting into tears I I can t tell you how unhappy I am I can hardly bear this I can tell nobody of my trouble nobody knows of it but you Poor girl said Wildeve visibly affected at her distress and at last led on so far as to take her hand It is hard when you have done nothing to deserve it that you should have got involved in such a web as this You were not made for these sad scenes I am to blame most If I could only have saved you from it all But Damon please pray tell me what I must do To sit by him hour after hour and hear him reproach himself as being the cause of her death and to know that I am the sinner if any human being is at all drives me into cold despair I don t know what to do Should I tell him or should I not tell him I always am asking myself that O I want to tell him and yet I am afraid If he find it out he must surely kill me for nothing else will be in proportion to his feelings now Beware the fury of a patient man sounds day by day in my ears as I watch him Well wait till he is better and trust to chance And when you tell you must only tell part for his own sake Which part should I keep back Wildeve paused That I was in the house at the time he said in a low tone Yes it must be concealed seeing what has been whispered How much easier are hasty actions than speeches that will excuse them If he were only to die Wildeve murmured Do not think of it I would not buy hope of immunity by so cowardly a desire even if I hated him Now I am going up to him again Thomasin bade me tell you she would be down in a few minutes Good bye She returned and Thomasin soon appeared When she was seated in the gig with her husband and the horse was turning to go off Wildeve lifted his eyes to the bedroom windows Looking from one of them he could discern a pale tragic face watching him drive away It was Eustacia s two A Lurid Light Breaks in upon a Darkened Understanding Clym s grief became mitigated by wearing itself out His strength returned and a month after the visit of Thomasin he might have been seen walking about the garden Endurance and despair equanimity and gloom the tints of health and the pallor of death mingled weirdly in his face He was now unnaturally silent upon all of the past that related to his mother and though Eustacia knew that he was thinking of it none the less she was only too glad to escape the topic ever to bring it up anew When his mind had been weaker his heart had led him to speak out but reason having now somewhat recovered itself he sank into taciturnity One evening when he was thus standing in the garden abstractedly spudding up a weed with his stick a bony figure turned the corner of the house and came up to him Christian isn t it said Clym I am glad you have found me out I shall soon want you to go to Blooms End and assist me in putting the house in order I suppose it is all locked up as I left it Yes Mister Clym Have you dug up the potatoes and other roots Yes without a drop o rain thank God But I was coming to tell ee of something else which is quite different from what we have lately had in the family I am sent by the rich gentleman at the Woman that we used to call the landlord to tell ee that missus Wildeve is doing well of a girl which was born punctually at one o clock at noon or a few minutes more or less and tis said that expecting of this increase is what have kept em there since they came into their money And she is getting on well you say Yes sir Only mister Wildeve is twanky because tisn t a boy that s what they say in the kitchen but I was not supposed to notice that Christian now listen to me Yes sure mister Yeobright Did you see my mother the day before she died No I did not Yeobright s face expressed disappointment But I zeed her the morning of the same day she died Clym s look lighted up That s nearer still to my meaning he said Yes I know twas the same day for she said I be going to see him Christian so I shall not want any vegetables brought in for dinner See whom See you She was going to your house you understand Yeobright regarded Christian with intense surprise Why did you never mention this he said Are you sure it was my house she was coming to O yes I didn t mention it because I ve never zeed you lately And as she didn t get there it was all nought and nothing to tell And I have been wondering why she should have walked in the heath on that hot day Well did she say what she was coming for It is a thing Christian I am very anxious to know Yes Mister Clym She didn t say it to me though I think she did to one here and there Do you know one person to whom she spoke of it There is one man please sir but I hope you won t mention my name to him as I have seen him in strange places particular in dreams One night last summer he glared at me like Famine and Sword and it made me feel so low that I didn t comb out my few hairs for two days He was standing as it might be Mister Yeobright in the middle of the path to Mistover and your mother came up looking as pale Yes when was that Last summer in my dream Pooh Who s the man Diggory the reddleman He called upon her and sat with her the evening before she set out to see you I hadn t gone home from work when he came up to the gate I must see Venn I wish I had known it before said Clym anxiously I wonder why he has not come to tell me He went out of Egdon Heath the next day so would not be likely to know you wanted him Christian said Clym you must go and find Venn I am otherwise engaged or I would go myself Find him at once and tell him I want to speak to him I am a good hand at hunting up folk by day said Christian looking dubiously round at the declining light but as to night time never is such a bad hand as I Mister Yeobright Search the heath when you will so that you bring him soon Bring him tomorrow if you can Christian then departed The morrow came but no Venn In the evening Christian arrived looking very weary He had been searching all day and had heard nothing of the reddleman Inquire as much as you can tomorrow without neglecting your work said Yeobright Don t come again till you have found him The next day Yeobright set out for the old house at Blooms End which with the garden was now his own His severe illness had hindered all preparations for his removal thither but it had become necessary that he should go and overlook its contents as administrator to his mother s little property for which purpose he decided to pass the next night on the premises He journeyed onward not quickly or decisively but in the slow walk of one who has been awakened from a stupefying sleep It was early afternoon when he reached the valley The expression of the place the tone of the hour were precisely those of many such occasions in days gone by and these antecedent similarities fostered the illusion that she who was there no longer would come out to welcome him The garden gate was locked and the shutters were closed just as he himself had left them on the evening after the funeral He unlocked the gate and found that a spider had already constructed a large web tying the door to the lintel on the supposition that it was never to be opened again When he had entered the house and flung back the shutters he set about his task of overhauling the cupboards and closets burning papers and considering how best to arrange the place for Eustacia s reception until such time as he might be in a position to carry out his long delayed scheme should that time ever arrive As he surveyed the rooms he felt strongly disinclined for the alterations which would have to be made in the time honoured furnishing of his parents and grandparents to suit Eustacia s modern ideas The gaunt oak cased clock with the picture of the Ascension on the door panel and the Miraculous Draught of Fishes on the base his grandmother s corner cupboard with the glass door through which the spotted china was visible the dumb waiter the wooden tea trays the hanging fountain with the brass tap whither would these venerable articles have to be banished He noticed that the flowers in the window had died for want of water and he placed them out upon the ledge that they might be taken away While thus engaged he heard footsteps on the gravel without and somebody knocked at the door Yeobright opened it and Venn was standing before him Good morning said the reddleman Is missus Yeobright at home Yeobright looked upon the ground Then you have not seen Christian or any of the Egdon folks he said No I have only just returned after a long stay away I called here the day before I left And you have heard nothing Nothing My mother is dead Dead said Venn mechanically Her home now is where I shouldn t mind having mine Venn regarded him and then said If I didn t see your face I could never believe your words Have you been ill I had an illness Well the change When I parted from her a month ago everything seemed to say that she was going to begin a new life And what seemed came true You say right no doubt Trouble has taught you a deeper vein of talk than mine All I meant was regarding her life here She has died too soon Perhaps through my living too long I have had a bitter experience on that score this last month Diggory But come in I have been wanting to see you He conducted the reddleman into the large room where the dancing had taken place the previous Christmas and they sat down in the settle together There s the cold fireplace you see said Clym When that half burnt log and those cinders were alight she was alive Little has been changed here yet I can do nothing My life creeps like a snail How came she to die said Venn Yeobright gave him some particulars of her illness and death and continued After this no kind of pain will ever seem more than an indisposition to me I began saying that I wanted to ask you something but I stray from subjects like a drunken man I am anxious to know what my mother said to you when she last saw you You talked with her a long time I think I talked with her more than half an hour About me Yes And it must have been on account of what we said that she was on the heath Without question she was coming to see you But why should she come to see me if she felt so bitterly against me There s the mystery Yet I know she quite forgave ee But Diggory would a woman who had quite forgiven her son say when she felt herself ill on the way to his house that she was broken hearted because of his ill usage Never What I know is that she didn t blame you at all She blamed herself for what had happened and only herself I had it from her own lips You had it from her lips that I had NOT ill treated her and at the same time another had it from her lips that I HAD ill treated her My mother was no impulsive woman who changed her opinion every hour without reason How can it be Venn that she should have told such different stories in close succession I cannot say It is certainly odd when she had forgiven you and had forgiven your wife and was going to see ye on purpose to make friends If there was one thing wanting to bewilder me it was this incomprehensible thing Diggory if we who remain alive were only allowed to hold conversation with the dead just once a bare minute even through a screen of iron bars as with persons in prison what we might learn How many who now ride smiling would hide their heads And this mystery I should then be at the bottom of it at once But the grave has forever shut her in and how shall it be found out now No reply was returned by his companion since none could be given and when Venn left a few minutes later Clym had passed from the dullness of sorrow to the fluctuation of carking incertitude He continued in the same state all the afternoon A bed was made up for him in the same house by a neighbour that he might not have to return again the next day and when he retired to rest in the deserted place it was only to remain awake hour after hour thinking the same thoughts How to discover a solution to this riddle of death seemed a query of more importance than highest problems of the living There was housed in his memory a vivid picture of the face of a little boy as he entered the hovel where Clym s mother lay The round eyes eager gaze the piping voice which enunciated the words had operated like stilettos on his brain A visit to the boy suggested itself as a means of gleaning new particulars though it might be quite unproductive To probe a child s mind after the lapse of six weeks not for facts which the child had seen and understood but to get at those which were in their nature beyond him did not promise much yet when every obvious channel is blocked we grope towards the small and obscure There was nothing else left to do after that he would allow the enigma to drop into the abyss of undiscoverable things It was about daybreak when he had reached this decision and he at once arose He locked up the house and went out into the green patch which merged in heather further on In front of the white garden palings the path branched into three like a broad arrow The road to the right led to the Quiet Woman and its neighbourhood the middle track led to Mistover Knap the left hand track led over the hill to another part of Mistover where the child lived On inclining into the latter path Yeobright felt a creeping chilliness familiar enough to most people and probably caused by the unsunned morning air In after days he thought of it as a thing of singular significance When Yeobright reached the cottage of Susan Nunsuch the mother of the boy he sought he found that the inmates were not yet astir But in upland hamlets the transition from a bed to abroad is surprisingly swift and easy There no dense partition of yawns and toilets divides humanity by night from humanity by day Yeobright tapped at the upper windowsill which he could reach with his walking stick and in three or four minutes the woman came down It was not till this moment that Clym recollected her to be the person who had behaved so barbarously to Eustacia It partly explained the insuavity with which the woman greeted him Moreover the boy had been ailing again and Susan now as ever since the night when he had been pressed into Eustacia s service at the bonfire attributed his indispositions to Eustacia s influence as a witch It was one of those sentiments which lurk like moles underneath the visible surface of manners and may have been kept alive by Eustacia s entreaty to the captain at the time that he had intended to prosecute Susan for the pricking in church to let the matter drop which he accordingly had done Yeobright overcame his repugnance for Susan had at least borne his mother no ill will He asked kindly for the boy but her manner did not improve I wish to see him continued Yeobright with some hesitation to ask him if he remembers anything more of his walk with my mother than what he has previously told She regarded him in a peculiar and criticizing manner To anybody but a half blind man it would have said You want another of the knocks which have already laid you so low She called the boy downstairs asked Clym to sit down on a stool and continued Now Johnny tell mister Yeobright anything you can call to mind You have not forgotten how you walked with the poor lady on that hot day said Clym No said the boy And what she said to you The boy repeated the exact words he had used on entering the hut Yeobright rested his elbow on the table and shaded his face with his hand and the mother looked as if she wondered how a man could want more of what had stung him so deeply She was going to Alderworth when you first met her No she was coming away That can t be Yes she walked along with me I was coming away too Then where did you first see her At your house Attend and speak the truth said Clym sternly Yes sir at your house was where I seed her first Clym started up and Susan smiled in an expectant way which did not embellish her face it seemed to mean Something sinister is coming What did she do at my house She went and sat under the trees at the Devil s Bellows Good God this is all news to me You never told me this before said Susan No Mother because I didn t like to tell ee I had been so far I was picking blackhearts and went further than I meant What did she do then said Yeobright Looked at a man who came up and went into your house That was myself a furze cutter with brambles in his hand No twas not you Twas a gentleman You had gone in afore Who was he I don t know Now tell me what happened next The poor lady went and knocked at your door and the lady with black hair looked out of the side window at her The boy s mother turned to Clym and said This is something you didn t expect Yeobright took no more notice of her than if he had been of stone Go on go on he said hoarsely to the boy And when she saw the young lady look out of the window the old lady knocked again and when nobody came she took up the furze hook and looked at it and put it down again and then she looked at the faggot bonds and then she went away and walked across to me and blowed her breath very hard like this We walked on together she and I and I talked to her and she talked to me a bit but not much because she couldn t blow her breath O murmured Clym in a low tone and bowed his head Let s have more he said She couldn t talk much and she couldn t walk and her face was O so queer How was her face Like yours is now The woman looked at Yeobright and beheld him colourless in a cold sweat Isn t there meaning in it she said stealthily What do you think of her now Silence said Clym fiercely And turning to the boy And then you left her to die No said the woman quickly and angrily He did not leave her to die She sent him away Whoever says he forsook her says what s not true Trouble no more about that answered Clym with a quivering mouth What he did is a trifle in comparison with what he saw Door kept shut did you say Kept shut she looking out of window Good heart of God what does it mean The child shrank away from the gaze of his questioner He said so answered the mother and Johnny s a God fearing boy and tells no lies Cast off by my son No by my best life dear mother it is not so But by your son s your son s May all murderesses get the torment they deserve With these words Yeobright went forth from the little dwelling The pupils of his eyes fixed steadfastly on blankness were vaguely lit with an icy shine his mouth had passed into the phase more or less imaginatively rendered in studies of Oedipus The strangest deeds were possible to his mood But they were not possible to his situation Instead of there being before him the pale face of Eustacia and a masculine shape unknown there was only the imperturbable countenance of the heath which having defied the cataclysmal onsets of centuries reduced to insignificance by its seamed and antique features the wildest turmoil of a single man three Eustacia Dresses Herself on a Black Morning A consciousness of a vast impassivity in all which lay around him took possession even of Yeobright in his wild walk towards Alderworth He had once before felt in his own person this overpowering of the fervid by the inanimate but then it had tended to enervate a passion far sweeter than that which at present pervaded him It was once when he stood parting from Eustacia in the moist still levels beyond the hills But dismissing all this he went onward home and came to the front of his house The blinds of Eustacia s bedroom were still closely drawn for she was no early riser All the life visible was in the shape of a solitary thrush cracking a small snail upon the door stone for his breakfast and his tapping seemed a loud noise in the general silence which prevailed but on going to the door Clym found it unfastened the young girl who attended upon Eustacia being astir in the back part of the premises Yeobright entered and went straight to his wife s room The noise of his arrival must have aroused her for when he opened the door she was standing before the looking glass in her nightdress the ends of her hair gathered into one hand with which she was coiling the whole mass round her head previous to beginning toilette operations She was not a woman given to speaking first at a meeting and she allowed Clym to walk across in silence without turning her head He came behind her and she saw his face in the glass It was ashy haggard and terrible Instead of starting towards him in sorrowful surprise as even Eustacia undemonstrative wife as she was would have done in days before she burdened herself with a secret she remained motionless looking at him in the glass And while she looked the carmine flush with which warmth and sound sleep had suffused her cheeks and neck dissolved from view and the deathlike pallor in his face flew across into hers He was close enough to see this and the sight instigated his tongue You know what is the matter he said huskily I see it in your face Her hand relinquished the rope of hair and dropped to her side and the pile of tresses no longer supported fell from the crown of her head about her shoulders and over the white nightgown She made no reply Speak to me said Yeobright peremptorily The blanching process did not cease in her and her lips now became as white as her face She turned to him and said Yes Clym I ll speak to you Why do you return so early Can I do anything for you Yes you can listen to me It seems that my wife is not very well Why Your face my dear your face Or perhaps it is the pale morning light which takes your colour away Now I am going to reveal a secret to you Ha ha O that is ghastly What Your laugh There s reason for ghastliness Eustacia you have held my happiness in the hollow of your hand and like a devil you have dashed it down She started back from the dressing table retreated a few steps from him and looked him in the face Ah you think to frighten me she said with a slight laugh Is it worth while I am undefended and alone How extraordinary What do you mean As there is ample time I will tell you though you know well enough I mean that it is extraordinary that you should be alone in my absence Tell me now where is he who was with you on the afternoon of the thirty first of August Under the bed Up the chimney A shudder overcame her and shook the light fabric of her nightdress throughout I do not remember dates so exactly she said I cannot recollect that anybody was with me besides yourself The day I mean said Yeobright his voice growing louder and harsher was the day you shut the door against my mother and killed her O it is too much too bad He leant over the footpiece of the bedstead for a few moments with his back towards her then rising again Tell me tell me tell me do you hear he cried rushing up to her and seizing her by the loose folds of her sleeve The superstratum of timidity which often overlies those who are daring and defiant at heart had been passed through and the mettlesome substance of the woman was reached The red blood inundated her face previously so pale What are you going to do she said in a low voice regarding him with a proud smile You will not alarm me by holding on so but it would be a pity to tear my sleeve Instead of letting go he drew her closer to him Tell me the particulars of my mother s death he said in a hard panting whisper or I ll I ll Clym she answered slowly do you think you dare do anything to me that I dare not bear But before you strike me listen You will get nothing from me by a blow even though it should kill me as it probably will But perhaps you do not wish me to speak killing may be all you mean Kill you Do you expect it I do Why No less degree of rage against me will match your previous grief for her Phew I shall not kill you he said contemptuously as if under a sudden change of purpose I did think of it but I shall not That would be making a martyr of you and sending you to where she is and I would keep you away from her till the universe come to an end if I could I almost wish you would kill me said she with gloomy bitterness It is with no strong desire I assure you that I play the part I have lately played on earth You are no blessing my husband You shut the door you looked out of the window upon her you had a man in the house with you you sent her away to die The inhumanity the treachery I will not touch you stand away from me and confess every word Never I ll hold my tongue like the very death that I don t mind meeting even though I can clear myself of half you believe by speaking Yes I will Who of any dignity would take the trouble to clear cobwebs from a wild man s mind after such language as this No let him go on and think his narrow thoughts and run his head into the mire I have other cares Tis too much but I must spare you Poor charity By my wretched soul you sting me Eustacia I can keep it up and hotly too Now then madam tell me his name Never I am resolved How often does he write to you Where does he put his letters when does he meet you Ah his letters Do you tell me his name I do not Then I ll find it myself His eyes had fallen upon a small desk that stood near on which she was accustomed to write her letters He went to it It was locked Unlock this You have no right to say it That s mine Without another word he seized the desk and dashed it to the floor The hinge burst open and a number of letters tumbled out Stay said Eustacia stepping before him with more excitement than she had hitherto shown Come come stand away I must see them She looked at the letters as they lay checked her feeling and moved indifferently aside when he gathered them up and examined them By no stretch of meaning could any but a harmless construction be placed upon a single one of the letters themselves The solitary exception was an empty envelope directed to her and the handwriting was Wildeve s Yeobright held it up Eustacia was doggedly silent Can you read madam Look at this envelope Doubtless we shall find more soon and what was inside them I shall no doubt be gratified by learning in good time what a well finished and full blown adept in a certain trade my lady is Do you say it to me do you she gasped He searched further but found nothing more What was in this letter he said Ask the writer Am I your hound that you should talk to me in this way Do you brave me do you stand me out mistress Answer Don t look at me with those eyes if you would bewitch me again Sooner than that I die You refuse to answer I wouldn t tell you after this if I were as innocent as the sweetest babe in heaven Which you are not Certainly I am not absolutely she replied I have not done what you suppose but if to have done no harm at all is the only innocence recognized I am beyond forgiveness But I require no help from your conscience You can resist and resist again Instead of hating you I could I think mourn for and pity you if you were contrite and would confess all Forgive you I never can I don t speak of your lover I will give you the benefit of the doubt in that matter for it only affects me personally But the other had you half killed me had it been that you wilfully took the sight away from these feeble eyes of mine I could have forgiven you But THAT S too much for nature Say no more I will do without your pity But I would have saved you from uttering what you will regret I am going away now I shall leave you You need not go as I am going myself You will keep just as far away from me by staying here Call her to mind think of her what goodness there was in her it showed in every line of her face Most women even when but slightly annoyed show a flicker of evil in some curl of the mouth or some corner of the cheek but as for her never in her angriest moments was there anything malicious in her look She was angered quickly but she forgave just as readily and underneath her pride there was the meekness of a child What came of it what cared you You hated her just as she was learning to love you O couldn t you see what was best for you but must bring a curse upon me and agony and death upon her by doing that cruel deed What was the fellow s name who was keeping you company and causing you to add cruelty to her to your wrong to me Was it Wildeve Was it poor Thomasin s husband Heaven what wickedness Lost your voice have you It is natural after detection of that most noble trick Eustacia didn t any tender thought of your own mother lead you to think of being gentle to mine at such a time of weariness Did not one grain of pity enter your heart as she turned away Think what a vast opportunity was then lost of beginning a forgiving and honest course Why did not you kick him out and let her in and say I ll be an honest wife and a noble woman from this hour Had I told you to go and quench eternally our last flickering chance of happiness here you could have done no worse Well she s asleep now and have you a hundred gallants neither they nor you can insult her any more You exaggerate fearfully she said in a faint weary voice but I cannot enter into my defence it is not worth doing You are nothing to me in future and the past side of the story may as well remain untold I have lost all through you but I have not complained Your blunders and misfortunes may have been a sorrow to you but they have been a wrong to me All persons of refinement have been scared away from me since I sank into the mire of marriage Is this your cherishing to put me into a hut like this and keep me like the wife of a hind You deceived me not by words but by appearances which are less seen through than words But the place will serve as well as any other as somewhere to pass from into my grave Her words were smothered in her throat and her head drooped down I don t know what you mean by that Am I the cause of your sin Eustacia made a trembling motion towards him What you can begin to shed tears and offer me your hand Good God can you No not I I ll not commit the fault of taking that The hand she had offered dropped nervelessly but the tears continued flowing Well yes I ll take it if only for the sake of my own foolish kisses that were wasted there before I knew what I cherished How bewitched I was How could there be any good in a woman that everybody spoke ill of O O O she cried breaking down at last and shaking with sobs which choked her she sank upon her knees O will you have done O you are too relentless there s a limit to the cruelty of savages I have held out long but you crush me down I beg for mercy I cannot bear this any longer it is inhuman to go further with this If I had killed your mother with my own hand I should not deserve such a scourging to the bone as this O O God have mercy upon a miserable woman You have beaten me in this game I beg you to stay your hand in pity I confess that I wilfully did not undo the door the first time she knocked but I should have unfastened it the second if I had not thought you had gone to do it yourself When I found you had not I opened it but she was gone That s the extent of my crime towards HER Best natures commit bad faults sometimes don t they I think they do Now I will leave you for ever and ever Tell all and I WILL pity you Was the man in the house with you Wildeve I cannot tell she said desperately through her sobbing Don t insist further I cannot tell I am going from this house We cannot both stay here You need not go I will go You can stay here No I will dress and then I will go Where Where I came from or ELSEWHERE She hastily dressed herself Yeobright moodily walking up and down the room the whole of the time At last all her things were on Her little hands quivered so violently as she held them to her chin to fasten her bonnet that she could not tie the strings and after a few moments she relinquished the attempt Seeing this he moved forward and said Let me tie them She assented in silence and lifted her chin For once at least in her life she was totally oblivious of the charm of her attitude But he was not and he turned his eyes aside that he might not be tempted to softness The strings were tied she turned from him Do you still prefer going away yourself to my leaving you he inquired again I do Very well let it be And when you will confess to the man I may pity you She flung her shawl about her and went downstairs leaving him standing in the room Eustacia had not long been gone when there came a knock at the door of the bedroom and Yeobright said Well It was the servant and she replied Somebody from missus Wildeve s have called to tell ee that the mis ess and the baby are getting on wonderful well and the baby s name is to be Eustacia Clementine And the girl retired What a mockery said Clym This unhappy marriage of mine to be perpetuated in that child s name four The Ministrations of a Half forgotten One Eustacia s journey was at first as vague in direction as that of thistledown on the wind She did not know what to do She wished it had been night instead of morning that she might at least have borne her misery without the possibility of being seen Tracing mile after mile along between the dying ferns and the wet white spiders webs she at length turned her steps towards her grandfather s house She found the front door closed and locked Mechanically she went round to the end where the stable was and on looking in at the stable door she saw Charley standing within Captain Vye is not at home she said No ma am said the lad in a flutter of feeling he s gone to Weatherbury and won t be home till night And the servant is gone home for a holiday So the house is locked up Eustacia s face was not visible to Charley as she stood at the doorway her back being to the sky and the stable but indifferently lighted but the wildness of her manner arrested his attention She turned and walked away across the enclosure to the gate and was hidden by the bank When she had disappeared Charley with misgiving in his eyes slowly came from the stable door and going to another point in the bank he looked over Eustacia was leaning against it on the outside her face covered with her hands and her head pressing the dewy heather which bearded the bank s outer side She appeared to be utterly indifferent to the circumstance that her bonnet hair and garments were becoming wet and disarranged by the moisture of her cold harsh pillow Clearly something was wrong Charley had always regarded Eustacia as Eustacia had regarded Clym when she first beheld him as a romantic and sweet vision scarcely incarnate He had been so shut off from her by the dignity of her look and the pride of her speech except at that one blissful interval when he was allowed to hold her hand that he had hardly deemed her a woman wingless and earthly subject to household conditions and domestic jars The inner details of her life he had only conjectured She had been a lovely wonder predestined to an orbit in which the whole of his own was but a point and this sight of her leaning like a helpless despairing creature against a wild wet bank filled him with an amazed horror He could no longer remain where he was Leaping over he came up touched her with his finger and said tenderly You are poorly ma am What can I do Eustacia started up and said Ah Charley you have followed me You did not think when I left home in the summer that I should come back like this I did not dear ma am Can I help you now I am afraid not I wish I could get into the house I feel giddy that s all Lean on my arm ma am till we get to the porch and I will try to open the door He supported her to the porch and there depositing her on a seat hastened to the back climbed to a window by the help of a ladder and descending inside opened the door Next he assisted her into the room where there was an old fashioned horsehair settee as large as a donkey wagon She lay down here and Charley covered her with a cloak he found in the hall Shall I get you something to eat and drink he said If you please Charley But I suppose there is no fire I can light it ma am He vanished and she heard a splitting of wood and a blowing of bellows and presently he returned saying I have lighted a fire in the kitchen and now I ll light one here He lit the fire Eustacia dreamily observing him from her couch When it was blazing up he said Shall I wheel you round in front of it ma am as the morning is chilly Yes if you like Shall I go and bring the victuals now Yes do she murmured languidly When he had gone and the dull sounds occasionally reached her ears of his movements in the kitchen she forgot where she was and had for a moment to consider by an effort what the sounds meant After an interval which seemed short to her whose thoughts were elsewhere he came in with a tray on which steamed tea and toast though it was nearly lunch time Place it on the table she said I shall be ready soon He did so and retired to the door when however he perceived that she did not move he came back a few steps Let me hold it to you if you don t wish to get up said Charley He brought the tray to the front of the couch where he knelt down adding I will hold it for you Eustacia sat up and poured out a cup of tea You are very kind to me Charley she murmured as she sipped Well I ought to be said he diffidently taking great trouble not to rest his eyes upon her though this was their only natural position Eustacia being immediately before him You have been kind to me How have I said Eustacia You let me hold your hand when you were a maiden at home Ah so I did Why did I do that My mind is lost it had to do with the mumming had it not Yes you wanted to go in my place I remember I do indeed remember too well She again became utterly downcast and Charley seeing that she was not going to eat or drink any more took away the tray Afterwards he occasionally came in to see if the fire was burning to ask her if she wanted anything to tell her that the wind had shifted from south to west to ask her if she would like him to gather her some blackberries to all which inquiries she replied in the negative or with indifference She remained on the settee some time longer when she aroused herself and went upstairs The room in which she had formerly slept still remained much as she had left it and the recollection that this forced upon her of her own greatly changed and infinitely worsened situation again set on her face the undetermined and formless misery which it had worn on her first arrival She peeped into her grandfather s room through which the fresh autumn air was blowing from the open window Her eye was arrested by what was a familiar sight enough though it broke upon her now with a new significance It was a brace of pistols hanging near the head of her grandfather s bed which he always kept there loaded as a precaution against possible burglars the house being very lonely Eustacia regarded them long as if they were the page of a book in which she read a new and a strange matter Quickly like one afraid of herself she returned downstairs and stood in deep thought If I could only do it she said It would be doing much good to myself and all connected with me and no harm to a single one The idea seemed to gather force within her and she remained in a fixed attitude nearly ten minutes when a certain finality was expressed in her gaze and no longer the blankness of indecision She turned and went up the second time softly and stealthily now and entered her grandfather s room her eyes at once seeking the head of the bed The pistols were gone The instant quashing of her purpose by their absence affected her brain as a sudden vacuum affects the body she nearly fainted Who had done this There was only one person on the premises besides herself Eustacia involuntarily turned to the open window which overlooked the garden as far as the bank that bounded it On the summit of the latter stood Charley sufficiently elevated by its height to see into the room His gaze was directed eagerly and solicitously upon her She went downstairs to the door and beckoned to him You have taken them away Yes ma am Why did you do it I saw you looking at them too long What has that to do with it You have been heart broken all the morning as if you did not want to live Well And I could not bear to leave them in your way There was meaning in your look at them Where are they now Locked up Where In the stable Give them to me No ma am You refuse I do I care too much for you to give em up She turned aside her face for the first time softening from the stony immobility of the earlier day and the corners of her mouth resuming something of that delicacy of cut which was always lost in her moments of despair At last she confronted him again Why should I not die if I wish she said tremulously I have made a bad bargain with life and I am weary of it weary And now you have hindered my escape O why did you Charley What makes death painful except the thought of others grief and that is absent in my case for not a sigh would follow me Ah it is trouble that has done this I wish in my very soul that he who brought it about might die and rot even if tis transportation to say it Charley no more of that What do you mean to do about this you have seen Keep it close as night if you promise not to think of it again You need not fear The moment has passed I promise She then went away entered the house and lay down Later in the afternoon her grandfather returned He was about to question her categorically but on looking at her he withheld his words Yes it is too bad to talk of she slowly returned in answer to his glance Can my old room be got ready for me tonight Grandfather I shall want to occupy it again He did not ask what it all meant or why she had left her husband but ordered the room to be prepared five An Old Move Inadvertently Repeated Charley s attentions to his former mistress were unbounded The only solace to his own trouble lay in his attempts to relieve hers Hour after hour he considered her wants he thought of her presence there with a sort of gratitude and while uttering imprecations on the cause of her unhappiness in some measure blessed the result Perhaps she would always remain there he thought and then he would be as happy as he had been before His dread was lest she should think fit to return to Alderworth and in that dread his eyes with all the inquisitiveness of affection frequently sought her face when she was not observing him as he would have watched the head of a stockdove to learn if it contemplated flight Having once really succoured her and possibly preserved her from the rashest of acts he mentally assumed in addition a guardian s responsibility for her welfare For this reason he busily endeavoured to provide her with pleasant distractions bringing home curious objects which he found in the heath such as white trumpet shaped mosses redheaded lichens stone arrowheads used by the old tribes on Egdon and faceted crystals from the hollows of flints These he deposited on the premises in such positions that she should see them as if by accident A week passed Eustacia never going out of the house Then she walked into the enclosed plot and looked through her grandfather s spyglass as she had been in the habit of doing before her marriage One day she saw at a place where the highroad crossed the distant valley a heavily laden wagon passing along It was piled with household furniture She looked again and again and recognized it to be her own In the evening her grandfather came indoors with a rumour that Yeobright had removed that day from Alderworth to the old house at Blooms End On another occasion when reconnoitring thus she beheld two female figures walking in the vale The day was fine and clear and the persons not being more than half a mile off she could see their every detail with the telescope The woman walking in front carried a white bundle in her arms from one end of which hung a long appendage of drapery and when the walkers turned so that the sun fell more directly upon them Eustacia could see that the object was a baby She called Charley and asked him if he knew who they were though she well guessed missus Wildeve and the nurse girl said Charley The nurse is carrying the baby said Eustacia No tis missus Wildeve carrying that he answered and the nurse walks behind carrying nothing The lad was in good spirits that day for the Fifth of November had again come round and he was planning yet another scheme to divert her from her too absorbing thoughts For two successive years his mistress had seemed to take pleasure in lighting a bonfire on the bank overlooking the valley but this year she had apparently quite forgotten the day and the customary deed He was careful not to remind her and went on with his secret preparations for a cheerful surprise the more zealously that he had been absent last time and unable to assist At every vacant minute he hastened to gather furze stumps thorn tree roots and other solid materials from the adjacent slopes hiding them from cursory view The evening came and Eustacia was still seemingly unconscious of the anniversary She had gone indoors after her survey through the glass and had not been visible since As soon as it was quite dark Charley began to build the bonfire choosing precisely that spot on the bank which Eustacia had chosen at previous times When all the surrounding bonfires had burst into existence Charley kindled his and arranged its fuel so that it should not require tending for some time He then went back to the house and lingered round the door and windows till she should by some means or other learn of his achievement and come out to witness it But the shutters were closed the door remained shut and no heed whatever seemed to be taken of his performance Not liking to call her he went back and replenished the fire continuing to do this for more than half an hour It was not till his stock of fuel had greatly diminished that he went to the back door and sent in to beg that missus Yeobright would open the window shutters and see the sight outside Eustacia who had been sitting listlessly in the parlour started up at the intelligence and flung open the shutters Facing her on the bank blazed the fire which at once sent a ruddy glare into the room where she was and overpowered the candles Well done Charley said Captain Vye from the chimney corner But I hope it is not my wood that he s burning Ah it was this time last year that I met with that man Venn bringing home Thomasin Yeobright to be sure it was Well who would have thought that girl s troubles would have ended so well What a snipe you were in that matter Eustacia Has your husband written to you yet No said Eustacia looking vaguely through the window at the fire which just then so much engaged her mind that she did not resent her grandfather s blunt opinion She could see Charley s form on the bank shovelling and stirring the fire and there flashed upon her imagination some other form which that fire might call up She left the room put on her garden bonnet and cloak and went out Reaching the bank she looked over with a wild curiosity and misgiving when Charley said to her with a pleased sense of himself I made it o purpose for you ma am Thank you she said hastily But I wish you to put it out now It will soon burn down said Charley rather disappointed Is it not a pity to knock it out I don t know she musingly answered They stood in silence broken only by the crackling of the flames till Charley perceiving that she did not want to talk to him moved reluctantly away Eustacia remained within the bank looking at the fire intending to go indoors yet lingering still Had she not by her situation been inclined to hold in indifference all things honoured of the gods and of men she would probably have come away But her state was so hopeless that she could play with it To have lost is less disturbing than to wonder if we may possibly have won and Eustacia could now like other people at such a stage take a standing point outside herself observe herself as a disinterested spectator and think what a sport for Heaven this woman Eustacia was While she stood she heard a sound It was the splash of a stone in the pond Had Eustacia received the stone full in the bosom her heart could not have given a more decided thump She had thought of the possibility of such a signal in answer to that which had been unwittingly given by Charley but she had not expected it yet How prompt Wildeve was Yet how could he think her capable of deliberately wishing to renew their assignations now An impulse to leave the spot a desire to stay struggled within her and the desire held its own More than that it did not do for she refrained even from ascending the bank and looking over She remained motionless not disturbing a muscle of her face or raising her eyes for were she to turn up her face the fire on the bank would shine upon it and Wildeve might be looking down There was a second splash into the pond Why did he stay so long without advancing and looking over Curiosity had its way she ascended one or two of the earth steps in the bank and glanced out Wildeve was before her He had come forward after throwing the last pebble and the fire now shone into each of their faces from the bank stretching breast high between them I did not light it cried Eustacia quickly It was lit without my knowledge Don t don t come over to me Why have you been living here all these days without telling me You have left your home I fear I am something to blame in this I did not let in his mother that s how it is You do not deserve what you have got Eustacia you are in great misery I see it in your eyes your mouth and all over you My poor poor girl He stepped over the bank You are beyond everything unhappy No no not exactly It has been pushed too far it is killing you I do think it Her usually quiet breathing had grown quicker with his words I I she began and then burst into quivering sobs shaken to the very heart by the unexpected voice of pity a sentiment whose existence in relation to herself she had almost forgotten This outbreak of weeping took Eustacia herself so much by surprise that she could not leave off and she turned aside from him in some shame though turning hid nothing from him She sobbed on desperately then the outpour lessened and she became quieter Wildeve had resisted the impulse to clasp her and stood without speaking Are you not ashamed of me who used never to be a crying animal she asked in a weak whisper as she wiped her eyes Why didn t you go away I wish you had not seen quite all that it reveals too much by half You might have wished it because it makes me as sad as you he said with emotion and deference As for revealing the word is impossible between us two I did not send for you don t forget it Damon I am in pain but I did not send for you As a wife at least I ve been straight Never mind I came O Eustacia forgive me for the harm I have done you in these two past years I see more and more that I have been your ruin Not you This place I live in Ah your generosity may naturally make you say that But I am the culprit I should either have done more or nothing at all In what way I ought never to have hunted you out or having done it I ought to have persisted in retaining you But of course I have no right to talk of that now I will only ask this can I do anything for you Is there anything on the face of the earth that a man can do to make you happier than you are at present If there is I will do it You may command me Eustacia to the limit of my influence and don t forget that I am richer now Surely something can be done to save you from this Such a rare plant in such a wild place it grieves me to see Do you want anything bought Do you want to go anywhere Do you want to escape the place altogether Only say it and I ll do anything to put an end to those tears which but for me would never have been at all We are each married to another person she said faintly and assistance from you would have an evil sound after after Well there s no preventing slanderers from having their fill at any time but you need not be afraid Whatever I may feel I promise you on my word of honour never to speak to you about or act upon until you say I may I know my duty to Thomasin quite as well as I know my duty to you as a woman unfairly treated What shall I assist you in In getting away from here Where do you wish to go to I have a place in my mind If you could help me as far as Budmouth I can do all the rest Steamers sail from there across the Channel and so I can get to Paris where I want to be Yes she pleaded earnestly help me to get to Budmouth harbour without my grandfather s or my husband s knowledge and I can do all the rest Will it be safe to leave you there alone Yes yes I know Budmouth well Shall I go with you I am rich now She was silent Say yes sweet She was silent still Well let me know when you wish to go We shall be at our present house till December after that we remove to Casterbridge Command me in anything till that time I will think of this she said hurriedly Whether I can honestly make use of you as a friend or must close with you as a lover that is what I must ask myself If I wish to go and decide to accept your company I will signal to you some evening at eight o clock punctually and this will mean that you are to be ready with a horse and trap at twelve o clock the same night to drive me to Budmouth harbour in time for the morning boat I will look out every night at eight and no signal shall escape me Now please go away If I decide on this escape I can only meet you once more unless I cannot go without you Go I cannot bear it longer Go go Wildeve slowly went up the steps and descended into the darkness on the other side and as he walked he glanced back till the bank blotted out her form from his further view six Thomasin Argues with Her Cousin and He Writes a Letter Yeobright was at this time at Blooms End hoping that Eustacia would return to him The removal of furniture had been accomplished only that day though Clym had lived in the old house for more than a week He had spent the time in working about the premises sweeping leaves from the garden paths cutting dead stalks from the flower beds and nailing up creepers which had been displaced by the autumn winds He took no particular pleasure in these deeds but they formed a screen between himself and despair Moreover it had become a religion with him to preserve in good condition all that had lapsed from his mother s hands to his own During these operations he was constantly on the watch for Eustacia That there should be no mistake about her knowing where to find him he had ordered a notice board to be affixed to the garden gate at Alderworth signifying in white letters whither he had removed When a leaf floated to the earth he turned his head thinking it might be her foot fall A bird searching for worms in the mould of the flower beds sounded like her hand on the latch of the gate and at dusk when soft strange ventriloquisms came from holes in the ground hollow stalks curled dead leaves and other crannies wherein breezes worms and insects can work their will he fancied that they were Eustacia standing without and breathing wishes of reconciliation Up to this hour he had persevered in his resolve not to invite her back At the same time the severity with which he had treated her lulled the sharpness of his regret for his mother and awoke some of his old solicitude for his mother s supplanter Harsh feelings produce harsh usage and this by reaction quenches the sentiments that gave it birth The more he reflected the more he softened But to look upon his wife as innocence in distress was impossible though he could ask himself whether he had given her quite time enough if he had not come a little too suddenly upon her on that sombre morning Now that the first flush of his anger had paled he was disinclined to ascribe to her more than an indiscreet friendship with Wildeve for there had not appeared in her manner the signs of dishonour And this once admitted an absolutely dark interpretation of her act towards his mother was no longer forced upon him On the evening of the fifth November his thoughts of Eustacia were intense Echoes from those past times when they had exchanged tender words all the day long came like the diffused murmur of a seashore left miles behind Surely he said she might have brought herself to communicate with me before now and confess honestly what Wildeve was to her Instead of remaining at home that night he determined to go and see Thomasin and her husband If he found opportunity he would allude to the cause of the separation between Eustacia and himself keeping silence however on the fact that there was a third person in his house when his mother was turned away If it proved that Wildeve was innocently there he would doubtless openly mention it If he were there with unjust intentions Wildeve being a man of quick feeling might possibly say something to reveal the extent to which Eustacia was compromised But on reaching his cousin s house he found that only Thomasin was at home Wildeve being at that time on his way towards the bonfire innocently lit by Charley at Mistover Thomasin then as always was glad to see Clym and took him to inspect the sleeping baby carefully screening the candlelight from the infant s eyes with her hand Tamsin have you heard that Eustacia is not with me now he said when they had sat down again No said Thomasin alarmed And not that I have left Alderworth No I never hear tidings from Alderworth unless you bring them What is the matter Clym in a disturbed voice related to her his visit to Susan Nunsuch s boy the revelation he had made and what had resulted from his charging Eustacia with having wilfully and heartlessly done the deed He suppressed all mention of Wildeve s presence with her All this and I not knowing it murmured Thomasin in an awestruck tone Terrible What could have made her O Eustacia And when you found it out you went in hot haste to her Were you too cruel or is she really so wicked as she seems Can a man be too cruel to his mother s enemy I can fancy so Very well then I ll admit that he can But now what is to be done Make it up again if a quarrel so deadly can ever be made up I almost wish you had not told me But do try to be reconciled There are ways after all if you both wish to I don t know that we do both wish to make it up said Clym If she had wished it would she not have sent to me by this time You seem to wish to and yet you have not sent to her True but I have been tossed to and fro in doubt if I ought after such strong provocation To see me now Thomasin gives you no idea of what I have been of what depths I have descended to in these few last days O it was a bitter shame to shut out my mother like that Can I ever forget it or even agree to see her again She might not have known that anything serious would come of it and perhaps she did not mean to keep Aunt out altogether She says herself that she did not But the fact remains that keep her out she did Believe her sorry and send for her How if she will not come It will prove her guilty by showing that it is her habit to nourish enmity But I do not think that for a moment I will do this I will wait for a day or two longer not longer than two days certainly and if she does not send to me in that time I will indeed send to her I thought to have seen Wildeve here tonight Is he from home Thomasin blushed a little No she said He is merely gone out for a walk Why didn t he take you with him The evening is fine You want fresh air as well as he Oh I don t care for going anywhere besides there is baby Yes yes Well I have been thinking whether I should not consult your husband about this as well as you said Clym steadily I fancy I would not she quickly answered It can do no good Her cousin looked her in the face No doubt Thomasin was ignorant that her husband had any share in the events of that tragic afternoon but her countenance seemed to signify that she concealed some suspicion or thought of the reputed tender relations between Wildeve and Eustacia in days gone by Clym however could make nothing of it and he rose to depart more in doubt than when he came You will write to her in a day or two said the young woman earnestly I do so hope the wretched separation may come to an end I will said Clym I don t rejoice in my present state at all And he left her and climbed over the hill to Blooms End Before going to bed he sat down and wrote the following letter MY DEAR EUSTACIA I must obey my heart without consulting my reason too closely Will you come back to me Do so and the past shall never be mentioned I was too severe but O Eustacia the provocation You don t know you never will know what those words of anger cost me which you drew down upon yourself All that an honest man can promise you I promise now which is that from me you shall never suffer anything on this score again After all the vows we have made Eustacia I think we had better pass the remainder of our lives in trying to keep them Come to me then even if you reproach me I have thought of your sufferings that morning on which I parted from you I know they were genuine and they are as much as you ought to bear Our love must still continue Such hearts as ours would never have been given us but to be concerned with each other I could not ask you back at first Eustacia for I was unable to persuade myself that he who was with you was not there as a lover But if you will come and explain distracting appearances I do not question that you can show your honesty to me Why have you not come before Do you think I will not listen to you Surely not when you remember the kisses and vows we exchanged under the summer moon Return then and you shall be warmly welcomed I can no longer think of you to your prejudice I am but too much absorbed in justifying you Your husband as ever CLYM There he said as he laid it in his desk that s a good thing done If she does not come before tomorrow night I will send it to her Meanwhile at the house he had just left Thomasin sat sighing uneasily Fidelity to her husband had that evening induced her to conceal all suspicion that Wildeve s interest in Eustacia had not ended with his marriage But she knew nothing positive and though Clym was her well beloved cousin there was one nearer to her still When a little later Wildeve returned from his walk to Mistover Thomasin said Damon where have you been I was getting quite frightened and thought you had fallen into the river I dislike being in the house by myself Frightened he said touching her cheek as if she were some domestic animal Why I thought nothing could frighten you It is that you are getting proud I am sure and don t like living here since we have risen above our business Well it is a tedious matter this getting a new house but I couldn t have set about it sooner unless our ten thousand pounds had been a hundred thousand when we could have afforded to despise caution No I don t mind waiting I would rather stay here twelve months longer than run any risk with baby But I don t like your vanishing so in the evenings There s something on your mind I know there is Damon You go about so gloomily and look at the heath as if it were somebody s gaol instead of a nice wild place to walk in He looked towards her with pitying surprise What do you like Egdon Heath he said I like what I was born near to I admire its grim old face Pooh my dear You don t know what you like I am sure I do There s only one thing unpleasant about Egdon What s that You never take me with you when you walk there Why do you wander so much in it yourself if you so dislike it The inquiry though a simple one was plainly disconcerting and he sat down before replying I don t think you often see me there Give an instance I will she answered triumphantly When you went out this evening I thought that as baby was asleep I would see where you were going to so mysteriously without telling me So I ran out and followed behind you You stopped at the place where the road forks looked round at the bonfires and then said Damn it I ll go And you went quickly up the left hand road Then I stood and watched you Wildeve frowned afterwards saying with a forced smile Well what wonderful discovery did you make There now you are angry and we won t talk of this any more She went across to him sat on a footstool and looked up in his face Nonsense he said that s how you always back out We will go on with it now we have begun What did you next see I particularly want to know Don t be like that Damon she murmured I didn t see anything You vanished out of sight and then I looked round at the bonfires and came in Perhaps this is not the only time you have dogged my steps Are you trying to find out something bad about me Not at all I have never done such a thing before and I shouldn t have done it now if words had not sometimes been dropped about you What DO you mean he impatiently asked They say they say you used to go to Alderworth in the evenings and it puts into my mind what I have heard about Wildeve turned angrily and stood up in front of her Now he said flourishing his hand in the air just out with it madam I demand to know what remarks you have heard Well I heard that you used to be very fond of Eustacia nothing more than that though dropped in a bit by bit way You ought not to be angry He observed that her eyes were brimming with tears Well he said there is nothing new in that and of course I don t mean to be rough towards you so you need not cry Now don t let us speak of the subject any more And no more was said Thomasin being glad enough of a reason for not mentioning Clym s visit to her that evening and his story seven The Night of the Sixth of November Having resolved on flight Eustacia at times seemed anxious that something should happen to thwart her own intention The only event that could really change her position was the appearance of Clym The glory which had encircled him as her lover was departed now yet some good simple quality of his would occasionally return to her memory and stir a momentary throb of hope that he would again present himself before her But calmly considered it was not likely that such a severance as now existed would ever close up she would have to live on as a painful object isolated and out of place She had used to think of the heath alone as an uncongenial spot to be in she felt it now of the whole world Towards evening on the sixth her determination to go away again revived About four o clock she packed up anew the few small articles she had brought in her flight from Alderworth and also some belonging to her which had been left here the whole formed a bundle not too large to be carried in her hand for a distance of a mile or two The scene without grew darker mud coloured clouds bellied downwards from the sky like vast hammocks slung across it and with the increase of night a stormy wind arose but as yet there was no rain Eustacia could not rest indoors having nothing more to do and she wandered to and fro on the hill not far from the house she was soon to leave In these desultory ramblings she passed the cottage of Susan Nunsuch a little lower down than her grandfather s The door was ajar and a riband of bright firelight fell over the ground without As Eustacia crossed the firebeams she appeared for an instant as distinct as a figure in a phantasmagoria a creature of light surrounded by an area of darkness the moment passed and she was absorbed in night again A woman who was sitting inside the cottage had seen and recognized her in that momentary irradiation This was Susan herself occupied in preparing a posset for her little boy who often ailing was now seriously unwell Susan dropped the spoon shook her fist at the vanished figure and then proceeded with her work in a musing absent way At eight o clock the hour at which Eustacia had promised to signal Wildeve if ever she signalled at all she looked around the premises to learn if the coast was clear went to the furze rick and pulled thence a long stemmed bough of that fuel This she carried to the corner of the bank and glancing behind to see if the shutters were all closed she struck a light and kindled the furze When it was thoroughly ablaze Eustacia took it by the stem and waved it in the air above her head till it had burned itself out She was gratified if gratification were possible to such a mood by seeing a similar light in the vicinity of Wildeve s residence a minute or two later Having agreed to keep watch at this hour every night in case she should require assistance this promptness proved how strictly he had held to his word Four hours after the present time that is at midnight he was to be ready to drive her to Budmouth as prearranged Eustacia returned to the house Supper having been got over she retired early and sat in her bedroom waiting for the time to go by The night being dark and threatening Captain Vye had not strolled out to gossip in any cottage or to call at the inn as was sometimes his custom on these long autumn nights and he sat sipping grog alone downstairs About ten o clock there was a knock at the door When the servant opened it the rays of the candle fell upon the form of Fairway I was a forced to go to Lower Mistover tonight he said and mister Yeobright asked me to leave this here on my way but faith I put it in the lining of my hat and thought no more about it till I got back and was hasping my gate before going to bed So I have run back with it at once He handed in a letter and went his way The girl brought it to the captain who found that it was directed to Eustacia He turned it over and over and fancied that the writing was her husband s though he could not be sure However he decided to let her have it at once if possible and took it upstairs for that purpose but on reaching the door of her room and looking in at the keyhole he found there was no light within the fact being that Eustacia without undressing had flung herself upon the bed to rest and gather a little strength for her coming journey Her grandfather concluded from what he saw that he ought not to disturb her and descending again to the parlour he placed the letter on the mantelpiece to give it to her in the morning At eleven o clock he went to bed himself smoked for some time in his bedroom put out his light at half past eleven and then as was his invariable custom pulled up the blind before getting into bed that he might see which way the wind blew on opening his eyes in the morning his bedroom window commanding a view of the flagstaff and vane Just as he had lain down he was surprised to observe the white pole of the staff flash into existence like a streak of phosphorus drawn downwards across the shade of night without Only one explanation met this a light had been suddenly thrown upon the pole from the direction of the house As everybody had retired to rest the old man felt it necessary to get out of bed open the window softly and look to the right and left Eustacia s bedroom was lighted up and it was the shine from her window which had lighted the pole Wondering what had aroused her he remained undecided at the window and was thinking of fetching the letter to slip it under her door when he heard a slight brushing of garments on the partition dividing his room from the passage The captain concluded that Eustacia feeling wakeful had gone for a book and would have dismissed the matter as unimportant if he had not also heard her distinctly weeping as she passed She is thinking of that husband of hers he said to himself Ah the silly goose she had no business to marry him I wonder if that letter is really his He arose threw his boat cloak round him opened the door and said Eustacia There was no answer Eustacia he repeated louder there is a letter on the mantelpiece for you But no response was made to this statement save an imaginary one from the wind which seemed to gnaw at the corners of the house and the stroke of a few drops of rain upon the windows He went on to the landing and stood waiting nearly five minutes Still she did not return He went back for a light and prepared to follow her but first he looked into her bedroom There on the outside of the quilt was the impression of her form showing that the bed had not been opened and what was more significant she had not taken her candlestick downstairs He was now thoroughly alarmed and hastily putting on his clothes he descended to the front door which he himself had bolted and locked It was now unfastened There was no longer any doubt that Eustacia had left the house at this midnight hour and whither could she have gone To follow her was almost impossible Had the dwelling stood in an ordinary road two persons setting out one in each direction might have made sure of overtaking her but it was a hopeless task to seek for anybody on a heath in the dark the practicable directions for flight across it from any point being as numerous as the meridians radiating from the pole Perplexed what to do he looked into the parlour and was vexed to find that the letter still lay there untouched At half past eleven finding that the house was silent Eustacia had lighted her candle put on some warm outer wrappings taken her bag in her hand and extinguishing the light again descended the staircase When she got into the outer air she found that it had begun to rain and as she stood pausing at the door it increased threatening to come on heavily But having committed herself to this line of action there was no retreating for bad weather Even the receipt of Clym s letter would not have stopped her now The gloom of the night was funereal all nature seemed clothed in crape The spiky points of the fir trees behind the house rose into the sky like the turrets and pinnacles of an abbey Nothing below the horizon was visible save a light which was still burning in the cottage of Susan Nunsuch Eustacia opened her umbrella and went out from the enclosure by the steps over the bank after which she was beyond all danger of being perceived Skirting the pool she followed the path towards Rainbarrow occasionally stumbling over twisted furze roots tufts of rushes or oozing lumps of fleshy fungi which at this season lay scattered about the heath like the rotten liver and lungs of some colossal animal The moon and stars were closed up by cloud and rain to the degree of extinction It was a night which led the traveller s thoughts instinctively to dwell on nocturnal scenes of disaster in the chronicles of the world on all that is terrible and dark in history and legend the last plague of Egypt the destruction of Sennacherib s host the agony in Gethsemane Eustacia at length reached Rainbarrow and stood still there to think Never was harmony more perfect than that between the chaos of her mind and the chaos of the world without A sudden recollection had flashed on her this moment she had not money enough for undertaking a long journey Amid the fluctuating sentiments of the day her unpractical mind had not dwelt on the necessity of being well provided and now that she thoroughly realized the conditions she sighed bitterly and ceased to stand erect gradually crouching down under the umbrella as if she were drawn into the Barrow by a hand from beneath Could it be that she was to remain a captive still Money she had never felt its value before Even to efface herself from the country means were required To ask Wildeve for pecuniary aid without allowing him to accompany her was impossible to a woman with a shadow of pride left in her to fly as his mistress and she knew that he loved her was of the nature of humiliation Anyone who had stood by now would have pitied her not so much on account of her exposure to weather and isolation from all of humanity except the mouldered remains inside the tumulus but for that other form of misery which was denoted by the slightly rocking movement that her feelings imparted to her person Extreme unhappiness weighed visibly upon her Between the drippings of the rain from her umbrella to her mantle from her mantle to the heather from the heather to the earth very similar sounds could be heard coming from her lips and the tearfulness of the outer scene was repeated upon her face The wings of her soul were broken by the cruel obstructiveness of all about her and even had she seen herself in a promising way of getting to Budmouth entering a steamer and sailing to some opposite port she would have been but little more buoyant so fearfully malignant were other things She uttered words aloud When a woman in such a situation neither old deaf crazed nor whimsical takes upon herself to sob and soliloquize aloud there is something grievous the matter Can I go can I go she moaned He s not GREAT enough for me to give myself to he does not suffice for my desire If he had been a Saul or a Bonaparte ah But to break my marriage vow for him it is too poor a luxury And I have no money to go alone And if I could what comfort to me I must drag on next year as I have dragged on this year and the year after that as before How I have tried and tried to be a splendid woman and how destiny has been against me I do not deserve my lot she cried in a frenzy of bitter revolt O the cruelty of putting me into this ill conceived world I was capable of much but I have been injured and blighted and crushed by things beyond my control O how hard it is of Heaven to devise such tortures for me who have done no harm to Heaven at all The distant light which Eustacia had cursorily observed in leaving the house came as she had divined from the cottage window of Susan Nunsuch What Eustacia did not divine was the occupation of the woman within at that moment Susan s sight of her passing figure earlier in the evening not five minutes after the sick boy s exclamation Mother I do feel so bad persuaded the matron that an evil influence was certainly exercised by Eustacia s propinquity On this account Susan did not go to bed as soon as the evening s work was over as she would have done at ordinary times To counteract the malign spell which she imagined poor Eustacia to be working the boy s mother busied herself with a ghastly invention of superstition calculated to bring powerlessness atrophy and annihilation on any human being against whom it was directed It was a practice well known on Egdon at that date and one that is not quite extinct at the present day She passed with her candle into an inner room where among other utensils were two large brown pans containing together perhaps a hundredweight of liquid honey the produce of the bees during the foregoing summer On a shelf over the pans was a smooth and solid yellow mass of a hemispherical form consisting of beeswax from the same take of honey Susan took down the lump and cutting off several thin slices heaped them in an iron ladle with which she returned to the living room and placed the vessel in the hot ashes of the fireplace As soon as the wax had softened to the plasticity of dough she kneaded the pieces together And now her face became more intent She began moulding the wax and it was evident from her manner of manipulation that she was endeavouring to give it some preconceived form The form was human By warming and kneading cutting and twisting dismembering and re joining the incipient image she had in about a quarter of an hour produced a shape which tolerably well resembled a woman and was about six inches high She laid it on the table to get cold and hard Meanwhile she took the candle and went upstairs to where the little boy was lying Did you notice my dear what missus Eustacia wore this afternoon besides the dark dress A red ribbon round her neck Anything else No except sandal shoes A red ribbon and sandal shoes she said to herself missus Nunsuch went and searched till she found a fragment of the narrowest red ribbon which she took downstairs and tied round the neck of the image Then fetching ink and a quilt from the rickety bureau by the window she blackened the feet of the image to the extent presumably covered by shoes and on the instep of each foot marked cross lines in the shape taken by the sandalstrings of those days Finally she tied a bit of black thread round the upper part of the head in faint resemblance to a snood worn for confining the hair Susan held the object at arm s length and contemplated it with a satisfaction in which there was no smile To anybody acquainted with the inhabitants of Egdon Heath the image would have suggested Eustacia Yeobright From her workbasket in the window seat the woman took a paper of pins of the old long and yellow sort whose heads were disposed to come off at their first usage These she began to thrust into the image in all directions with apparently excruciating energy Probably as many as fifty were thus inserted some into the head of the wax model some into the shoulders some into the trunk some upwards through the soles of the feet till the figure was completely permeated with pins She turned to the fire It had been of turf and though the high heap of ashes which turf fires produce was somewhat dark and dead on the outside upon raking it abroad with the shovel the inside of the mass showed a glow of red heat She took a few pieces of fresh turf from the chimney corner and built them together over the glow upon which the fire brightened Seizing with the tongs the image that she had made of Eustacia she held it in the heat and watched it as it began to waste slowly away And while she stood thus engaged there came from between her lips a murmur of words It was a strange jargon the Lord s Prayer repeated backwards the incantation usual in proceedings for obtaining unhallowed assistance against an enemy Susan uttered the lugubrious discourse three times slowly and when it was completed the image had considerably diminished As the wax dropped into the fire a long flame arose from the spot and curling its tongue round the figure ate still further into its substance A pin occasionally dropped with the wax and the embers heated it red as it lay eight Rain Darkness and Anxious Wanderers While the effigy of Eustacia was melting to nothing and the fair woman herself was standing on Rainbarrow her soul in an abyss of desolation seldom plumbed by one so young Yeobright sat lonely at Blooms End He had fulfilled his word to Thomasin by sending off Fairway with the letter to his wife and now waited with increased impatience for some sound or signal of her return Were Eustacia still at Mistover the very least he expected was that she would send him back a reply tonight by the same hand though to leave all to her inclination he had cautioned Fairway not to ask for an answer If one were handed to him he was to bring it immediately if not he was to go straight home without troubling to come round to Blooms End again that night But secretly Clym had a more pleasing hope Eustacia might possibly decline to use her pen it was rather her way to work silently and surprise him by appearing at his door How fully her mind was made up to do otherwise he did not know To Clym s regret it began to rain and blow hard as the evening advanced The wind rasped and scraped at the corners of the house and filliped the eavesdroppings like peas against the panes He walked restlessly about the untenanted rooms stopping strange noises in windows and doors by jamming splinters of wood into the casements and crevices and pressing together the leadwork of the quarries where it had become loosened from the glass It was one of those nights when cracks in the walls of old churches widen when ancient stains on the ceilings of decayed manor houses are renewed and enlarged from the size of a man s hand to an area of many feet The little gate in the palings before his dwelling continually opened and clicked together again but when he looked out eagerly nobody was there it was as if invisible shapes of the dead were passing in on their way to visit him Between ten and eleven o clock finding that neither Fairway nor anybody else came to him he retired to rest and despite his anxieties soon fell asleep His sleep however was not very sound by reason of the expectancy he had given way to and he was easily awakened by a knocking which began at the door about an hour after Clym arose and looked out of the window Rain was still falling heavily the whole expanse of heath before him emitting a subdued hiss under the downpour It was too dark to see anything at all Who s there he cried Light footsteps shifted their position in the porch and he could just distinguish in a plaintive female voice the words O Clym come down and let me in He flushed hot with agitation Surely it is Eustacia he murmured If so she had indeed come to him unawares He hastily got a light dressed himself and went down On his flinging open the door the rays of the candle fell upon a woman closely wrapped up who at once came forward Thomasin he exclaimed in an indescribable tone of disappointment It is Thomasin and on such a night as this O where is Eustacia Thomasin it was wet frightened and panting Eustacia I don t know Clym but I can think she said with much perturbation Let me come in and rest I will explain this There is a great trouble brewing my husband and Eustacia What what I think my husband is going to leave me or do something dreadful I don t know what Clym will you go and see I have nobody to help me but you Eustacia has not yet come home No She went on breathlessly Then they are going to run off together He came indoors tonight about eight o clock and said in an off hand way Tamsie I have just found that I must go a journey When I said Tonight he said Where I asked him I cannot tell you at present he said I shall be back again tomorrow He then went and busied himself in looking up his things and took no notice of me at all I expected to see him start but he did not and then it came to be ten o clock when he said You had better go to bed I didn t know what to do and I went to bed I believe he thought I fell asleep for half an hour after that he came up and unlocked the oak chest we keep money in when we have much in the house and took out a roll of something which I believe was banknotes though I was not aware that he had em there These he must have got from the bank when he went there the other day What does he want banknotes for if he is only going off for a day When he had gone down I thought of Eustacia and how he had met her the night before I know he did meet her Clym for I followed him part of the way but I did not like to tell you when you called and so make you think ill of him as I did not think it was so serious Then I could not stay in bed I got up and dressed myself and when I heard him out in the stable I thought I would come and tell you So I came downstairs without any noise and slipped out Then he was not absolutely gone when you left No Will you dear Cousin Clym go and try to persuade him not to go He takes no notice of what I say and puts me off with the story of his going on a journey and will be home tomorrow and all that but I don t believe it I think you could influence him I ll go said Clym O Eustacia Thomasin carried in her arms a large bundle and having by this time seated herself she began to unroll it when a baby appeared as the kernel to the husks dry warm and unconscious of travel or rough weather Thomasin briefly kissed the baby and then found time to begin crying as she said I brought baby for I was afraid what might happen to her I suppose it will be her death but I couldn t leave her with Rachel Clym hastily put together the logs on the hearth raked abroad the embers which were scarcely yet extinct and blew up a flame with the bellows Dry yourself he said I ll go and get some more wood No no don t stay for that I ll make up the fire Will you go at once please will you Yeobright ran upstairs to finish dressing himself While he was gone another rapping came to the door This time there was no delusion that it might be Eustacia s the footsteps just preceding it had been heavy and slow Yeobright thinking it might possibly be Fairway with a note in answer descended again and opened the door Captain Vye he said to a dripping figure Is my granddaughter here said the captain No Then where is she I don t know But you ought to know you are her husband Only in name apparently said Clym with rising excitement I believe she means to elope tonight with Wildeve I am just going to look to it Well she has left my house she left about half an hour ago Who s sitting there My cousin Thomasin The captain bowed in a preoccupied way to her I only hope it is no worse than an elopement he said Worse What s worse than the worst a wife can do Well I have been told a strange tale Before starting in search of her I called up Charley my stable lad I missed my pistols the other day Pistols He said at the time that he took them down to clean He has now owned that he took them because he saw Eustacia looking curiously at them and she afterwards owned to him that she was thinking of taking her life but bound him to secrecy and promised never to think of such a thing again I hardly suppose she will ever have bravado enough to use one of them but it shows what has been lurking in her mind and people who think of that sort of thing once think of it again Where are the pistols Safely locked up O no she won t touch them again But there are more ways of letting out life than through a bullet hole What did you quarrel about so bitterly with her to drive her to all this You must have treated her badly indeed Well I was always against the marriage and I was right Are you going with me said Yeobright paying no attention to the captain s latter remark If so I can tell you what we quarrelled about as we walk along Where to To Wildeve s that was her destination depend upon it Thomasin here broke in still weeping He said he was only going on a sudden short journey but if so why did he want so much money O Clym what do you think will happen I am afraid that you my poor baby will soon have no father left to you I am off now said Yeobright stepping into the porch I would fain go with ee said the old man doubtfully But I begin to be afraid that my legs will hardly carry me there such a night as this I am not so young as I was If they are interrupted in their flight she will be sure to come back to me and I ought to be at the house to receive her But be it as twill I can t walk to the Quiet Woman and that s an end on t I ll go straight home It will perhaps be best said Clym Thomasin dry yourself and be as comfortable as you can With this he closed the door upon her and left the house in company with Captain Vye who parted from him outside the gate taking the middle path which led to Mistover Clym crossed by the right hand track towards the inn Thomasin being left alone took off some of her wet garments carried the baby upstairs to Clym s bed and then came down to the sitting room again where she made a larger fire and began drying herself The fire soon flared up the chimney giving the room an appearance of comfort that was doubled by contrast with the drumming of the storm without which snapped at the windowpanes and breathed into the chimney strange low utterances that seemed to be the prologue to some tragedy But the least part of Thomasin was in the house for her heart being at ease about the little girl upstairs she was mentally following Clym on his journey Having indulged in this imaginary peregrination for some considerable interval she became impressed with a sense of the intolerable slowness of time But she sat on The moment then came when she could scarcely sit longer and it was like a satire on her patience to remember that Clym could hardly have reached the inn as yet At last she went to the baby s bedside The child was sleeping soundly but her imagination of possibly disastrous events at her home the predominance within her of the unseen over the seen agitated her beyond endurance She could not refrain from going down and opening the door The rain still continued the candlelight falling upon the nearest drops and making glistening darts of them as they descended across the throng of invisible ones behind To plunge into that medium was to plunge into water slightly diluted with air But the difficulty of returning to her house at this moment made her all the more desirous of doing so anything was better than suspense I have come here well enough she said and why shouldn t I go back again It is a mistake for me to be away She hastily fetched the infant wrapped it up cloaked herself as before and shoveling the ashes over the fire to prevent accidents went into the open air Pausing first to put the door key in its old place behind the shutter she resolutely turned her face to the confronting pile of firmamental darkness beyond the palings and stepped into its midst But Thomasin s imagination being so actively engaged elsewhere the night and the weather had for her no terror beyond that of their actual discomfort and difficulty She was soon ascending Blooms End valley and traversing the undulations on the side of the hill The noise of the wind over the heath was shrill and as if it whistled for joy at finding a night so congenial as this Sometimes the path led her to hollows between thickets of tall and dripping bracken dead though not yet prostrate which enclosed her like a pool When they were more than usually tall she lifted the baby to the top of her head that it might be out of the reach of their drenching fronds On higher ground where the wind was brisk and sustained the rain flew in a level flight without sensible descent so that it was beyond all power to imagine the remoteness of the point at which it left the bosoms of the clouds Here self defence was impossible and individual drops stuck into her like the arrows into Saint Sebastian She was enabled to avoid puddles by the nebulous paleness which signified their presence though beside anything less dark than the heath they themselves would have appeared as blackness Yet in spite of all this Thomasin was not sorry that she had started To her there were not as to Eustacia demons in the air and malice in every bush and bough The drops which lashed her face were not scorpions but prosy rain Egdon in the mass was no monster whatever but impersonal open ground Her fears of the place were rational her dislikes of its worst moods reasonable At this time it was in her view a windy wet place in which a person might experience much discomfort lose the path without care and possibly catch cold If the path is well known the difficulty at such times of keeping therein is not altogether great from its familiar feel to the feet but once lost it is irrecoverable Owing to her baby who somewhat impeded Thomasin s view forward and distracted her mind she did at last lose the track This mishap occurred when she was descending an open slope about two thirds home Instead of attempting by wandering hither and thither the hopeless task of finding such a mere thread she went straight on trusting for guidance to her general knowledge of the contours which was scarcely surpassed by Clym s or by that of the heath croppers themselves At length Thomasin reached a hollow and began to discern through the rain a faint blotted radiance which presently assumed the oblong form of an open door She knew that no house stood hereabouts and was soon aware of the nature of the door by its height above the ground Why it is Diggory Venn s van surely she said A certain secluded spot near Rainbarrow was she knew often Venn s chosen centre when staying in this neighbourhood and she guessed at once that she had stumbled upon this mysterious retreat The question arose in her mind whether or not she should ask him to guide her into the path In her anxiety to reach home she decided that she would appeal to him notwithstanding the strangeness of appearing before his eyes at this place and season But when in pursuance of this resolve Thomasin reached the van and looked in she found it to be untenanted though there was no doubt that it was the reddleman s The fire was burning in the stove the lantern hung from the nail Round the doorway the floor was merely sprinkled with rain and not saturated which told her that the door had not long been opened While she stood uncertainly looking in Thomasin heard a footstep advancing from the darkness behind her and turning beheld the well known form in corduroy lurid from head to foot the lantern beams falling upon him through an intervening gauze of raindrops I thought you went down the slope he said without noticing her face How do you come back here again Diggory said Thomasin faintly Who are you said Venn still unperceiving And why were you crying so just now O Diggory don t you know me said she But of course you don t wrapped up like this What do you mean I have not been crying here and I have not been here before Venn then came nearer till he could see the illuminated side of her form missus Wildeve he exclaimed starting What a time for us to meet And the baby too What dreadful thing can have brought you out on such a night as this She could not immediately answer and without asking her permission he hopped into his van took her by the arm and drew her up after him What is it he continued when they stood within I have lost my way coming from Blooms End and I am in a great hurry to get home Please show me as quickly as you can It is so silly of me not to know Egdon better and I cannot think how I came to lose the path Show me quickly Diggory please Yes of course I will go with ee But you came to me before this missus Wildeve I only came this minute That s strange I was lying down here asleep about five minutes ago with the door shut to keep out the weather when the brushing of a woman s clothes over the heath bushes just outside woke me up for I don t sleep heavy and at the same time I heard a sobbing or crying from the same woman I opened my door and held out my lantern and just as far as the light would reach I saw a woman she turned her head when the light sheened on her and then hurried on downhill I hung up the lantern and was curious enough to pull on my things and dog her a few steps but I could see nothing of her any more That was where I had been when you came up and when I saw you I thought you were the same one Perhaps it was one of the heathfolk going home No it couldn t be Tis too late The noise of her gown over the he th was of a whistling sort that nothing but silk will make It wasn t I then My dress is not silk you see Are we anywhere in a line between Mistover and the inn Well yes not far out Ah I wonder if it was she Diggory I must go at once She jumped down from the van before he was aware when Venn unhooked the lantern and leaped down after her I ll take the baby ma am he said You must be tired out by the weight Thomasin hesitated a moment and then delivered the baby into Venn s hands Don t squeeze her Diggory she said or hurt her little arm and keep the cloak close over her like this so that the rain may not drop in her face I will said Venn earnestly As if I could hurt anything belonging to you I only meant accidentally said Thomasin The baby is dry enough but you are pretty wet said the reddleman when in closing the door of his cart to padlock it he noticed on the floor a ring of water drops where her cloak had hung from her Thomasin followed him as he wound right and left to avoid the larger bushes stopping occasionally and covering the lantern while he looked over his shoulder to gain some idea of the position of Rainbarrow above them which it was necessary to keep directly behind their backs to preserve a proper course You are sure the rain does not fall upon baby Quite sure May I ask how old he is ma am He said Thomasin reproachfully Anybody can see better than that in a moment She is nearly two months old How far is it now to the inn A little over a quarter of a mile Will you walk a little faster I was afraid you could not keep up I am very anxious to get there Ah there is a light from the window Tis not from the window That s a gig lamp to the best of my belief O said Thomasin in despair I wish I had been there sooner give me the baby Diggory you can go back now I must go all the way said Venn There is a quag between us and that light and you will walk into it up to your neck unless I take you round But the light is at the inn and there is no quag in front of that No the light is below the inn some two or three hundred yards Never mind said Thomasin hurriedly Go towards the light and not towards the inn Yes answered Venn swerving round in obedience and after a pause I wish you would tell me what this great trouble is I think you have proved that I can be trusted There are some things that cannot be cannot be told to And then her heart rose into her throat and she could say no more nine Sights and Sounds Draw the Wanderers Together Having seen Eustacia s signal from the hill at eight o clock Wildeve immediately prepared to assist her in her flight and as he hoped accompany her He was somewhat perturbed and his manner of informing Thomasin that he was going on a journey was in itself sufficient to rouse her suspicions When she had gone to bed he collected the few articles he would require and went upstairs to the money chest whence he took a tolerably bountiful sum in notes which had been advanced to him on the property he was so soon to have in possession to defray expenses incidental to the removal He then went to the stable and coach house to assure himself that the horse gig and harness were in a fit condition for a long drive Nearly half an hour was spent thus and on returning to the house Wildeve had no thought of Thomasin being anywhere but in bed He had told the stable lad not to stay up leading the boy to understand that his departure would be at three or four in the morning for this though an exceptional hour was less strange than midnight the time actually agreed on the packet from Budmouth sailing between one and two At last all was quiet and he had nothing to do but to wait By no effort could he shake off the oppression of spirits which he had experienced ever since his last meeting with Eustacia but he hoped there was that in his situation which money could cure He had persuaded himself that to act not ungenerously towards his gentle wife by settling on her the half of his property and with chivalrous devotion towards another and greater woman by sharing her fate was possible And though he meant to adhere to Eustacia s instructions to the letter to deposit her where she wished and to leave her should that be her will the spell that she had cast over him intensified and his heart was beating fast in the anticipated futility of such commands in the face of a mutual wish that they should throw in their lot together He would not allow himself to dwell long upon these conjectures maxims and hopes and at twenty minutes to twelve he again went softly to the stable harnessed the horse and lit the lamps whence taking the horse by the head he led him with the covered car out of the yard to a spot by the roadside some quarter of a mile below the inn Here Wildeve waited slightly sheltered from the driving rain by a high bank that had been cast up at this place Along the surface of the road where lit by the lamps the loosened gravel and small stones scudded and clicked together before the wind which leaving them in heaps plunged into the heath and boomed across the bushes into darkness Only one sound rose above this din of weather and that was the roaring of a ten hatch weir to the southward from a river in the meads which formed the boundary of the heath in this direction He lingered on in perfect stillness till he began to fancy that the midnight hour must have struck A very strong doubt had arisen in his mind if Eustacia would venture down the hill in such weather yet knowing her nature he felt that she might Poor thing tis like her ill luck he murmured At length he turned to the lamp and looked at his watch To his surprise it was nearly a quarter past midnight He now wished that he had driven up the circuitous road to Mistover a plan not adopted because of the enormous length of the route in proportion to that of the pedestrian s path down the open hillside and the consequent increase of labour for the horse At this moment a footstep approached but the light of the lamps being in a different direction the comer was not visible The step paused then came on again Eustacia said Wildeve The person came forward and the light fell upon the form of Clym glistening with wet whom Wildeve immediately recognized but Wildeve who stood behind the lamp was not at once recognized by Yeobright He stopped as if in doubt whether this waiting vehicle could have anything to do with the flight of his wife or not The sight of Yeobright at once banished Wildeve s sober feelings who saw him again as the deadly rival from whom Eustacia was to be kept at all hazards Hence Wildeve did not speak in the hope that Clym would pass by without particular inquiry While they both hung thus in hesitation a dull sound became audible above the storm and wind Its origin was unmistakable it was the fall of a body into the stream in the adjoining mead apparently at a point near the weir Both started Good God can it be she said Clym Why should it be she said Wildeve in his alarm forgetting that he had hitherto screened himself Ah that s you you traitor is it cried Yeobright Why should it be she Because last week she would have put an end to her life if she had been able She ought to have been watched Take one of the lamps and come with me Yeobright seized the one on his side and hastened on Wildeve did not wait to unfasten the other but followed at once along the meadow track to the weir a little in the rear of Clym Shadwater Weir had at its foot a large circular pool fifty feet in diameter into which the water flowed through ten huge hatches raised and lowered by a winch and cogs in the ordinary manner The sides of the pool were of masonry to prevent the water from washing away the bank but the force of the stream in winter was sometimes such as to undermine the retaining wall and precipitate it into the hole Clym reached the hatches the framework of which was shaken to its foundations by the velocity of the current Nothing but the froth of the waves could be discerned in the pool below He got upon the plank bridge over the race and holding to the rail that the wind might not blow him off crossed to the other side of the river There he leant over the wall and lowered the lamp only to behold the vortex formed at the curl of the returning current Wildeve meanwhile had arrived on the former side and the light from Yeobright s lamp shed a flecked and agitated radiance across the weir pool revealing to the ex engineer the tumbling courses of the currents from the hatches above Across this gashed and puckered mirror a dark body was slowly borne by one of the backward currents O my darling exclaimed Wildeve in an agonized voice and without showing sufficient presence of mind even to throw off his greatcoat he leaped into the boiling caldron Yeobright could now also discern the floating body though but indistinctly and imagining from Wildeve s plunge that there was life to be saved he was about to leap after Bethinking himself of a wiser plan he placed the lamp against a post to make it stand upright and running round to the lower part of the pool where there was no wall he sprang in and boldly waded upwards towards the deeper portion Here he was taken off his legs and in swimming was carried round into the centre of the basin where he perceived Wildeve struggling While these hasty actions were in progress here Venn and Thomasin had been toiling through the lower corner of the heath in the direction of the light They had not been near enough to the river to hear the plunge but they saw the removal of the carriage lamp and watched its motion into the mead As soon as they reached the car and horse Venn guessed that something new was amiss and hastened to follow in the course of the moving light Venn walked faster than Thomasin and came to the weir alone The lamp placed against the post by Clym still shone across the water and the reddleman observed something floating motionless Being encumbered with the infant he ran back to meet Thomasin Take the baby please missus Wildeve he said hastily Run home with her call the stable lad and make him send down to me any men who may be living near Somebody has fallen into the weir Thomasin took the child and ran When she came to the covered car the horse though fresh from the stable was standing perfectly still as if conscious of misfortune She saw for the first time whose it was She nearly fainted and would have been unable to proceed another step but that the necessity of preserving the little girl from harm nerved her to an amazing self control In this agony of suspense she entered the house put the baby in a place of safety woke the lad and the female domestic and ran out to give the alarm at the nearest cottage Diggory having returned to the brink of the pool observed that the small upper hatches or floats were withdrawn He found one of these lying upon the grass and taking it under one arm and with his lantern in his hand entered at the bottom of the pool as Clym had done As soon as he began to be in deep water he flung himself across the hatch thus supported he was able to keep afloat as long as he chose holding the lantern aloft with his disengaged hand Propelled by his feet he steered round and round the pool ascending each time by one of the back streams and descending in the middle of the current At first he could see nothing Then amidst the glistening of the whirlpools and the white clots of foam he distinguished a woman s bonnet floating alone His search was now under the left wall when something came to the surface almost close beside him It was not as he had expected a woman but a man The reddleman put the ring of the lantern between his teeth seized the floating man by the collar and holding on to the hatch with his remaining arm struck out into the strongest race by which the unconscious man the hatch and himself were carried down the stream As soon as Venn found his feet dragging over the pebbles of the shallower part below he secured his footing and waded towards the brink There where the water stood at about the height of his waist he flung away the hatch and attempted to drag forth the man This was a matter of great difficulty and he found as the reason that the legs of the unfortunate stranger were tightly embraced by the arms of another man who had hitherto been entirely beneath the surface At this moment his heart bounded to hear footsteps running towards him and two men roused by Thomasin appeared at the brink above They ran to where Venn was and helped him in lifting out the apparently drowned persons separating them and laying them out upon the grass Venn turned the light upon their faces The one who had been uppermost was Yeobright he who had been completely submerged was Wildeve Now we must search the hole again said Venn A woman is in there somewhere Get a pole One of the men went to the footbridge and tore off the handrail The reddleman and the two others then entered the water together from below as before and with their united force probed the pool forwards to where it sloped down to its central depth Venn was not mistaken in supposing that any person who had sunk for the last time would be washed down to this point for when they had examined to about halfway across something impeded their thrust Pull it forward said Venn and they raked it in with the pole till it was close to their feet Venn vanished under the stream and came up with an armful of wet drapery enclosing a woman s cold form which was all that remained of the desperate Eustacia When they reached the bank there stood Thomasin in a stress of grief bending over the two unconscious ones who already lay there The horse and cart were brought to the nearest point in the road and it was the work of a few minutes only to place the three in the vehicle Venn led on the horse supporting Thomasin upon his arm and the two men followed till they reached the inn The woman who had been shaken out of her sleep by Thomasin had hastily dressed herself and lighted a fire the other servant being left to snore on in peace at the back of the house The insensible forms of Eustacia Clym and Wildeve were then brought in and laid on the carpet with their feet to the fire when such restorative processes as could be thought of were adopted at once the stableman being in the meantime sent for a doctor But there seemed to be not a whiff of life in either of the bodies Then Thomasin whose stupor of grief had been thrust off awhile by frantic action applied a bottle of hartshorn to Clym s nostrils having tried it in vain upon the other two He sighed Clym s alive she exclaimed He soon breathed distinctly and again and again did she attempt to revive her husband by the same means but Wildeve gave no sign There was too much reason to think that he and Eustacia both were for ever beyond the reach of stimulating perfumes Their exertions did not relax till the doctor arrived when one by one the senseless three were taken upstairs and put into warm beds Venn soon felt himself relieved from further attendance and went to the door scarcely able yet to realize the strange catastrophe that had befallen the family in which he took so great an interest Thomasin surely would be broken down by the sudden and overwhelming nature of this event No firm and sensible missus Yeobright lived now to support the gentle girl through the ordeal and whatever an unimpassioned spectator might think of her loss of such a husband as Wildeve there could be no doubt that for the moment she was distracted and horrified by the blow As for himself not being privileged to go to her and comfort her he saw no reason for waiting longer in a house where he remained only as a stranger He returned across the heath to his van The fire was not yet out and everything remained as he had left it Venn now bethought himself of his clothes which were saturated with water to the weight of lead He changed them spread them before the fire and lay down to sleep But it was more than he could do to rest here while excited by a vivid imagination of the turmoil they were in at the house he had quitted and blaming himself for coming away he dressed in another suit locked up the door and again hastened across to the inn Rain was still falling heavily when he entered the kitchen A bright fire was shining from the hearth and two women were bustling about one of whom was Olly Dowden Well how is it going on now said Venn in a whisper mister Yeobright is better but missus Yeobright and mister Wildeve are dead and cold The doctor says they were quite gone before they were out of the water Ah I thought as much when I hauled em up And missus Wildeve She is as well as can be expected The doctor had her put between blankets for she was almost as wet as they that had been in the river poor young thing You don t seem very dry reddleman Oh tis not much I have changed my things This is only a little dampness I ve got coming through the rain again Stand by the fire Mis ess says you be to have whatever you want and she was sorry when she was told that you d gone away Venn drew near to the fireplace and looked into the flames in an absent mood The steam came from his leggings and ascended the chimney with the smoke while he thought of those who were upstairs Two were corpses one had barely escaped the jaws of death another was sick and a widow The last occasion on which he had lingered by that fireplace was when the raffle was in progress when Wildeve was alive and well Thomasin active and smiling in the next room Yeobright and Eustacia just made husband and wife and missus Yeobright living at Blooms End It had seemed at that time that the then position of affairs was good for at least twenty years to come Yet of all the circle he himself was the only one whose situation had not materially changed While he ruminated a footstep descended the stairs It was the nurse who brought in her hand a rolled mass of wet paper The woman was so engrossed with her occupation that she hardly saw Venn She took from a cupboard some pieces of twine which she strained across the fireplace tying the end of each piece to the firedog previously pulled forward for the purpose and unrolling the wet papers she began pinning them one by one to the strings in a manner of clothes on a line What be they said Venn Poor master s banknotes she answered They were found in his pocket when they undressed him Then he was not coming back again for some time said Venn That we shall never know said she Venn was loth to depart for all on earth that interested him lay under this roof As nobody in the house had any more sleep that night except the two who slept for ever there was no reason why he should not remain So he retired into the niche of the fireplace where he had used to sit and there he continued watching the steam from the double row of banknotes as they waved backwards and forwards in the draught of the chimney till their flaccidity was changed to dry crispness throughout Then the woman came and unpinned them and folding them together carried the handful upstairs Presently the doctor appeared from above with the look of a man who could do no more and pulling on his gloves went out of the house the trotting of his horse soon dying away upon the road At four o clock there was a gentle knock at the door It was from Charley who had been sent by Captain Vye to inquire if anything had been heard of Eustacia The girl who admitted him looked in his face as if she did not know what answer to return and showed him in to where Venn was seated saying to the reddleman Will you tell him please Venn told Charley s only utterance was a feeble indistinct sound He stood quite still then he burst out spasmodically I shall see her once more I dare say you may see her said Diggory gravely But hadn t you better run and tell Captain Vye Yes yes Only I do hope I shall see her just once again You shall said a low voice behind and starting round they beheld by the dim light a thin pallid almost spectral form wrapped in a blanket and looking like Lazarus coming from the tomb It was Yeobright Neither Venn nor Charley spoke and Clym continued You shall see her There will be time enough to tell the captain when it gets daylight You would like to see her too would you not Diggory She looks very beautiful now Venn assented by rising to his feet and with Charley he followed Clym to the foot of the staircase where he took off his boots Charley did the same They followed Yeobright upstairs to the landing where there was a candle burning which Yeobright took in his hand and with it led the way into an adjoining room Here he went to the bedside and folded back the sheet They stood silently looking upon Eustacia who as she lay there still in death eclipsed all her living phases Pallor did not include all the quality of her complexion which seemed more than whiteness it was almost light The expression of her finely carved mouth was pleasant as if a sense of dignity had just compelled her to leave off speaking Eternal rigidity had seized upon it in a momentary transition between fervour and resignation Her black hair was looser now than either of them had ever seen it before and surrounded her brow like a forest The stateliness of look which had been almost too marked for a dweller in a country domicile had at last found an artistically happy background Nobody spoke till at length Clym covered her and turned aside Now come here he said They went to a recess in the same room and there on a smaller bed lay another figure Wildeve Less repose was visible in his face than in Eustacia s but the same luminous youthfulness overspread it and the least sympathetic observer would have felt at sight of him now that he was born for a higher destiny than this The only sign upon him of his recent struggle for life was in his fingertips which were worn and sacrificed in his dying endeavours to obtain a hold on the face of the weir wall Yeobright s manner had been so quiet he had uttered so few syllables since his reappearance that Venn imagined him resigned It was only when they had left the room and stood upon the landing that the true state of his mind was apparent Here he said with a wild smile inclining his head towards the chamber in which Eustacia lay She is the second woman I have killed this year I was a great cause of my mother s death and I am the chief cause of hers How said Venn I spoke cruel words to her and she left my house I did not invite her back till it was too late It is I who ought to have drowned myself It would have been a charity to the living had the river overwhelmed me and borne her up But I cannot die Those who ought to have lived lie dead and here am I alive But you can t charge yourself with crimes in that way said Venn You may as well say that the parents be the cause of a murder by the child for without the parents the child would never have been begot Yes Venn that is very true but you don t know all the circumstances If it had pleased God to put an end to me it would have been a good thing for all But I am getting used to the horror of my existence They say that a time comes when men laugh at misery through long acquaintance with it Surely that time will soon come to me Your aim has always been good said Venn Why should you say such desperate things No they are not desperate They are only hopeless and my great regret is that for what I have done no man or law can punish me BOOK SIX AFTERCOURSES one The Inevitable Movement Onward The story of the deaths of Eustacia and Wildeve was told throughout Egdon and far beyond for many weeks and months All the known incidents of their love were enlarged distorted touched up and modified till the original reality bore but a slight resemblance to the counterfeit presentation by surrounding tongues Yet upon the whole neither the man nor the woman lost dignity by sudden death Misfortune had struck them gracefully cutting off their erratic histories with a catastrophic dash instead of as with many attenuating each life to an uninteresting meagreness through long years of wrinkles neglect and decay On those most nearly concerned the effect was somewhat different Strangers who had heard of many such cases now merely heard of one more but immediately where a blow falls no previous imaginings amount to appreciable preparation for it The very suddenness of her bereavement dulled to some extent Thomasin s feelings yet irrationally enough a consciousness that the husband she had lost ought to have been a better man did not lessen her mourning at all On the contrary this fact seemed at first to set off the dead husband in his young wife s eyes and to be the necessary cloud to the rainbow But the horrors of the unknown had passed Vague misgivings about her future as a deserted wife were at an end The worst had once been matter of trembling conjecture it was now matter of reason only a limited badness Her chief interest the little Eustacia still remained There was humility in her grief no defiance in her attitude and when this is the case a shaken spirit is apt to be stilled Could Thomasin s mournfulness now and Eustacia s serenity during life have been reduced to common measure they would have touched the same mark nearly But Thomasin s former brightness made shadow of that which in a sombre atmosphere was light itself The spring came and calmed her the summer came and soothed her the autumn arrived and she began to be comforted for her little girl was strong and happy growing in size and knowledge every day Outward events flattered Thomasin not a little Wildeve had died intestate and she and the child were his only relatives When administration had been granted all the debts paid and the residue of her husband s uncle s property had come into her hands it was found that the sum waiting to be invested for her own and the child s benefit was little less than ten thousand pounds Where should she live The obvious place was Blooms End The old rooms it is true were not much higher than the between decks of a frigate necessitating a sinking in the floor under the new clock case she brought from the inn and the removal of the handsome brass knobs on its head before there was height for it to stand but such as the rooms were there were plenty of them and the place was endeared to her by every early recollection Clym very gladly admitted her as a tenant confining his own existence to two rooms at the top of the back staircase where he lived on quietly shut off from Thomasin and the three servants she had thought fit to indulge in now that she was a mistress of money going his own ways and thinking his own thoughts His sorrows had made some change in his outward appearance and yet the alteration was chiefly within It might have been said that he had a wrinkled mind He had no enemies and he could get nobody to reproach him which was why he so bitterly reproached himself He did sometimes think he had been ill used by fortune so far as to say that to be born is a palpable dilemma and that instead of men aiming to advance in life with glory they should calculate how to retreat out of it without shame But that he and his had been sarcastically and pitilessly handled in having such irons thrust into their souls he did not maintain long It is usually so except with the sternest of men Human beings in their generous endeavour to construct a hypothesis that shall not degrade a First Cause have always hesitated to conceive a dominant power of lower moral quality than their own and even while they sit down and weep by the waters of Babylon invent excuses for the oppression which prompts their tears Thus though words of solace were vainly uttered in his presence he found relief in a direction of his own choosing when left to himself For a man of his habits the house and the hundred and twenty pounds a year which he had inherited from his mother were enough to supply all worldly needs Resources do not depend upon gross amounts but upon the proportion of spendings to takings He frequently walked the heath alone when the past seized upon him with its shadowy hand and held him there to listen to its tale His imagination would then people the spot with its ancient inhabitants forgotten Celtic tribes trod their tracks about him and he could almost live among them look in their faces and see them standing beside the barrows which swelled around untouched and perfect as at the time of their erection Those of the dyed barbarians who had chosen the cultivable tracts were in comparison with those who had left their marks here as writers on paper beside writers on parchment Their records had perished long ago by the plough while the works of these remained Yet they all had lived and died unconscious of the different fates awaiting their relics It reminded him that unforeseen factors operate in the evolution of immortality Winter again came round with its winds frosts tame robins and sparkling starlight The year previous Thomasin had hardly been conscious of the season s advance this year she laid her heart open to external influences of every kind The life of this sweet cousin her baby and her servants came to Clym s senses only in the form of sounds through a wood partition as he sat over books of exceptionally large type but his ear became at last so accustomed to these slight noises from the other part of the house that he almost could witness the scenes they signified A faint beat of half seconds conjured up Thomasin rocking the cradle a wavering hum meant that she was singing the baby to sleep a crunching of sand as between millstones raised the picture of Humphrey s Fairway s or Sam s heavy feet crossing the stone floor of the kitchen a light boyish step and a gay tune in a high key betokened a visit from Grandfer Cantle a sudden break off in the Grandfer s utterances implied the application to his lips of a mug of small beer a bustling and slamming of doors meant starting to go to market for Thomasin in spite of her added scope of gentility led a ludicrously narrow life to the end that she might save every possible pound for her little daughter One summer day Clym was in the garden immediately outside the parlour window which was as usual open He was looking at the pot flowers on the sill they had been revived and restored by Thomasin to the state in which his mother had left them He heard a slight scream from Thomasin who was sitting inside the room O how you frightened me she said to someone who had entered I thought you were the ghost of yourself Clym was curious enough to advance a little further and look in at the window To his astonishment there stood within the room Diggory Venn no longer a reddleman but exhibiting the strangely altered hues of an ordinary Christian countenance white shirt front light flowered waistcoat blue spotted neckerchief and bottle green coat Nothing in this appearance was at all singular but the fact of its great difference from what he had formerly been Red and all approach to red was carefully excluded from every article of clothes upon him for what is there that persons just out of harness dread so much as reminders of the trade which has enriched them Yeobright went round to the door and entered I was so alarmed said Thomasin smiling from one to the other I couldn t believe that he had got white of his own accord It seemed supernatural I gave up dealing in reddle last Christmas said Venn It was a profitable trade and I found that by that time I had made enough to take the dairy of fifty cows that my father had in his lifetime I always thought of getting to that place again if I changed at all and now I am there How did you manage to become white Diggory Thomasin asked I turned so by degrees ma am You look much better than ever you did before Venn appeared confused and Thomasin seeing how inadvertently she had spoken to a man who might possibly have tender feelings for her still blushed a little Clym saw nothing of this and added good humouredly What shall we have to frighten Thomasin s baby with now you have become a human being again Sit down Diggory said Thomasin and stay to tea Venn moved as if he would retire to the kitchen when Thomasin said with pleasant pertness as she went on with some sewing Of course you must sit down here And where does your fifty cow dairy lie mister Venn At Stickleford about two miles to the right of Alderworth ma am where the meads begin I have thought that if mister Yeobright would like to pay me a visit sometimes he shouldn t stay away for want of asking I ll not bide to tea this afternoon thank ee for I ve got something on hand that must be settled Tis Maypole day tomorrow and the Shadwater folk have clubbed with a few of your neighbours here to have a pole just outside your palings in the heath as it is a nice green place Venn waved his elbow towards the patch in front of the house I have been talking to Fairway about it he continued and I said to him that before we put up the pole it would be as well to ask missus Wildeve I can say nothing against it she answered Our property does not reach an inch further than the white palings But you might not like to see a lot of folk going crazy round a stick under your very nose I shall have no objection at all Venn soon after went away and in the evening Yeobright strolled as far as Fairway s cottage It was a lovely May sunset and the birch trees which grew on this margin of the vast Egdon wilderness had put on their new leaves delicate as butterflies wings and diaphanous as amber Beside Fairway s dwelling was an open space recessed from the road and here were now collected all the young people from within a radius of a couple of miles The pole lay with one end supported on a trestle and women were engaged in wreathing it from the top downwards with wild flowers The instincts of merry England lingered on here with exceptional vitality and the symbolic customs which tradition has attached to each season of the year were yet a reality on Egdon Indeed the impulses of all such outlandish hamlets are pagan still in these spots homage to nature self adoration frantic gaieties fragments of Teutonic rites to divinities whose names are forgotten seem in some way or other to have survived mediaeval doctrine Yeobright did not interrupt the preparations and went home again The next morning when Thomasin withdrew the curtains of her bedroom window there stood the Maypole in the middle of the green its top cutting into the sky It had sprung up in the night or rather early morning like Jack s bean stalk She opened the casement to get a better view of the garlands and posies that adorned it The sweet perfume of the flowers had already spread into the surrounding air which being free from every taint conducted to her lips a full measure of the fragrance received from the spire of blossom in its midst At the top of the pole were crossed hoops decked with small flowers beneath these came a milk white zone of Maybloom then a zone of bluebells then of cowslips then of lilacs then of ragged robins daffodils and so on till the lowest stage was reached Thomasin noticed all these and was delighted that the May revel was to be so near When afternoon came people began to gather on the green and Yeobright was interested enough to look out upon them from the open window of his room Soon after this Thomasin walked out from the door immediately below and turned her eyes up to her cousin s face She was dressed more gaily than Yeobright had ever seen her dressed since the time of Wildeve s death eighteen months before since the day of her marriage even she had not exhibited herself to such advantage How pretty you look today Thomasin he said Is it because of the Maypole Not altogether And then she blushed and dropped her eyes which he did not specially observe though her manner seemed to him to be rather peculiar considering that she was only addressing himself Could it be possible that she had put on her summer clothes to please him He recalled her conduct towards him throughout the last few weeks when they had often been working together in the garden just as they had formerly done when they were boy and girl under his mother s eye What if her interest in him were not so entirely that of a relative as it had formerly been To Yeobright any possibility of this sort was a serious matter and he almost felt troubled at the thought of it Every pulse of loverlike feeling which had not been stilled during Eustacia s lifetime had gone into the grave with her His passion for her had occurred too far on in his manhood to leave fuel enough on hand for another fire of that sort as may happen with more boyish loves Even supposing him capable of loving again that love would be a plant of slow and laboured growth and in the end only small and sickly like an autumn hatched bird He was so distressed by this new complexity that when the enthusiastic brass band arrived and struck up which it did about five o clock with apparently wind enough among its members to blow down his house he withdrew from his rooms by the back door went down the garden through the gate in the hedge and away out of sight He could not bear to remain in the presence of enjoyment today though he had tried hard Nothing was seen of him for four hours When he came back by the same path it was dusk and the dews were coating every green thing The boisterous music had ceased but entering the premises as he did from behind he could not see if the May party had all gone till he had passed through Thomasin s division of the house to the front door Thomasin was standing within the porch alone She looked at him reproachfully You went away just when it began Clym she said Yes I felt I could not join in You went out with them of course No I did not You appeared to be dressed on purpose Yes but I could not go out alone so many people were there One is there now Yeobright strained his eyes across the dark green patch beyond the paling and near the black form of the Maypole he discerned a shadowy figure sauntering idly up and down Who is it he said mister Venn said Thomasin You might have asked him to come in I think Tamsie He has been very kind to you first and last I will now she said and acting on the impulse went through the wicket to where Venn stood under the Maypole It is mister Venn I think she inquired Venn started as if he had not seen her artful man that he was and said Yes Will you come in I am afraid that I I have seen you dancing this evening and you had the very best of the girls for your partners Is it that you won t come in because you wish to stand here and think over the past hours of enjoyment Well that s partly it said mister Venn with ostentatious sentiment But the main reason why I am biding here like this is that I want to wait till the moon rises To see how pretty the Maypole looks in the moonlight No To look for a glove that was dropped by one of the maidens Thomasin was speechless with surprise That a man who had to walk some four or five miles to his home should wait here for such a reason pointed to only one conclusion the man must be amazingly interested in that glove s owner Were you dancing with her Diggory she asked in a voice which revealed that he had made himself considerably more interesting to her by this disclosure No he sighed And you will not come in then Not tonight thank you ma am Shall I lend you a lantern to look for the young person s glove mister Venn O no it is not necessary missus Wildeve thank you The moon will rise in a few minutes Thomasin went back to the porch Is he coming in said Clym who had been waiting where she had left him He would rather not tonight she said and then passed by him into the house whereupon Clym too retired to his own rooms When Clym was gone Thomasin crept upstairs in the dark and just listening by the cot to assure herself that the child was asleep she went to the window gently lifted the corner of the white curtain and looked out Venn was still there She watched the growth of the faint radiance appearing in the sky by the eastern hill till presently the edge of the moon burst upwards and flooded the valley with light Diggory s form was now distinct on the green he was moving about in a bowed attitude evidently scanning the grass for the precious missing article walking in zigzags right and left till he should have passed over every foot of the ground How very ridiculous Thomasin murmured to herself in a tone which was intended to be satirical To think that a man should be so silly as to go mooning about like that for a girl s glove A respectable dairyman too and a man of money as he is now What a pity At last Venn appeared to find it whereupon he stood up and raised it to his lips Then placing it in his breastpocket the nearest receptacle to a man s heart permitted by modern raiment he ascended the valley in a mathematically direct line towards his distant home in the meadows two Thomasin Walks in a Green Place by the Roman Road Clym saw little of Thomasin for several days after this and when they met she was more silent than usual At length he asked her what she was thinking of so intently I am thoroughly perplexed she said candidly I cannot for my life think who it is that Diggory Venn is so much in love with None of the girls at the Maypole were good enough for him and yet she must have been there Clym tried to imagine Venn s choice for a moment but ceasing to be interested in the question he went on again with his gardening No clearing up of the mystery was granted her for some time But one afternoon Thomasin was upstairs getting ready for a walk when she had occasion to come to the landing and call Rachel Rachel was a girl about thirteen who carried the baby out for airings and she came upstairs at the call Have you seen one of my last new gloves about the house Rachel inquired Thomasin It is the fellow to this one Rachel did not reply Why don t you answer said her mistress I think it is lost ma am Lost Who lost it I have never worn them but once Rachel appeared as one dreadfully troubled and at last began to cry Please ma am on the day of the Maypole I had none to wear and I seed yours on the table and I thought I would borrow em I did not mean to hurt em at all but one of them got lost Somebody gave me some money to buy another pair for you but I have not been able to go anywhere to get em Who s somebody mister Venn Did he know it was my glove Yes I told him Thomasin was so surprised by the explanation that she quite forgot to lecture the girl who glided silently away Thomasin did not move further than to turn her eyes upon the grass plat where the Maypole had stood She remained thinking then said to herself that she would not go out that afternoon but would work hard at the baby s unfinished lovely plaid frock cut on the cross in the newest fashion How she managed to work hard and yet do no more than she had done at the end of two hours would have been a mystery to anyone not aware that the recent incident was of a kind likely to divert her industry from a manual to a mental channel Next day she went her ways as usual and continued her custom of walking in the heath with no other companion than little Eustacia now of the age when it is a matter of doubt with such characters whether they are intended to walk through the world on their hands or on their feet so that they get into painful complications by trying both It was very pleasant to Thomasin when she had carried the child to some lonely place to give her a little private practice on the green turf and shepherd s thyme which formed a soft mat to fall headlong upon them when equilibrium was lost Once when engaged in this system of training and stooping to remove bits of stick fern stalks and other such fragments from the child s path that the journey might not be brought to an untimely end by some insuperable barrier a quarter of an inch high she was alarmed by discovering that a man on horseback was almost close beside her the soft natural carpet having muffled the horse s tread The rider who was Venn waved his hat in the air and bowed gallantly Diggory give me my glove said Thomasin whose manner it was under any circumstances to plunge into the midst of a subject which engrossed her Venn immediately dismounted put his hand in his breastpocket and handed the glove Thank you It was very good of you to take care of it It is very good of you to say so O no I was quite glad to find you had it Everybody gets so indifferent that I was surprised to know you thought of me If you had remembered what I was once you wouldn t have been surprised Ah no she said quickly But men of your character are mostly so independent What is my character he asked I don t exactly know said Thomasin simply except it is to cover up your feelings under a practical manner and only to show them when you are alone Ah how do you know that said Venn strategically Because said she stopping to put the little girl who had managed to get herself upside down right end up again because I do You mustn t judge by folks in general said Venn Still I don t know much what feelings are nowadays I have got so mixed up with business of one sort and t other that my soft sentiments are gone off in vapour like Yes I am given up body and soul to the making of money Money is all my dream O Diggory how wicked said Thomasin reproachfully and looking at him in exact balance between taking his words seriously and judging them as said to tease her Yes tis rather a rum course said Venn in the bland tone of one comfortably resigned to sins he could no longer overcome You who used to be so nice Well that s an argument I rather like because what a man has once been he may be again Thomasin blushed Except that it is rather harder now Venn continued Why she asked Because you be richer than you were at that time O no not much I have made it nearly all over to the baby as it was my duty to do except just enough to live on I am rather glad of that said Venn softly and regarding her from the corner of his eye for it makes it easier for us to be friendly Thomasin blushed again and when a few more words had been said of a not unpleasing kind Venn mounted his horse and rode on This conversation had passed in a hollow of the heath near the old Roman road a place much frequented by Thomasin And it might have been observed that she did not in future walk that way less often from having met Venn there now Whether or not Venn abstained from riding thither because he had met Thomasin in the same place might easily have been guessed from her proceedings about two months later in the same year three The Serious Discourse of Clym with His Cousin Throughout this period Yeobright had more or less pondered on his duty to his cousin Thomasin He could not help feeling that it would be a pitiful waste of sweet material if the tender natured thing should be doomed from this early stage of her life onwards to dribble away her winsome qualities on lonely gorse and fern But he felt this as an economist merely and not as a lover His passion for Eustacia had been a sort of conserve of his whole life and he had nothing more of that supreme quality left to bestow So far the obvious thing was not to entertain any idea of marriage with Thomasin even to oblige her But this was not all Years ago there had been in his mother s mind a great fancy about Thomasin and himself It had not positively amounted to a desire but it had always been a favourite dream That they should be man and wife in good time if the happiness of neither were endangered thereby was the fancy in question So that what course save one was there now left for any son who reverenced his mother s memory as Yeobright did It is an unfortunate fact that any particular whim of parents which might have been dispersed by half an hour s conversation during their lives becomes sublimated by their deaths into a fiat the most absolute with such results to conscientious children as those parents had they lived would have been the first to decry Had only Yeobright s own future been involved he would have proposed to Thomasin with a ready heart He had nothing to lose by carrying out a dead mother s hope But he dreaded to contemplate Thomasin wedded to the mere corpse of a lover that he now felt himself to be He had but three activities alive in him One was his almost daily walk to the little graveyard wherein his mother lay another his just as frequent visits by night to the more distant enclosure which numbered his Eustacia among its dead the third was self preparation for a vocation which alone seemed likely to satisfy his cravings that of an itinerant preacher of the eleventh commandment It was difficult to believe that Thomasin would be cheered by a husband with such tendencies as these Yet he resolved to ask her and let her decide for herself It was even with a pleasant sense of doing his duty that he went downstairs to her one evening for this purpose when the sun was printing on the valley the same long shadow of the housetop that he had seen lying there times out of number while his mother lived Thomasin was not in her room and he found her in the front garden I have long been wanting Thomasin he began to say something about a matter that concerns both our futures And you are going to say it now she remarked quickly colouring as she met his gaze Do stop a minute Clym and let me speak first for oddly enough I have been wanting to say something to you By all means say on Tamsie I suppose nobody can overhear us she went on casting her eyes around and lowering her voice Well first you will promise me this that you won t be angry and call me anything harsh if you disagree with what I propose Yeobright promised and she continued What I want is your advice for you are my relation I mean a sort of guardian to me aren t you Clym Well yes I suppose I am a sort of guardian In fact I am of course he said altogether perplexed as to her drift I am thinking of marrying she then observed blandly But I shall not marry unless you assure me that you approve of such a step Why don t you speak I was taken rather by surprise But nevertheless I am very glad to hear such news I shall approve of course dear Tamsie Who can it be I am quite at a loss to guess No I am not tis the old doctor not that I mean to call him old for he is not very old after all Ah I noticed when he attended you last time No no she said hastily Tis mister Venn Clym s face suddenly became grave There now you don t like him and I wish I hadn t mentioned him she exclaimed almost petulantly And I shouldn t have done it either only he keeps on bothering me so till I don t know what to do Clym looked at the heath I like Venn well enough he answered at last He is a very honest and at the same time astute man He is clever too as is proved by his having got you to favour him But really Thomasin he is not quite Gentleman enough for me That is just what I feel I am sorry now that I asked you and I won t think any more of him At the same time I must marry him if I marry anybody that I WILL say I don t see that said Clym carefully concealing every clue to his own interrupted intention which she plainly had not guessed You might marry a professional man or somebody of that sort by going into the town to live and forming acquaintances there I am not fit for town life so very rural and silly as I always have been Do not you yourself notice my countrified ways Well when I came home from Paris I did a little but I don t now That s because you have got countrified too O I couldn t live in a street for the world Egdon is a ridiculous old place but I have got used to it and I couldn t be happy anywhere else at all Neither could I said Clym Then how could you say that I should marry some town man I am sure say what you will that I must marry Diggory if I marry at all He has been kinder to me than anybody else and has helped me in many ways that I don t know of Thomasin almost pouted now Yes he has said Clym in a neutral tone Well I wish with all my heart that I could say marry him But I cannot forget what my mother thought on that matter and it goes rather against me not to respect her opinion There is too much reason why we should do the little we can to respect it now Very well then sighed Thomasin I will say no more But you are not bound to obey my wishes I merely say what I think O no I don t want to be rebellious in that way she said sadly I had no business to think of him I ought to have thought of my family What dreadfully bad impulses there are in me Her lips trembled and she turned away to hide a tear Clym though vexed at what seemed her unaccountable taste was in a measure relieved to find that at any rate the marriage question in relation to himself was shelved Through several succeeding days he saw her at different times from the window of his room moping disconsolately about the garden He was half angry with her for choosing Venn then he was grieved at having put himself in the way of Venn s happiness who was after all as honest and persevering a young fellow as any on Egdon since he had turned over a new leaf In short Clym did not know what to do When next they met she said abruptly He is much more respectable now than he was then Who O yes Diggory Venn Aunt only objected because he was a reddleman Well Thomasin perhaps I don t know all the particulars of my mother s wish So you had better use your own discretion You will always feel that I slighted your mother s memory No I will not I shall think you are convinced that had she seen Diggory in his present position she would have considered him a fitting husband for you Now that s my real feeling Don t consult me any more but do as you like Thomasin I shall be content It is to be supposed that Thomasin was convinced for a few days after this when Clym strayed into a part of the heath that he had not lately visited Humphrey who was at work there said to him I am glad to see that missus Wildeve and Venn have made it up again seemingly Have they said Clym abstractedly Yes and he do contrive to stumble upon her whenever she walks out on fine days with the chiel But mister Yeobright I can t help feeling that your cousin ought to have married you Tis a pity to make two chimleycorners where there need be only one You could get her away from him now tis my belief if you were only to set about it How can I have the conscience to marry after having driven two women to their deaths Don t think such a thing Humphrey After my experience I should consider it too much of a burlesque to go to church and take a wife In the words of Job I have made a covenant with mine eyes when then should I think upon a maid No mister Clym don t fancy that about driving two women to their deaths You shouldn t say it Well we ll leave that out said Yeobright But anyhow God has set a mark upon me which wouldn t look well in a love making scene I have two ideas in my head and no others I am going to keep a night school and I am going to turn preacher What have you got to say to that Humphrey I ll come and hear ee with all my heart Thanks Tis all I wish As Clym descended into the valley Thomasin came down by the other path and met him at the gate What do you think I have to tell you Clym she said looking archly over her shoulder at him I can guess he replied She scrutinized his face Yes you guess right It is going to be after all He thinks I may as well make up my mind and I have got to think so too It is to be on the twenty fifth of next month if you don t object Do what you think right dear I am only too glad that you see your way clear to happiness again My sex owes you every amends for the treatment you received in days gone by The writer may state here that the original conception of the story did not design a marriage between Thomasin and Venn He was to have retained his isolated and weird character to the last and to have disappeared mysteriously from the heath nobody knowing whither Thomasin remaining a widow But certain circumstances of serial publication led to a change of intent Readers can therefore choose between the endings and those with an austere artistic code can assume the more consistent conclusion to be the true one four Cheerfulness Again Asserts Itself at Blooms End and Clym Finds His Vocation Anybody who had passed through Blooms End about eleven o clock on the morning fixed for the wedding would have found that while Yeobright s house was comparatively quiet sounds denoting great activity came from the dwelling of his nearest neighbour Timothy Fairway It was chiefly a noise of feet briskly crunching hither and thither over the sanded floor within One man only was visible outside and he seemed to be later at an appointment than he had intended to be for he hastened up to the door lifted the latch and walked in without ceremony The scene within was not quite the customary one Standing about the room was the little knot of men who formed the chief part of the Egdon coterie there being present Fairway himself Grandfer Cantle Humphrey Christian and one or two turf cutters It was a warm day and the men were as a matter of course in their shirtsleeves except Christian who had always a nervous fear of parting with a scrap of his clothing when in anybody s house but his own Across the stout oak table in the middle of the room was thrown a mass of striped linen which Grandfer Cantle held down on one side and Humphrey on the other while Fairway rubbed its surface with a yellow lump his face being damp and creased with the effort of the labour Waxing a bed tick souls said the newcomer Yes Sam said Grandfer Cantle as a man too busy to waste words Shall I stretch this corner a shade tighter Timothy Fairway replied and the waxing went on with unabated vigour Tis going to be a good bed by the look o t continued Sam after an interval of silence Who may it be for Tis a present for the new folks that s going to set up housekeeping said Christian who stood helpless and overcome by the majesty of the proceedings Ah to be sure and a valuable one a b lieve Beds be dear to fokes that don t keep geese bain t they Mister Fairway said Christian as to an omniscient being Yes said the furze dealer standing up giving his forehead a thorough mopping and handing the beeswax to Humphrey who succeeded at the rubbing forthwith Not that this couple be in want of one but twas well to show em a bit of friendliness at this great racketing vagary of their lives I set up both my own daughters in one when they was married and there have been feathers enough for another in the house the last twelve months Now then neighbours I think we have laid on enough wax Grandfer Cantle you turn the tick the right way outwards and then I ll begin to shake in the feathers When the bed was in proper trim Fairway and Christian brought forward vast paper bags stuffed to the full but light as balloons and began to turn the contents of each into the receptacle just prepared As bag after bag was emptied airy tufts of down and feathers floated about the room in increasing quantity till through a mishap of Christian s who shook the contents of one bag outside the tick the atmosphere of the room became dense with gigantic flakes which descended upon the workers like a windless snowstorm I never saw such a clumsy chap as you Christian said Grandfer Cantle severely You might have been the son of a man that s never been outside Blooms End in his life for all the wit you have Really all the soldiering and smartness in the world in the father seems to count for nothing in forming the nater of the son As far as that chief Christian is concerned I might as well have stayed at home and seed nothing like all the rest of ye here Though as far as myself is concerned a dashing spirit has counted for sommat to be sure Don t ye let me down so Father I feel no bigger than a ninepin after it I ve made but a bruckle hit I m afeard Come come Never pitch yerself in such a low key as that Christian you should try more said Fairway Yes you should try more echoed the Grandfer with insistence as if he had been the first to make the suggestion In common conscience every man ought either to marry or go for a soldier Tis a scandal to the nation to do neither one nor t other I did both thank God Neither to raise men nor to lay em low that shows a poor do nothing spirit indeed I never had the nerve to stand fire faltered Christian But as to marrying I own I ve asked here and there though without much fruit from it Yes there s some house or other that might have had a man for a master such as he is that s now ruled by a woman alone Still it might have been awkward if I had found her for d ye see neighbours there d have been nobody left at home to keep down Father s spirits to the decent pitch that becomes a old man And you ve your work cut out to do that my son said Grandfer Cantle smartly I wish that the dread of infirmities was not so strong in me I d start the very first thing tomorrow to see the world over again But seventy one though nothing at home is a high figure for a rover Ay seventy one last Candlemasday Gad I d sooner have it in guineas than in years And the old man sighed Don t you be mournful Grandfer said Fairway Empt some more feathers into the bed tick and keep up yer heart Though rather lean in the stalks you be a green leaved old man still There s time enough left to ye yet to fill whole chronicles Begad I ll go to em Timothy to the married pair said Granfer Cantle in an encouraged voice and starting round briskly I ll go to em tonight and sing a wedding song hey Tis like me to do so you know and they d see it as such My Down in Cupid s Gardens was well liked in four still I ve got others as good and even better What do you say to my She cal led to her love From the lat tice a bove O come in from the fog gy fog gy dew Twould please em well at such a time Really now I come to think of it I haven t turned my tongue in my head to the shape of a real good song since Old Midsummer night when we had the Barley Mow at the Woman and tis a pity to neglect your strong point where there s few that have the compass for such things So tis so tis said Fairway Now gie the bed a shake down We ve put in seventy pounds of best feathers and I think that s as many as the tick will fairly hold A bit and a drap wouldn t be amiss now I reckon Christian maul down the victuals from corner cupboard if canst reach man and I ll draw a drap o sommat to wet it with They sat down to a lunch in the midst of their work feathers around above and below them the original owners of which occasionally came to the open door and cackled begrudgingly at sight of such a quantity of their old clothes Upon my soul I shall be chokt said Fairway when having extracted a feather from his mouth he found several others floating on the mug as it was handed round I ve swallered several and one had a tolerable quill said Sam placidly from the corner Hullo what s that wheels I hear coming Grandfer Cantle exclaimed jumping up and hastening to the door Why tis they back again I didn t expect em yet this half hour To be sure how quick marrying can be done when you are in the mind for t O yes it can soon be DONE said Fairway as if something should be added to make the statement complete He arose and followed the Grandfer and the rest also went to the door In a moment an open fly was driven past in which sat Venn and missus Venn Yeobright and a grand relative of Venn s who had come from Budmouth for the occasion The fly had been hired at the nearest town regardless of distance and cost there being nothing on Egdon Heath in Venn s opinion dignified enough for such an event when such a woman as Thomasin was the bride and the church was too remote for a walking bridal party As the fly passed the group which had run out from the homestead they shouted Hurrah and waved their hands feathers and down floating from their hair their sleeves and the folds of their garments at every motion and Grandfer Cantle s seals dancing merrily in the sunlight as he twirled himself about The driver of the fly turned a supercilious gaze upon them he even treated the wedded pair themselves with something like condescension for in what other state than heathen could people rich or poor exist who were doomed to abide in such a world s end as Egdon Thomasin showed no such superiority to the group at the door fluttering her hand as quickly as a bird s wing towards them and asking Diggory with tears in her eyes if they ought not to alight and speak to these kind neighbours Venn however suggested that as they were all coming to the house in the evening this was hardly necessary After this excitement the saluting party returned to their occupation and the stuffing and sewing were soon afterwards finished when Fairway harnessed a horse wrapped up the cumbrous present and drove off with it in the cart to Venn s house at Stickleford Yeobright having filled the office at the wedding service which naturally fell to his hands and afterwards returned to the house with the husband and wife was indisposed to take part in the feasting and dancing that wound up the evening Thomasin was disappointed I wish I could be there without dashing your spirits he said But I might be too much like the skull at the banquet No no Well dear apart from that if you would excuse me I should be glad I know it seems unkind but dear Thomasin I fear I should not be happy in the company there that s the truth of it I shall always be coming to see you at your new home you know so that my absence now will not matter Then I give in Do whatever will be most comfortable to yourself Clym retired to his lodging at the housetop much relieved and occupied himself during the afternoon in noting down the heads of a sermon with which he intended to initiate all that really seemed practicable of the scheme that had originally brought him hither and that he had so long kept in view under various modifications and through evil and good report He had tested and weighed his convictions again and again and saw no reason to alter them though he had considerably lessened his plan His eyesight by long humouring in his native air had grown stronger but not sufficiently strong to warrant his attempting his extensive educational project Yet he did not repine there was still more than enough of an unambitious sort to tax all his energies and occupy all his hours Evening drew on and sounds of life and movement in the lower part of the domicile became more pronounced the gate in the palings clicking incessantly The party was to be an early one and all the guests were assembled long before it was dark Yeobright went down the back staircase and into the heath by another path than that in front intending to walk in the open air till the party was over when he would return to wish Thomasin and her husband good bye as they departed His steps were insensibly bent towards Mistover by the path that he had followed on that terrible morning when he learnt the strange news from Susan s boy He did not turn aside to the cottage but pushed on to an eminence whence he could see over the whole quarter that had once been Eustacia s home While he stood observing the darkening scene somebody came up Clym seeing him but dimly would have let him pass silently had not the pedestrian who was Charley recognized the young man and spoken to him Charley I have not seen you for a length of time said Yeobright Do you often walk this way No the lad replied I don t often come outside the bank You were not at the Maypole No said Charley in the same listless tone I don t care for that sort of thing now You rather liked Miss Eustacia didn t you Yeobright gently asked Eustacia had frequently told him of Charley s romantic attachment Yes very much Ah I wish Yes I wish mister Yeobright you could give me something to keep that once belonged to her if you don t mind I shall be very happy to It will give me very great pleasure Charley Let me think what I have of hers that you would like But come with me to the house and I ll see They walked towards Blooms End together When they reached the front it was dark and the shutters were closed so that nothing of the interior could be seen Come round this way said Clym My entrance is at the back for the present The two went round and ascended the crooked stair in darkness till Clym s sitting room on the upper floor was reached where he lit a candle Charley entering gently behind Yeobright searched his desk and taking out a sheet of tissue paper unfolded from it two or three undulating locks of raven hair which fell over the paper like black streams From these he selected one wrapped it up and gave it to the lad whose eyes had filled with tears He kissed the packet put it in his pocket and said in a voice of emotion O mister Clym how good you are to me I will go a little way with you said Clym And amid the noise of merriment from below they descended Their path to the front led them close to a little side window whence the rays of candles streamed across the shrubs The window being screened from general observation by the bushes had been left unblinded so that a person in this private nook could see all that was going on within the room which contained the wedding guests except in so far as vision was hindered by the green antiquity of the panes Charley what are they doing said Clym My sight is weaker again tonight and the glass of this window is not good Charley wiped his own eyes which were rather blurred with moisture and stepped closer to the casement mister Venn is asking Christian Cantle to sing he replied and Christian is moving about in his chair as if he were much frightened at the question and his father has struck up a stave instead of him Yes I can hear the old man s voice said Clym So there s to be no dancing I suppose And is Thomasin in the room I see something moving in front of the candles that resembles her shape I think Yes She do seem happy She is red in the face and laughing at something Fairway has said to her O my What noise was that said Clym mister Venn is so tall that he knocked his head against the beam in gieing a skip as he passed under missus Venn has run up quite frightened and now she s put her hand to his head to feel if there s a lump And now they be all laughing again as if nothing had happened Do any of them seem to care about my not being there Clym asked No not a bit in the world Now they are all holding up their glasses and drinking somebody s health I wonder if it is mine No tis mister and missus Venn s because he is making a hearty sort of speech There now missus Venn has got up and is going away to put on her things I think Well they haven t concerned themselves about me and it is quite right they should not It is all as it should be and Thomasin at least is happy We will not stay any longer now as they will soon be coming out to go home He accompanied the lad into the heath on his way home and returning alone to the house a quarter of an hour later found Venn and Thomasin ready to start all the guests having departed in his absence The wedded pair took their seats in the four wheeled dogcart which Venn s head milker and handy man had driven from Stickleford to fetch them in little Eustacia and the nurse were packed securely upon the open flap behind and the milker on an ancient overstepping pony whose shoes clashed like cymbals at every tread rode in the rear in the manner of a body servant of the last century Now we leave you in absolute possession of your own house again said Thomasin as she bent down to wish her cousin good night It will be rather lonely for you Clym after the hubbub we have been making O that s no inconvenience said Clym smiling rather sadly And then the party drove off and vanished in the night shades and Yeobright entered the house The ticking of the clock was the only sound that greeted him for not a soul remained Christian who acted as cook valet and gardener to Clym sleeping at his father s house Yeobright sat down in one of the vacant chairs and remained in thought a long time His mother s old chair was opposite it had been sat in that evening by those who had scarcely remembered that it ever was hers But to Clym she was almost a presence there now as always Whatever she was in other people s memories in his she was the sublime saint whose radiance even his tenderness for Eustacia could not obscure But his heart was heavy that Mother had NOT crowned him in the day of his espousals and in the day of the gladness of his heart And events had borne out the accuracy of her judgment and proved the devotedness of her care He should have heeded her for Eustacia s sake even more than for his own It was all my fault he whispered O my mother my mother would to God that I could live my life again and endure for you what you endured for me On the Sunday after this wedding an unusual sight was to be seen on Rainbarrow From a distance there simply appeared to be a motionless figure standing on the top of the tumulus just as Eustacia had stood on that lonely summit some two years and a half before But now it was fine warm weather with only a summer breeze blowing and early afternoon instead of dull twilight Those who ascended to the immediate neighbourhood of the Barrow perceived that the erect form in the centre piercing the sky was not really alone Round him upon the slopes of the Barrow a number of heathmen and women were reclining or sitting at their ease They listened to the words of the man in their midst who was preaching while they abstractedly pulled heather stripped ferns or tossed pebbles down the slope This was the first of a series of moral lectures or Sermons on the Mount which were to be delivered from the same place every Sunday afternoon as long as the fine weather lasted The commanding elevation of Rainbarrow had been chosen for two reasons first that it occupied a central position among the remote cottages around secondly that the preacher thereon could be seen from all adjacent points as soon as he arrived at his post the view of him being thus a convenient signal to those stragglers who wished to draw near The speaker was bareheaded and the breeze at each waft gently lifted and lowered his hair somewhat too thin for a man of his years these still numbering less than thirty three He wore a shade over his eyes and his face was pensive and lined but though these bodily features were marked with decay there was no defect in the tones of his voice which were rich musical and stirring He stated that his discourses to people were to be sometimes secular and sometimes religious but never dogmatic and that his texts would be taken from all kinds of books This afternoon the words were as follows And the king rose up to meet her and bowed himself unto her and sat down on his throne and caused a seat to be set for the king s mother and she sat on his right hand Then she said I desire one small petition of thee I pray thee say me not nay And the king said unto her Ask on my mother for I will not say thee nay Yeobright had in fact found his vocation in the career of an itinerant open air preacher and lecturer on morally unimpeachable subjects and from this day he laboured incessantly in that office speaking not only in simple language on Rainbarrow and in the hamlets round but in a more cultivated strain elsewhere from the steps and porticoes of town halls from market crosses from conduits on esplanades and on wharves from the parapets of bridges in barns and outhouses and all other such places in the neighbouring Wessex towns and villages He left alone creeds and systems of philosophy finding enough and more than enough to occupy his tongue in the opinions and actions common to all good men Some believed him and some believed not some said that his words were commonplace others complained of his want of theological doctrine while others again remarked that it was well enough for a man to take to preaching who could not see to do anything else But everywhere he was kindly received for the story of his
