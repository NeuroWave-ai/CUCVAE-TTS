104-132091-0007	train-other-500	It was a hot day The sky was very blue
none	none	 and white clouds 
104-132091-0008	train-other-500	like great swans went floating over it to and fro Just opposite me was a clump of green rushes with dark velvety spikes and among them one single tall red cardinal flower which was bending over the brook
104-132091-0009	train-other-500	as if to see its own beautiful face in the water But the cardinal did not seem to be vain The picture was so pretty that I sat a long time enjoying it Suddenly close to me two small voices began to talk
104-132091-0010	train-other-500	or to sing for I couldn t tell exactly which it was One voice was shrill the other which was a little deeper sounded very positive and cross They were evidently disputing about something
104-132091-0011	train-other-500	for they said the same words over and over again These were the words Katy did Katy didn t She did She didn t She did She didn t Did Didn t
104-132091-0012	train-other-500	I think they must have repeated them at least a hundred times I got up from my seat to see if I could find the speakers and sure enough there on one of the cat tail bulrushes I spied two tiny pale green creatures
104-132091-0013	train-other-500	Their eyes seemed to be weak for they both wore black goggles They had six legs apiece two short ones two not so short and two very long
none	none	 These last legs had joints like the springs to buggy tops and as I watched 
104-132091-0014	train-other-500	they began walking up the rush and then I saw that they moved exactly like an old fashioned gig In fact if I hadn t been too big I think I should have heard them creak as they went along
104-132091-0015	train-other-500	They didn t say anything so long as I was there but the moment my back was turned they began to quarrel again and in the same old words Katy did Katy didn t She did She didn t
104-132091-0016	train-other-500	As I walked home I fell to thinking about another Katy a Katy I once knew
none	none	 who planned to do a great many wonderful things and in the end did none of them but something quite different something she didn t like at all at first but which on the whole was a great deal better than any of the doings she had dreamed about And as I thought 
104-132091-0017	train-other-500	this little story grew in my head and I resolved to write it down for you I have done it and in memory of my two little friends on the bulrush I give it their name Here it is the story of What Katy Did
104-132091-0018	train-other-500	Katy s name was Katy Carr She lived in the town of Burnet which wasn t a very big town
none	none	 but was growing as fast as it knew how The house she lived in stood on the edge of the town It was a large square house white with green blinds and had a porch in front over which roses and clematis made a thick bower Four tall locust trees shaded the gravel path which led to the front gate On one side of the house was an orchard 
104-132091-0019	train-other-500	on the other side were wood piles and barns and an ice house Behind was a kitchen garden sloping to the south and behind that a pasture with a brook in it
none	none	 and butternut trees and four cows 
104-132091-0020	train-other-500	two red ones a yellow one with sharp horns tipped with tin and a dear little white one named Daisy There were six of the Carr children four girls and two boys Katy the oldest was twelve years old
104-132091-0021	train-other-500	little Phil the youngest was four and the rest fitted in between doctor Carr their Papa was a dear kind busy man who was away from home all day and sometimes all night too
none	none	 taking care of sick people 
104-132091-0022	train-other-500	The children hadn t any Mamma She had died when Phil was a baby four years before my story began Katy could remember her pretty well to the rest she was but a sad sweet name
104-132091-0023	train-other-500	spoken on Sunday and at prayer times
none	none	 or when Papa was especially gentle and solemn 
104-132091-0024	train-other-500	In place of this Mamma whom they recollected so dimly there was Aunt Izzie Papa s sister who came to take care of them when Mamma went away on that long journey from which for so many months
104-132091-0025	train-other-500	the little ones kept hoping she might return Aunt Izzie was a small woman sharp faced and thin rather old looking and very neat and particular about everything She meant to be kind to the children but they puzzled her much
104-132091-0026	train-other-500	because they were not a bit like herself when she was a child Aunt Izzie had been a gentle tidy little thing who loved to sit as Curly Locks did sewing long seams in the parlor and to have her head patted by older people and be told that she was a good girl
104-132091-0027	train-other-500	whereas Katy tore her dress every day hated sewing and didn t care a button about being called good while Clover and Elsie shied off like restless ponies when any one tried to pat their heads It was very perplexing to Aunt Izzie
none	none	 and she found it hard to quite forgive the children for being so unaccountable and so little like the good boys and girls in Sunday school memoirs who were the young people she liked best and understood most about Then doctor Carr was another person who worried her He wished to have the children hardy and bold 
104-132091-0028	train-other-500	and encouraged climbing and rough plays in spite of the bumps and ragged clothes which resulted In fact there was just one half hour of the day when Aunt Izzie was really satisfied about her charges and that was the half hour before breakfast
none	none	 when she had made a law that they were all to sit in their little chairs and learn the Bible verse for the day 
104-132091-0029	train-other-500	At this time she looked at them with pleased eyes they were all so spick and span with such nicely brushed jackets and such neatly combed hair But the moment the bell rang her comfort was over From that time on
104-132091-0030	train-other-500	they were what she called not fit to be seen The neighbors pitied her very much
none	none	 They used to count the sixty stiff white pantalette legs hung out to dry every Monday morning 
104-132091-0031	train-other-500	and say to each other what a sight of washing those children made
none	none	 and what a chore it must be for poor Miss Carr to keep them so nice But poor Miss Carr didn t think them at all nice that was the worst of it Clover go up stairs and wash your hands Dorry pick your hat off the floor and hang it on the nail Not that nail the third nail from the corner These were the kind of things Aunt Izzie was saying all day long The children minded her pretty well but they didn t exactly love her I fear They called her Aunt Izzie 
104-132091-0032	train-other-500	always never Aunty Boys and girls will know what that meant I want to show you the little Carrs and I don t know that I could ever have a better chance
104-132091-0033	train-other-500	than one day when five out of the six were perched on top of the ice house like chickens on a roost
none	none	 This ice house was one of their favorite places 
104-132091-0034	train-other-500	It was only a low roof set over a hole in the ground and as it stood in the middle of the side yard it always seemed to the children that the shortest road to every place was up one of its slopes and down the other
none	none	 They also liked to mount to the ridge pole 
104-132091-0035	train-other-500	and then still keeping the sitting position to let go
none	none	 and scrape slowly down over the warm shingles to the ground It was bad for their shoes and trousers of course but what of that 
104-132091-0036	train-other-500	Shoes and trousers and clothes generally were Aunt Izzie s affair theirs was to slide and enjoy themselves Clover next in age to Katy
none	none	 sat in the middle 
104-132091-0037	train-other-500	She was a fair sweet dumpling of a girl with thick pig tails of light brown hair and short sighted blue eyes which seemed to hold tears just ready to fall from under the blue Really Clover was the jolliest little thing in the world
none	none	 but these eyes and her soft cooing voice always made people feel like petting her and taking her part Once when she was very small she ran away with Katy s doll and when Katy pursued and tried to take it from her 
104-132091-0038	train-other-500	Clover held fast and would not let go doctor Carr who wasn t attending particularly heard nothing but the pathetic tone of Clover s voice as she said
none	none	 Me won t 
104-132091-0039	train-other-500	Me want dolly and without stopping to inquire he called out sharply For shame Katy give your sister her doll at once which Katy much surprised did while Clover purred in triumph
104-132091-0040	train-other-500	like a satisfied kitten Clover was sunny and sweet tempered a little indolent and very modest about herself though in fact she was particularly clever in all sorts of games
none	none	 and extremely droll and funny in a quiet way 
104-132091-0041	train-other-500	Everybody loved her and she loved everybody especially Katy whom she looked up to as one of the wisest people in the world Pretty little Phil sat next on the roof to Clover and she held him tight with her arm
104-132091-0042	train-other-500	Then came Elsie a thin brown child of eight with beautiful dark eyes and crisp short curls covering the whole of her small head Poor little Elsie was the odd one among the Carrs
104-132091-0043	train-other-500	She didn t seem to belong exactly to either the older or the younger children The great desire and ambition of her heart
none	none	 was to be allowed to go about with Katy and Clover and Cecy Hall and to know their secrets and be permitted to put notes into the little post offices 
104-132091-0044	train-other-500	they were forever establishing in all sorts of hidden places But they didn t want Elsie and used to tell her to run away and play with the children which hurt her feelings very much When she wouldn t run away
104-132091-0045	train-other-500	I am sorry to say they ran away from her which as their legs were longest it was easy to do
none	none	 Poor Elsie 
104-132091-0046	train-other-500	left behind would cry bitter tears and as she was too proud to play much with Dorry and John her principal comfort was tracking the older ones about and discovering their mysteries especially the post offices
104-132091-0047	train-other-500	which were her greatest grievance Her eyes were bright and quick as a bird s She would peep and peer and follow and watch till at last in some odd unlikely place the crotch of a tree
none	none	 the middle of the asparagus bed 
104-132091-0048	train-other-500	or perhaps on the very top step of the scuttle ladder she spied the little paper box with its load of notes all ending with Be sure and not let Elsie know Then she would seize the box and marching up to wherever the others were
none	none	 she would throw it down saying defiantly 
104-132091-0049	train-other-500	There s your old post office but feeling all the time just like crying Poor little Elsie In almost every big family there is one of these unmated left out children Katy
none	none	 who had the finest plans in the world for being heroic 
104-132091-0050	train-other-500	and of use never saw as she drifted on her heedless way that here in this lonely little sister was the very chance she wanted for being a comfort to somebody who needed comfort very much She never saw it
104-132091-0051	train-other-500	and Elsie s heavy heart went uncheered Dorry and Joanna sat on the two ends of the ridge pole Dorry was six years old a pale pudgy boy with rather a solemn face
none	none	 and smears of molasses on the sleeve of his jacket Joanna whom the children called John and Johnnie was a square splendid child a year younger than Dorry she had big brave eyes and a wide rosy mouth 
104-132091-0052	train-other-500	which always looked ready to laugh These two were great friends though Dorry seemed like a girl who had got into boy s clothes by mistake and Johnnie like a boy who in a fit of fun had borrowed his sister s frock
none	none	 And now as they all sat there chattering and giggling 
104-132091-0053	train-other-500	the window above opened a glad shriek was heard and Katy s head appeared
none	none	 In her hand she held a heap of stockings 
104-132091-0054	train-other-500	which she waved triumphantly Hurray she cried all done and Aunt Izzie says we may go Are you tired out waiting
none	none	 I couldn t help it the holes were so big and took so long 
104-132091-0055	train-other-500	Hurry up Clover and get the things Cecy and I will be down in a minute The children jumped up gladly and slid down the roof Clover fetched a couple of baskets from the wood shed Elsie ran for her kitten
none	none	 Dorry and John loaded themselves with two great fagots of green boughs 
104-132091-0056	train-other-500	Just as they were ready the side door banged and Katy and Cecy Hall came into the yard I must tell you about Cecy She was a great friend of the children s and lived in a house next door
104-132091-0057	train-other-500	The yards of the houses were only separated by a green hedge with no gate so that Cecy spent two thirds of her time at doctor Carr s
none	none	 and was exactly like one of the family 
104-132091-0058	train-other-500	She was a neat dapper pink and white girl modest and prim in manner with light shiny hair which always kept smooth and slim hands which never looked dirty
none	none	 How different from my poor Katy Katy s hair was forever in a snarl her gowns were always catching on nails and tearing themselves and in spite of her age and size 
104-132091-0059	train-other-500	she was as heedless and innocent as a child of six
none	none	 Katy was the longest girl that was ever seen 
104-132091-0060	train-other-500	What she did to make herself grow so nobody could tell but there she was up above Papa s ear and half a head taller than poor Aunt Izzie Whenever she stopped to think about her height she became very awkward
104-132091-0061	train-other-500	and felt as if she were all legs and elbows and angles and joints Happily her head was so full of other things of plans and schemes and fancies of all sorts that she didn t often take time to remember how tall she was
104-132091-0062	train-other-500	She was a dear loving child for all her careless habits and made bushels of good resolutions every week of her life only unluckily she never kept any of them She had fits of responsibility about the other children
104-132091-0063	train-other-500	and longed to set them a good example but when the chance came she generally forgot to do so Katy s days flew like the wind for when she wasn t studying lessons or sewing and darning with Aunt Izzie which she hated extremely
104-132091-0064	train-other-500	there were always so many delightful schemes rioting in her brains
none	none	 that all she wished for was ten pairs of hands to carry them out 
104-132091-0065	train-other-500	These same active brains got her into perpetual scrapes She was fond of building castles in the air
none	none	 and dreaming of the time when something she had done would make her famous so that everybody would hear of her and want to know her I don t think she had made up her mind what this wonderful thing was to be but while thinking about it she often forgot to learn a lesson or to lace her boots and then she had a bad mark or a scolding from Aunt Izzie At such times she consoled herself with planning how by and by she would be beautiful and beloved and amiable as an angel A great deal was to happen to Katy before that time came Her eyes which were black were to turn blue her nose was to lengthen and straighten and her mouth quite too large at present to suit the part of a heroine was to be made over into a sort of rosy button Meantime and until these charming changes should take place Katy forgot her features as much as she could though still I think the person on earth whom she most envied was that lady on the outside of the Tricopherous bottles with the wonderful hair which sweeps the ground CHAPTER II PARADISE The place to which the children were going was a sort of marshy thicket at the bottom of a field near the house It wasn t a big thicket but it looked big 
104-132092-0000	train-other-500	because the trees and bushes grew so closely that you could not see just where it ended In winter the ground was damp and boggy so that nobody went there
none	none	 excepting cows 
104-132092-0001	train-other-500	who don t mind getting their feet wet but in summer the water dried away and then it was all fresh and green and full of delightful things wild roses and sassafras and birds nests
104-132092-0002	train-other-500	Narrow winding paths ran here and there made by the cattle as they wandered to and fro This place the children called Paradise and to them
none	none	 it seemed as wide and endless and full of adventure 
104-132092-0003	train-other-500	as any forest of fairy land The way to Paradise was through some wooden bars Katy and Cecy climbed these with a hop skip and jump while the smaller ones scrambled underneath Once past the bars
104-132092-0004	train-other-500	they were fairly in the field and with one consent they all began to run till they reached the entrance of the wood Then they halted with a queer look of hesitation on their faces
none	none	 It was always an exciting occasion to go to Paradise 
104-132092-0005	train-other-500	for the first time after the long winter Who knew what the fairies might not have done since any of them had been there to see Which path shall we go in by asked Clover at last Suppose we vote said Katy
104-132092-0006	train-other-500	I say by the Pilgrim s Path and the Hill of Difficulty So do I chimed in Clover who always agreed with Katy The Path of Peace is nice suggested Cecy No no
104-132092-0007	train-other-500	We want to go by Sassafras Path cried John and Dorry However Katy as usual had her way It was agreed that they should first try Pilgrim s Path and afterward make a thorough exploration of the whole of their little kingdom
none	none	 and see all that had happened since last they were there 
104-132092-0008	train-other-500	So in they marched Katy and Cecy heading the procession
none	none	 and Dorry with his great trailing bunch of boughs 
104-132092-0009	train-other-500	bringing up the rear Oh there is the dear Rosary all safe cried the children as they reached the top of the Hill of Difficulty and came upon a tall stump
none	none	 out of the middle of which 
104-132092-0010	train-other-500	waved a wild rose bush budded over with fresh green eaves This Rosary was a fascinating thing to their minds They were always inventing stories about it and were in constant terror
104-132092-0011	train-other-500	lest some hungry cow should take a fancy to the rose bush and eat it up Yes said Katy stroking a leaf with her finger it was in great danger one night last winter but it escaped
none	none	 Oh how Tell us about it cried the others for Katy s stories were famous in the family 
104-132092-0012	train-other-500	It was Christmas Eve continued Katy in a mysterious tone The fairy of the Rosary was quite sick She had taken a dreadful cold in her head and the poplar tree fairy just over there
none	none	 told her that sassafras tea is good for colds So she made a large acorn cup full and then cuddled herself in where the wood looks so black and soft and fell asleep In the middle of the night when she was snoring soundly 
104-132092-0013	train-other-500	there was a noise in the forest and a dreadful black bull with fiery eyes galloped up
none	none	 He saw our poor Rosy Posy 
104-132092-0014	train-other-500	and opening his big mouth
none	none	 he was just going to bite her in two but at that minute 
104-132092-0015	train-other-500	a little fat man with a wand in his hand popped out from behind the stump It was Santa Claus of course He gave the bull such a rap with his wand that he moo ed dreadfully and then put up his fore paw to see if his nose was on or not
none	none	 He found it was but it hurt him so that he moo ed again and galloped off as fast as he could into the woods 
104-132092-0016	train-other-500	Then Santa Claus waked up the fairy and told her that if she didn t take better care of Rosy Posy he should put some other fairy into her place and set her to keep guard over a prickly scratchy blackberry bush
none	none	 Is there really any fairy asked Dorry who had listened to this narrative with open mouth Of course answered Katy Then bending down toward Dorry she added in a voice intended to be of wonderful sweetness I am a fairy Dorry Pshaw was Dorry s reply you re a giraffe 
104-132092-0017	train-other-500	Pa said so The Path of Peace got its name because of its darkness and coolness High bushes almost met over it and trees kept it shady even in the middle of the day A sort of white flower grew there
104-132092-0018	train-other-500	which the children called Pollypods because they didn t know the real name They staid a long while picking bunches of these flowers and then John and Dorry had to grub up an armful of sassafras roots so that before they had fairly gone through Toadstool Avenue
104-132092-0019	train-other-500	Rabbit Hollow and the rest the sun was just over their heads and it was noon I m getting hungry said Dorry Oh no Dorry you mustn t be hungry till the bower is ready cried the little girls alarmed for Dorry was apt to be disconsolate
none	none	 if he was kept waiting for his meals 
104-132092-0020	train-other-500	So they made haste to build the bower It did not take long
none	none	 being composed of boughs hung over skipping ropes 
104-132092-0021	train-other-500	which were tied to the very poplar tree
none	none	 where the fairy lived who had recommended sassafras tea to the Fairy of the Rose 
104-132092-0022	train-other-500	When it was done they all cuddled in underneath It was a very small bower just big enough to hold them and the baskets and the kitten I don t think there would have been room for anybody else not even another kitten Katy
none	none	 who sat in the middle untied and lifted the lid of the largest basket while all the rest peeped eagerly to see what was inside First came a great many ginger cakes These were carefully laid on the grass to keep till wanted buttered biscuit came next three apiece with slices of cold lamb laid in between and last of all were a dozen hard boiled eggs and a layer of thick bread and butter sandwiched with corn beef 
104-132092-0023	train-other-500	Aunt Izzie had put up lunches for Paradise before you see and knew pretty well what to expect in the way of appetite Oh how good everything tasted in that bower with the fresh wind rustling the poplar leaves sunshine and sweet wood smells about them
none	none	 and birds singing overhead No grown up dinner party ever had half so much fun Each mouthful was a pleasure and when the last crumb had vanished Katy produced the second basket and there oh delightful surprise 
104-132092-0024	train-other-500	were seven little pies molasses pies baked in saucers each with a brown top and crisp candified edge
none	none	 which tasted like toffy and lemon peel and all sorts of good things mixed up together 
104-132092-0025	train-other-500	There was a general shout Even demure Cecy was pleased and Dorry and John kicked their heels on the ground in a tumult of joy Seven pairs of hands were held out at once toward the basket
none	none	 seven sets of teeth went to work without a moment s delay In an incredibly short time every vestige of the pie had disappeared 
104-132092-0026	train-other-500	and a blissful stickiness pervaded the party
none	none	 What shall we do now asked Clover while little Phil tipped the baskets upside down 
104-132092-0027	train-other-500	as if to make sure there was nothing left that could possibly be eaten I don t know replied Katy dreamily She had left her seat
none	none	 and was half sitting half lying on the low crooked bough of a butternut tree 
104-132092-0028	train-other-500	which hung almost over the children s heads Let s play we re grown up said Cecy and tell what we mean to do Well said Clover you begin What do you mean to do
104-132092-0029	train-other-500	I mean to have a black silk dress and pink roses in my bonnet and a white muslin long shawl said Cecy and I mean to look exactly like Minerva Clark I shall be very good too
none	none	 as good as missus Bedell 
104-132092-0030	train-other-500	only a great deal prettier All the young gentlemen will want me to go and ride but I shan t notice them at all because you know I shall always be teaching in Sunday school and visiting the poor And some day
none	none	 when I am bending over an old woman and feeding her with currant jelly a poet will come along and see me and he ll go home and write a poem about me concluded Cecy triumphantly Pooh said Clover I don t think that would be nice at 
104-132092-0031	train-other-500	all I m going to be a beautiful lady the most beautiful lady in the world And I m going to live in a yellow castle with yellow pillars to the portico and a square thing on top like mister Sawyer s My children are going to have a play house up there
none	none	 There s going to be a spy glass in the window to look out of

104-132092-0057	train-other-500	It was dreadful to have to pick up the empty baskets and go home feeling that the long delightful Saturday was over and that there wouldn t be another for a week But it was comforting to remember that Paradise was always there and that at any moment

none	none	 enter in and take possession of their Eden CHAPTER III THE DAY OF SCRAPES missus Knight s school to which Katy and Clover and Cecy went stood quite at the other end of the town from doctor Carr s It was a low one story building and had a yard behind it in which the girls played at recess Unfortunately next door to it was Miss Miller s school equally large and popular and with a yard behind it also Only a high board fence separated the two playgrounds missus Knight was a stout gentle woman who moved slowly and had a face which made you think of an amiable and well disposed cow Miss Miller on the contrary had black eyes with black corkscrew curls waving about them and was generally brisk and snappy A constant feud raged between the two schools as to the respective merits of the teachers and the instruction The Knight girls for some unknown reason considered themselves genteel and the Miller girls vulgar and took no pains to conceal this opinion while the Miller girls on the other hand retaliated by being as aggravating as they knew how They spent their recesses and intermissions mostly in making faces through the knot holes in the fence and over the top of it when they could get there which wasn t an easy thing to do as the fence was pretty high The Knight girls could make faces too for all their gentility Their yard had one great advantage over the other it possessed a wood shed with a climbable roof which commanded Miss Miller s premises and upon this the girls used to sit in rows turning up their noses at the next yard and irritating the foe by jeering remarks Knights and Millerites the two schools called each other and the feud raged so high that sometimes it was hardly safe for a Knight to meet a Millerite in the street all of which as may be imagined was exceedingly improving both to the manners and morals of the young ladies concerned One morning not long after the day in Paradise Katy was late She could not find her things Her algebra as she expressed it had gone and lost itself her slate was missing and the string was off her sun bonnet She ran about searching for these articles and banging doors till Aunt Izzie was out of patience As for your algebra she said if it is that very dirty book with only one cover and scribbled all over the leaves you will find it under the kitchen table Philly was playing before breakfast that it was a pig no wonder I m sure for it looks good for nothing else How you do manage to spoil your school books in this manner Katy I cannot imagine It is less than a month since your father got you a new algebra and look at it now not fit to be carried about I do wish you would realize what books cost About your slate she went on I know nothing but here is the bonnet string taking it out of her pocket Oh thank you said Katy hastily sticking it on with a pin Katy Carr almost screamed Miss Izzie what are you about Pinning on your bonnet string Mercy on me what shiftless thing will you do next Now stand still and don t fidget You sha n t stir till I have sewed it on properly It wasn t easy to stand still and not fidget with Aunt Izzie fussing away and lecturing and now and then in a moment of forgetfulness sticking her needle into one s chin Katy bore it as well as she could only shifting perpetually from one foot to the other and now and then uttering a little snort like an impatient horse The minute she was released she flew into the kitchen seized the algebra and rushed like a whirlwind to the gate where good little Clover stood patiently waiting though all ready herself and terribly afraid she should be late We shall have to run gasped Katy quite out of breath Aunt Izzie kept me She has been so horrid They did run as fast as they could but time ran faster and before they were half way to school the town clock struck nine and all hope was over This vexed Katy very much for though often late she was always eager to be early There she said stopping short I shall just tell Aunt Izzie that it was her fault It is too bad And she marched into school in a very cross mood A day begun in this manner is pretty sure to end badly as most of us know All the morning through things seemed to go wrong Katy missed twice in her grammar lesson and lost her place in the class Her hand shook so when she copied her composition that the writing not good at best turned out almost illegible so that missus Knight said it must all be done over again This made Katy crosser than ever and almost before she thought she had whispered to Clover How hateful And then when just before recess all who had communicated were requested to stand up her conscience gave such a twinge that she was forced to get up with the rest and see a black mark put against her name on the list The tears came into her eyes from vexation and for fear the other girls would notice them she made a bolt for the yard as soon as the bell rang and mounted up all alone to the wood house roof where she sat with her back to the school fighting with her eyes and trying to get her face in order before the rest should come Miss Miller s clock was about four minutes slower than missus Knight s so the next playground was empty It was a warm breezy day and as Katy sat here suddenly a gust of wind came and seizing her sun bonnet which was only half tied on whirled it across the roof She clutched after it as it flew but too late Once twice thrice it flapped then it disappeared over the edge and Katy flying after saw it lying a crumpled lilac heap in the very middle of the enemy s yard This was horrible Not merely losing the bonnet for Katy was comfortably indifferent as to what became of her clothes but to lose it so In another minute the Miller girls would be out Already she seemed to see them dancing war dances round the unfortunate bonnet pinning it on a pole using it as a football waving it over the fence and otherwise treating it as Indians treat a captive taken in war Was it to be endured Never Better die first And with very much the feeling of a person who faces destruction rather than forfeit honor Katy set her teeth and sliding rapidly down the roof seized the fence and with one bold leap vaulted into Miss Miller s yard Just then the recess bell tinkled and a little Millerite who sat by the window and who for two seconds had been dying to give the exciting information squeaked out to the others There s Katy Carr in our back yard Out poured the Millerites big and little Their wrath and indignation at this daring invasion cannot be described With a howl of fury they precipitated themselves upon Katy but she was quick as they and holding the rescued bonnet in her hand was already half way up the fence There are moments when it is a fine thing to be tall On this occasion Katy s long legs and arms served her an excellent turn Nothing but a Daddy Long Legs ever climbed so fast or so wildly as she did now In one second she had gained the top of the fence Just as she went over a Millerite seized her by the last foot and almost dragged her boot off Almost not quite thanks to the stout thread with which Aunt Izzie had sewed on the buttons With a frantic kick Katy released herself and had the satisfaction of seeing her assailant go head over heels backward while with a shriek of triumph and fright she herself plunged headlong into the midst of a group of Knights They were listening with open mouths to the uproar and now stood transfixed at the astonishing spectacle of one of their number absolutely returning alive from the camp of the enemy I cannot tell you what a commotion ensued The Knights were beside themselves with pride and triumph Katy was kissed and hugged and made to tell her story over and over again while rows of exulting girls sat on the wood house roof to crow over the discomfited Millerites and when later the foe rallied and began to retort over the fence Clover armed with a tack hammer was lifted up in the arms of one of the tall girls to rap the intruding knuckles as they appeared on the top This she did with such good will that the Millerites were glad to drop down again and mutter vengeance at a safe distance Altogether it was a great day for the school a day to be remembered As time went on Katy what with the excitement of her adventure and of being praised and petted by the big girls grew perfectly reckless and hardly knew what she said or did A good many of the scholars lived too far from school to go home at noon and were in the habit of bringing their lunches in baskets and staying all day Katy and Clover were of this number This noon after the dinners were eaten it was proposed that they should play something in the school room and Katy s unlucky star put it into her head to invent a new game which she called the Game of Rivers It was played in the following manner Each girl took the name of a river and laid out for herself an appointed path through the room winding among the desks and benches and making a low roaring sound to imitate the noise of water Cecy was the Platte Marianne Brooks a tall girl the Mississippi Alice Blair the Ohio Clover the Penobscot and so on They were instructed to run into each other once in a while because as Katy said rivers do As for Katy herself she was Father Ocean and growling horribly raged up and down the platform where missus Knight usually sat Every now and then when the others were at the far end of the room she would suddenly cry out Now for a meeting of the waters whereupon all the rivers bouncing bounding scrambling screaming would turn and run toward Father Ocean while he roared louder than all of them put together and made short rushes up and down to represent the movement of waves on a beach Such a noise as this beautiful game made was never heard in the town of Burnet before or since It was like the bellowing of the bulls of Bashan the squeaking of pigs the cackle of turkey cocks and the laugh of wild hyenas all at once and in addition there was a great banging of furniture and scraping of many feet on an uncarpeted floor People going by stopped and stared children cried an old lady asked why some one didn t run for a policeman while the Miller girls listened to the proceedings with malicious pleasure and told everybody that it was the noise that missus Knight s scholars usually made at recess missus Knight coming back from dinner was much amazed to see a crowd of people collected in front of her school As she drew near the sounds reached her and then she became really frightened for she thought somebody was being murdered on her premises Hurrying in she threw open the door and there to her dismay was the whole room in a frightful state of confusion and uproar chairs flung down desks upset ink streaming on the floor while in the midst of the ruin the frantic rivers raced and screamed and old Father Ocean with a face as red as fire capered like a lunatic on the platform What does this mean gasped poor missus Knight almost unable to speak for horror At the sound of her voice the Rivers stood still Father Ocean brought his prances to an abrupt close and slunk down from the platform All of a sudden each girl seemed to realize what a condition the room was in and what a horrible thing she had done The timid ones cowered behind their desks the bold ones tried to look unconscious and to make matters worse the scholars who had gone home to dinner began to return staring at the scene of disaster and asking in whispers what had been going on missus Knight rang the bell When the school had come to order she had the desks and chairs picked up while she herself brought wet cloths to sop the ink from the floor This was done in profound silence and the expression of missus Knight s face was so direful and solemn that a fresh damp fell upon the spirits of the guilty Rivers and Father Ocean wished himself thousands of miles away When all was in order again and the girls had taken their seats missus Knight made a short speech She said she never was so shocked in her life before she had supposed that she could trust them to behave like ladies when her back was turned The idea that they could act so disgracefully make such an uproar and alarm people going by had never occurred to her and she was deeply pained It was setting a bad example to all the neighborhood by which missus Knight meant the rival school Miss Miller having just sent over a little girl with her compliments to ask if any one was hurt and could she do anything which was naturally aggravating missus Knight hoped they were sorry she thought they must be sorry and ashamed The exercises could now go on as usual Of course some punishment would be inflicted for the offense but she should have to reflect before deciding what it ought to be Meantime she wanted them all to think it over seriously and if any one felt that she was more to blame than the others now was the moment to rise and confess it Katy s heart gave a great thump but she rose bravely I made up the game and I was Father Ocean she said to the astonished missus Knight who glared at her for a minute and then replied solemnly Very well Katy sit down which Katy did feeling more ashamed than ever but somehow relieved in her mind There is a saving grace in truth which helps truth tellers through the worst of their troubles and Katy found this out now The afternoon was long and hard missus Knight did not smile once the lessons dragged and Katy after the heat and excitement of the forenoon began to feel miserable She had received more than one hard blow during the meetings of the waters and had bruised herself almost without knowing it against the desks and chairs All these places now began to ache her head throbbed so that she could hardly see and a lump of something heavy seemed to be lying on her heart When school was over missus Knight rose and said The young ladies who took part in the game this afternoon are requested to remain All the others went away and shut the door behind them It was a horrible moment the girls never forgot it or the hopeless sound of the door as the last departing scholar clapped it after her as she left I can t begin to tell you what it was that missus Knight said to them it was very affecting and before long most of the girls began to cry The penalty for their offense was announced to be the loss of recess for three weeks but that wasn t half so bad as seeing missus Knight so religious and afflicted as Cecy told her mother afterward One by one the sobbing sinners departed from the schoolroom When most of them were gone missus Knight called Katy up to the platform and said a few words to her specially She was not really severe but Katy was too penitent and worn out to bear much and before long was weeping like a water spout or like the ocean she had pretended to be At this tender hearted missus Knight was so much affected that she let her off at once and even kissed her in token of forgiveness which made poor Ocean sob harder than ever All the way home she sobbed faithful little Clover running along by her side in great distress begging her to stop crying and trying in vain to hold up the fragments of her dress which was torn in at least a dozen places Katy could not stop crying and it was fortunate that Aunt Izzie happened to be out and that the only person who saw her in this piteous plight was Mary the nurse who doted on the children and was always ready to help them out of their troubles On this occasion she petted and cosseted Katy exactly as if it had been Johnnie or little Phil She took her on her lap bathed the hot head brushed the hair put arnica on the bruises and produced a clean frock so that by tea time the poor child except for her red eyes looked like herself again and Aunt Izzie didn t notice anything unusual For a wonder doctor Carr was at home that evening It was always a great treat to the children when this happened and Katy thought herself happy when after the little ones had gone to bed she got Papa to herself and told him the whole story Papa she said sitting on his knee which big girl as she was she liked very much to do what is the reason that makes some days so lucky and other days so unlucky Now today began all wrong and everything that happened in it was wrong and on other days I begin right and all goes right straight through If Aunt Izzie hadn t kept me in the morning I shouldn t have lost my mark and then I shouldn t have been cross and then perhaps I shouldn t have got in my other scrapes But what made Aunt Izzie keep you Katy To sew on the string of my bonnet Papa But how did it happen that the string was off Well said Katy reluctantly I am afraid that was my fault for it came off on Tuesday and I didn t fasten it on So you see we must go back of Aunt Izzie for the beginning of this unlucky day of yours Childie Did you ever hear the old saying about For the want of a nail the shoe was lost No never tell it to me cried Katy who loved stories as well as when she was three years old So doctor Carr repeated For the want of a nail the shoe was lost For the want of a shoe the horse was lost For the want of a horse the rider was lost For the want of a rider the battle was lost For the want of a battle the kingdom was lost And all for want of a horse shoe nail Oh Papa exclaimed Katy giving him a great hug as she got off his knee I see what you mean Who would have thought such a little speck of a thing as not sewing on my string could make a difference But I don t believe I shall get in any more scrapes for I sha n t ever forget For the want of a nail the shoe was lost CHAPTER IV KIKERI But I am sorry to say that my poor thoughtless Katy did forget and did get into another scrape and that no later than the very next Monday Monday was apt to be rather a stormy day at the Carrs There was the big wash to be done and Aunt Izzie always seemed a little harder to please and the servants a good deal crosser than on common days But I think it was also in part the fault of the children who after the quiet of Sunday were specially frisky and uproarious and readier than usual for all sorts of mischief To Clover and Elsie Sunday seemed to begin at Saturday s bed time when their hair was wet and screwed up in papers that it might curl next day Elsie s waved naturally so Aunt Izzie didn t think it necessary to pin her papers very tight but Clover s thick straight locks required to be pinched hard before they would give even the least twirl and to her Saturday night was one of misery She would lie tossing and turning and trying first one side of her head and then the other but whichever way she placed herself the hard knobs and the pins stuck out and hurt her so when at last she fell asleep it was face down with her small nose buried in the pillow which was not comfortable and gave her bad dreams In consequence of these sufferings Clover hated curls and when she made up stories for the younger children they always commenced The hair of the beautiful princess was as straight as a yard stick and she never did it up in papers never Sunday always began with a Bible story followed by a breakfast of baked beans which two things were much tangled up together in Philly s mind After breakfast the children studied their Sunday school lessons and then the big carryall came round and they drove to church which was a good mile off It was a large old fashioned church with galleries and long pews with high red cushioned seats The choir sat at the end behind a low green curtain which slipped from side to side on rods When the sermon began they would draw the curtain aside and show themselves all ready to listen but the rest of the time they kept it shut Katy always guessed that they must be having good times behind the green curtain eating orange peel perhaps or reading the Sunday school books and she often wished she might sit up there among them The seat in doctor Carr s pew was so high that none of the children except Katy could touch the floor even with the point of a toe This made their feet go to sleep and when they felt the queer little pin pricks which drowsy feet use to rouse themselves with they would slide off the seat and sit on the benches to get over it Once there and well hidden from view it was almost impossible not to whisper Aunt Izzie would frown and shake her head but it did little good especially as Phil and Dorry were sleeping with their heads on her lap and it took both her hands to keep them from rolling off into the bottom of the pew When good old doctor Stone said Finally my brethren she would begin waking them up It was hard work sometimes but generally she succeeded so that during the last hymn the two stood together on the seat quite brisk and refreshed sharing a hymn book and making believe to sing like the older people After church came Sunday school which the children liked very much and then they went home to dinner which was always the same on Sunday cold corned beef baked potatoes and rice pudding They did not go to church in the afternoon unless they wished but were pounced upon by Katy instead and forced to listen to the reading of The Sunday Visitor a religious paper of which she was the editor This paper was partly written partly printed on a large sheet of foolscap and had at the top an ornamental device in lead pencil with Sunday Visitor in the middle of it The reading part began with a dull little piece of the kind which grown people call an editorial about Neatness or Obedience or Punctuality The children always fidgeted when listening to this partly I think because it aggravated them to have Katy recommending on paper as very easy the virtues which she herself found it so hard to practise in real life Next came anecdotes about dogs and elephants and snakes taken from the Natural History book and not very interesting because the audience knew them by heart already A hymn or two followed or a string of original verses and last of all a chapter of Little Maria and Her Sisters a dreadful tale in which Katy drew so much moral and made such personal allusions to the faults of the rest that it was almost more than they could bear In fact there had just been a nursery rebellion on the subject You must know that for some weeks back Katy had been too lazy to prepare any fresh Sunday Visitors and so had forced the children to sit in a row and listen to the back numbers which she read aloud from the very beginning Little Maria sounded much worse when taken in these large doses and Clover and Elsie combining for once made up their minds to endure it no longer So watching their chance they carried off the whole edition and poked it into the kitchen fire where they watched it burn with a mixture of fear and delight which it was comical to witness They dared not confess the deed but it was impossible not to look conscious when Katy was flying about and rummaging after her lost treasure and she suspected them and was very irate in consequence The evenings of Sunday were always spent in repeating hymns to Papa and Aunt Izzie This was fun for they all took turns and there was quite a scramble as to who should secure the favorites such as The west hath shut its gate of gold and Go when the morning shineth On the whole Sunday was a sweet and pleasant day and the children thought so but from its being so much quieter than other days they always got up on Monday full of life and mischief and ready to fizz over at any minute like champagne bottles with the wires just cut This particular Monday was rainy so there couldn t be any out door play which was the usual vent for over high spirits The little ones cooped up in the nursery all the afternoon had grown perfectly riotous Philly was not quite well and had been taking medicine The medicine was called Elixir Pro It was a great favorite with Aunt Izzie who kept a bottle of it always on hand The bottle was large and black with a paper label tied round its neck and the children shuddered at the sight of it After Phil had stopped roaring and spluttering and play had begun again the dolls as was only natural were taken ill also and so was Pikery John s little yellow chair which she always pretended was a doll too She kept an old apron tied on his back and generally took him to bed with her not into bed that would have been troublesome but close by tied to the bed post Now as she told the others Pikery was very sick indeed He must have some medicine just like Philly Give him some water suggested Dorry No said John decidedly it must be black and out of a bottle or it won t do any good After thinking a moment she trotted quietly across the passage into Aunt Izzie s room Nobody was there but John knew where the Elixir Pro was kept in the closet on the third shelf She pulled one of the drawers out a little climbed up and reached it down The children were enchanted when she marched back the bottle in one hand the cork in the other and proceeded to pour a liberal dose on to Pikery s wooden seat which John called his lap There there my poor boy she said patting his shoulder I mean his arm swallow it down it ll do you good Just then Aunt Izzie came in and to her dismay saw a long trickle of something dark and sticky running down on to the carpet It was Pikery s medicine which he had refused to swallow What is that she asked sharply My baby is sick faltered John displaying the guilty bottle Aunt Izzie rapped her over the head with a thimble and told her that she was a very naughty child whereupon Johnnie pouted and cried a little Aunt Izzie wiped up the slop and taking away the Elixir retired with it to her closet saying that she never knew anything like it it was always so on Mondays What further pranks were played in the nursery that day I cannot pretend to tell But late in the afternoon a dreadful screaming was heard and when people rushed from all parts of the house to see what was the matter behold the nursery door was locked and nobody could get in Aunt Izzie called through the keyhole to have it opened but the roars were so loud that it was long before she could get an answer At last Elsie sobbing violently explained that Dorry had locked the door and now the key wouldn t turn and they couldn t open it Would they have to stay there always and starve Of course you won t you foolish child exclaimed Aunt Izzie Dear dear what on earth will come next Stop crying Elsie do you hear me You shall all be got out in a few minutes And sure enough the next thing came a rattling at the blinds and there was Alexander the hired man standing outside on a tall ladder and nodding his head at the children The little ones forgot their fright They flew to open the window and frisked and jumped about Alexander as he climbed in and unlocked the door It struck them as being such a fine thing to be let out in this way that Dorry began to rather plume himself for fastening them in But Aunt Izzie didn t take this view of the case She scolded them well and declared they were troublesome children who couldn t be trusted one moment out of sight and that she was more than half sorry she had promised to go to the Lecture that evening How do I know she concluded that before I come home you won t have set the house on fire or killed somebody Oh no we won t no we won t whined the children quite moved by this frightful picture But bless you ten minutes afterward they had forgotten all about it All this time Katy had been sitting on the ledge of the bookcase in the Library poring over a book It was called Tasso s Jerusalem Delivered The man who wrote it was an Italian but somebody had done the story over into English It was rather a queer book for a little girl to take a fancy to but somehow Katy liked it very much It told about knights and ladies and giants and battles and made her feel hot and cold by turns as she read and as if she must rush at something and shout and strike blows Katy was naturally fond of reading Papa encouraged it He kept a few books locked up and then turned her loose in the Library She read all sorts of things travels and sermons and old magazines Nothing was so dull that she couldn t get through with it Anything really interesting absorbed her so that she never knew what was going on about her The little girls to whose houses she went visiting had found this out and always hid away their story books when she was expected to tea If they didn t do this she was sure to pick one up and plunge in and then it was no use to call her or tug at her dress for she neither saw nor heard anything more till it was time to go home This afternoon she read the Jerusalem till It was too dark to see any more On her way up stairs she met Aunt Izzie with bonnet and shawl on Where have you been she said I have been calling you for the last half hour I didn t hear you ma am But where were you persisted Miss Izzie In the Library reading replied Katy Her aunt gave a sort of sniff but she knew Katy s ways and said no more I m going out to drink tea with missus Hall and attend the evening Lecture she went on Be sure that Clover gets her lesson and if Cecy comes over as usual you must send her home early All of you must be in bed by nine Yes m said Katy but I fear she was not attending much but thinking in her secret soul how jolly it was to have Aunt Izzie go out for once Miss Carr was very faithful to her duties she seldom left the children even for an evening so whenever she did they felt a certain sense of novelty and freedom which was dangerous as well as pleasant Still I am sure that on this occasion Katy meant no mischief Like all excitable people she seldom did mean to do wrong she just did it when it came into her head Supper passed off successfully and all might have gone well had it not been that after the lessons were learned and Cecy had come in they fell to talking about Kikeri Kikeri was a game which had been very popular with them a year before They had invented it themselves and chosen for it this queer name out of an old fairy story It was a sort of mixture of Blindman s Buff and Tag only instead of any one s eyes being bandaged they all played in the dark One of the children would stay out in the hall which was dimly lighted from the stairs while the others hid themselves in the nursery When they were all hidden they would call out Kikeri as a signal for the one in the hall to come in and find them Of course coming from the light he could see nothing while the others could see only dimly It was very exciting to stand crouching up in a corner and watch the dark figure stumbling about and feeling to right and left while every now and then somebody just escaping his clutches would slip past and gain the hall which was Freedom Castle with a joyful shout of Kikeri Kikeri Kikeri Ki Whoever was caught had to take the place of the catcher For a long time this game was the delight of the Carr children but so many scratches and black and blue spots came of it and so many of the nursery things were thrown down and broken that at last Aunt Izzie issued an order that it should not be played any more This was almost a year since but talking of it now put it into their heads to want to try it again After all we didn t promise said Cecy No and Papa never said a word about our not playing it added Katy to whom Papa was authority and must always be minded while Aunt Izzie might now and then be defied So they all went up stairs Dorry and John though half undressed were allowed to join the game Philly was fast asleep in another room It was certainly splendid fun Once Clover climbed up on the mantel piece and sat there and when Katy who was finder groped about a little more wildly than usual she caught hold of Clover s foot and couldn t imagine where it came from Dorry got a hard knock and cried and at another time Katy s dress caught on the bureau handle and was frightfully torn but these were too much affairs of every day to interfere in the least with the pleasures of Kikeri The fun and frolic seemed to grow greater the longer they played In the excitement time went on much faster than any of them dreamed Suddenly in the midst of the noise came a sound the sharp distinct slam of the carryall door at the side entrance Aunt Izzie had returned from her Lecture The dismay and confusion of that moment Cecy slipped down stairs like an eel and fled on the wings of fear along the path which led to her home missus Hall as she bade Aunt Izzie good night and shut doctor Carr s front door behind her with a bang might have been struck with the singular fact that a distant bang came from her own front door like a sort of echo But she was not a suspicious woman and when she went up stairs there were Cecy s clothes neatly folded on a chair and Cecy herself in bed fast asleep only with a little more color than usual in her cheeks Meantime Aunt Izzie was on her way up stairs and such a panic as prevailed in the nursery Katie felt it and basely scuttled off to her own room where she went to bed with all possible speed But the others found it much harder to go to bed there were so many of them all getting into each other s way and with no lamp to see by Dorry and John popped under the clothes half undressed Elsie disappeared and Clover too late for either and hearing Aunt Izzie s step in the hall did this horrible thing fell on her knees with her face buried in a chair and began to say her prayers very hard indeed Aunt Izzie coming in with a candle in her hand stood in the doorway astonished at the spectacle She sat down and waited for Clover to get through while Clover on her part didn t dare to get through but went on repeating Now I lay me over and over again in a sort of despair At last Aunt Izzie said very grimly That will do Clover you can get up and Clover rose feeling like a culprit which she was for it was much naughtier to pretend to be praying than to disobey Aunt Izzie and be out of bed after ten o clock though I think Clover hardly understood this then Aunt Izzie at once began to undress her and while doing so asked so many questions that before long she had got at the truth of the whole matter She gave Clover a sharp scolding and leaving her to wash her tearful face she went to the bed where John and Dorry lay fast asleep and snoring as conspicuously as they knew how Something strange in the appearance of the bed made her look more closely she lifted the clothes and there sure enough they were half dressed and with their school boots on Such a shake as Aunt Izzie gave the little scamps at this discovery would have roused a couple of dormice Much against their will John and Dorry were forced to wake up and be slapped and scolded and made ready for bed Aunt Izzie standing over them all the while like a dragon She had just tucked them warmly in when for the first time she missed Elsie Where is my poor little Elsie she exclaimed In bed said Clover meekly In bed repeated Aunt Izzie much amazed Then stooping down she gave a vigorous pull The trundle bed came into view and sure enough there was Elsie in full dress shoes and all but so fast asleep that not all Aunt Izzie s shakes and pinches and calls were able to rouse her Her clothes were taken off her boots unlaced her night gown put on but through it all Elsie slept and she was the only one of the children who did not get the scolding she deserved that dreadful night Katy did not even pretend to be asleep when Aunt Izzie went to her room Her tardy conscience had waked up and she was lying in bed very miserable at having drawn the others into a scrape as well as herself and at the failure of her last set of resolutions about setting an example to the younger ones So unhappy was she that Aunt Izzie s severe words were almost a relief and though she cried herself to sleep it was rather from the burden of her own thoughts than because she had been scolded She cried even harder the next day for doctor Carr talked to her more seriously than he had ever done before He reminded her of the time when her Mamma died and of how she said Katy must be a Mamma to the little ones when she grows up And he asked her if she didn t think the time was come for beginning to take this dear place towards the children Poor Katy She sobbed as if her heart would break at this and though she made no promises I think she was never quite so thoughtless again after that day As for the rest Papa called them together and made them distinctly understand that Kikeri was never to be played any more It was so seldom that Papa forbade any games however boisterous that this order really made an impression on the unruly brood and they never have played Kikeri again from that day to this CHAPTER V IN THE LOFT I declare said Miss Petingill laying down her work if them children don t beat all What on airth are they going to do now Miss Petingill was sitting in the little room in the back building which she always had when she came to the Carr s for a week s mending and making over She was the dearest funniest old woman who ever went out sewing by the day Her face was round and somehow made you think of a very nice baked apple it was so criss crossed and lined by a thousand good natured puckers She was small and wiry and wore caps and a false front which was just the color of a dusty Newfoundland dog s back Her eyes were dim and she used spectacles but for all that she was an excellent worker Every one liked Miss Petingill though Aunt Izzie did once say that her tongue was hung in the middle Aunt Izzie made this remark when she was in a temper and was by no means prepared to have Phil walk up at once and request Miss Petingill to stick it out which she obligingly did while the rest of the children crowded to look They couldn t see that it was different from other tongues but Philly persisted in finding something curious about it there must be you know since it was hung in that queer way Wherever Miss Petingill went all sorts of treasures went with her The children liked to have her come for it was as good as a fairy story or the circus to see her things unpacked Miss Petingill was very much afraid of burglars she lay awake half the night listening for them and nothing on earth would have persuaded her to go anywhere leaving behind what she called her Plate This stately word meant six old teaspoons very thin and bright and sharp and a butter knife whose handle set forth that it was A testimonial of gratitude for saving the life of Ithuriel Jobson aged seven on the occasion of his being attacked with quinsy sore throat Miss Petingill was very proud of her knife It and the spoons travelled about in a little basket which hung on her arm and was never allowed to be out of her sight even when the family she was sewing for were the honestest people in the world Then beside the plate basket Miss Petingill never stirred without Tom her tortoiseshell cat Tom was a beauty and knew his power he ruled Miss Petingill with a rod of iron and always sat in the rocking chair when there was one It was no matter where she sat Miss Petingill told people but Tom was delicate and must be made comfortable A big family Bible always came too and a special red merino pin cushion and some shade pictures of old mister and missus Petingill and Peter Petingill who was drowned at sea and photographs of missus Porter who used to be Marcia Petingill and missus Porter s husband and all the Porter children Many little boxes and jars came also and a long row of phials and bottles filled with homemade physic and herb teas Miss Petingill could not have slept without having them beside her for as she said how did she know that she might not be took sudden with something and die for want of a little ginger balsam or pennyroyal The Carr children always made so much noise that it required something unusual to make Miss Petingill drop her work as she did now and fly to the window In fact there was a tremendous hubbub hurrahs from Dorry stamping of feet and a great outcry of shrill glad voices Looking down Miss Petingill saw the whole six no seven for Cecy was there too stream out of the wood house door which wasn t a door but only a tall open arch and rush noisily across the yard Katy was at the head bearing a large black bottle without any cork in it while the others carried in each hand what seemed to be a cookie Katherine Carr Kather ine screamed Miss Petingill tapping loudly on the glass Don t you see that it s raining you ought to be ashamed to let your little brothers and sisters go out and get wet in such a way But nobody heard her and the children vanished into the shed where nothing could be seen but a distant flapping of pantalettes and frilled trousers going up what seemed to be a ladder farther back in the shed So with a dissatisfied cluck Miss Petingill drew back her head perched the spectacles on her nose and went to work again on Katy s plaid alpaca which had two immense zigzag rents across the middle of the front breadth Katy s frocks strange to say always tore exactly in that place If Miss Petingill s eyes could have reached a little farther they would have seen that it wasn t a ladder up which the children were climbing but a tall wooden post with spikes driven into it about a foot apart It required quite a stride to get from one spike to the other in fact the littler ones couldn t have managed it at all had it not been for Clover and Cecy boosting very hard from below while Katy making a long arm clawed from above At last they were all safely up and in the delightful retreat which I am about to describe Imagine a low dark loft without any windows and with only a very little light coming in through the square hole in the floor to which the spikey post led There was a strong smell of corn cobs though the corn had been taken away a great deal of dust and spiderweb in the corners and some wet spots on the boards for the roof always leaked a little in rainy weather This was the place which for some reason I have never been able to find out the Carr children preferred to any other on rainy Saturdays when they could not play out doors Aunt Izzie was as much puzzled at this fancy as I am When she was young a vague far off time which none of her nieces and nephews believed in much she had never had any of these queer notions about getting off into holes and corners and poke away places Aunt Izzie would gladly have forbidden them to go the loft but doctor Carr had given his permission so all she could do was to invent stories about children who had broken their bones in various dreadful ways by climbing posts and ladders But these stories made no impression on any of the children except little Phil and the self willed brood kept on their way and climbed their spiked post as often as they liked What s in the bottle demanded Dorry the minute he was fairly landed in the loft Don t be greedy replied Katy severely you will know when the time comes It is something delicious I can assure you Now she went on having thus quenched Dorry all of you had better give me your cookies to put away if you don t they ll be sure to be eaten up before the feast and then you know there wouldn t be anything to make a feast of So all of them handed over their cookies Dorry who had begun on his as he came up the ladder was a little unwilling but he was too much in the habit of minding Katy to dare to disobey The big bottle was set in a corner and a stack of cookies built up around it That s right proceeded Katy who as oldest and biggest always took the lead in their plays Now if we re fixed and ready to begin the Fete Katy pronounced it Feet can commence The opening exercise will be A Tragedy of the Alhambra by Miss Hall No cried Clover first The Blue Wizard or Edwitha of the Hebrides you know Katy Didn t I tell you said Katy a dreadful accident has happened to that Oh what cried all the rest for Edwitha was rather a favorite with the family It was one of the many serial stories which Katy was forever writing and was about a lady a knight a blue wizard and a poodle named Bop It had been going on so many months now that everybody had forgotten the beginning and nobody had any particular hope of living to hear the end but still the news of its untimely fate was a shock I ll tell you said Katy Old Judge Kirby called this morning to see Aunt Izzie I was studying in the little room but I saw him come in and pull out the big chair and sit down and I almost screamed out don t Why cried the children Don t you see I had stuffed Edwitha down between the back and the seat It was a beau tiful hiding place for the seat goes back ever so far but Edwitha was such a fat bundle and old Judge Kirby takes up so much room that I was afraid there would be trouble And sure enough he had hardly dropped down before there was a great crackling of paper and he jumped up again and called out Bless me what is that And then he began poking and poking and just as he had poked out the whole bundle and was putting on his spectacles to see what it was Aunt Izzie came in Well what next cried the children immensely tickled Oh continued Katy Aunt Izzie put on her glasses too and screwed up her eyes you know the way she does and she and the judge read a little bit of it that part at the first you remember where Bop steals the blue pills and the Wizard tries to throw him into the sea You can t think how funny it was to hear Aunt Izzie reading Edwitha out loud and Katy went into convulsions at the recollection where she got to Oh Bop my angel Bop I just rolled under the table and stuffed the table cover in my mouth to keep from screaming right out By and by I heard her call Debby and give her the papers and say Here is a mass of trash which I wish you to put at once into the kitchen fire And she told me afterward that she thought I would be in an insane asylum before I was twenty It was too bad ended Katy half laughing and half crying to burn up the new chapter and all But there s one good thing she didn t find The Fairy of the Dry Goods Box that was stuffed farther back in the seat And now continued the mistress of ceremonies we will begin Miss Hall will please rise Miss Hall much flustered at her fine name got up with very red cheeks It was once upon a time she read Moonlight lay on the halls of the Alhambra and the knight striding impatiently down the passage thought she would never come Who the moon asked Clover No of course not replied Cecy a lady he was in love with The next verse is going to tell about her only you interrupted She wore a turban of silver with a jewelled crescent As she stole down the corregidor the beams struck it and it glittered like stars So you are come Zuleika Yes my lord Just then a sound as of steel smote upon the ear and Zuleika s mail clad father rushed in He drew his sword so did the other A moment more and they both lay dead and stiff in the beams of the moon Zuleika gave a loud shriek and threw herself upon their bodies She was dead too And so ends the Tragedy of the Alhambra That s lovely said Katy drawing a long breath only very sad What beautiful stories you do write Cecy But I wish you wouldn t always kill the people Why couldn t the knight have killed the father and no I suppose Zuleika wouldn t have married him then Well the father might have oh bother why must anybody be killed anyhow why not have them fall on each other s necks and make up Why Katy cried Cecy it wouldn t have been a tragedy then You know the name was A Tragedy of the Alhambra Oh well said Katy hurriedly for Cecy s lips were beginning to pout and her fair pinkish face to redden as if she were about to cry perhaps it was prettier to have them all die only I thought for a change you know What a lovely word that was Corregidor what does it mean I don t know replied Cecy quite consoled It was in the Conquest of Granada Something to walk over I believe The next went on Katy consulting her paper is Yap a Simple Poem by Clover Carr All the children giggled but Clover got up composedly and recited the following verses Did you ever know Yap The best little dog Who e er sat on lap Or barked at a frog His eyes were like beads His tail like a mop And it waggled as if It never would stop His hair was like silk Of the glossiest sheen He always ate milk And once the cold cream Off the nursery bureau That line is too long It made him quite ill So endeth my song For Yappy he died Just two months ago And we oughtn t to sing At a funeral you know The Poem met with immense applause all the children laughed and shouted and clapped till the loft rang again But Clover kept her face perfectly and sat down as demure as ever except that the little dimples came and went at the corners of her mouth dimples partly natural and partly I regret to say the result of a pointed slate pencil with which Clover was in the habit of deepening them every day while she studied her lessons Now said Katy after the noise had subsided now come Scripture Verses by Miss Elsie and Joanna Carr Hold up your head Elsie and speak distinctly and oh Johnnie you mustn t giggle in that way when it comes your turn But Johnnie only giggled the harder at this appeal keeping her hands very tight across her mouth and peeping out over her fingers Elsie however was solemn as a little judge and with great dignity began An angel with a fiery sword Came to send Adam and Eve abroad And as they journeyed through the skies They took one look at Paradise They thought of all the happy hours Among the birds and fragrant bowers And Eve she wept and Adam bawled And both together loudly squalled Dorry snickered at this but sedate Clover hushed him You mustn t she said it s about the Bible you know Now John it s your turn But Johnnie would persist in holding her hands over her mouth while her fat little shoulders shook with laughter At last with a great effort she pulled her face straight and speaking as fast as she possibly could repeated in a sort of burst Balaam s donkey saw the Angel And stopped short in fear Balaam didn t see the Angel Which is very queer After which she took refuge again behind her fingers while Elsie went on Elijah by the creek He by ravens fed Took from their horny beak Pieces of meat and bread Come Johnnie said Katy but the incorrigible Johnnie was shaking again and all they could make out was The bears came down and ate and ate These Verses were part of a grand project on which Clover and Elsie had been busy for more than a year It was a sort of rearrangement of Scripture for infant minds and when it was finished they meant to have it published bound in red with daguerreotypes of the two authoresses on the cover The Youth s Poetical Bible was to be the name of it Papa much tickled with the scraps which he overheard proposed instead The Trundle Bed Book as having been composed principally in that spot but Elsie and Clover were highly indignant and would not listen to the idea for a moment After the Scripture Verses came Dorry s turn He had been allowed to choose for himself which was unlucky as his taste was peculiar not to say gloomy On this occasion he had selected that cheerful hymn which begins Hark from the tombs a doleful sound And he now began to recite it in a lugubrious voice and with great emphasis smacking his lips as it were over such lines as Princes this clay shall be your bed In spite of all your towers The older children listened with a sort of fascinated horror rather enjoying the cold chills which ran down their backs and huddling close together as Dorry s hollow tones echoed from the dark corners of the loft It was too much for Philly however At the close of the piece he was found to be in tears I don t want to saint a a y up here and be groaned at he sobbed There you bad boy cried Katy all the more angry because she was conscious of having enjoyed it herself that s what you do with your horrid hymns frightening us to death and making Phil cry And she gave Dorry a little shake He began to whimper and as Phil was still sobbing and Johnnie had begun to sob too out of sympathy with the others the Feet in the Loft seemed likely to come to a sad end I m goin to tell Aunt Izzie that I don t like you declared Dorry putting one leg through the opening in the floor No you aren t said Katy seizing him you are going to stay because now we are going to have the Feast Do stop Phil and Johnnie don t be a goose but come and pass round the cookies The word Feast produced a speedy effect on the spirits of the party Phil cheered at once and Dorry changed his mind about going The black bottle was solemnly set in the midst and the cookies were handed about by Johnnie who was now all smiles The cookies had scalloped edges and caraway seeds inside and were very nice There were two apiece and as the last was finished Katy put her hand in her pocket and amid great applause produced the crowning addition to the repast seven long brown sticks of cinnamon Isn t it fun she said Debby was real good natured to day and let me put my own hand into the box so I picked out the longest sticks there were Now Cecy as you re company you shall have the first drink out of the bottle The something delicious proved to be weak vinegar and water It was quite warm but somehow drank up there in the loft and out of a bottle it tasted very nice Beside they didn t call it vinegar and water of course not Each child gave his or her swallow a different name as if the bottle were like Signor Blitz s and could pour out a dozen things at once Clover called her share Raspberry Shrub Dorry christened his Ginger Pop while Cecy who was romantic took her three sips under the name of Hydomel which she explained was something nice made she believed of beeswax The last drop gone and the last bit of cinnamon crunched the company came to order again for the purpose of hearing Philly repeat his one piece Little drops of water which exciting poem he had said every Saturday as far back as they could remember After that Katy declared the literary part of the Feet over and they all fell to playing Stagecoach which in spite of close quarters and an occasional bump from the roof was such good fun that a general Oh dear welcomed the ringing of the tea bell I suppose cookies and vinegar had taken away their appetites for none of them were hungry and Dorry astonished Aunt Izzie very much by eyeing the table in a disgusted way and saying Pshaw only plum sweatmeats and sponge cake and hot biscuit I don t want any supper What ails the child he must be sick said doctor Carr but Katy explained Oh no Papa it isn t that only we ve been having a feast in the loft Did you have a good time asked Papa while Aunt Izzie gave a dissatisfied groan And all the children answered at once Splendiferous CHAPTER VI INTIMATE FRIENDS Aunt Izzie may I ask Imogen Clark to spend the day here on Saturday cried Katy bursting in one afternoon Who on earth is Imogen Clark I never heard the name before replied her aunt Oh the loveliest girl She hasn t been going to missus Knight s school but a little while but we re the greatest friends And she s perfectly beautiful Aunt Izzie Her hands are just as white as snow and no bigger than that She s got the littlest waist of any girl in school and she s real sweet and so self denying and unselfish I don t believe she has a bit good times at home either Do let me ask her How do you know she s so sweet and self denying if you ve known her such a short time asked Aunt Izzie in an unpromising tone Oh she tells me everything We always walk together at recess now I know all about her and she s just lovely Her father used to be real rich but they re poor now and Imogen had to have her boots patched twice last winter I guess she s the flower of her family You can t think how I love her concluded Katy sentimentally No I can t said Aunt Izzie I never could see into these sudden friendships of yours Katy and I d rather you wouldn t invite this Imogen or whatever her name is till I ve had a chance to ask somebody about her Katy clasped her hands in despair Oh Aunt Izzie she cried Imogen knows that I came in to ask you and she s standing at the gate at this moment waiting to hear what you say Please let me just this once I shall be so dreadfully ashamed not to Well said Miss Izzie moved by the wretchedness of Katy s face if you ve asked her already it s no use my saying no I suppose But recollect Katy this is not to happen again I can t have you inviting girls and then coming for my leave Your father won t be at all pleased He s very particular about whom you make friends with Remember how missus Spenser turned out Poor Katy Her propensity to fall violently in love with new people was always getting her into scrapes Ever since she began to walk and talk Katy s intimate friends had been one of the jokes of the household Papa once undertook to keep a list of them but the number grew so great that he gave it up in despair First on the list was a small Irish child named Marianne O Riley Marianne lived in a street which Katy passed on her way to school It was not missus Knight s but an ABC school to which Dorry and John now went Marianne used to be always making sand pies in front of her mother s house and Katy who was about five years old often stopped to help her Over this mutual pastry they grew so intimate that Katy resolved to adopt Marianne as her own little girl and bring her up in a safe and hidden corner She told Clover of this plan but nobody else The two children full of their delightful secret began to save pieces of bread and cookies from their supper every evening By degrees they collected a great heap of dry crusts and other refreshments which they put safely away in the garret They also saved the apples which were given them for two weeks and made a bed in a big empty box with cotton quilts and the dolls pillows out of the baby house When all was ready Katy broke the plan to her beloved Marianne and easily persuaded her to run away and take possession of this new home We won t tell Papa and Mamma till she s quite grown up Katy said to Clover then we ll bring her down stairs and won t they be surprised Don t let s call her Marianne any longer either It isn t pretty We ll name her Susquehanna instead Susquehanna Carr Recollect Marianne you mustn t answer if I call you Marianne only when I say Susquehanna Yes m replied Marianne very meekly For a whole day all went on delightfully Susquehanna lived in her wooden box ate all the apples and the freshest cookies and was happy The two children took turns to steal away and play with the Baby as they called Marianne though she was a great deal bigger than Clover But when night came on and nurse swooped on Katy and Clover and carried them off to bed Miss O Riley began to think that the garret was a dreadful place Peeping out of her box she could see black things standing in corners which she did not recollect seeing in the day time They were really trunks and brooms and warming pans but somehow in the darkness they looked different big and awful Poor little Marianne bore it as long as she could but when at last a rat began to scratch in the wall close beside her her courage gave way entirely and she screamed at the top of her voice What is that said doctor Carr who had just come in and was on his way up stairs It sounds as if it came from the attic said missus Carr for this was before Mamma died Can it be that one of the children has got out of bed and wandered up stairs in her sleep No Katy and Clover were safe in the nursery so doctor Carr took a candle and went as fast as he could to the attic where the yells were growing terrific When he reached the top of the stairs the cries ceased He looked about Nothing was to be seen at first then a little head appeared over the edge of a big wooden box and a piteous voice sobbed out Ah Miss Katy and indeed I can t be stayin any longer There s rats in it Who on earth are you asked the amazed Doctor Sure I m Miss Katy s and Miss Clover s Baby But I don t want to be a baby any longer I want to go home and see my mother And again the poor little midge lifted up her voice and wept I don t think doctor Carr ever laughed so hard in his life as when finally he got to the bottom of the story and found that Katy and Clover had been adopting a child But he was very kind to poor Susquehanna and carried her down stairs in his arms to the nursery There in a bed close to the other children she soon forgot her troubles and fell asleep The little sisters were much surprised when they waked up in the morning and found their Baby asleep beside them But their joy was speedily turned to tears After breakfast doctor Carr carried Marianne home to her mother who was in a great fright over her disappearance and explained to the children that the garret plan must be given up Great was the mourning in the nursery but as Marianne was allowed to come and play with them now and then they gradually got over their grief A few months later mister O Riley moved away from Burnet and that was the end of Katy s first friendship The next was even funnier There was a queer old black woman who lived all alone by herself in a small house near the school This old woman had a very bad temper The neighbors told horrible stories about her so that the children were afraid to pass the house They used to turn always just before they reached it and cross to the other side of the street This they did so regularly that their feet had worn a path in the grass But for some reason Katy found a great fascination in the little house She liked to dodge about the door always holding herself ready to turn and run in case the old woman rushed out upon her with a broomstick One day she begged a large cabbage of Alexander and rolled it in at the door of the house The old woman seemed to like it and after this Katy always stopped to speak when she went by She even got so far as to sit on the step and watch the old woman at work There was a sort of perilous pleasure in doing this It was like sitting at the entrance of a lion s cage uncertain at what moment his Majesty might take it into his head to give a spring and eat you up After this Katy took a fancy to a couple of twin sisters daughters of a German jeweller They were quite grown up and always wore dresses exactly alike Hardly any one could tell them apart They spoke very little English and as Katy didn t know a word of German their intercourse was confined to smiles and to the giving of bunches of flowers which Katy used to tie up and present to them whenever they passed the gate She was too shy to do more than just put the flowers in their hands and run away but the twins were evidently pleased for one day when Clover happened to be looking out of the window she saw them open the gate fasten a little parcel to a bush and walk rapidly off Of course she called Katy at once and the two children flew out to see what the parcel was It held a bonnet a beautiful doll s bonnet of blue silk trimmed with artificial flowers upon it was pinned a slip of paper with these words in an odd foreign hand To the nice little girl who was so kindly to give us some flowers You can judge whether Katy and Clover were pleased or not This was when Katy was six years old I can t begin to tell you how many different friends she had set up since then There was an ash man and a steam boat captain There was missus Sawyer s cook a nice old woman who gave Katy lessons in cooking and taught her to make soft custard and sponge cake There was a bonnet maker pretty and dressy whom to Aunt Izzie s great indignation Katy persisted in calling Cousin Estelle There was a thief in the town jail under whose window Katy used to stand saying I m so sorry poor man and have you got any little girls like me in the most piteous way The thief had a piece of string which he let down from the window Katy would tie rosebuds and cherries to this string and the thief would draw them up It was so interesting to do this that Katy felt dreadfully when they carried the man off to the State Prison Then followed a short interval of Cornelia Perham a nice good natured girl whose father was a fruit merchant I am afraid Katy s liking for prunes and white grapes played a part in this intimacy It was splendid fun to go with Cornelia to her father s big shop and have whole boxes of raisins and drums of figs opened for their amusement and be allowed to ride up and down in the elevator as much as they liked But of all Katy s queer acquaintances missus Spenser to whom Aunt Izzie had alluded was the queerest missus Spenser was a mysterious lady whom nobody ever saw Her husband was a handsome rather bad looking man who had come from parts unknown and rented a small house in Burnet He didn t seem to have any particular business and was away from home a great deal His wife was said to be an invalid and people when they spoke of him shook their heads and wondered how the poor woman got on all alone in the house while her husband was absent Of course Katy was too young to understand these whispers or the reasons why people were not disposed to think well of mister Spenser The romance of the closed door and the lady whom nobody saw interested her very much She used to stop and stare at the windows and wonder what was going on inside till at last it seemed as if she must know So one day she took some flowers and Victoria her favorite doll and boldly marched into the Spensers yard She tapped at the front door but nobody answered Then she tapped again Still nobody answered She tried the door It was locked So shouldering Victoria she trudged round to the back of the house As she passed the side door she saw that it was open a little way She knocked for the third time and as no one came she went in and passing through the little hall began to tap at all the inside doors There seemed to be no people in the house Katy peeped into the kitchen first It was bare and forlorn All sorts of dishes were standing about There was no fire in the stove The parlor was not much better mister Spenser s boots lay in the middle of the floor There were dirty glasses on the table On the mantel piece was a platter with bones of meat upon it Dust lay thick over everything and the whole house looked as if it hadn t been lived in for at least a year Katy tried several other doors all of which were locked and then she went up stairs As she stood on the top step grasping her flowers and a little doubtful what to do next a feeble voice from a bed room called out Who is there This was missus Spenser She was lying on her bed which was very tossed and tumbled as if it hadn t been made up that morning The room was as disorderly and dirty as all the rest of the house and missus Spenser s wrapper and night cap were by no means clean but her face was sweet and she had beautiful curling hair which fell over the pillow She was evidently very sick and altogether Katy felt sorrier for her than she had ever done for anybody in her life Who are you child asked missus Spenser I m doctor Carr s little girl answered Katy going straight up to the bed I came to bring you some flowers And she laid the bouquet on the dirty sheet missus Spenser seemed to like the flowers She took them up and smelled them for a long time without speaking But how did you get in she said at last The door was open faltered Katy who was beginning to feel scared at her own daring and they said you were sick so I thought perhaps you would like me to come and see you You are a kind little girl said missus Spenser and gave her a kiss After this Katy used to go every day Sometimes missus Spenser would be up and moving feebly about but more often she was in bed and Katy would sit beside her The house never looked a bit better than it did that first day but after a while Katy used to brush missus Spenser s hair and wash her face with the corner of a towel I think her visits were a comfort to the poor lady who was very ill and lonely Sometimes when she felt pretty well she would tell Katy stories about the time when she was a little girl and lived at home with her father and mother But she never spoke of mister Spenser and Katy never saw him except once when she was so frightened that for several days she dared not go near the house At last Cecy reported that she had seen him go off in the stage with his carpet bag so Katy ventured in again missus Spenser cried when she saw her I thought you were never coming any more she said Katy was touched and flattered at having been missed and after that she never lost a day She always carried the prettiest flowers she could find and if any one gave her a specially nice peach or a bunch of grapes she saved it for missus Spenser Aunt Izzie was much worried at all this But doctor Carr would not interfere He said it was a case where grown people could do nothing and if Katy was a comfort to the poor lady he was glad Katy was glad too and the visits did her as much good as they did missus Spenser for the intense pity she felt for the sick woman made her gentle and patient as she had never been before One day she stopped as usual on her way home from school She tried the side door it was locked the back door it was locked too All the blinds were shut tight This was very puzzling As she stood in the yard a woman put her head out of the window of the next house It s no use knocking she said all the folks have gone away Gone away where asked Katy Nobody knows said the woman the gentleman came back in the middle of the night and this morning before light he had a wagon at the door and just put in the trunks and the sick lady and drove off There s been more than one a knocking besides you since then But mister Pudgett he s got the key and nobody can get in without goin to him It was too true missus Spenser was gone and Katy never saw her again In a few days it came out that mister Spenser was a very bad man and had been making false money counterfeiting as grown people call it The police were searching for him to put him in jail and that was the reason he had come back in such a hurry and carried off his poor sick wife Aunt Izzie cried with mortification when she heard this She said she thought it was a disgrace that Katy should have been visiting in a counterfeiter s family But doctor Carr only laughed He told Aunt Izzie that he didn t think that kind of crime was catching and as for missus Spenser she was much to be pitied But Aunt Izzie could not get over her vexation and every now and then when she was vexed she would refer to the affair though this all happened so long ago that most people had forgotten all about it and Philly and John had stopped playing at Putting mister Spenser in Jail which for a long time was one of their favorite games Katy always felt badly when Aunt Izzie spoke unkindly of her poor sick friend She had tears in her eyes now as she walked to the gate and looked so very sober that Imogen Clark who stood there waiting clasped her hands and said Ah I see Your aristocratic Aunt refuses Imogen s real name was Elizabeth She was rather a pretty girl with a screwed up sentimental mouth shiny brown hair and a little round curl on each of her cheeks These curls must have been fastened on with glue or tin tacks one would think for they never moved however much she laughed or shook her head Imogen was a bright girl naturally but she had read so many novels that her brain was completely turned It was partly this which made her so attractive to Katy who adored stories and thought Imogen was a real heroine of romance Oh no she doesn t she replied hardly able to keep from laughing at the idea of Aunt Izzie s being called an aristocratic relative she says she shall be my hap But here Katy s conscience gave a prick and the sentence ended in um um um So you ll come won t you darling I am so glad And I said Imogen turning up her eyes theatrically From this time on till the end of the week the children talked of nothing but Imogen s visit and the nice time they were going to have Before breakfast on Saturday morning Katy and Clover were at work building a beautiful bower of asparagus boughs under the trees All the playthings were set out in order Debby baked them some cinnamon cakes the kitten had a pink ribbon tied round her neck and the dolls including Pikery were arrayed in their best clothes About half past ten Imogen arrived She was dressed in a light blue barege with low neck and short sleeves and wore coral beads in her hair white satin slippers and a pair of yellow gloves The gloves and slippers were quite dirty and the barege was old and darned but the general effect was so very gorgeous that the children who were dressed for play in gingham frocks and white aprons were quite dazzled at the appearance of their guest Oh Imogen you look just like a young lady in a story said simple Katy whereupon Imogen tossed her head and rustled her skirts about more than ever Somehow with these fine clothes Imogen seemed to have put on a fine manner quite different from the one she used every day You know some people always do when they go out visiting You would almost have supposed that this was a different Imogen who was kept in a box most of the time and taken out for Sundays and grand occasions She swam about and diddled and lisped and looked at herself in the glass and was generally grown up and airy When Aunt Izzie spoke to her she fluttered and behaved so queerly that Clover almost laughed and even Katy who could see nothing wrong in people she loved was glad to carry her away to the playroom Come out to the bower she said putting her arm round the blue barege waist A bower cried Imogen How sweet But when they reached the asparagus boughs her face fell Why it hasn t any roof or pinnacles or any fountain she said Why no of course not said Clover staring we made it ourselves Oh said Imogen She was evidently disappointed Katy and Clover felt mortified but as their visitor did not care for the bower they tried to think of something else Let us go to the Loft they said So they all crossed the yard together Imogen picked her way daintily in the white satin slippers but when she saw the spiked post she gave a scream Oh not up there darling not up there she cried never never Oh do try It s just as easy as can be pleaded Katy going up and down half a dozen times in succession to show how easy it was But Imogen wouldn t be persuaded Do not ask me she said affectedly my nerves would never stand such a thing And besides my dress What made you wear it said Philly who was a plain spoken child and given to questions While John whispered to Dorry That s a real stupid girl Let s go off somewhere and play by ourselves So one by one the small fry crept away leaving Katy and Clover to entertain the visitor by themselves They tried dolls but Imogen did not care for dolls Then they proposed to sit down in the shade and cap verses a game they all liked But Imogen said that though she adored poetry she never could remember any So it ended in their going to the orchard where Imogen ate a great many plums and early apples and really seemed to enjoy herself But when she could eat no more a dreadful dulness fell over the party At last Imogen said Don t you ever sit in the drawing room The what asked Clover The drawing room repeated Imogen Oh she means the parlor cried Katy No we don t sit there except when Aunt Izzie has company to tea It is all dark and poky you know Beside it s so much pleasanter to be out doors Don t you think so Yes sometimes replied Imogen doubtfully but I think it would be pleasant to go in and sit there for a while now My head aches dreadfully being out here in this horrid sun Katy was at her wit s end to know what to do They scarcely ever went into the parlor which Aunt Izzie regarded as a sort of sacred place She kept cotton petticoats over all the chairs for fear of dust and never opened the blinds for fear of flies The idea of children with dusty boots going in there to sit On the other hand Katy s natural politeness made it hard to refuse a visitor anything she asked for And beside it was dreadful to think that Imogen might go away and report Katy Carr isn t allowed to sit in the best room even when she has company With a quaking heart she led the way to the parlor She dared not open the blinds so the room looked very dark She could just see Imogen s figure as she sat on the sofa and Clover twirling uneasily about on the piano stool All the time she kept listening to hear if Aunt Izzie were not coming and altogether the parlor was a dismal place to her not half so pleasant as the asparagus bower where they felt perfectly safe But Imogen who for the first time seemed comfortable began to talk Her talk was about herself Such stories she told about the things which had happened to her All the young ladies in The Ledger put together never had stranger adventures Gradually Katy and Clover got so interested that they left their seats and crouched down close to the sofa listening with open mouths to these stories Katy forgot to listen for Aunt Izzie The parlor door swung open but she did not notice it She did not even hear the front door shut when Papa came home to dinner doctor Carr stopping in the hall to glance over his newspaper heard the high pitched voice running on in the parlor At first he hardly listened then these words caught his ear Oh it was lovely girls perfectly delicious I suppose I did look well for I was all in white with my hair let down and just one rose you know here on top And he leaned over me and said in a low deep tone Lady I am a Brigand but I feel the enchanting power of your beauty You are free doctor Carr pushed the door open a little farther Nothing was to be seen but some indistinct figures but he heard Katy s voice in an eager tone Oh do go on What happened next Who on earth have the children got in the parlor he asked Aunt Izzie whom he found in the dining room The parlor cried Miss Izzie wrathfully why what are they there for Then going to the door she called out Children what are you doing in the parlor Come out right away I thought you were playing out doors Imogen had a head ache faltered Katy The three girls came out into the hall Clover and Katy looking scared and even the Enchanter of the Brigand quite crest fallen Oh said Aunt Izzie grimly I am sorry to hear that Probably you are bilious Would you like some camphor or anything No thank you replied Imogen meekly But afterwards she whispered to Katy Your aunt isn t very nice I think She s just like Jackima that horrid old woman I told you about who lived in the Brigand s Cave and did the cooking I don t think you re a bit polite to tell me so retorted Katy very angry at this speech Oh never mind dear don t take it to heart replied Imogen sweetly We can t help having relations that ain t nice you know The visit was evidently not a success Papa was very civil to Imogen at dinner but he watched her closely and Katy saw a comical twinkle in his eye which she did not like Papa had very droll eyes They saw everything and sometimes they seemed to talk almost as distinctly as his tongue Katy began to feel low spirited She confessed afterward that she should never have got through the afternoon if she hadn t run up stairs two or three times and comforted herself by reading a little in Rosamond Aren t you glad she s gone whispered Clover as they stood at the gate together watching Imogen walk down the street Oh Clover how can you said Katy But she gave Clover a great hug and I think in her heart she was glad Katy said Papa next day you came into the room then exactly like your new friend Miss Clark How I don t know what you mean answered Katy blushing deeply So said doctor Carr and he got up raising his shoulders and squaring his elbows and took a few mincing steps across the room Katy couldn t help laughing it was so funny and so like Imogen Then Papa sat down again and drew her close to him My dear he said you re an affectionate child and I m glad of it But there is such a thing as throwing away one s affection I didn t fancy that little girl at all yesterday What makes you like her so much I didn t like her so much yesterday admitted Katy reluctantly She s a great deal nicer than that at school sometimes I m glad to hear it said her father For I should be sorry to think that you really admired such silly manners And what was that nonsense I heard her telling you about Brigands It really hap began Katy Then she caught Papa s eye and bit her lip for he looked very quizzical Well she went on laughing I suppose it didn t really all happen but it was ever so funny Papa even if it was a make up And Imogen s just as good natured as can be All the girls like her Make ups are all very well said Papa as long as people don t try to make you believe they are true When they do that it seems to me it comes too near the edge of falsehood to be very safe or pleasant If I were you Katy I d be a little shy of swearing eternal friendship for Miss Clark She may be good natured as you say but I think two or three years hence she won t seem so nice to you as she does now Give me a kiss Chick and run away for there s Alexander with the buggy CHAPTER VII COUSIN HELEN S VISIT A little knot of the school girls were walking home together one afternoon in July As they neared doctor Carr s gate Maria Fiske exclaimed at the sight of a pretty bunch of flowers lying in the middle of the sidewalk 
2552-132097-0001	train-other-500	Oh my she cried see what somebody s dropped I m going to have it She stooped to pick it up But just as her fingers touched the stems the nosegay as if bewitched began to move
2552-132097-0002	train-other-500	Maria made a bewildered clutch The nosegay moved faster and at last vanished under the gate while a giggle sounded from the other side of the hedge Did you see that shrieked Maria
2552-132097-0003	train-other-500	those flowers ran away of themselves Nonsense said Katy it s those absurd children Then opening the gate she called John Dorry come out and show yourselves
2552-132097-0004	train-other-500	But nobody replied and no one could be seen The nosegay lay on the path however and picking it up Katy exhibited to the girls a long end of black thread tied to the stems
2552-132097-0005	train-other-500	That s a very favorite trick of Johnnie s she said
none	none	 she and Dorry are always tying up flowers and putting them out on the walk to tease people 
2552-132097-0006	train-other-500	Here Maria take em if you like Though I don t think John s taste in bouquets is very good Isn t it splendid to have vacation come said one of the bigger girls What are you all going to do We re going to the seaside
none	none	 Pa says 
2552-132097-0007	train-other-500	he ll take Susie and me to Niagara said Maria I m going to make my aunt a visit said Alice Blair
none	none	 She lives in a real lovely place in the country and there s a pond there 
2552-132097-0008	train-other-500	and Tom that s my cousin says he ll teach me to row What are you going to do Katy Oh I don t know play round and have splendid times replied Katy throwing her bag of books into the air and catching it again
2552-132097-0009	train-other-500	But the other girls looked as if they didn t think this good fun at all and as if they were sorry for her and Katy felt suddenly that her vacation wasn t going to be so pleasant as that of the rest
2552-132097-0010	train-other-500	I wish Papa would take us somewhere she said to Clover as they walked up the gravel path All the other girls Papas do He s too busy replied Clover Beside
2552-132097-0011	train-other-500	I don t think any of the rest of the girls have half such good times as we Ellen Robbins says she d give a million of dollars for such nice brothers and sisters as ours to play with And you know Maria and Susie have awful times at home
2552-132097-0012	train-other-500	though they do go to places missus Fiske is so particular She always says Don t and they haven t got any yard to their house or anything I wouldn t change Nor I said Katy cheering up at these words of wisdom
2552-132097-0013	train-other-500	Oh isn t it lovely to think there won t be any school to morrow Vacations are just splendid and she gave her bag another toss It fell to the ground with a crash There you ve cracked your slate
2552-132097-0014	train-other-500	said Clover No matter I sha n t want it again for eight weeks replied Katy comfortably
none	none	 as they ran up the steps 
2552-132097-0015	train-other-500	They burst open the front door and raced up stairs crying Hurrah hurrah vacation s begun Aunt Izzie vacation s begun Then they stopped short
none	none	 for lo the upper hall was all in confusion 
2552-132097-0016	train-other-500	Sounds of beating and dusting came from the spare room Tables and chairs were standing about and a cot bed which seemed to be taking a walk all by itself had stopped short at the head of the stairs and barred the way
2552-132097-0017	train-other-500	Why how queer said Katy trying to get by What can be going to happen Oh there s Aunt Izzie Aunt Izzie who s coming What are you moving the things out of the Blue room for Oh gracious is that you
2552-132097-0018	train-other-500	replied Aunt Izzie who looked very hot and flurried Now children it s no use for you to stand there asking questions I haven t got time to answer them Let the bedstead alone Katy you ll push it into the wall There I told you so as Katy gave an impatient shove
none	none	 you ve made a bad mark on the paper 
2552-132097-0019	train-other-500	What a troublesome child you are Go right down stairs both of you and don t come up this way again till after tea
none	none	 I ve just as much as I can possibly attend to till then 
2552-132097-0020	train-other-500	Just tell us what s going to happen and we will cried the children Your Cousin Helen is coming to visit us said Miss Izzie curtly and disappeared into the Blue room This was news indeed Katy and Clover
2552-132097-0021	train-other-500	ran down stairs in great excitement and after consulting a little retired to the Loft to talk it over in peace and quiet Cousin Helen coming It seemed as strange as if Queen Victoria gold crown and all
2552-132097-0022	train-other-500	had invited herself to tea Or as if some character out of a book Robinson Crusoe say or Amy Herbert had driven up with a trunk
none	none	 and announced the intention of spending a week 
2552-132097-0023	train-other-500	For to the imaginations of the children Cousin Helen was as interesting and unreal as anybody in the Fairy Tales Cinderella or Blue Beard or dear Red Riding Hood herself Only
2552-132097-0024	train-other-500	there was a sort of mixture of Sunday school book in their idea of her for Cousin Helen was very very good None of them had ever seen her Philly said he was sure she hadn t any legs
2552-132097-0025	train-other-500	because she never went away from home
none	none	 and lay on a sofa 
2552-132097-0026	train-other-500	all the time But the rest knew that this was because Cousin Helen was ill Papa always went to visit her twice a year and he liked to talk to the children about her
none	none	 and tell how sweet and patient she was and what a pretty room she lived in 
2552-132097-0027	train-other-500	Katy and Clover had played Cousin Helen so long that now they were frightened as well as glad at the idea of seeing the real one
none	none	 Do you suppose she will want us to say hymns to her all the time 
2552-132097-0028	train-other-500	asked Clover Not all the time replied Katy because you know she ll get tired and have to take naps in the afternoons And then of course she reads the Bible a great deal Oh dear
2552-132097-0029	train-other-500	how quiet we shall have to be I wonder how long she s going to stay
none	none	 What do you suppose she looks like 
2552-132097-0030	train-other-500	went on Clover Something like Lucy in missus Sherwood I guess with blue eyes and curls and a long straight nose And she ll keep her hands clasped so all the time and wear
2552-132097-0031	train-other-500	frilled wrappers and lie on the sofa perfectly still and never smile but just look patient We ll have to take off our boots in the hall Clover and go up stairs in stocking feet so as not to make a noise
2552-132097-0032	train-other-500	all the time she stays Won t it be funny giggled Clover her sober little face growing bright at the idea of this variation on the hymns The time seemed very long till the next afternoon
2552-132097-0033	train-other-500	when Cousin Helen was expected Aunt Izzie who was in a great excitement gave the children many orders about their behavior They were to do this and that and not to do the other Dorry at last
2552-132097-0034	train-other-500	announced that he wished Cousin Helen would just stay at home Clover and Elsie who had been thinking pretty much the same thing in private were glad to hear that she was on her way to a Water Cure and would stay only four days
2552-132097-0035	train-other-500	Five o clock came They all sat on the steps waiting for the carriage At last it drove up Papa was on the box He motioned the children to stand back Then
2552-132097-0036	train-other-500	he helped out a nice looking young woman who Aunt Izzie told them was Cousin Helen s nurse and then very carefully lifted Cousin Helen in his arms and brought her in Oh there are the chicks
none	none	 were the first words the children heard in such a gay 
2552-132097-0037	train-other-500	pleasant voice Do set me down somewhere uncle I want to see them so much So Papa put Cousin Helen on the hall sofa The nurse fetched a pillow and when she was made comfortable
none	none	 doctor Carr called to the little ones Cousin Helen wants to see you 
2552-132097-0038	train-other-500	he said Indeed I do said the bright voice So this is Katy
none	none	 Why what a splendid tall Katy it is And this is Clover 
2552-132097-0039	train-other-500	kissing her and this dear little Elsie You all look as natural as possible just as if I had seen you before And she hugged them all round
none	none	 not as if it was polite to like them because they were 
2552-132097-0040	train-other-500	relations but as if she had loved them and wanted them all her life There was something in Cousin Helen s face and manner which made the children at home with her at once Even Philly
2552-132097-0041	train-other-500	who had backed away with his hands behind him after staring hard for a minute or two came up with a sort of rush to get his share of kissing Still Katy s first feeling was one of disappointment Cousin Helen was not at all
2552-132097-0042	train-other-500	like Lucy in missus Sherwood s story Her nose turned up the least bit in the world She had brown hair which didn t curl a brown skin and bright eyes which danced when she laughed or spoke Her face was thin
2552-132097-0043	train-other-500	but except for that you wouldn t have guessed that she was sick She didn t fold her hands and she didn t look patient but absolutely glad and merry Her dress wasn t a frilled wrapper but a sort of loose travelling thing of pretty gray stuff
2552-132097-0044	train-other-500	with a rose colored bow and bracelets and a round hat trimmed with a gray feather All Katy s dreams about the saintly invalid seemed to take wings and fly away But the more she watched Cousin Helen
2552-132097-0045	train-other-500	the more she seemed to like her and to feel as if she were nicer than the imaginary person which she and Clover had invented She looks just like other people don t she
none	none	 whispered Cecy who had come over to have a peep at the new arrival Y e s replied Katy 
2552-132097-0046	train-other-500	doubtfully only a great great deal prettier By and by Papa carried Cousin Helen up stairs All the children wanted to go too but he told them she was tired and must rest
none	none	 So they went out doors to play till tea time Oh do let me take up the tray cried Katy at the tea table as she watched Aunt Izzie getting ready Cousin Helen s supper 
2552-132097-0047	train-other-500	Such a nice supper Cold chicken and raspberries and cream and tea in a pretty pink and white china cup And such a snow white napkin as Aunt Izzie spread over the tray No indeed said Aunt Izzie
2552-132097-0048	train-other-500	you ll drop it the first thing But Katy s eyes begged so hard that doctor Carr said Yes let her Izzie I like to see the girls useful So Katy proud of the commission
2552-132097-0049	train-other-500	took the tray and carried it carefully across the hall There was a bowl of flowers on the table As she passed she was struck with a bright idea She set down the tray and picking out a rose
2552-132097-0050	train-other-500	laid it on the napkin besides the saucer of crimson raspberries It looked very pretty and Katy smiled to herself with pleasure What are you stopping for
none	none	 called Aunt Izzie from the dining room 
2552-132097-0051	train-other-500	Do be careful Katy I really think Bridget had better take it Oh no no protested Katy I m most up already And she sped up stairs as fast as she could go Luckless speed
none	none	 She had just reached the door of the Blue room 
2552-132097-0052	train-other-500	when she tripped upon her boot lace which as usual was dangling made a misstep and stumbled She caught at the door to save herself the door flew open and Katy with the tray cream raspberries rose and all
2552-132097-0053	train-other-500	descended in a confused heap upon the carpet I told you so exclaimed Aunt Izzie from the bottom of the stairs Katy never forgot how kind Cousin Helen was on this occasion She was in bed and was of course a good deal startled
2552-132097-0054	train-other-500	at the sudden crash and tumble on her floor But after one little jump nothing could have been sweeter than the way in which she comforted poor crest fallen Katy and made so merry over the accident that even Aunt Izzie almost forgot to scold
2552-132097-0055	train-other-500	The broken dishes were piled up and the carpet made clean again while Aunt Izzie prepared another tray just as nice as the first Please let Katy bring it up pleaded Cousin Helen in her pleasant voice
2552-132097-0056	train-other-500	I am sure she will be careful this time And Katy I want just such another rose on the napkin I guess that was your doing wasn t it Katy was careful This time all went well The tray
2552-132097-0057	train-other-500	was placed safely on a little table beside the bed and Katy sat watching Cousin Helen eat her supper with a warm loving feeling at her heart I think we are scarcely ever so grateful to people
2552-132097-0058	train-other-500	as when they help us to get back our own self esteem Cousin Helen hadn t much appetite though she declared everything was delicious Katy could see that she was very tired Now she said
none	none	 when she had finished 
2552-132097-0059	train-other-500	if you ll shake up this pillow so and move this other pillow a little I think I will settle myself to sleep
none	none	 Thanks that s just right 
2552-132097-0060	train-other-500	Why Katy dear you are a born nurse Now kiss me Good night To morrow we will have a nice talk Katy went down stairs very happy
2552-132097-0061	train-other-500	Cousin Helen s perfectly lovely she told Clover And she s got on the most beautiful night gown all lace and ruffles It s just like a night gown in a book Isn t it wicked to care about clothes when you re sick
2552-132097-0062	train-other-500	questioned Cecy I don t believe Cousin Helen could do anything wicked said Katy I told Ma that she had on bracelets and Ma said she feared your cousin was a worldly person retorted Cecy primming up her lips
none	none	 Katy and Clover were quite distressed at this opinion They talked about it while they were undressing 
2552-132097-0063	train-other-500	I mean to ask Cousin Helen to morrow said Katy Next morning the children got up very early They were so glad that it was vacation If it hadn t been
none	none	 they would have been forced to go to school without seeing Cousin Helen 
2552-132097-0064	train-other-500	for she didn t wake till late They grew so impatient of the delay and went up stairs so often to listen at the door and see if she were moving that Aunt Izzie finally had to order them off Katy rebelled against this order a good deal
2552-132097-0065	train-other-500	but she consoled herself by going into the garden and picking the prettiest flowers she could find to give to Cousin Helen the moment she should see her When Aunt Izzie let her go up Cousin Helen was lying on the sofa
2552-132097-0066	train-other-500	all dressed for the day in a fresh blue muslin with blue ribbons and cunning bronze slippers with rosettes on the toes The sofa had been wheeled round with its back to the light There was a cushion
2552-132097-0067	train-other-500	with a pretty fluted cover that Katy had never seen before and several other things were scattered about which gave the room quite a different air All the house was neat but somehow Aunt Izzie s rooms never were pretty
2552-132097-0068	train-other-500	Children s eyes are quick to perceive such things and Katy saw at once that the Blue room had never looked like this Cousin Helen was white and tired but her eyes and smile were as bright as ever
2552-132097-0069	train-other-500	She was delighted with the flowers which Katy presented rather shyly Oh how lovely she said I must put them in water right away Katy dear don t you want to bring that little vase on the bureau and set it on this chair beside me And please
none	none	 pour a little water into it first 
2552-132097-0070	train-other-500	What a beauty cried Katy as she lifted the graceful white cup swung on a gilt stand Is it yours Cousin Helen Yes it is my pet vase
2552-132097-0071	train-other-500	It stands on a little table beside me at home and I fancied that the Water Cure would seem more home like if I had it with me there so I brought it along
none	none	 But why do you look so puzzled Katy 
2552-132097-0072	train-other-500	Does it seem queer that a vase should travel about in a trunk No said Katy slowly I was only thinking Cousin Helen is it worldly to have pretty things when you re sick
2552-132097-0073	train-other-500	Cousin Helen laughed heartily
none	none	 What put that idea into your head she asked 
2552-132097-0074	train-other-500	Cecy said so when I told her about your beautiful night gown Cousin Helen laughed again Well she said I ll tell you what I think Katy Pretty things are no more worldly than ugly ones except
2552-132097-0075	train-other-500	when they spoil us by making us vain or careless of the comfort of other people And sickness is such a disagreeable thing in itself that unless sick people take great pains
2552-132097-0076	train-other-500	they soon grow to be eyesores to themselves and everybody about them I don t think it is possible for an invalid to be too particular And when one has the back ache and the head ache and the all over ache she added smiling
none	none	 there isn t much danger of growing vain 
2552-132097-0077	train-other-500	because of a ruffle more or less on one s night gown
none	none	 or a bit of bright ribbon 
2552-132097-0078	train-other-500	Then she began to arrange the flowers touching each separate one gently and as if she loved it What a queer noise she exclaimed suddenly stopping It was queer
2552-132097-0079	train-other-500	a sort of snuffing and snorting sound as if a walrus or a sea horse were promenading up and down in the hall Katy opened the door Behold there were John and Dorry
2552-132097-0080	train-other-500	very red in the face from flattening their noses against the key hole in a vain attempt
none	none	 to see if Cousin Helen were up 
2552-132097-0081	train-other-500	and ready to receive company Oh let them come in cried Cousin Helen from her sofa So they came in followed before long by Clover and Elsie Such a merry morning as they had
2552-132097-0082	train-other-500	Cousin Helen proved to possess a perfect genius for story telling and for suggesting games
none	none	 which could be played about her sofa and did not make more noise than she could bear 
2552-132097-0083	train-other-500	Aunt Izzie dropping in about eleven o clock found them having such a good time that almost before she knew it she was drawn into the game too Nobody had ever heard of such a thing before
2552-132097-0084	train-other-500	There sat Aunt Izzie on the floor with three long lamp lighters stuck in her hair playing I m a genteel Lady
none	none	 always genteel in the jolliest manner possible The children were so enchanted at the spectacle 
2552-132097-0085	train-other-500	that they could hardly attend to the game and were always forgetting how many horns they had Clover privately thought that Cousin Helen must be a witch and Papa when he came home at noon said almost the same thing
2552-132097-0086	train-other-500	What have you been doing to them Helen
none	none	 he inquired as he opened the door and saw the merry circle on the carpet 
2552-132097-0087	train-other-500	Aunt Izzie s hair was half pulled down and Philly was rolling over and over in convulsions of laughter But Cousin Helen said she hadn t done anything and pretty soon Papa was on the floor too playing away as fast as the rest
2552-132097-0088	train-other-500	I must put a stop to this he cried when everybody was tired of laughing and everybody s head was stuck as full of paper quills as a porcupine s back Cousin Helen will be worn out Run away all of you and don t come near this door again till the clock strikes four
none	none	 Do you hear chicks Run run Shoo shoo 
2552-132097-0089	train-other-500	The children scuttled away like a brood of fowls all but Katy Oh Papa I ll be so quiet she pleaded Mightn t I stay just till the dinner bell rings
2552-132097-0090	train-other-500	Do let her said Cousin Helen so Papa said Yes Katy sat on the floor holding Cousin Helen s hand and listening to her talk with Papa It interested her
none	none	 though it was about things and people she did not know 
2552-132097-0091	train-other-500	How is Alex asked doctor Carr at length Quite well now replied Cousin Helen with one of her brightest looks He was run down and tired in the Spring and we were a little anxious about him
2552-132097-0092	train-other-500	but Emma persuaded him to take a fortnight s vacation and he came back all right Do you see them often Almost every day
none	none	 And little Helen comes every day you know for her lessons Is she as pretty as she used to be 
2552-132097-0093	train-other-500	Oh yes prettier I think She is a lovely little creature
none	none	 having her so much with me is one of my greatest treats 
2552-132097-0094	train-other-500	Alex tries to think that she looks a little as I used to But that is a compliment so great that I dare not appropriate it doctor Carr stooped and kissed Cousin Helen as if he could not help it My dear child
2552-132097-0095	train-other-500	he said That was all but something in the tone made Katy curious
none	none	 Papa 
2552-132097-0096	train-other-500	she said after dinner who is Alex that you and Cousin Helen were talking about Why Katy What makes you want to know I can t exactly tell only Cousin Helen looked so and you kissed her
2552-132097-0097	train-other-500	and I thought perhaps it was something interesting So it is said doctor Carr drawing her on to his knee I ve a mind to tell you about it Katy because you re old enough to see how beautiful it is and wise enough I hope not to chatter
2552-132097-0098	train-other-500	or ask questions Alex is the name of somebody who long ago when Cousin Helen was well and strong she loved and expected to marry Oh why didn t she
2552-132097-0099	train-other-500	cried Katy She met with a dreadful accident continued doctor Carr For a long time they thought she would die Then she grew slowly better and the doctors told her that she might live
2552-132097-0100	train-other-500	a good many years but that she would have to lie on her sofa always and be helpless and a cripple Alex felt dreadfully when he heard this He wanted to marry Cousin Helen just the same and be her nurse
2552-132097-0101	train-other-500	and take care of her always but she would not consent She broke the engagement and told him that some day she hoped he would love somebody else well enough to marry her So after a good many years he did
2552-132097-0102	train-other-500	and now he and his wife live next door to Cousin Helen and are her dearest friends Their little girl is named Helen All their plans are talked over with her and there is nobody in the world they think so much of
2552-132097-0103	train-other-500	But doesn t it make Cousin Helen feel bad when she sees them walking about and enjoying themselves and she can t move asked Katy No said doctor Carr it doesn t because
2552-132097-0104	train-other-500	Cousin Helen is half an angel already and loves other people better than herself I m very glad she could come here for once She s an example to us all Katy and I couldn t ask anything better
2552-132097-0105	train-other-500	than to have my little girls take pattern after her It must be awful to be sick soliloquized Katy after Papa was gone Why if I had to stay in bed a whole week I should die
none	none	 I know I should 
2552-132097-0106	train-other-500	Poor Katy It seemed to her as it does to almost all young people that there is nothing in the world so easy as to die the moment things go wrong This conversation with Papa
2552-132097-0107	train-other-500	made Cousin Helen doubly interesting in Katy s eyes It was just like something in a book to be in the same house with the heroine of a love story so sad and sweet
2552-132097-0108	train-other-500	The play that afternoon was much interrupted for every few minutes somebody had to run in and see if it wasn t four o clock The instant the hour came all six children galloped up stairs
2552-132097-0109	train-other-500	I think we ll tell stories this time said Cousin Helen So they told stories Cousin Helen s were the best of all There was one of them about a robber which sent delightful chills creeping down all their backs All but Philly
none	none	 He was so excited that he grew warlike 
2552-132097-0110	train-other-500	I ain t afraid of robbers he declared strutting up and down When they come I shall just cut them in two with my sword which Papa gave me They did come once I did cut them in two three five eleven of em You ll see
2552-132097-0111	train-other-500	But that evening after the younger children were gone to bed and Katy and Clover were sitting in the Blue room a lamentable howling was heard from the nursery Clover ran to see what was the matter Behold there was Phil
2552-132097-0112	train-other-500	sitting up in bed and crying for help There s robbers under the bed he sobbed ever so many robbers Why no Philly
none	none	 said Clover peeping under the valance to satisfy him 
2552-132097-0113	train-other-500	there isn t anybody there Yes there is I tell you declared Phil holding her tight I heard one They were chewing my india rubbers Poor little fellow said Cousin Helen when Clover
2552-132097-0114	train-other-500	having pacified Phil came back to report It s a warning against robber stories But this one ended so well
none	none	 that I didn t think of anybody s being frightened It was no use after this for Aunt Izzie to make rules about going into the Blue room She might as well have ordered flies to keep away from a sugar bowl 
2552-132097-0115	train-other-500	By hook or by crook the children would get up stairs Whenever Aunt Izzie went in she was sure to find them there just as close to Cousin Helen as they could get
none	none	 And Cousin Helen begged her not to interfere 
2552-132097-0116	train-other-500	We have only three or four days to be together she said Let them come as much as they like It won t hurt me a bit Little Elsie clung with a passionate love to this new friend Cousin Helen had sharp eyes
2552-132097-0117	train-other-500	She saw the wistful look in Elsie s face at once and took special pains to be sweet and tender to her This preference made Katy jealous She couldn t bear to share her cousin with anybody
2552-132097-0118	train-other-500	When the last evening came and they went up after tea to the Blue room Cousin Helen was opening a box
none	none	 which had just come by Express It is a Good by Box she said All of you must sit down in a row and when I hide my hands behind me 
2552-132097-0119	train-other-500	so you must choose in turn which you will take So they all chose in turn Which hand will you have the right or the left and Cousin Helen with the air of a wise fairy
2552-132097-0120	train-other-500	brought out from behind her pillow something pretty for each one First came a vase exactly like her own which Katy had admired so much Katy screamed with delight
none	none	 as it was placed in her hands Oh how lovely how lovely 
2552-132097-0121	train-other-500	she cried I ll keep it as long as I live and breathe If you do it ll be the first time you ever kept anything for a week without breaking it remarked Aunt Izzie Next came a pretty purple pocket book for Clover
2552-132097-0122	train-other-500	It was just what she wanted for she had lost her porte monnaie Then a cunning little locket on a bit of velvet ribbon which Cousin Helen tied round Elsie s neck There s a piece of my hair in it she said
2552-132097-0123	train-other-500	Why Elsie darling what s the matter Don t cry so Oh you re s o beautiful and
none	none	 s o sweet 
2552-132097-0124	train-other-500	sobbed Elsie and you re go o ing away Dorry had a box of dominoes and John a solitaire board For Phil there appeared a book The History
2552-132097-0125	train-other-500	of the Robber Cat That will remind you of the night when the thieves came and chewed your india rubbers said Cousin Helen with a mischievous smile They all laughed Phil loudest of all Nobody was forgotten
2552-132097-0126	train-other-500	There was a notebook for Papa and a set of ivory tablets for Aunt Izzie Even Cecy was remembered Her present was The Book of Golden Deeds with all sorts of stories about boys and girls
2552-132097-0127	train-other-500	who had done brave and good things She was almost too pleased to speak Oh thank you Cousin Helen she said at last Cecy wasn t a cousin but she and the Carr children were in the habit of sharing their aunts and uncles
2552-132097-0128	train-other-500	and relations generally as they did their other good things Next day came the sad parting All the little ones stood at the gate to wave their pocket handkerchiefs as the carriage drove away When it was quite out of sight
2552-132097-0129	train-other-500	Katy rushed off to weep a little weep all by herself Papa said he wished we were all like Cousin Helen she thought as she wiped her eyes and I mean to try
none	none	 though I don t suppose if I tried a thousand years I should ever get to be half so good 
2552-132097-0130	train-other-500	I ll study and keep my things in order and be ever so kind to the little ones Dear me if only Aunt Izzie was Cousin Helen how easy it would be
none	none	 Never mind I ll think about her all the time and I ll begin to morrow CHAPTER VIII TO MORROW To morrow I will begin thought Katy as she dropped asleep that night How often we all do so And what a pity it is that when morning comes and to morrow is to day we so frequently wake up feeling quite differently careless or impatient and not a bit inclined to do the fine things we planned overnight Sometimes it seems as if there must be wicked little imps in the world who are kept tied up so long as the sun shines but who creep into our bed rooms when we are asleep to tease us and ruffle our tempers Else why when we go to rest good natured and pleasant should we wake up so cross Now there was Katy Her last sleepy thought was an intention to be an angel from that time on and as much like Cousin Helen as she could and when she opened her eyes she was all out of sorts and as fractious as a bear Old Mary said that she got out of bed on the wrong side I wonder by the way if anybody will ever be wise enough to tell us which side that is so that we may always choose the other How comfortable it would be if they could You know how if we begin the day in a cross mood all sorts of unfortunate accidents seem to occur to add to our vexations The very first thing Katy did this morning was to break her precious vase the one Cousin Helen had given her It was standing on the bureau with a little cluster of blush roses in it The bureau had a swing glass While Katy was brushing her hair the glass tipped a little so that she could not see At a good humored moment this accident wouldn t have troubled her much But being out of temper to begin with it made her angry She gave the glass a violent push The lower part swung forward there was a smash and the first thing Katy knew the blush roses lay scattered all over the floor and Cousin Helen s pretty present was ruined Katy just sat down on the carpet and cried as hard as if she had been Phil himself Aunt Izzie heard her lamenting and came in I m very sorry she said picking up the broken glass but it s no more than I expected you re so careless Katy Now don t sit there in that foolish way Get up and dress yourself You ll be late to breakfast What s the matter asked Papa noticing Katy s red eyes as she took her seat at the table I ve broken my vase said Katy dolefully It was extremely careless of you to put it in such a dangerous place said her aunt You might have known that the glass would swing and knock it off Then seeing a big tear fall in the middle of Katy s plate she added Really Katy you re too big to behave like a baby Why Dorry would be ashamed to do so Pray control yourself This snub did not improve Katy s temper She went on with her breakfast in sulky silence What are you all going to do to day asked doctor Carr hoping to give things a more cheerful turn Swing cried John and Dorry both together Alexander s put us up a splendid one in the wood shed No you re not said Aunt Izzie in a positive tone the swing is not to be used till to morrow Remember that children Not till to morrow And not then unless I give you leave This was unwise of Aunt Izzie She would better have explained farther The truth was that Alexander in putting up the swing had cracked one of the staples which fastened it to the roof He meant to get a new one in the course of the day and meantime he had cautioned Miss Carr to let no one use the swing because it really was not safe If she had told this to the children all would have been right but Aunt Izzie s theory was that young people must obey their elders without explanation John and Elsie and Dorry all pouted when they heard this order Elsie recovered her good humor first I don t care she said cause I m going to be very busy I ve got to write a letter to Cousin Helen about somefing Elsie never could quite pronounce the th What asked Clover Oh somefing answered Elsie wagging her head mysteriously None of the rest of you must know Cousin Helen said so it s a secret she and me has got I don t believe Cousin Helen said so at all said Katy crossly She wouldn t tell secrets to a silly little girl like you Yes she would too retorted Elsie angrily She said I was just as good to trust as if I was ever so big And she said I was her pet So there Katy Carr Stop disputing said Aunt Izzie Katy your top drawer is all out of order I never saw anything look so badly Go up stairs at once and straighten it before you do anything else Children you must keep in the shade this morning It s too hot for you to be running about in the sun Elsie go into the kitchen and tell Debby I want to speak to her Yes said Elsie in an important tone And afterwards I m coming back to write my letter to Cousin Helen Katy went slowly up stairs dragging one foot after the other It was a warm languid day Her head ached a little and her eyes smarted and felt heavy from crying so much Everything seemed dull and hateful She said to herself that Aunt Izzie was very unkind to make her work in vacation and she pulled the top drawer open with a disgusted groan It must be confessed that Miss Izzie was right A bureau drawer could hardly look worse than this one did It reminded one of the White Knight s recipe for a pudding which began with blotting paper and ended with sealing wax and gunpowder All sorts of things were mixed together as if somebody had put in a long stick and stirred them well up There were books and paint boxes and bits of scribbled paper and lead pencils and brushes Stocking legs had come unrolled and twisted themselves about pocket handkerchiefs and ends of ribbon and linen collars Ruffles all crushed out of shape stuck up from under the heavier things and sundry little paper boxes lay empty on top the treasures they once held having sifted down to the bottom of the drawer and disappeared beneath the general mass It took much time and patience to bring order out of this confusion But Katy knew that Aunt Izzie would be up by and by and she dared not stop till all was done By the time it was finished she was very tired Going down stairs she met Elsie coming up with a slate in her hand which as soon as she saw Katy she put behind her You mustn t look she said it s my letter to Cousin Helen Nobody but me knows the secret It s all written and I m going to send it to the office See there s a stamp on it and she exhibited a corner of the slate Sure enough there was a stamp stuck on the frame You little goose said Katy impatiently you can t send that to the post office Here give me the slate I ll copy what you ve written on paper and Papa ll give you an envelope No no cried Elsie struggling you mustn t You ll see what I ve said and Cousin Helen said I wasn t to tell It s a secret Let go of my slate I say I ll tell Cousin Helen what a mean girl you are and then she won t love you a bit There then take your old slate said Katy giving her a vindictive push Elsie slipped screamed caught at the banisters missed them and rolling over and over fell with a thump on the hall floor It wasn t much of a fall only half a dozen steps but the bump was a hard one and Elsie roared as if she had been half killed Aunt Izzie and Mary came rushing to the spot Katy pushed me sobbed Elsie She wanted me to tell her my secret and I wouldn t She s a bad naughty girl Well Katy Carr I should think you d be ashamed of yourself said Aunt Izzie wreaking your temper on your poor little sister I think your Cousin Helen will be surprised when she hears this There there Elsie Don t cry any more dear Come up stairs with me I ll put on some arnica and Katy sha n t hurt you again So they went up stairs Katy left below felt very miserable repentant defiant discontented and sulky all at once She knew in her heart that she had not meant to hurt Elsie but was thoroughly ashamed of that push but Aunt Izzie s hint about telling Cousin Helen had made her too angry to allow of her confessing this to herself or anybody else I don t care she murmured choking back her tears Elsie is a real cry baby anyway And Aunt Izzie always takes her part Just because I told the little silly not to go and send a great heavy slate to the post office She went out by the side door into the yard As she passed the shed the new swing caught her eye How exactly like Aunt Izzie she thought ordering the children not to swing till she gives them leave I suppose she thinks it s too hot or something I sha n t mind her anyhow She seated herself in the swing It was a first rate one with a broad comfortable seat and thick new ropes The seat hung just the right distance from the floor Alexander was a capital hand at putting up swings and the wood shed the nicest possible spot in which to have one It was a big place with a very high roof There was not much wood left in it just now and the little there was was piled neatly about the sides of the shed so as to leave plenty of room The place felt cool and dark and the motion of the swing seemed to set the breeze blowing It waved Katy s hair like a great fan and made her dreamy and quiet All sorts of sleepy ideas began to flit through her brain Swinging to and fro like the pendulum of a great clock she gradually rose higher and higher driving herself along by the motion of her body and striking the floor smartly with her foot at every sweep Now she was at the top of the high arched door Then she could almost touch the cross beam above it and through the small square window could see pigeons sitting and pluming themselves on the eaves of the barn and white clouds blowing over the blue sky She had never swung so high before It was like flying she thought and she bent and curved more strongly in the seat trying to send herself yet higher and graze the roof with her toes Suddenly at the very highest point of the sweep there was a sharp noise of cracking The swing gave a violent twist spun half round and tossed Katy into the air She clutched the rope felt it dragged from her grasp then down down down she fell All grew dark and she knew no more When she opened her eyes she was lying on the sofa in the dining room Clover was kneeling beside her with a pale scared face and Aunt Izzie was dropping something cold and wet on her forehead What s the matter said Katy faintly Oh she s alive she s alive and Clover put her arms round Katy s neck and sobbed Hush dear Aunt Izzie s voice sounded unusually gentle You ve had a bad tumble Katy Don t you recollect A tumble Oh yes out of the swing said Katy as it all came slowly back to her Did the rope break Aunt Izzie I can t remember about it No Katy not the rope The staple drew out of the roof It was a cracked one and not safe Don t you recollect my telling you not to swing to day Did you forget No Aunt Izzie I didn t forget I but here Katy broke down She closed her eyes and big tears rolled from under the lids Don t cry whispered Clover crying herself please don t Aunt Izzie isn t going to scold you But Katy was too weak and shaken not to cry I think I d like to go up stairs and lie on the bed she said But when she tried to get off the sofa everything swam before her and she fell back again on the pillow Why I can t stand up she gasped looking very much frightened I m afraid you ve given yourself a sprain somewhere said Aunt Izzie who looked rather frightened herself You d better lie still a while dear before you try to move Ah here s the doctor well I am glad And she went forward to meet him It wasn t Papa but doctor Alsop who lived quite near them I am so relieved that you could come Aunt Izzie said My brother is gone out of town not to return till to morrow and one of the little girls has had a bad fall doctor Alsop sat down beside the sofa and counted Katy s pulse Then he began feeling all over her Can you move this leg he asked Katy gave a feeble kick And this The kick was a good deal more feeble Did that hurt you asked doctor Alsop seeing a look of pain on her face Yes a little replied Katy trying hard not to cry In your back eh Was the pain high up or low down And the doctor punched Katy s spine for some minutes making her squirm uneasily I m afraid she s done some mischief he said at last but it s impossible to tell yet exactly what It may be only a twist or a slight sprain he added seeing the look of terror on Katy s face You d better get her up stairs and undress her as soon as you can Miss Carr I ll leave a prescription to rub her with And doctor Alsop took out a bit of paper and began to write Oh must I go to bed said Katy How long will I have to stay there doctor That depends on how fast you get well replied the doctor not long I hope Perhaps only a few days A few days repeated Katy in a despairing tone After the doctor was gone Aunt Izzie and Debby lifted Katy and carried her slowly up stairs It was not easy for every motion hurt her and the sense of being helpless hurt most of all She couldn t help crying after she was undressed and put into bed It all seemed so dreadful and strange If only Papa was here she thought But doctor Carr had gone into the country to see somebody who was very sick and couldn t possibly be back till to morrow Such a long long afternoon as that was Aunt Izzie sent up some dinner but Katy couldn t eat Her lips were parched and her head ached violently The sun began to pour in the room grew warm Flies buzzed in the window and tormented her by lighting on her face Little prickles of pain ran up and down her back She lay with her eyes shut because it hurt to keep them open and all sorts of uneasy thoughts went rushing through her mind Perhaps if my back is really sprained I shall have to lie here as much as a week she said to herself Oh dear dear I can t The vacation is only eight weeks and I was going to do such lovely things How can people be as patient as Cousin Helen when they have to lie still Won t she be sorry when she hears Was it really yesterday that she went away It seems a year If only I hadn t got into that nasty old swing And then Katy began to imagine how it would have been if she hadn t and how she and Clover had meant to go to Paradise that afternoon They might have been there under the cool trees now As these thoughts ran through her mind her head grew hotter and her position in the bed more uncomfortable Suddenly she became conscious that the glaring light from the window was shaded and that the wind seemed to be blowing freshly over her She opened her heavy eyes The blinds were shut and there beside the bed sat little Elsie fanning her with a palm leaf fan Did I wake you up Katy she asked in a timid voice Katy looked at her with startled amazed eyes Don t be frightened said Elsie I won t disturb you Johnnie and me are so sorry you re sick and her little lips trembled But we mean to keep real quiet and never bang the nursery door or make noises on the stairs till you re well again And I ve brought you somefing real nice Some of it s from John and some from me It s because you got tumbled out of the swing See and Elsie pointed triumphantly to a chair which she had pulled up close to the bed and on which were solemnly set forth first A pewter tea set twod A box with a glass lid on which flowers were painted threed A jointed doll fourth A transparent slate and lastly two new lead pencils They re all yours yours to keep said generous little Elsie You can have Pikery too if you want Only he s pretty big and I m afraid he d be lonely without me Don t you like the fings Katy They re real pretty It seemed to Katy as if the hottest sort of a coal of fire was burning into the top of her head as she looked at the treasures on the chair and then at Elsie s face all lighted up with affectionate self sacrifice She tried to speak but began to cry instead which frightened Elsie very much Does it hurt you so bad she asked crying too from sympathy Oh no it isn t that sobbed Katy but I was so cross to you this morning Elsie and pushed you Oh please forgive me please do Why it s got well said Elsie surprised Aunt Izzie put a fing out of a bottle on it and the bump all went away Shall I go and ask her to put some on you too I will And she ran toward the door Oh no cried Katy don t go away Elsie Come here and kiss me instead Elsie turned as if doubtful whether this invitation could be meant for her Katy held out her arms Elsie ran right into them and the big sister and the little exchanged an embrace which seemed to bring their hearts closer together than they had ever been before You re the most precious little darling murmured Katy clasping Elsie tight I ve been real horrid to you Elsie But I ll never be again You shall play with me and Clover and Cecy just as much as you like and write notes in all the post offices and everything else Oh goody goody cried Elsie executing little skips of transport How sweet you are Katy I mean to love you next best to Cousin Helen and Papa And racking her brains for some way of repaying this wonderful kindness I ll tell you the secret if you want me to very much I guess Cousin Helen would let me No said Katy never mind about the secret I don t want you to tell it to me Sit down by the bed and fan me some more instead No persisted Elsie who now that she had made up her mind to part with the treasured secret could not bear to be stopped Cousin Helen gave me a half dollar and told me to give it to Debby and tell her she was much obliged to her for making her such nice things to eat And I did And Debby was real pleased And I wrote Cousin Helen a letter and told her that Debby liked the half dollar That s the secret Isn t it a nice one Only you mustn t tell anybody about it ever just as long as you live No said Katy smiling faintly I won t All the rest of the afternoon Elsie sat beside the bed with her palm leaf fan keeping off the flies and shue ing away the other children when they peeped in at the door Do you really like to have me here she asked more than once and smiled oh so triumphantly when Katy said Yes But though Katy said yes I am afraid it was only half the truth for the sight of the dear little forgiving girl whom she had treated unkindly gave her more pain than pleasure I ll be so good to her when I get well she thought to herself tossing uneasily to and fro Aunt Izzie slept in her room that night Katy was feverish When morning came and doctor Carr returned he found her in a good deal of pain hot and restless with wide open anxious eyes Papa she cried the first thing must I lie here as much as a week My darling I m afraid you must replied her father who looked worried and very grave Dear dear sobbed Katy how can I bear it CHAPTER IX DISMAL DAYS If anybody had told Katy that first afternoon that at the end of a week she would still be in bed and in pain and with no time fixed for getting up I think it would have almost killed her She was so restless and eager that to lie still seemed one of the hardest things in the world But to lie still and have her back ache all the time was worse yet Day after day she asked Papa with quivering lip Mayn t I get up and go down stairs this morning And when he shook his head the lip would quiver more and tears would come But if she tried to get up it hurt her so much that in spite of herself she was glad to sink back again on the soft pillows and mattress which felt so comfortable to her poor bones Then there came a time when Katy didn t even ask to be allowed to get up A time when sharp dreadful pain such as she never imagined before took hold of her When days and nights got all confused and tangled up together and Aunt Izzie never seemed to go to bed A time when Papa was constantly in her room When other doctors came and stood over her and punched and felt her back and talked to each other in low whispers It was all like a long bad dream from which she couldn t wake up though she tried ever so hard Now and then she would rouse a little and catch the sound of voices or be aware that Clover or Elsie stood at the door crying softly or that Aunt Izzie in creaking slippers was going about the room on tiptoe Then all these things would slip away again and she would drop off into a dark place where there was nothing but pain and sleep which made her forget pain and so seemed the best thing in the world We will hurry over this time for it is hard to think of our bright Katy in such a sad plight By and by the pain grew less and the sleep quieter Then as the pain became easier still Katy woke up as it were began to take notice of what was going on about her to put questions How long have I been sick she asked one morning It is four weeks yesterday said Papa Four weeks said Katy Why I didn t know it was so long as that Was I very sick Papa Very dear But you are a great deal better now How did I hurt me when I tumbled out of the swing asked Katy who was in an unusually wakeful mood I don t believe I could make you understand dear But try Papa Well did you know that you had a long bone down your back called a spine I thought that was a disease said Katy Clover said that Cousin Helen had the spine No the spine is a bone It is made up of a row of smaller bones or knobs and in the middle of it is a sort of rope of nerves called the spinal cord Nerves you know are the things we feel with Well this spinal cord is rolled up for safe keeping in a soft wrapping called membrane When you fell out of the swing you struck against one of these knobs and bruised the membrane inside and the nerve inflamed and gave you a fever in the back Do you see A little said Katy not quite understanding but too tired to question farther After she had rested a while she said Is the fever well now Papa Can I get up again and go down stairs right away Not right away I m afraid said doctor Carr trying to speak cheerfully Katy didn t ask any more questions then Another week passed and another The pain was almost gone It only came back now and then for a few minutes She could sleep now and eat and be raised in bed without feeling giddy But still the once active limbs hung heavy and lifeless and she was not able to walk or even stand alone My legs feel so queer she said one morning they are just like the Prince s legs which were turned to black marble in the Arabian Nights What do you suppose is the reason Papa Won t they feel natural soon Not soon answered doctor Carr Then he said to himself Poor child she had better know the truth So he went on aloud I am afraid my darling that you must make up your mind to stay in bed a long time How long said Katy looking frightened a month more I can t tell exactly how long answered her father The doctors think as I do that the injury to your spine is one which you will outgrow by and by because you are so young and strong But it may take a good while to do it It may be that you will have to lie here for months or it may be more The only cure for such a hurt is time and patience It is hard darling for Katy began to sob wildly but you have Hope to help you along Think of poor Cousin Helen bearing all these years without hope Oh Papa gasped Katy between her sobs doesn t it seem dreadful that just getting into the swing for a few minutes should do so much harm Such a little thing as that Yes such a little thing repeated doctor Carr sadly And it was only a little thing too forgetting Aunt Izzie s order about the swing Just for the want of the small horseshoe nail of Obedience Katy Years afterwards Katy told somebody that the longest six weeks of her life were those which followed this conversation with Papa Now that she knew there was no chance of getting well at once the days dragged dreadfully Each seemed duller and dismaller than the day before She lost heart about herself and took no interest in anything Aunt Izzie brought her books but she didn t want to read or to sew Nothing amused her Clover and Cecy would come and sit with her but hearing them tell about their plays and the things they had been doing made her cry so miserably that Aunt Izzie wouldn t let them come often They were very sorry for Katy but the room was so gloomy and Katy so cross that they didn t mind much not being allowed to see her In those days Katy made Aunt Izzie keep the blinds shut tight and she lay in the dark thinking how miserable she was and how wretched all the rest of her life was going to be Everybody was very kind and patient with her but she was too selfishly miserable to notice it Aunt Izzie ran up and down stairs and was on her feet all day trying to get something which would please her but Katy hardly said Thank you and never saw how tired Aunt Izzie looked So long as she was forced to stay in bed Katy could not be grateful for anything that was done for her But doleful as the days were they were not so bad as the nights when after Aunt Izzie was asleep Katy would lie wide awake and have long hopeless fits of crying At these times she would think of all the plans she had made for doing beautiful things when she was grown up And now I shall never do any of them she would say to herself only just lie here Papa says I may get well by and by but I sha n t I know I sha n t And even if I do I shall have wasted all these years and the others will grow up and get ahead of me and I sha n t be a comfort to them or to anybody else Oh dear oh dear how dreadful it is The first thing which broke in upon this sad state of affairs was a letter from Cousin Helen which Papa brought one morning and handed to Aunt Izzie Helen tells me she s going home this week said Aunt Izzie from the window where she had gone to read the letter Well I m sorry but I think she s quite right not to stop It s just as she says one invalid at a time is enough in a house I m sure I have my hands full with Katy Oh Aunt Izzie cried Katy is Cousin Helen coming this way when she goes home Oh do make her stop If it s just for one day do ask her I want to see her so much I can t tell you how much Won t you Please Please dear Papa She was almost crying with eagerness Why yes darling if you wish it so much said doctor Carr It will cost Aunt Izzie some trouble but she s so kind that I m sure she ll manage it if it is to give you so much pleasure Can t you Izzie And he looked eagerly at his sister Of course I will said Miss Izzie heartily Katy was so glad that for the first time in her life she threw her arms of her own accord round Aunt Izzie s neck and kissed her Thank you dear Aunty she said Aunt Izzie looked as pleased as could be She had a warm heart hidden under her fidgety ways only Katy had never been sick before to find it out For the next week Katy was feverish with expectation At last Cousin Helen came This time Katy was not on the steps to welcome her but after a little while Papa brought Cousin Helen in his arms and sat her in a big chair beside the bed How dark it is she said after they had kissed each other and talked for a minute or two I can t see your face at all Would it hurt your eyes to have a little more light Oh no answered Katy It don t hurt my eyes only I hate to have the sun come in It makes me feel worse somehow Push the blind open a little bit then Clover and Clover did so Now I can see said Cousin Helen It was a forlorn looking child enough which she saw lying before her Katy s face had grown thin and her eyes had red circles about them from continual crying Her hair had been brushed twice that morning by Aunt Izzie but Katy had run her fingers impatiently through it till it stood out above her head like a frowsy bush She wore a calico dressing gown which though clean was particularly ugly in pattern and the room for all its tidiness had a dismal look with the chairs set up against the wall and a row of medicine bottles on the chimney piece Isn t it horrid sighed Katy as Cousin Helen looked around Everything s horrid But I don t mind so much now that you ve come Oh Cousin Helen I ve had such a dreadful dreadful time I know said her cousin pityingly I ve heard all about it Katy and I m so very sorry for you It is a hard trial my poor darling But how do you do it cried Katy How do you manage to be so sweet and beautiful and patient when you re feeling badly all the time and can t do anything or walk or stand her voice was lost in sobs Cousin Helen didn t say anything for a little while She just sat and stroked Katy s hand Katy she said at last has Papa told you that he thinks you are going to get well by and by Yes replied Katy he did say so But perhaps it won t be for a long long time And I wanted to do so many things And now I can t do anything at all What sort of things Study and help people and become famous And I wanted to teach the children Mamma said I must take care of them and I meant to And now I can t go to school or learn anything myself And if I ever do get well the children will be almost grown up and they won t need me But why must you wait till you get well asked Cousin Helen smiling Why Cousin Helen what can I do lying here in bed A good deal Shall I tell you Katy what it seems to me that I should say to myself if I were in your place Yes please replied Katy wonderingly I should say this Now Katy Carr you wanted to go to school and learn to be wise and useful and here s a chance for you God is going to let you go to His school where He teaches all sorts of beautiful things to people Perhaps He will only keep you for one term or perhaps it may be for three or four but whichever it is you must make the very most of the chance because He gives it to you Himself But what is the school asked Katy I don t know what you mean It is called The School of Pain replied Cousin Helen with her sweetest smile And the place where the lessons are to be learned is this room of yours The rules of the school are pretty hard but the good scholars who keep them best find out after a while how right and kind they are And the lessons aren t easy either but the more you study the more interesting they become What are the lessons asked Katy getting interested and beginning to feel as if Cousin Helen were telling her a story Well there s the lesson of Patience That s one of the hardest studies You can t learn much of it at a time but every bit you get by heart makes the next bit easier And there s the lesson of Cheerfulness And the lesson of Making the Best of Things Sometimes there isn t anything to make the best of remarked Katy dolefully Yes there is always Everything in the world has two handles Didn t you know that One is a smooth handle If you take hold of it the thing comes up lightly and easily but if you seize the rough handle it hurts your hand and the thing is hard to lift Some people always manage to get hold of the wrong handle Is Aunt Izzie a thing asked Katy Cousin Helen was glad to hear her laugh Yes Aunt Izzie is a thing and she has a nice pleasant handle too if you just try to find it And the children are things also in one sense All their handles are different You know human beings aren t made just alike like red flower pots We have to feel and guess before we can make out just how other people go and how we ought to take hold of them It is very interesting I advise you to try it And while you are trying you will learn all sorts of things which will help you to help others If I only could sighed Katy Are there any other studies in the School Cousin Helen Yes there s the lesson of Hopefulness That class has ever so many teachers The Sun is one He sits outside the window all day waiting a chance to slip in and get at his pupil He s a first rate teacher too I wouldn t shut him out if I were you Every morning the first thing when I woke up I would say to myself I am going to get well so Papa thinks Perhaps it may be to morrow So in case this should be the last day of my sickness let me spend it beauti fully and make my sick room so pleasant that everybody will like to remember it Then there is one more lesson Katy the lesson of Neatness School rooms must be kept in order you know A sick person ought to be as fresh and dainty as a rose But it is such a fuss pleaded Katy I don t believe you ve any idea what a bother it is to always be nice and in order You never were careless like me Cousin Helen you were born neat Oh was I said her Cousin Well Katy we won t dispute that point but I ll tell you a story if you like about a girl I once knew who wasn t born neat Oh do cried Katy enchanted Cousin Helen had done her good already She looked brighter and less listless than for days This girl was quite young continued Cousin Helen she was strong and active and liked to run and climb and ride and do all sorts of jolly things One day something happened an accident and they told her that all the rest of her life she had got to lie on her back and suffer pain and never walk any more or do any of the things she enjoyed most Just like you and me whispered Katy squeezing Cousin Helen s hand Something like me but not so much like you because you know we hope you are going to get well one of these days The girl didn t mind it so much when they first told her for she was so ill that she felt sure she should die But when she got better and began to think of the long life which lay before her that was worse than ever the pain had been She was so wretched that she didn t care what became of anything or how anything looked She had no Aunt Izzie to look after things so her room soon got into a dreadful state It was full of dust and confusion and dirty spoons and phials of physic She kept the blinds shut and let her hair tangle every which way and altogether was a dismal spectacle This girl had a dear old father went on Cousin Helen who used to come every day and sit beside her bed One morning he said to her My daughter I m afraid you ve got to live in this room for a long time Now there s one thing I want you to do for my sake What s that she asked surprised to hear there was anything left which she could do for anybody I want you to turn out all these physic bottles and make your room pleasant and pretty for me to come and sit in You see I shall spend a good deal of my time here Now I don t like dust and darkness I like to see flowers on the table and sunshine in at the window Will you do this to please me Yes said the girl but she gave a sigh and I am afraid she felt as if it was going to be a dreadful trouble Then another thing continued her father I want you to look pretty Can t nightgowns and wrappers be trimmed and made becoming just as much as dresses A sick woman who isn t neat is a disagreeable object Do to please me send for something pretty and let me see you looking nice again I can t bear to have my Helen turn into a slattern Helen exclaimed Katy with wide open eyes was it you Yes said her cousin smiling It was I though I didn t mean to let the name slip out so soon So after my father was gone away I sent for a looking glass Such a sight Katy My hair was a perfect mouse s nest and I had frowned so much that my forehead was all criss crossed with lines of pain till it looked like an old woman s Katy stared at Cousin Helen s smooth brow and glossy hair I can t believe it she said your hair never could be rough Yes it was worse a great deal than yours looks now But that peep in the glass did me good I began to think how selfishly I was behaving and to desire to do better And after that when the pain came on I used to lie and keep my forehead smooth with my fingers and try not to let my face show what I was enduring So by and by the wrinkles wore away and though I am a good deal older now they have never come back It was a great deal of trouble at first to have to think and plan to keep my room and myself looking nice But after a while it grew to be a habit and then it became easy And the pleasure it gave my dear father repaid for all He had been proud of his active healthy girl but I think she was never such a comfort to him as his sick one lying there in her bed My room was his favorite sitting place and he spent so much time there that now the room and everything in it makes me think of him There were tears in Cousin Helen s eyes as she ceased speaking But Katy looked bright and eager It seemed somehow to be a help as well as a great surprise that ever there should have been a time when Cousin Helen was less perfect than she was now Do you really think I could do so too she asked Do what Comb your hair Cousin Helen was smiling now Oh no Be nice and sweet and patient and a comfort to people You know what I mean I am sure you can if you try But what would you do first asked Katy who now that her mind had grasped a new idea was eager to begin Well first I would open the blinds and make the room look a little less dismal Are you taking all those medicines in the bottles now No only that big one with the blue label Then you might ask Aunt Izzy to take away the others And I d get Clover to pick a bunch of fresh flowers every day for your table By the way I don t see the little white vase No it got broken the very day after you went away the day I fell out of the swing said Katy sorrowfully Never mind pet don t look so doleful I know the tree those vases grow upon and you shall have another Then after the room is made pleasant I would have all my lesson books fetched up if I were you and I would study a couple of hours every morning Oh cried Katy making a wry face at the idea Cousin Helen smiled I know said she it sounds like dull work learning geography and doing sums up here all by yourself But I think if you make the effort you ll be glad by and by You won t lose so much ground you see won t slip back quite so far in your education And then studying will be like working at a garden where things don t grow easily Every flower you raise will be a sort of triumph and you will value it twice as much as a common flower which has cost no trouble Well said Katy rather forlornly I ll try But it won t be a bit nice studying without anybody to study with me Is there anything else Cousin Helen Just then the door creaked and Elsie timidly put her head into the room Oh Elsie run away cried Katy Cousin Helen and I are talking Don t come just now Katy didn t speak unkindly but Elsie s face fell and she looked disappointed She said nothing however but shut the door and stole away Cousin Helen watched this little scene without speaking For a few minutes after Elsie was gone she seemed to be thinking Katy she said at last you were saying just now that one of the things you were sorry about was that while you were ill you could be of no use to the children Do you know I don t think you have that reason for being sorry Why not said Katy astonished Because you can be of use It seems to me that you have more of a chance with the children now than you ever could have had when you were well and flying about as you used You might do almost anything you liked with them I can t think what you mean said Katy sadly Why Cousin Helen half the time I don t even know where they are or what they are doing And I can t get up and go after them you know But you can make your room such a delightful place that they will want to come to you Don t you see a sick person has one splendid chance she is always on hand Everybody who wants her knows just where to go If people love her she gets naturally to be the heart of the house Once make the little ones feel that your room is the place of all others to come to when they are tired or happy or grieved or sorry about anything and that the Katy who lives there is sure to give them a loving reception and the battle is won For you know we never do people good by lecturing only by living their lives with them and helping a little here and a little there to make them better And when one s own life is laid aside for a while as yours is now that is the very time to take up other people s lives as we can t do when we are scurrying and bustling over our own affairs But I didn t mean to preach a sermon I m afraid you re tired No I m not a bit said Katy holding Cousin Helen s hand tight in hers you can t think how much better I feel Oh Cousin Helen I will try It won t be easy replied her cousin There will be days when your head aches and you feel cross and fretted and don t want to think of any one but yourself And there ll be other days when Clover and the rest will come in as Elsie did just now and you will be doing something else and will feel as if their coming was a bother But you must recollect that every time you forget and are impatient or selfish you chill them and drive them farther away They are loving little things and are so sorry for you now that nothing you do makes them angry But by and by they will get used to having you sick and if you haven t won them as friends they will grow away from you as they get older Just then doctor Carr came in Oh Papa you haven t come to take Cousin Helen have you cried Katy Indeed I have said her father I think the big invalid and the little invalid have talked quite long enough Cousin Helen looks tired For a minute Katy felt just like crying But she choked back the tears My first lesson in Patience she said to herself and managed to give a faint watery smile as Papa looked at her That s right dear whispered Cousin Helen as she bent forward to kiss her And one last word Katy In this school to which you and I belong there is one great comfort and that is that the Teacher is always at hand He never goes away If things puzzle us there He is close by ready to explain and make all easy Try to think of this darling and don t be afraid to ask Him for help if the lesson seems too hard Katy had a strange dream that night She thought she was trying to study a lesson out of a book which wouldn t come quite open She could just see a little bit of what was inside but it was in a language which she did not understand She tried in vain not a word could she read and yet for all that it looked so interesting that she longed to go on Oh if somebody would only help me she cried impatiently Suddenly a hand came over her shoulder and took hold of the book It opened at once and showed the whole page And then the forefinger of the hand began to point to line after line and as it moved the words became plain and Katy could read them easily She looked up There stooping over her was a great beautiful Face The eyes met hers The lips smiled Why didn t you ask me before Little Scholar said a voice Why it is You just as Cousin Helen told me cried Katy She must have spoken in her sleep for Aunt Izzie half woke up and said What is it Do you want anything The dream broke and Katy roused to find herself in bed with the first sunbeams struggling in at the window and Aunt Izzie raised on her elbow looking at her with a sort of sleepy wonder CHAPTER X saint NICHOLAS AND saint VALENTINE What are the children all doing to day said Katy laying down Norway and the Norwegians which she was reading for the fourth time I haven t seen them since breakfast Aunt Izzie who was sewing on the other side of the room looked up from her work I don t know she said they re over at Cecy s or somewhere They ll be back before long I guess Her voice sounded a little odd and mysterious but Katy didn t notice it I thought of such a nice plan yesterday she went on That was that all of them should hang their stockings up here to morrow night instead of in the nursery Then I could see them open their presents you know Mayn t they Aunt Izzie It would be real fun I don t believe there will be any objection replied her aunt She looked as if she were trying not to laugh Katy wondered what was the matter with her It was more than two months now since Cousin Helen went away and Winter had fairly come Snow was falling out doors Katy could see the thick flakes go whirling past the window but the sight did not chill her It only made the room look warmer and more cosy It was a pleasant room now There was a bright fire in the grate Everything was neat and orderly the air was sweet with mignonette from a little glass of flowers which stood on the table and the Katy who lay in bed was a very different looking Katy from the forlorn girl of the last chapter Cousin Helen s visit though it lasted only one day did great good Not that Katy grew perfect all at once None of us do that even in books But it is everything to be started in the right path Katy s feet were on it now and though she often stumbled and slipped and often sat down discouraged she kept on pretty steadily in spite of bad days which made her say to herself that she was not getting forward at all These bad days when everything seemed hard and she herself was cross and fretful and drove the children out of her room cost Katy many bitter tears But after them she would pick herself up and try again and harder And I think that in spite of drawbacks the little scholar on the whole was learning her lesson pretty well Cousin Helen was a great comfort all this time She never forgot Katy Nearly every week some little thing came from her Sometimes it was a pencil note written from her sofa Sometimes it was an interesting book or a new magazine or some pretty little thing for the room The crimson wrapper which Katy wore was one of her presents so were the bright chromos of Autumn leaves which hung on the wall the little stand for the books all sorts of things Katy loved to look about her as she lay All the room seemed full of Cousin Helen and her kindness I wish I had something pretty to put into everybody s stocking she went on wistfully but I ve only got the muffetees for Papa and these reins for Phil She took them from under her pillow as she spoke gay worsted affairs with bells sewed on here and there She had knit them herself a very little bit at a time There s my pink sash she said suddenly I might give that to Clover I only wore it once you know and I don t think I got any spots on it Would you please fetch it and let me see Aunt Izzie It s in the top drawer Aunt Izzie brought the sash It proved to be quite fresh and they both decided that it would do nicely for Clover You know I sha n t want sashes for ever so long said Katy in rather a sad tone And this is a beauty When she spoke next her voice was bright again I wish I had something real nice for Elsie Do you know Aunt Izzie I think Elsie is the dearest little girl that ever was I m glad you ve found it out said Aunt Izzie who had always been specially fond of Elsie What she wants most of all is a writing desk continued Katy And Johnnie wants a sled But oh dear these are such big things And I ve only got two dollars and a quarter Aunt Izzie marched out of the room without saying anything When she came back she had something folded up in her hand I didn t know what to give you for Christmas Katy she said because Helen sends you such a lot of things that there don t seem to be anything you haven t already So I thought I d give you this and let you choose for yourself But if you ve set your heart on getting presents for the children perhaps you d rather have it now So saying Aunt Izzie laid on the bed a crisp new five dollar bill How good you are cried Katy flushed with pleasure And indeed Aunt Izzie did seem to have grown wonderfully good of late Perhaps Katy had got hold of her smooth handle Being now in possession of seven dollars and a quarter Katy could afford to be gorgeously generous She gave Aunt Izzie an exact description of the desk she wanted It s no matter about its being very big said Katy but it must have a blue velvet lining and an inkstand with a silver top And please buy some little sheets of paper and envelopes and a pen handle the prettiest you can find Oh and there must be a lock and key Don t forget that Aunt Izzie No I won t What else I d like the sled to be green went on Katy and to have a nice name Sky Scraper would be nice if there was one Johnnie saw a sled once called Sky Scraper and she said it was splendid And if there s money enough left Aunty won t you buy me a real nice book for Dorry and another for Cecy and a silver thimble for Mary Her old one is full of holes Oh and some candy And something for Debby and Bridget some little thing you know I think that s all Was ever seven dollars and a quarter expected to do so much Aunt Izzie must have been a witch indeed to make it hold out But she did and next day all the precious bundles came home How Katy enjoyed untying the strings Everything was exactly right There wasn t any Sky Scraper said Aunt Izzie so I got Snow Skimmer instead It s beautiful and I like it just as well said Katy contentedly Oh hide them hide them she cried with sudden terror somebody s coming But the somebody was only Papa who put his head into the room as Aunt Izzie laden with bundles scuttled across the hall Katy was glad to catch him alone She had a little private secret to talk over with him It was about Aunt Izzie for whom she as yet had no present I thought perhaps you d get me a book like that one of Cousin Helen s which Aunt Izzie liked so much she said I don t recollect the name exactly It was something about a Shadow But I ve spent all my money Never mind about that said doctor Carr We ll make that right The Shadow of the Cross was that it I ll buy it this afternoon Oh thank you Papa And please get a brown cover if you can because Cousin Helen s was brown And you won t let Aunt Izzie know will you Be careful Papa I ll swallow the book first brown cover and all said Papa making a funny face He was pleased to see Katy so interested about anything again These delightful secrets took up so much of her thoughts that Katy scarcely found time to wonder at the absence of the children who generally haunted her room but who for three days back had hardly been seen However after supper they all came up in a body looking very merry and as if they had been having a good time somewhere You don t know what we ve been doing began Philly Hush Phil said Clover in a warning voice Then she divided the stockings which she held in her hand And everybody proceeded to hang them up Dorry hung his on one side of the fireplace and John hers exactly opposite Clover and Phil suspended theirs side by side on two handles of the bureau I m going to put mine here close to Katy so that she can see it the first fing in the mornin said Elsie pinning hers to the bed post Then they all sat down round the fire to write their wishes on bits of paper and see whether they would burn or fly up the chimney If they did the latter it was a sign that Santa Claus had them safe and would bring the things wished for John wished for a sled and a doll s tea set and the continuation of the Swiss Family Robinson Dorry s list ran thus A plum cake A new Bibel Harry and Lucy A Kellidescope Everything else Santa Claus likes When they had written these lists they threw them into the fire The fire gave a flicker just then and the papers vanished Nobody saw exactly how John thought they flew up chimney but Dorry said they didn t Phil dropped his piece in very solemnly It flamed for a minute then sank into ashes There you won t get it whatever it was said Dorry What did you write Phil Nofing said Phil only just Philly Carr The children shouted I wrote a writing desk on mine remarked Elsie sorrowfully but it all burned up Katy chuckled when she heard this And now Clover produced her list She read aloud Strive and Thrive A pair of kid gloves A muff A good temper Then she dropped it into the fire Behold it flew straight up chimney How queer said Katy none of the rest of them did that The truth was that Clover who was a canny little mortal had slipped across the room and opened the door just before putting her wishes in This of course made a draft and sent the paper right upward Pretty soon Aunt Izzie came in and swept them all off to bed I know how it will be in the morning she said you ll all be up and racing about as soon as it is light So you must get your sleep now if ever After they had gone Katy recollected that nobody had offered to hang a stocking up for her She felt a little hurt when she thought of it But I suppose they forgot she said to herself A little later Papa and Aunt Izzie came in and they filled the stockings It was great fun Each was brought to Katy as she lay in bed that she might arrange it as she liked The toes were stuffed with candy and oranges Then came the parcels all shapes and sizes tied in white paper with ribbons and labelled What s that asked doctor Carr as Aunt Izzie rammed a long narrow package into Clover s stocking A nail brush answered Aunt Izzie Clover needed a new one How Papa and 
2230_132101_000012_000000	train-clean-360	Katy laughed 
none	none	I don t believe Santa Claus ever had such a thing before said doctor Carr He s a very dirty old gentleman then observed Aunt Izzie grimly The desk and sled were too big to go into any stocking so they were wrapped in paper and hung beneath the other things It was ten o clock before all was done and Papa and Aunt Izzie went away Katy lay a long time watching the queer shapes of the stocking legs as they dangled in the firelight Then she fell asleep It seemed only a minute before something touched her and woke her up Behold it was day time and there was Philly in his nightgown climbing up on the bed to kiss her The rest of the children half dressed were dancing about with their stockings in their hands Merry Christmas Merry Christmas they cried Oh Katy such beautiful beautiful things Oh shrieked Elsie who at that moment spied her desk Santa Claus did bring it after all Why it s got from Katy written on it Oh Katy it s so sweet and I m so happy and Elsie hugged Katy and sobbed for pleasure But what was that strange thing beside the bed Katy stared and rubbed her eyes It certainly had not been there when she went to sleep How had it come It was a little evergreen tree planted in a red flower pot The pot had stripes of gilt paper stuck on it and gilt stars and crosses which made it look very gay The boughs of the tree were hung with oranges and nuts and shiny red apples and pop corn balls and strings of bright berries There were also a number of little packages tied with blue and crimson ribbon and altogether the tree looked so pretty that Katy gave a cry of delighted surprise It s a Christmas tree for you because you re sick you know said the children all trying to hug her at once We made it ourselves said Dorry hopping about on one foot I pasted the black stars on the pot And I popped the corn cried Philly Do you like it asked Elsie cuddling close to Katy That s my present that one tied with a green ribbon I wish it was nicer Don t you want to open em right away Of course Katy wanted to All sorts of things came out of the little bundles The children had arranged every parcel themselves No grown person had been allowed to help in the least Elsie s present was a pen wiper with a gray flannel kitten on it Johnnie s a doll s tea tray of scarlet tin Isn t it beau ti ful she said admiringly Dorry s gift I regret to say was a huge red and yellow spider which whirred wildly when waved at the end of its string They didn t want me to buy it said he but I did I thought it would amoose you Does it amoose you Katy Yes indeed said Katy laughing and blinking as Dorry waved the spider to and fro before her eyes You can play with it when we ain t here and you re all alone you know remarked Dorry highly gratified But you don t notice what the tree s standing upon said Clover It was a chair a very large and curious one with a long cushioned back which ended in a footstool That s Papa s present said Clover see it tips back so as to be just like a bed And Papa says he thinks pretty soon you can lie on it in the window where you can see us play Does he really said Katy doubtfully It still hurt her very much to be touched or moved And see what s tied to the arm of the chair said Elsie It was a little silver bell with Katy engraved on the handle Cousin Helen sent it It s for you to ring when you want anybody to come explained Elsie More surprises To the other arm of the chair was fastened a beautiful book It was The Wide Wide World and there Was Katy s name written on it from her affectionate Cecy On it stood a great parcel of dried cherries from missus Hall missus Hall had the most delicious dried cherries the children thought How perfectly lovely everybody is said Katy with grateful tears in her eyes That was a pleasant Christmas The children declared it to be the nicest they had ever had And though Katy couldn t quite say that she enjoyed it too and was very happy It was several weeks before she was able to use the chair but when once she became accustomed to it it proved very comfortable Aunt Izzie would dress her in the morning tip the chair back till it was on a level with the bed and then very gently and gradually draw her over on to it Wheeling across the room was always painful but sitting in the window and looking out at the clouds the people going by and the children playing in the snow was delightful How delightful nobody knows excepting those who like Katy have lain for six months in bed without a peep at the outside world Every day she grew brighter and more cheerful How jolly Santa Claus was this year She happened to say one day when she was talking with Cecy I wish another Saint would come and pay us a visit But I don t know any more except Cousin Helen and she can t There s saint Valentine suggested Cecy Sure enough What a bright thought cried Katy clapping her hands Oh Cecy let s do something funny on Valentine s Day Such a good idea has just popped into my mind So the two girls put their heads together and held a long mysterious confabulation What it was about we shall see farther on Valentine s Day was the next Friday When the children came home from school on Thursday afternoon Aunt Izzie met them and to their great surprise told them that Cecy was come to drink tea and they must all go up stairs and be made nice But Cecy comes most every day remarked Dorry who didn t see the connection between this fact and having his face washed Yes but to night you are to take tea in Katy s room said Aunt Izzie here are the invitations one for each of you Sure enough there was a neat little note for each requesting the pleasure of their company at Queen Katharine s Palace that afternoon at six o clock This put quite a different aspect on the affair The children scampered up stairs and pretty soon all nicely brushed and washed they were knocking formally at the door of the Palace How fine it sounded The room looked bright and inviting Katy in her chair sat close to the fire Cecy was beside her and there was a round table all set out with a white cloth and mugs of milk and biscuit and strawberry Jam and doughnuts In the middle was a loaf of frosted cake There was something on the icing which looked like pink letters and Clover leaning forward read aloud saint Valentine What s that for asked Dorry Why you know this is saint Valentine s Eve replied Katy Debbie remembered it I guess so she put that on Nothing more was said about saint Valentine just then But when the last pink letter of his name had been eaten and the supper had been cleared away suddenly as the children sat by the fire there was a loud rap at the door Who can that be said Katy please see Clover So Clover opened the door There stood Bridget trying very hard not to laugh and holding a letter in her hand It s a note as has come for you Miss Clover she said For me cried Clover much amazed Then she shut the door and brought the note to the table How very funny she exclaimed as she looked at the envelope which was a green and white one There was something hard inside Clover broke the seal Out tumbled a small green velvet pincushion made in the shape of a clover leaf with a tiny stem of wire wound with green silk Pinned to the cushion was a paper with these verses Some people love roses well Tulips gayly dressed Some love violets blue and sweet I love Clover best Though she has a modest air Though no grace she boast Though no gardener call her fair I love Clover most Butterfly may pass her by He is but a rover I m a faithful loving Bee And I stick to Clover This was the first valentine Clover had ever had She was perfectly enchanted Oh who do you suppose sent it she cried But before anybody could answer there came another loud knock at the door which made them all jump Behold Bridget again with a second letter It s for you Miss Elsie this time she said with a grin There was an instant rush from all the children and the envelope was torn open in the twinkling of an eye Inside was a little ivory seal with Elsie on it in old English letters and these rhymes I know a little girl She is very dear to me She is just as sweet as honey When she chooses so to be And her name begins with E and ends with E She has brown hair which curls And black eyes for to see With teeth like tiny pearls And dimples one two three And her name begins with E and ends with E Her little feet run faster Than other feet can flee As she brushes quickly past her Voice hums like a bee And her name begins with E and ends with E Do you ask me why I love her Then I shall answer thee Because I can t help loving She is so sweet to me This little girl whose name begins and ends with E It s just like a fairy story said Elsie whose eyes had grown as big as saucers from surprise while these verses were being read aloud by Cecy Another knock This time there was a perfect handful of letters Everybody had one Katy to her great surprise had two Why what can this be she said But when she peeped into the second one she saw Cousin Helen s handwriting and she put it into her pocket till the valentines should be read Dorry s was opened first It had the picture of a pie at the top I ought to explain that Dorry had lately been having a siege with the dentist Little Jack Horner Sat in his corner Eating his Christmas pie When a sudden grimace Spread over his face And he began loudly to cry His tender Mamma Heard the sound from afar And hastened to comfort her child What aileth my John She inquired in a tone Which belied her question mild Oh Mother he said Every tooth in my head Jumps and aches and is loose O my And it hurts me to eat Anything that is sweet So what will become of my pie It were vain to describe How he roared and he cried And howled like a miniature tempest Suffice it to say That the very next day He had all his teeth pulled by a dentist This valentine made the children laugh for a long time Johnnie s envelope held a paper doll named Red Riding Hood These were the verses I send you my picture dear Johnnie to show That I m just as alive as you And that you needn t cry over my fate Any more as you used to do The wolf didn t hurt me at all that day For I kicked and fought and cried Till he dropped me out of his mouth and ran Away in the woods to hide And Grandma and I have lived ever since In the little brown house so small And churned fresh butter and made cream cheeses Nor seen the wolf at all So cry no more for fear I am eaten The naughty wolf is shot And if you will come to tea some evening You shall see for yourself I m not Johnnie was immensely pleased at this for Red Riding Hood was a great favorite of hers Philly had a bit of india rubber in his letter which was written with very black ink on a big sheet of foolscap I was once a naughty man And I hid beneath the bed To steal your india rubbers But I chewed them up instead Then you called out Who is there I was thrown most in a fit And I let the india rubbers fall All but this little bit I m sorry for my naughty ways And now to make amends I send the chewed piece back again And beg we may be friends ROBBER Just listen to mine said Cecy who had all along pretended to be as much surprised as anybody and now behaved as if she could hardly wait till Philly s was finished Then she read aloud TO CECY If I were a bird And you were a bird What would we do Why you should be little and I would be big And side by side on a cherry tree twig We d kiss with our yellow bills and coo That s what we d do If I were a fish And you were a fish What would we do We d frolic and whisk our little tails And play all sorts of tricks with the whales And call on the oysters and order a stew That s what we d do If I were a bee And you were a bee What would we do We d find a home in a breezy wood And store it with honey sweet and good You should feed me and I would feed you That s what we d do VALENTINE I think that s the prettiest of all said Clover I don t said Elsie I think mine is the prettiest Cecy didn t have any seal in hers either And she fondled the little seal which all this time she had held in her hand Katy you ought to have read yours first because you are the oldest said Clover Mine isn t much replied Katy and she read The rose is red the violet blue Sugar is sweet and so are you What a mean valentine cried Elsie with flashing eyes It s a real shame Katy You ought to have had the best of all Katy could hardly keep from laughing The fact was that the verses for the others had taken so long that no time had been left for writing a valentine to herself So thinking it would excite suspicion to have none she had scribbled this old rhyme at the last moment It isn t very nice she said trying to look as pensive as she could but never mind It s a shame repeated Elsie petting her very hard to make up for the injustice Hasn t it been a funny evening said John and Dorry replied Yes we never had such good times before Katy was sick did we Katy heard this with a mingled feeling of pleasure and pain I think the children do love me a little more of late she said to herself But oh why couldn t I be good to them when I was well and strong She didn t open Cousin Helen s letter until the rest were all gone to bed I think somebody must have written and told about the valentine party for instead of a note there were these verses in Cousin Helen s own clear pretty hand It wasn t a valentine because it was too solemn as Katy explained to Clover next day But she added it is a great deal beautifuller than any valentine that ever was written And Clover thought so too These were the verses IN SCHOOL I used to go to a bright school Where Youth and Frolic taught in turn But idle scholar that I was I liked to play I would not learn So the Great Teacher did ordain That I should try the School of Pain One of the infant class I am With little easy lessons set In a great book the higher class Have harder ones than I and yet I find mine hard and can t restrain My tears while studying thus with Pain There are two Teachers in the school One has a gentle voice and low And smiles upon her scholars as She softly passes to and fro Her name is Love tis very plain She shuns the sharper teacher Pain Or so I sometimes think and then At other times they meet and kiss And look so strangely like that I Am puzzled to tell how it is Or whence the change which makes it vain To guess if it be Love or Pain They tell me if I study well And learn my lessons I shall be Moved upward to that higher class Where dear Love teaches constantly And I work hard in hopes to gain Reward and get away from Pain Yet Pain is sometimes kind and helps Me on when I am very dull I thank him often in my heart But Love is far more beautiful Under her tender gentle reign I must learn faster than of Pain So I will do my very best Nor chide the clock nor call it slow That when the Teacher calls me up To see if I am fit to go I may to Love s high class attain And bid a sweet good by to Pain CHAPTER XI A NEW LESSON TO LEARN It was a long time before the children ceased to talk and laugh over that jolly evening 
2230_132101_000002_000001	train-clean-360	Dorry declared he wished there could be a Valentine s Day every week 
none	none	Don t you think saint Valentine would be tired of writing verses asked Katy But she too had enjoyed the frolic and the bright recollection helped her along through the rest of the long cold winter Spring opened late that year but the Summer when it came was a warm one 
2230_132101_000004_000001	train-clean-360	Katy felt the heat very much 
none	none	She could not change her seat and follow the breeze about from window to window as other people could The long burning days left her weak and parched She hung her head and seemed to wilt like the flowers in the garden beds Indeed she was worse off than they for every evening Alexander gave them a watering with the hose while nobody was able to bring a watering pot and pour out what she needed a shower of cold fresh air It wasn t easy to be good humored under these circumstances and one could hardly have blamed Katy if she had sometimes forgotten her resolutions and been cross and fretful But she didn t not very often Now and then bad days came when she was discouraged and forlorn 
2230_132101_000005_000002	train-clean-360	But Katy s long year of schooling had taught her self control and as a general thing her discomforts were borne patiently 
2230_132101_000005_000003	train-clean-360	She could not help growing pale and thin however and Papa saw with concern that as the summer went on she became too languid to read or study or sew and just sat hour after hour with folded hands gazing wistfully out of the window 
none	none	He tried the experiment of taking her to drive But the motion of the carriage and the being lifted in and out brought on so much pain that Katy begged that he would not ask her to go again So there was nothing to be done but wait for cooler weather The summer dragged on and all who loved Katy rejoiced when it was over When September came with cool mornings and nights and fresh breezes smelling of pine woods and hill tops all things seemed to revive and Katy with them She began to crochet and to read 
2230_132101_000007_000002	train-clean-360	After a while she collected her books again and tried to study as Cousin Helen had advised 
2230_132101_000007_000003	train-clean-360	But so many idle weeks made it seem harder work than ever 
none	none	One day she asked Papa to let her take French lessons You see I m forgetting all I knew she said and Clover is going to begin this term and I don t like that she should get so far ahead of me Don t you think mister Berger would be willing to come here Papa He does go to houses sometimes I think he would if we asked him said doctor Carr pleased to see Katy waking up with something like life again 
2230_132101_000010_000000	train-clean-360	So the arrangement was made 
none	none	mister Berger came twice every week and sat beside the big chair correcting Katy s exercises and practising her in the verbs and pronunciation He was a lively little old Frenchman and knew how to make lesson time pleasant You take more pain than you used Mademoiselle he said one day if you go on so you shall be my best scholar 
2230_132101_000011_000001	train-clean-360	And if to hurt the back make you study it would be well that some other of my young ladies shall do the same 
none	none	Katy laughed But in spite of mister Berger and his lessons and in spite of her endeavors to keep cheerful and busy this second winter was harder than the first 
2230_132101_000012_000002	train-clean-360	It is often so with sick people 
none	none	There is a sort of excitement in being ill which helps along just at the beginning 
2230_132101_000012_000004	train-clean-360	But as months go on and everything grows an old story and one day follows another day all just alike and all tiresome courage is apt to flag and spirits to grow dull 
none	none	Spring seemed a long long way off whenever Katy thought about it I wish something would happen she often said to herself And something was about to happen But she little guessed what it was going to be Katy said Clover coming in one day in November do you know where the camphor is Aunt Izzie has got such a headache No replied Katy I don t Or wait Clover it seems to me that Debby came for it the other day 
2230_132101_000015_000002	train-clean-360	Perhaps if you look in her room you ll find it 
none	none	How very queer she soliloquized when Clover was gone I never knew Aunt Izzie to have a headache before How is Aunt Izzie she asked when Papa came in at noon Well I don t know 
2230_132101_000018_000001	train-clean-360	She has some fever and a bad pain in her head 
2230_132101_000018_000002	train-clean-360	I have told her that she had better lie still and not try to get up this evening 
none	none	Old Mary will come in to undress you Katy You won t mind will you dear N o said Katy reluctantly But she did mind Aunt Izzie had grown used to her and her ways Nobody else suited her so well It seems so strange to have to explain just how every little thing is to be done she remarked to Clover rather petulantly It seemed stranger yet when the next day and the next and the next after that passed and still no Aunt Izzie came near her 
2230_132101_000021_000001	train-clean-360	Blessings brighten as they take their flight 
none	none	Katy began to appreciate for the first time how much she had learned to rely on her aunt She missed her dreadfully When is Aunt Izzie going to get well she asked her father I want her so much
2230_132101_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 We all want her said doctor Carr who looked disturbed and anxious 
none	none	Is she very sick asked Katy struck by the expression of his face Pretty sick I m afraid he replied I m going to get a regular nurse to take care of her Aunt Izzie s attack proved to be typhoid fever The doctors said that the house must be kept quiet so John and Dorry and Phil were sent over to missus Hall s to stay Elsie and Clover were to have gone too but they begged so hard and made so many promises of good behavior that finally Papa permitted them to remain The dear little things stole about the house on tiptoe as quietly as mice whispering to each other and waiting on Katy who would have been lonely enough without them for everybody else was absorbed in Aunt Izzie It was a confused melancholy time 
2230_132101_000027_000001	train-clean-360	The three girls didn t know much about sickness but Papa s grave face and the hushed house weighed upon their spirits and they missed the children very much 
2230_132101_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh dear sighed Elsie 
none	none	How I wish Aunt Izzie would hurry and get well
2230_132101_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 We ll be real good to her when she does won t we said Clover 
none	none	I never mean to leave my rubbers in the hat stand any more because she don t like to have me 
2230_132101_000029_000002	train-clean-360	And I shall pick up the croquet balls and put them in the box every night 
none	none	Yes added Elsie so will I when she gets well It never occurred to either of them that perhaps Aunt Izzie might not get well 
2230_132101_000031_000001	train-clean-360	Little people are apt to feel as if grown folks are so strong and so big that nothing can possibly happen to them 
none	none	Katy was more anxious Still she did not fairly realize the danger So it came like a sudden and violent shock to her when one morning on waking up she found old Mary crying quietly beside the bed with her apron at her eyes Aunt Izzie had died in the night All their kind penitent thoughts of her their resolutions to please their plans for obeying her wishes and saving her trouble were too late 
2230_132101_000033_000001	train-clean-360	For the first time the three girls sobbing in each other s arms realized what a good friend Aunt Izzie had been to them 
2230_132101_000033_000002	train-clean-360	Her worrying ways were all forgotten now 
none	none	They could only remember the many kind things she had done for them since they were little children 
2230_132101_000033_000004	train-clean-360	How they wished that they had never teased her never said sharp words about her to each other 
2230_132101_000033_000005	train-clean-360	But it was no use to wish 
none	none	What shall we do without Aunt Izzie thought Katy as she cried herself to sleep that night And the question came into her mind again and again after the funeral was over and the little ones had come back from missus Hall s and things began to go on in their usual manner 
2230_132101_000035_000000	train-clean-360	For several days she saw almost nothing of her father 
2230_132101_000035_000001	train-clean-360	Clover reported that he looked very tired and scarcely said a word 
2230_132101_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 Did Papa eat any dinner asked Katy one afternoon 
none	none	Not much He said he wasn t hungry 
2230_132101_000037_000002	train-clean-360	And missus Jackson s boy came for him before we were through 
none	none	Oh dear sighed Katy I do hope he isn t going to be sick How it rains Clovy I wish you d run down and get out his slippers and put them by the fire to warm 
2230_132101_000038_000003	train-clean-360	Oh and ask Debby to make some cream toast for tea 
none	none	Papa likes cream toast After tea doctor Carr came up stairs to sit a while in Katy s room He often did so but this was the first time since Aunt Izzie s death 
2230_132101_000040_000000	train-clean-360	Katy studied his face anxiously 
2230_132101_000040_000001	train-clean-360	It seemed to her that it had grown older of late and there was a sad look upon it which made her heart ache 
none	none	She longed to do something for him but all she could do was to poke the fire bright and then to possess herself of his hand and stroke it gently with both hers 
2230_132101_000040_000003	train-clean-360	It wasn t much to be sure but I think Papa liked it 
none	none	What have you been about all day he asked
2230_132101_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh nothing much said Katy 
2230_132101_000042_000001	train-clean-360	 I studied my French lesson this morning 
2230_132101_000042_000002	train-clean-360	And after school Elsie and John brought in their patchwork and we had a Bee That s all 
none	none	I ve been thinking how we are to manage about the housekeeping said doctor Carr Of course we shall have to get somebody to come and take charge But it isn t easy to find just the right person missus Hall knows of a woman who might do but she is out West just now and it will be a week or two before we can hear from her Do you think you can get on as you are for a few days
2230_132101_000044_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh Papa cried Katy in dismay must we have anybody 
2230_132101_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 Why how did you suppose we were going to arrange it 
none	none	Clover is much too young for a housekeeper 
2230_132101_000045_000002	train-clean-360	And beside she is at school all day 
none	none	I don t know I hadn t thought about it said Katy in a perplexed tone But she did think about it all that evening and the first thing when she woke in the morning Papa she said the next time she got him to herself I ve been thinking over what you were saying last night about getting somebody to keep the house you know And I wish you wouldn t I wish you would let me try Really and truly I think I could manage But how asked doctor Carr much surprised I really don t see If you were well and strong perhaps but even then you would be pretty young for such a charge Katy I shall be fourteen in two weeks said Katy drawing herself up in her chair as straight as she could And if I were well Papa I should be going to school you know and then of course I couldn t 
2230_132101_000050_000002	train-clean-360	No I ll tell you my plan 
2230_132101_000050_000003	train-clean-360	I ve been thinking about it all day 
none	none	Debby and Bridget have been with us so long that they know all Aunt Izzie s ways and they re such good women that all they want is just to be told a little now and then Now why couldn t they come up to me when anything is wanted just as well as to have me go down to them Clover and old Mary will keep watch you know and see if anything is wrong And you wouldn t mind if things were a little crooked just at first would you because you know I should be learning all the time 
2230_132101_000050_000009	train-clean-360	Do let me try 
none	none	It will be real nice to have something to think about as I sit up here alone so much better than having a stranger in the house who doesn t know the children or anything I am sure it will make me happier Please say Yes Papa please do It s too much for you a great deal too much replied doctor Carr But it was not easy to resist Katy s Please Please and after a while it ended with Well darling you may try though I am doubtful as to the result of the experiment I will tell missus Hall to put off writing to Wisconsin for a month and we will see Poor child anything to take her thoughts off herself he muttered as he walked down stairs She ll be glad enough to give the thing up by the end of the month But Papa was mistaken 
2230_132101_000054_000001	train-clean-360	At the end of a month Katy was eager to go on So he said 
none	none	Very well she might try it till Spring It was not such hard work as it sounds 
2230_132101_000056_000001	train-clean-360	Katy had plenty of quiet thinking time for one thing 
none	none	The children were at school all day and few visitors came to interrupt her so she could plan out her hours and keep to the plans That is a great help to a housekeeper Then Aunt Izzie s regular punctual ways were so well understood by the servants that the house seemed almost to keep itself As Katy had said all Debby and Bridget needed was a little telling now and then 
2230_132101_000058_000000	train-clean-360	As soon as breakfast was over and the dishes were washed and put away Debby would tie on a clean apron and come up stairs for orders 
none	none	At first Katy thought this great fun But after ordering dinner a good many times it began to grow tiresome She never saw the dishes after they were cooked and being inexperienced it seemed impossible to think of things enough to make a variety Let me see there is roast beef leg of mutton boiled chicken she would say counting on her fingers roast beef leg of mutton boiled chicken Debby you might roast the chickens Dear I wish somebody would invent a new animal 
2230_132101_000059_000003	train-clean-360	Where all the things to eat are gone to I can t imagine 
none	none	Then Katy would send for every recipe book in the house and pore over them by the hour till her appetite was as completely gone as if she had swallowed twenty dinners 
2230_132101_000066_000000	train-clean-360	Poor Debby 
none	none	learned to dread these books 
2230_132101_000060_000002	train-clean-360	She would stand by the door with her pleasant red face drawn up into a pucker while Katy read aloud some impossible sounding rule 
none	none	This looks as if it were delicious Debby I wish you d try it Take a gallon of oysters a pint of beef stock sixteen soda crackers the juice of two lemons four cloves a glass of white wine a sprig of marjoram a sprig of thyme a sprig of bay a sliced shalott
2230_132101_000062_000000	train-clean-360	 Please Miss Katy what s them 
none	none	Oh don t you know Debby 
2230_132101_000063_000001	train-clean-360	It must be something quite common for it s in almost all the recipes 
2230_132101_000064_000000	train-clean-360	 No Miss Katy I never heard tell of it before 
2230_132101_000064_000001	train-clean-360	Miss Carr never gave me no shell outs at all at all 
none	none	Dear me how provoking Katy would cry flapping over the leaves of her book then we must try something else Poor Debby If she hadn t loved Katy so dearly I think her patience must have given way 
2230_132101_000066_000002	train-clean-360	But she bore her trials meekly except for an occasional grumble when alone with Bridget 
2230_132101_000066_000003	train-clean-360	doctor Carr had to eat a great many queer things in those days 
none	none	But he didn t mind and as for the children they enjoyed it 
2230_132101_000066_000005	train-clean-360	Dinner time became quite exciting when nobody could tell exactly what any dish on the table was made of 
2230_132101_000066_000006	train-clean-360	Dorry who was a sort of doctor Livingstone where strange articles of food were concerned usually made the first experiment and if he said that it was good the rest followed suit 
2230_132101_000067_000000	train-clean-360	After a while Katy grew wiser 
none	none	She ceased teasing Debby to try new things and the Carr family went back to plain roast and boiled much to the advantage of all concerned But then another series of experiments began Katy got hold of a book upon The Stomach and was seized with a rage for wholesome food She entreated Clover and the other children to give up sugar and butter and gravy and pudding sauce and buckwheat cakes and pies and almost everything else that they particularly liked Boiled rice seemed to her the most sensible dessert and she kept the family on it until finally John and Dorry started a rebellion and doctor Carr was forced to interfere
2230_132101_000068_000000	train-clean-360	 My dear you are overdoing it sadly he said as Katy opened her book and prepared to explain her views I am glad to have the children eat simple food but really boiled rice five times in a week is too much 
none	none	Katy sighed but submitted Later as the Spring came on she had a fit of over anxiousness and was always sending Clover down to ask Debby if her bread was not burning or if she was sure that the pickles were not fermenting in their jars 
2230_132101_000069_000002	train-clean-360	She also fidgeted the children about wearing india rubbers and keeping on their coats and behaved altogether as if the cares of the world were on her shoulders 
none	none	But all these were but the natural mistakes of a beginner 
2230_132101_000070_000001	train-clean-360	Katy was too much in earnest not to improve 
2230_132101_000070_000002	train-clean-360	Month by month she learned how to manage a little better and a little better still 
none	none	Matters went on more smoothly 
2230_132101_000070_000004	train-clean-360	Her cares ceased to fret her 
none	none	doctor Carr watching the increasing brightness of her face and manner felt that the experiment was a success Nothing more was said about somebody else and Katy sitting up stairs in her big chair held the threads of the house firmly in her hands CHAPTER XII TWO YEARS AFTERWARD It was a pleasant morning in early June A warm wind was rustling the trees which were covered thickly with half opened leaves and looked like fountains of green spray thrown high into the air 
2606-132102-0001	train-other-500	doctor Carr s front door stood wide open Through the parlor window came the sound of piano practice and on the steps under the budding roses sat a small figure busily sewing This was Clover little Clover still though more than two years had passed since we saw her last
2606-132102-0002	train-other-500	and she was now over fourteen Clover was never intended to be tall Her eyes were as blue and sweet as ever
none	none	 and her apple blossom cheeks as pink 
2606-132102-0003	train-other-500	But the brown pig tails were pinned up into a round knot and the childish face had gained almost a womanly look Old Mary declared that Miss Clover was getting quite young ladyfied and Miss Clover was quite aware of the fact and mightily pleased with it
2606-132102-0004	train-other-500	It delighted her to turn up her hair and she was very particular about having her dresses made to come below the tops of her boots She had also left off ruffles and wore narrow collars instead and little cuffs with sleeve buttons to fasten them
2606-132102-0005	train-other-500	These sleeve buttons which were a present from Cousin Helen Clover liked best of all her things Papa said that he was sure she took them to bed with her but of course that was only a joke though she certainly was never seen without them in the daytime
none	none	 She glanced frequently at these beloved buttons as she sat sewing and every now and then laid down her work to twist them into a better position or give them an affectionate pat with her forefinger Pretty soon the side gate swung open and Philly came round the corner of the house 
2606-132102-0006	train-other-500	He had grown into a big boy All his pretty baby curls were cut off and his frocks had given place to jacket and trousers In his hand he held something What Clover could not see What s that she said as he reached the steps
none	none	 I m going up stairs to ask Katy if these are ripe replied Phil exhibiting some currants faintly streaked with red 
2606-132102-0007	train-other-500	Why of course they re not ripe said Clover putting one into her mouth Can t you tell by the taste They re as green as can be I don t care if Katy says they re ripe I shall eat em
2606-132102-0008	train-other-500	answered Phil defiantly marching into the house What did Philly want asked Elsie opening the parlor door as Phil went up stairs
none	none	 Only to know if the currants are ripe enough to eat 
2606-132102-0009	train-other-500	How particular he always is about asking now said Elsie he s afraid of another dose of salts I should think he would be replied Clover laughing
none	none	 Johnnie says she never was so scared in her life as when Papa called them and they looked up and saw him standing there with the bottle in one hand and a spoon in the other 
2606-132102-0010	train-other-500	Yes went on Elsie and you know Dorry held his in his mouth for ever so long and then went round the corner of the house and spat it out Papa said he had a good mind to make him take another spoonful
2606-132102-0011	train-other-500	but he remembered that after all Dorry had the bad taste a great deal longer than the others so he didn t I think it was an awful punishment don t you Yes but it was a good one
2606-132102-0012	train-other-500	for none of them have ever touched the green gooseberries since Have you got through practising It doesn t seem like an hour yet Oh it isn t it s only twenty five minutes But Katy told me not to sit more than half an hour at a time without getting up and running round to rest
2606-132102-0013	train-other-500	I m going to walk twice down to the gate and twice back I promised her I would And Elsie set off clapping her hands briskly before and behind her as she walked Why what is Bridget doing in Papa s room she asked as she came back the second time
none	none	 She s flapping things out of the window 
2606-132102-0014	train-other-500	Are the girls up there I thought they were cleaning the dining room They re doing both Katy said it was such a good chance having Papa away that she would have both the carpets taken up at once
2606-132102-0015	train-other-500	There isn t going to be any dinner today only just bread and butter and milk and cold ham up in Katy s room because Debby is helping too so as to get through and save Papa all the fuss And see exhibiting her sewing Katy s making a new cover for Papa s pincushion
2606-132102-0016	train-other-500	and I m hemming the ruffle to go round it How nicely you hem said Elsie I wish I had something for Papa s room too There s my washstand mats but the one for the soap dish isn t finished
2606-132102-0017	train-other-500	Do you suppose if Katy would excuse me from the rest of my practising I could get it done I ve a great mind to go and ask her There s her bell said Clover as a little tinkle sounded up stairs I ll ask her if you like No let me go
2606-132102-0018	train-other-500	I ll see what she wants But Clover was already half way across the hall and the two girls ran up side by side There was often a little strife between them as to which should answer Katy s bell Both liked to wait on her so much Katy came to meet them as they entered
2606-132102-0019	train-other-500	Not on her feet that alas was still only a far off possibility but in a chair with large wheels with which she was rolling herself across the room This chair was a great comfort to her Sitting in it she could get to her closet and her bureau drawers
2606-132102-0020	train-other-500	and help herself to what she wanted without troubling anybody It was only lately that she had been able to use it doctor Carr considered her doing so as a hopeful sign but he had never told Katy this She had grown accustomed to her invalid life at last
none	none	 and was cheerful in it and he thought it unwise to make her restless by exciting hopes 
2606-132102-0021	train-other-500	which might after all end in fresh disappointment She met the girls with a bright smile as they came in and said Oh Clovy it was you I rang for
none	none	 I am troubled for fear Bridget will meddle with the things on Papa s table 
2606-132102-0022	train-other-500	You know he likes them to be left just so Will you please go and remind her that she is not to touch them at all After the carpet is put down I want you to dust the table so as to be sure that everything is put back in the same place Will you
2606-132102-0023	train-other-500	Of course I will said Clover who was a born housewife and dearly loved to act as Katy s prime minister Sha n t I fetch you the pincushion too while I m there Oh yes please do I want to measure
2606-132102-0024	train-other-500	Katy said Elsie those mats of mine are most done and
none	none	 I would like to finish them and put them on Papa s washstand before he comes back 
2606-132102-0025	train-other-500	Mayn t I stop practising now and bring my crochet up here instead Will there be plenty of time to learn the new exercise before Miss Phillips comes if you do I think so plenty She doesn t come till Friday you know
none	none	 Well then it seems to me that you might just as well as not 
2606-132102-0026	train-other-500	And Elsie dear run into papa s room first and bring me the drawer out of his table I want to put that in order myself Elsie went cheerfully She laid the drawer across Katy s lap and Katy began to dust and arrange the contents Pretty soon Clover joined them
none	none	 Here s the cushion she said Now we ll have a nice quiet time all by ourselves won t we 
2606-132102-0027	train-other-500	I like this sort of day when nobody comes in to interrupt us Somebody tapped at the door as she spoke Katy called out Come
none	none	 And in marched a tall broad shouldered lad with a solemn sensible face and a little clock carried carefully in both his hands This was Dorry He has grown and improved very much since we saw him last 
2606-132102-0028	train-other-500	and is turning out clever in several ways Among the rest he has developed a strong turn for mechanics Here s your clock Katy he said I ve got it fixed so that it strikes all right
2606-132102-0029	train-other-500	Only you must be careful not to hit the striker when you start the pendulum Have you really said Katy Why Dorry you re a genius I m ever so much obliged
none	none	 It s four minutes to eleven now 
2606-132102-0030	train-other-500	went on Dorry So it ll strike pretty soon I guess I d better stay and hear it so as to be sure that it is right That is he added politely
none	none	 unless you re busy and would rather not I m never too busy to want you old fellow 
2606-132102-0031	train-other-500	said Katy stroking his arm Here this drawer is arranged now Don t you want to carry it into Papa s room and put it back into the table Your hands are stronger than Elsie s Dorry looked gratified
2606-132102-0032	train-other-500	When he came back the clock was just beginning to strike There he exclaimed that s splendid isn t it But alas the clock did not stop at eleven It went on Twelve Thirteen
2606-132102-0033	train-other-500	Fourteen Fifteen Sixteen Dear me said Clover what does all this mean
none	none	 It must be day after to morrow at least 
2606-132102-0034	train-other-500	Dorry stared with open mouth at the clock
none	none	 which was still striking as though it would split its sides 
2606-132102-0035	train-other-500	Elsie screaming with laughter kept count Thirty Thirty one
none	none	 Oh Dorry Thirty two Thirty three Thirty four 
2606-132102-0036	train-other-500	You ve bewitched it Dorry said Katy as much entertained as the rest Then they all began counting Dorry seized the clock shook it slapped it turned it upside down
none	none	 But still the sharp vibrating sounds continued as if the clock having got its own way for once meant to go on 
2606-132102-0037	train-other-500	till it was tired out At last at the one hundred and thirtieth stroke it suddenly ceased and Dorry
none	none	 with a red amazed countenance faced the laughing company 
2606-132102-0038	train-other-500	It s very queer he said
none	none	 but I m sure it s not because of anything I did 
2606-132102-0039	train-other-500	I can fix it though if you ll let me try again May I Katy I ll promise not to hurt it For a moment Katy hesitated Clover pulled her sleeve and whispered Don t
2606-132102-0040	train-other-500	Then seeing the mortification on Dorry s face she made up her mind Yes take it Dorry I m sure you ll be careful
none	none	 But if I were you I d carry it down to Wetherell s first of all 
2606-132102-0041	train-other-500	and talk it over with them Together you could hit on just the right thing
none	none	 Don t you think so 
2606-132102-0042	train-other-500	Perhaps said Dorry
none	none	 yes I think I will 
2606-132102-0043	train-other-500	Then he departed with the clock under his arm while Clover called after him teasingly Lunch at one hundred thirty two o clock don t forget No I won t said Dorry
none	none	 Two years before he would not have borne to be laughed at so good naturedly 
2606-132102-0044	train-other-500	How could you let him take your clock again said Clover as soon as the door was shut
none	none	 He ll spoil it 
2606-132102-0045	train-other-500	And you think so much of it I thought he would feel mortified if I didn t let him try replied Katy quietly I don t believe he ll hurt it Wetherell s man likes Dorry and he ll show him what to do
2606-132102-0046	train-other-500	You were real good to do it responded Clover but if it had been mine I don t think I could Just then the door flew open and Johnnie rushed in
none	none	 two years taller but otherwise looking exactly as she used to do Oh Katy 
2606-132102-0047	train-other-500	she gasped won t you please tell Philly not to wash the chickens in the rain water tub He s put in every one of Speckle s and is just beginning on Dame Durden s I m afraid one little yellow one is dead already
none	none	 Why he mustn t of course he mustn t said Katy 
2606-132102-0048	train-other-500	what made him think of such a thing He says they re dirty because they ve just come out of egg shells And he insists that the yellow on them is yolk of egg I told him it wasn t but he wouldn t listen to me And Johnnie wrung her hands
none	none	 Clover 
2606-132102-0049	train-other-500	cried Katy won t you run down and ask Philly to come up to me Speak pleasantly you know I spoke pleasantly
none	none	 real pleasantly 
2606-132102-0050	train-other-500	but it wasn t any use said Johnnie on whom the wrongs of the chicks had evidently made a deep impression What a mischief Phil is getting to be
none	none	 said Elsie 
2606-132102-0051	train-other-500	Papa says his name ought to be Pickle
none	none	 Pickles turn out very nice sometimes you know 
2606-132102-0052	train-other-500	replied Katy laughing Pretty soon Philly came up escorted by Clover He looked a little defiant but Katy understood how to manage him She lifted him into her lap which big boy as he was he liked extremely
2606-132102-0053	train-other-500	and talked to him so affectionately about the poor little shivering chicks that his heart was quite melted
none	none	 I didn t mean to hurt em really and truly 
2606-132102-0054	train-other-500	he said but they were all dirty and yellow with egg you know and I thought you d like me to clean em up But that wasn t egg Philly it was dear little clean feathers like a canary bird s wings Was it
2606-132102-0055	train-other-500	Yes And now the chickies are as cold and forlorn as you would feel if you tumbled into a pond and nobody gave you any dry clothes Don t you think you ought to go and warm them How
none	none	 Well 
2606-132102-0056	train-other-500	in your hands very gently And then I would let them run round in the sun
none	none	 I will said Philly getting down from her lap 
2606-132102-0057	train-other-500	Only kiss me first because I didn t mean to you know Philly was very fond of Katy Miss Petingill said it was wonderful to see how that child let himself be managed But I think the secret was that Katy didn t manage
none	none	 but tried to be always kind and loving and considerate of Phil s feelings 
2606-132102-0058	train-other-500	Before the echo of Phil s boots had fairly died away on the stairs old Mary put her head into the door There was a distressed expression on her face Miss Katy she said
2606-132102-0059	train-other-500	I wish you d speak to Alexander about putting the woodshed in order I don t think you know how bad it looks I don t suppose I do said Katy smiling and then sighing
2606-132102-0060	train-other-500	She had never seen the wood shed since the day of her fall from the swing Never mind Mary I ll talk to Alexander about it and he shall make it all nice Mary trotted down stairs satisfied
2606-132102-0061	train-other-500	But in the course of a few minutes she was up again
none	none	 There s a man come with a box of soap 
2606-132102-0062	train-other-500	Miss Katy and here s the bill He says it s resated
none	none	 It took Katy a little time to find her purse and then she wanted her pencil and account book 
2606-132102-0063	train-other-500	and Elsie had to move from her seat at the table Oh dear she said
none	none	 I wish people wouldn t keep coming and interrupting us Who ll be the next I wonder 
2606-132102-0064	train-other-500	She was not left to wonder long Almost as she spoke there was another knock at the door
none	none	 Come in 
2606-132102-0065	train-other-500	said Katy rather wearily The door opened Shall I said a voice
none	none	 There was a rustle of skirts a clatter of boot heels and Imogen Clark swept into the room 
2606-132102-0066	train-other-500	Katy could not think who it was at first
none	none	 She had not seen Imogen for almost two years 
2606-132102-0067	train-other-500	I found the front door open
none	none	 explained Imogen in her high pitched voice 
2606-132102-0068	train-other-500	and as nobody seemed to hear when I rang the bell I ventured to come right up stairs I hope I m not interrupting anything private Not at all said Katy politely Elsie dear move up that low chair please
2606-132102-0069	train-other-500	Do sit down Imogen I m sorry nobody answered your ring but the servants are cleaning house to day and I suppose they didn t hear So Imogen sat down and began to rattle on in her usual manner
2606-132102-0070	train-other-500	while Elsie from behind Katy s chair took a wide awake survey of her dress
none	none	 It was of cheap material but very gorgeously made and trimmed with flounces and puffs and Imogen wore a jet necklace and long black ear rings which jingled and clicked 
2606-132102-0071	train-other-500	when she waved her head about She still had the little round curls stuck on to her cheeks and Elsie wondered anew what kept them in their places
none	none	 By and by the object of Imogen s visit came out She had called to say good by 
2606-132102-0072	train-other-500	The Clark family were all going back to Jacksonville to live Did you ever see the Brigand again asked Clover who had never forgotten that eventful tale told in the parlor Yes replied Imogen
2606-132102-0073	train-other-500	several times And I get letters from him quite often
none	none	 He writes beau tiful letters I wish I had one with me so that I could read you a little bit 
2606-132102-0074	train-other-500	You would enjoy it I know Let me see perhaps I have And she put her hand into her pocket Sure enough there was a letter
none	none	 Clover couldn t help suspecting that Imogen knew it all the time The Brigand seemed to write a bold black hand and his note paper and envelope was just like anybody else s But perhaps his band had surprised a pedlar with a box of stationery Let me see said Imogen running her eye down the page Adored Imogen that wouldn t interest you 
2606-132102-0075	train-other-500	hm hm
none	none	 hm ah here s something 
2606-132102-0076	train-other-500	I took dinner at the Rock House on Christmas It was lonesome without you I had roast turkey roast goose roast beef mince pie plum pudding and nuts and raisins A pretty good dinner was it not
2606-132102-0077	train-other-500	But nothing tastes first rate when friends are away Katy and Clover stared as well they might Such language from a Brigand John Billings has bought a new horse
2606-132102-0078	train-other-500	continued Imogen hm hm hm him I don t think there is anything else you d care about Oh yes just here at the end is some poetry Come little dove with azure wing
2606-132102-0079	train-other-500	And brood upon my breast That s sweet ain t it Hasn t he reformed said Clover he writes as if he had Reformed
none	none	 cried Imogen with a toss of the jingling ear rings 
2606-132102-0080	train-other-500	He was always just as good as he could be There was nothing to be said in reply to this
none	none	 Katy felt her lips twitch and for fear she should be rude and laugh out she began to talk as fast as she could 
2606-132102-0081	train-other-500	about something else All the time she found herself taking measure of Imogen and thinking Did I ever really like her How queer
none	none	 Oh what a wise man Papa is Imogen stayed half an hour 
2606-132102-0082	train-other-500	Then she took her leave She never asked how you were cried Elsie indignantly
none	none	 I noticed and she didn t not once Oh well I suppose she forgot We were talking about her not about me replied Katy The little group settled down again to their work This time half an hour went by without any more interruptions 
2606-132102-0083	train-other-500	Then the door bell rang and Bridget with a disturbed face came up stairs Miss Katy she said
none	none	 it s old missus Worrett 
2606-132102-0084	train-other-500	and I reckon s she s come to spend the day for she s brought her bag What ever shall I tell her Katy looked dismayed Oh dear she said how unlucky
2606-132102-0085	train-other-500	What can we do missus Worrett was an old friend of Aunt Izzie s who lived in the country about six miles from Burnet and was in the habit of coming to doctor Carr s for lunch on days when shopping or other business brought her into town
2606-132102-0086	train-other-500	This did not occur often and as it happened Katy had never had to entertain her before Tell her ye re busy and can t see her suggested Bridget there s no dinner nor nothing you know
2606-132102-0087	train-other-500	The Katy of two years ago would probably have jumped at this idea But the Katy of to day was more considerate
none	none	 N o she said 
2606-132102-0088	train-other-500	I don t like to do that We must just make the best of it Bridget Run down Clover dear that s a good girl
none	none	 and tell missus Worrett that the dining room is all in confusion but that we re going to have lunch here and after she s rested I should be glad to have her come up And oh Clovy give her a fan the first thing She ll be so hot 
2606-132102-0089	train-other-500	Bridget you can bring up the luncheon just the same only take out some canned peaches by way of a dessert and make missus Worrett a cup of tea She drinks tea always I believe I can t bear to send the poor old lady away when she has come so far
2606-132102-0090	train-other-500	she explained to Elsie after the others were gone Pull the rocking chair a little this way Elsie And oh push all those little chairs back against the wall missus Worrett broke down in one the last time she was here don t you recollect
2606-132102-0091	train-other-500	It took some time to cool missus Worrett off so nearly twenty minutes passed before a heavy creaking step on the stairs announced that the guest was on her way up Elsie began to giggle missus Worrett always made her giggle
2606-132102-0092	train-other-500	Katy had just time to give her a warning glance before the door opened missus Worrett was the most enormously fat person ever seen Nobody dared to guess how much she weighed but she looked as if it might be a thousand pounds
2606-132102-0093	train-other-500	Her face was extremely red In the coldest weather she appeared hot
none	none	 and on a mild day she seemed absolutely ready to melt 
2606-132102-0094	train-other-500	Her bonnet strings were flying loose as she came in and she fanned herself all the way across the room which shook as she walked
none	none	 Well my dear 
2606-132102-0095	train-other-500	she said as she plumped herself into the rocking chair and how do you do Very well thank you replied Katy thinking that she never saw missus Worrett look half so fat before
none	none	 and wondering how she was to entertain her 
2606-132102-0096	train-other-500	And how s your Pa inquired missus Worrett Katy answered politely and then asked after missus Worrett s own health Well I m so s to be round was the reply
none	none	 which had the effect of sending Elsie off into a fit of convulsive laughter behind Katy s chair 
2606-132102-0097	train-other-500	I had business at the bank continued the visitor and I thought while I was about it I d step up to Miss Petingill s and see if I couldn t get her to come and let out my black silk It was made quite a piece back
2606-132102-0098	train-other-500	and I seem to have fleshed up since then for I can t make the hooks and eyes meet at all But when I got there she was out so I d my walk for nothing Do you know where she s sewing now
2606-132102-0099	train-other-500	No said Katy feeling her chair shake and keeping her own countenance with difficulty she was here for three days last week to make Johnnie a school dress
2606-132102-0100	train-other-500	But I haven t heard anything about her since Elsie
none	none	 don t you want to run down stairs and ask Bridget to bring a 
2606-132102-0101	train-other-500	a a glass of iced water for missus Worrett She looks warm after her walk Elsie dreadfully ashamed made a bolt from the room and hid herself in the hall closet to have her laugh out
2606-132102-0102	train-other-500	She came back after a while with a perfectly straight face Luncheon was brought up missus Worrett made a good meal and seemed to enjoy everything
none	none	 She was so comfortable that she never stirred till four o clock 
2606-132102-0103	train-other-500	Oh how long that afternoon did seem to the poor girls sitting there and trying to think of something to say to their vast visitor At last missus Worrett got out of her chair and prepared to depart Well she said tying her bonnet strings
2606-132102-0104	train-other-500	I ve had a good rest and feel all the better for it
none	none	 Ain t some of you young folks coming out to see me one of these days 
2606-132102-0105	train-other-500	I d like to have you first rate if you will Tain t every girl would know how to take care of a fat old woman and make her feel to home as you have me Katy I wish your aunt could see you all as you are now
2606-132102-0106	train-other-500	She d be right pleased I know that Somehow this sentence rang pleasantly in Katy s ears Ah don t laugh at her she said later in the evening when the children after their tea in the clean fresh smelling dining room were come up to sit with her
2606-132102-0107	train-other-500	and Cecy in her pretty pink lawn and white shawl had dropped in to spend an hour or two she s a real kind old woman and I don t like to have you It isn t her fault that she s fat And Aunt Izzie was fond of her you know
2606-132102-0108	train-other-500	It is doing something for her when we can show a little attention to one of her friends I was sorry when she came but now it s over I m glad It feels so nice when it stops aching quoted Elsie mischievously
none	none	 while Cecy whispered to Clover 
2606-132102-0109	train-other-500	Isn t Katy sweet Isn t she replied Clover
none	none	 I wish I was half so good Sometimes I think I shall really be sorry if she ever gets well She s such a dear old darling to us all sitting there in her chair that it wouldn t seem so nice to have her anywhere else But then I know it s horrid in me And I don t believe she d be different or grow slam bang and horrid like some of the girls even if she were well Of course she wouldn t replied Cecy CHAPTER XIII 
1373-132103-0000	train-other-500	AT LAST It was about six weeks after this that one day Clover and Elsie were busy down stairs they were startled by the sound of Katy s bell ringing in a sudden and agitated manner Both ran up two steps at a time to see what was wanted
1373-132103-0001	train-other-500	Katy sat in her chair looking very much flushed and excited Oh girls she exclaimed what do you think
none	none	 I stood up What cried Clover and Elsie I really did I stood up on my feet by myself The others were too much astonished to speak 
1373-132103-0002	train-other-500	so Katy went on explaining It was all at once you see Suddenly I had the feeling that if I tried I could and almost before I thought I did try and there I was up and out of the chair
none	none	 Only I kept hold of the arm all the time I don t know how I got back I was so frightened 
1373-132103-0003	train-other-500	Oh girls and Katy buried her face in her hands Do you think I shall ever be able to do it again she asked looking up with wet eyes
none	none	 Why of course you will said Clover 
1373-132103-0004	train-other-500	while Elsie danced about crying out anxiously Be careful Do be careful Katy tried but the spring was gone She could not move out of the chair at all She began to wonder if she had dreamed the whole thing But next day
1373-132103-0005	train-other-500	when Clover happened to be in the room she heard a sudden exclamation and turning there stood Katy
none	none	 absolutely on her feet Papa papa shrieked Clover rushing down stairs Dorry John Elsie come Come and see Papa was out 
1373-132103-0006	train-other-500	but all the rest crowded up at once This time Katy found no trouble in doing it again It seemed as if her will had been asleep and now that it had waked up the limbs recognized its orders and obeyed them
1373-132103-0007	train-other-500	When Papa came in he was as much excited as any of the children He walked round and round the chair questioning Katy and making her stand up and sit down Am I really going to get well she asked almost in a whisper
1373-132103-0008	train-other-500	Yes my love I think you are replied doctor Carr seizing Phil and giving him a toss into the air None of the children had ever before seen Papa behave so like a boy But pretty soon
1373-132103-0009	train-other-500	noticing Katy s burning cheeks and excited eyes he calmed himself sent the others all away and sat down to soothe and quiet her with gentle words
none	none	 I think it is coming my darling he said but it will take time and you must have a great deal of patience After being such a good child all the years I am sure you won t fail now 
1373-132103-0010	train-other-500	Remember any imprudence will put you back You must be content to gain a very little at a time There is no royal road to walking any more than there is to learning Every baby finds that out Oh Papa said Katy
none	none	 it s no matter if it takes a year if only I get well at last 
1373-132103-0011	train-other-500	How happy she was that night too happy to sleep
none	none	 Papa noticed the dark circles under her eyes in the morning and shook his head You must be careful he told her or you ll be laid up again A course of fever would put you back for years 
1373-132103-0012	train-other-500	Katy knew Papa was right and she was careful though it was by no means easy to be so with that new life tingling in every limb Her progress was slow as doctor Carr had predicted
1373-132103-0013	train-other-500	At first she only stood on her feet a few seconds then a minute then five minutes holding tightly all the while by the chair Next she ventured to let go the chair and stand alone After that she began to walk a step at a time
1373-132103-0014	train-other-500	pushing a chair before her as children do when they are learning the use of their feet Clover and Elsie hovered about her as she moved like anxious mammas It was droll and a little pitiful to see tall Katy with her feeble unsteady progress
1373-132103-0015	train-other-500	and the active figures of the little sisters following her protectingly But Katy did not consider it either droll or pitiful to her it was simply delightful the most delightful thing possible
1373-132103-0016	train-other-500	No baby of a year old was ever prouder of his first steps than she Gradually she grew adventurous and ventured on a bolder flight Clover running up stairs one day to her own room stood transfixed at the sight of Katy sitting there flushed panting
1373-132103-0017	train-other-500	but enjoying the surprise she caused You see she explained in an apologizing tone I was seized with a desire to explore It is such a time since I saw any room but my own But oh dear how long that hall is
none	none	 I had forgotten it could be so long 
1373-132103-0018	train-other-500	I shall have to take a good rest before I go back Katy did take a good rest but she was very tired next day The experiment however did no harm In the course of two or three weeks she was able to walk all over the second story
1373-132103-0019	train-other-500	This was a great enjoyment It was like reading an interesting book to see all the new things and the little changes She was forever wondering over something Why Dorry she would say what a pretty book shelf When did you get it
none	none	 That old thing Why I ve 
1373-132103-0020	train-other-500	had it two years Didn t I ever tell you about it Perhaps you did Katy would reply but you see I never saw it before so it made no impression By the end of August she was grown so strong that she began to talk about going down stairs
1373-132103-0021	train-other-500	But Papa said Wait It will tire you much more than walking about on a level he explained you had better put it off a little while till you are quite sure of your feet I think so too said Clover and beside
none	none	 I want to have the house all put in order and made nice before your sharp eyes see it 
1373-132103-0022	train-other-500	missus Housekeeper Oh I ll tell you Such a beautiful idea has come into my head You shall fix a day to come down Katy and we ll be all ready for you and have a celebration among ourselves That would be just lovely How soon may she Papa
none	none	 Well in 
1373-132103-0023	train-other-500	ten days I should say it might be safe Ten days
none	none	 that will bring it to the seventh of September won t it said Katy 
1373-132103-0024	train-other-500	Then Papa if I may I ll come down stairs the first time on the eighth It was Mamma s birthday you know she added in a lower voice So it was settled How delicious cried Clover
1373-132103-0025	train-other-500	skipping about and clapping her hands I never never never did hear of anything so perfectly lovely Papa when are you coming down stairs
none	none	 I want to speak to you dreadfully 
1373-132103-0026	train-other-500	Right away rather than have my coat tails pulled off answered doctor Carr laughing and they went away together Katy sat looking out of the window in a peaceful happy mood Oh she thought can it really be
1373-132103-0027	train-other-500	Is School going to let out just as Cousin Helen s hymn said Am I going to Bid a sweet good bye to Pain But there was Love in the Pain I see it now How good the dear Teacher has been to me
1373-132103-0028	train-other-500	Clover seemed to be very busy all the rest of that week She was having windows washed she said
none	none	 but this explanation hardly accounted for her long absences and the mysterious exultation on her face 
1373-132103-0029	train-other-500	not to mention certain sounds of hammering and sawing which came from down stairs The other children had evidently been warned to say nothing for once or twice Philly broke out with Oh Katy and then hushed himself up saying I most forgot
1373-132103-0030	train-other-500	Katy grew very curious But she saw that the secret whatever it was gave immense satisfaction to everybody except herself so though she longed to know she concluded not to spoil the fun by asking any questions
1373-132103-0031	train-other-500	At last it wanted but one day of the important occasion See said Katy as Clover came into the room a little before tea time Miss Petingill has brought home my new dress
none	none	 I m going to wear it for the first time to go down stairs in How pretty said Clover examining the dress 
1373-132103-0032	train-other-500	which was a soft dove colored cashmere trimmed with ribbon of the same shade But Katy I came up to shut your door Bridget s going to sweep the hall and I don t want the dust to fly in
none	none	 because your room was brushed this morning you know What a queer time to sweep a hall said Katy wonderingly 
1373-132103-0033	train-other-500	Why don t you make her wait till morning Oh she can t There are she has I mean there will be other things for her to do to morrow It s a great deal more convenient that she should do it now Don t worry Katy darling but just keep your door shut
1373-132103-0034	train-other-500	You will won t you Promise me Very well said Katy more and more amazed but yielding to Clover s eagerness I ll keep it shut Her curiosity was excited She took a book and tried to read
1373-132103-0035	train-other-500	but the letters danced up and down before her eyes and she couldn t help listening Bridget was making a most ostentatious noise with her broom but through it all Katy seemed to hear other sounds feet on the stairs doors opening and shutting
1373-132103-0036	train-other-500	once a stifled giggle How queer it all was Never mind she said resolutely stopping her ears I shall know all about it to morrow To morrow dawned fresh and fair the very ideal of a September day
none	none	 Katy said Clover as she came in from the garden with her hands full of flowers 
1373-132103-0037	train-other-500	that dress of yours is sweet You never looked so nice before in your life And she stuck a beautiful carnation pink under Katy s breast pin and fastened another in her hair There she said now you re adorned
none	none	 Papa is coming up in a few minutes to take you down 
1373-132103-0038	train-other-500	Just then Elsie and Johnnie came in They had on their best frocks
none	none	 So had Clover It was evidently a festival day to all the house 
1373-132103-0039	train-other-500	Cecy followed invited over for the special purpose of seeing Katy walk down stairs She too had on a new frock How fine we are said Clover as she remarked this magnificence Turn round Cecy
1373-132103-0040	train-other-500	a panier I do declare and a sash You are getting awfully grown up Miss Hall None of us will ever be so grown up as Katy said Cecy laughing And now Papa appeared Very slowly they all went down stairs
1373-132103-0041	train-other-500	Katy leaning on Papa with Dorry on her other side and the girls behind while Philly clattered ahead And there were Debby and Bridget and Alexander
none	none	 peeping out of the kitchen door to watch her 
1373-132103-0042	train-other-500	and dear old Mary with her apron at her eyes crying for joy Oh the front door is open said Katy in a delighted tone How nice And what a pretty oil cloth That s new since I was here
1373-132103-0043	train-other-500	Don t stop to look at that cried Philly who seemed in a great hurry about something It isn t new It s been there ever and ever so long Come into the parlor instead Yes said Papa dinner isn t quite ready yet
none	none	 you ll have time to rest a little after your walk down stairs 
1373-132103-0044	train-other-500	You have borne it admirably Katy
none	none	 Are you very tired Not a 
1373-132103-0045	train-other-500	bit replied Katy cheerfully I could do it alone I think Oh the bookcase door has been mended How nice it looks Don t wait oh don t wait repeated Phil in an agony of impatience
1373-132103-0046	train-other-500	So they moved on Papa opened the parlor door Katy took one step into the room then stopped
none	none	 The color flashed over her face 
1373-132103-0047	train-other-500	and she held by the door knob to support herself What was it that she saw Not merely the room itself with its fresh muslin curtains and vases of flowers Nor even the wide beautiful window which had been cut toward the sun
1373-132103-0048	train-other-500	or the inviting little couch and table which stood there evidently for her No there was something else The sofa was pulled out and there upon it supported by pillows her bright eyes turned to the door lay Cousin Helen
1373-132103-0049	train-other-500	When she saw Katy she held out her arms Clover and Cecy agreed afterward that they never were so frightened in their lives as at this moment for Katy forgetting her weakness let go of Papa s arm and absolutely ran toward the sofa Oh Cousin Helen
1373-132103-0050	train-other-500	dear dear Cousin Helen she cried Then she tumbled down by the sofa somehow the two pairs of arms and the two faces met and for a moment or two not a word more was heard from anybody
none	none	 Isn t a nice prise shouted Philly turning a somerset by way of relieving his feelings 
1373-132103-0051	train-other-500	while John and Dorry executed a sort of war dance round the sofa Phil s voice seemed to break the spell of silence and a perfect hubbub of questions and exclamations began It appeared that this happy thought of getting Cousin Helen to the Celebration was Clover s
1373-132103-0052	train-other-500	She it was who had proposed it to Papa and made all the arrangements And artful puss she had set Bridget to sweep the hall on purpose that Katy might not hear the noise of the arrival
none	none	 Cousin Helen s going to stay three weeks this time 
1373-132103-0053	train-other-500	isn t that nice asked Elsie while Clover anxiously questioned Are you sure that you didn t suspect Not one bit Not the least tiny weeny mite No indeed not the least How could I suspect anything so perfectly delightful
1373-132103-0054	train-other-500	And Katy gave Cousin Helen another rapturous kiss Such a short day as that seemed There was so much to see to ask about to talk over that the hours flew and evening dropped upon them all like another great surprise
1373-132103-0055	train-other-500	Cousin Helen was perhaps the happiest of the party Beside the pleasure of knowing Katy to be almost well again she had the additional enjoyment of seeing for herself how many changes for the better had taken place during the four years among the little cousins she loved so much
1373-132103-0056	train-other-500	It was very interesting to watch them all Elsie and Dorry seemed to her the most improved of the family Elsie had quite lost her plaintive look and little injured tone and was as bright and beaming a maiden of twelve as any one could wish to see
none	none	 Dorry s moody face had grown open and sensible and his manners were good humored and obliging 
1373-132103-0057	train-other-500	He was still a sober boy and not specially quick in catching an idea but he promised to turn out a valuable man And to him as to all the other children Katy was evidently the centre and the sun
none	none	 They all revolved about her and trusted her for everything 
1373-132103-0058	train-other-500	Cousin Helen looked on as Phil came in crying after a hard tumble and was consoled as Johnnie whispered an important secret and Elsie begged for help in her work She saw Katy meet them all pleasantly and sweetly without a bit of the dictatorial elder sister in her manner
1373-132103-0059	train-other-500	and with none of her old impetuous tone And best of all she saw the change in Katy s own face the gentle expression of her eyes the womanly look the pleasant voice the politeness
1373-132103-0060	train-other-500	the tact in advising the others without seeming to advise Dear Katy she said a day or two after her arrival
none	none	 this visit is a great pleasure to me you can t think how great It is such a contrast to the last I made 
1373-132103-0061	train-other-500	when you were so sick and everybody so sad Do you remember Indeed I do And how good you were and how you helped me I shall never forget that I m glad But what I could do was very little
1373-132103-0062	train-other-500	You have been learning by yourself all this time And Katy darling I want to tell you how pleased I am to see how bravely you have worked your way up I can perceive it in everything
1373-132103-0063	train-other-500	in Papa in the children in yourself You have won the place which you recollect I once told you an invalid should try to gain of being to everybody The Heart of the House Oh Cousin Helen don t
1373-132103-0064	train-other-500	said Katy her eyes filling with sudden tears I haven t been brave You can t think how badly I sometimes have behaved how cross and ungrateful I am and how stupid and slow Every day I see things which ought to be done
1373-132103-0065	train-other-500	and I don t do them It s too delightful to have you praise me but you mustn t I don t deserve it But although she said she didn t deserve it
