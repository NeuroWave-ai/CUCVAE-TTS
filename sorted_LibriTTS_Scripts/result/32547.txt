Fourth Avenue thirtieth Street New York London Bombay and Calcutta nineteen twelve Copyright nineteen twelve by Henry James junior All Rights Reserved EDITOR S PREFACE The present volume is an attempt to carry out a plan which William James is known to have formed several years before his death In nineteen oh seven he collected reprints in an envelope which he inscribed with the title Essays in Radical Empiricism and he also had duplicate sets of these reprints bound under the same title and deposited for the use of students in the general Harvard Library and in the Philosophical Library in Emerson Hall Two years later Professor James published The Meaning of Truth and A Pluralistic Universe and inserted in these volumes several of the articles which he had intended to use in the Essays in Radical Empiricism Whether he would nevertheless have carried out his original plan had he lived cannot be certainly known Several facts however stand out very clearly In the first place the articles included in the original plan but omitted from his later volumes are indispensable to the understanding of his other writings To these articles he repeatedly alludes Thus in The Meaning of Truth p one hundred twenty seven he says This statement is probably excessively obscure to any one who has not read my two articles Does Consciousness Exist and A World of Pure Experience Other allusions have been indicated in the present text In the second place the articles originally brought together as Essays in Radical Empiricism form a connected whole Not only were most of them written consecutively within a period of two years but they contain numerous cross references In the third place Professor James regarded radical empiricism as an independent doctrine This he asserted expressly Let me say that there is no logical connexion between pragmatism as I understand it and a doctrine which I have recently set forth as radical empiricism The latter stands on its own feet One may entirely reject it and still be a pragmatist Pragmatism nineteen oh seven Preface p ix Finally Professor James came toward the end of his life to regard radical empiricism as more fundamental and more important than pragmatism In the Preface to The Meaning of Truth nineteen oh nine the author gives the following explanation of his desire to continue and if possible conclude the controversy over pragmatism I am interested in another doctrine in philosophy to which I give the name of radical empiricism and it seems to me that the establishment of the pragmatist theory of truth is a step of first rate importance in making radical empiricism prevail p xii In preparing the present volume the editor has therefore been governed by two motives On the one hand he has sought to preserve and make accessible certain important articles not to be found in Professor James s other books This is true of Essays I II IV V VIII IX X XI and XII On the other hand he has sought to bring together in one volume a set of essays treating systematically of one independent coherent and fundamental doctrine To this end it has seemed best to include three essays III VI and VII which although included in the original plan were afterwards reprinted elsewhere and one essay XII not included in the original plan Essays III VI and VII are indispensable to the consecutiveness of the series and are so interwoven with the rest that it is necessary that the student should have them at hand for ready consultation Essay XII throws an important light on the author s general empiricism and forms an important link between radical empiricism and the author s other doctrines In short the present volume is designed not as a collection but rather as a treatise It is intended that another volume shall be issued which shall contain papers having biographical or historical importance which have not yet been reprinted in book form The present volume is intended not only for students of Professor James s philosophy but for students of metaphysics and the theory of knowledge It sets forth systematically and within brief compass the doctrine of radical empiricism A word more may be in order concerning the general meaning of this doctrine In the Preface to the Will to Believe eighteen ninety eight Professor James gives the name radical empiricism to his philosophic attitude and adds the following explanation I say empiricism because it is contented to regard its most assured conclusions concerning matters of fact as hypotheses liable to modification in the course of future experience and I say radical because it treats the doctrine of monism itself as an hypothesis and unlike so much of the halfway empiricism that is current under the name of positivism or agnosticism or scientific naturalism it does not dogmatically affirm monism as something with which all experience has got to square pp vii viii An empiricism of this description is a philosophic attitude or temper of mind rather than a doctrine and characterizes all of Professor James s writings It is set forth in Essay XII of the present volume In a narrower sense empiricism is the method of resorting to particular experiences for the solution of philosophical problems Rationalists are the men of principles empiricists the men of facts Some Problems of Philosophy p thirty five cf also ibid p forty four and Pragmatism pp nine fifty one Or since principles are universals and facts are particulars perhaps the best way of characterizing the two tendencies is to say that rationalist thinking proceeds most willingly by going from wholes to parts while empiricist thinking proceeds by going from parts to wholes Some Problems of Philosophy p thirty five cf also ibid p ninety eight and A Pluralistic Universe p seven Again empiricism remands us to sensation Op cit p two hundred sixty four The empiricist view insists that as reality is created temporally day by day concepts can never fitly supersede perception The deeper features of reality are found only in perceptual experience Some Problems of Philosophy pp one hundred ninety seven Empiricism in this sense is as yet characteristic of Professor James s philosophy as a whole It is not the distinctive and independent doctrine set forth in the present book The only summary of radical empiricism in this last and narrowest sense appears in the Preface to The Meaning of Truth pp xii xiii and it must be reprinted here as the key to the text that follows one Radical empiricism consists one first of a postulate two next of a statement of fact three and finally of a generalized conclusion one The postulate is that the only things that shall be debatable among philosophers shall be things definable in terms drawn from experience Things of an unexperienceable nature may exist ad libitum but they form no part of the material for philosophic debate This is the principle of pure experience as a methodical postulate Cf below pp one hundred fifty nine two hundred forty one This postulate corresponds to the notion which the author repeatedly attributes to Shadworth Hodgson the notion that realities are only what they are known as Pragmatism p fifty Varieties of Religious Experience p four hundred forty three The Meaning of Truth pp forty three one hundred eighteen In this sense radical empiricism and pragmatism are closely allied Indeed if pragmatism be defined as the assertion that the meaning of any proposition can always be brought down to some particular consequence in our future practical experience the point lying in the fact that the experience must be particular rather than in the fact that it must be active Meaning of Truth p two hundred ten then pragmatism and the above postulate come to the same thing The present book however consists not so much in the assertion of this postulate as in the use of it And the method is successful in special applications by virtue of a certain statement of fact concerning relations two The statement of fact is that the relations between things conjunctive as well as disjunctive are just as much matters of direct particular experience neither more so nor less so than the things themselves Cf also A Pluralistic Universe p two hundred eighty The Will to Believe p two hundred seventy eight This is the central doctrine of the present book It distinguishes radical empiricism from the ordinary empiricism of Hume J S Mill et cetera with which it is otherwise allied Cf below pp forty two forty four It provides an empirical and relational version of activity and so distinguishes the author s voluntarism from a view with which it is easily confused the view which upholds a pure or transcendent activity Cf below Essay VI It makes it possible to escape the vicious disjunctions that have thus far baffled philosophy such disjunctions as those between consciousness and physical nature between thought and its object between one mind and another and between one thing and another These disjunctions need not be overcome by calling in any extraneous trans empirical connective support Meaning of Truth Preface p xiii they may now be avoided by regarding the dualities in question as only differences of empirical relationship among common empirical terms The pragmatistic account of meaning and truth shows only how a vicious disjunction between idea and object may thus be avoided The present volume not only presents pragmatism in this light but adds similar accounts of the other dualities mentioned above Thus while pragmatism and radical empiricism do not differ essentially when regarded as methods they are independent when regarded as doctrines For it would be possible to hold the pragmatistic theory of meaning and truth without basing it on any fundamental theory of relations and without extending such a theory of relations to residual philosophical problems without in short holding either to the above statement of fact or to the following generalized conclusion three The generalized conclusion is that therefore the parts of experience hold together from next to next by relations that are themselves parts of experience The directly apprehended universe needs in short no extraneous trans empirical connective support but possesses in its own right a concatenated or continuous structure When thus generalized radical empiricism is not only a theory of knowledge comprising pragmatism as a special chapter but a metaphysic as well It excludes the hypothesis of trans empirical reality Cf below p one hundred ninety five It is the author s most rigorous statement of his theory that reality is an experience continuum Meaning of Truth p one hundred fifty two A Pluralistic Universe Lect V VII It is that positive and constructive empiricism of which Professor James said Let empiricism once become associated with religion as hitherto through some strange misunderstanding it has been associated with irreligion and I believe that a new era of religion as well as of philosophy will be ready to begin Op cit p three hundred fourteen cf ibid Lect VIII passim and The Varieties of Religious Experience

names for two sorts of object which common sense will always find contrasted and will always practically oppose to each other Philosophy reflecting on the contrast has varied in the past in her explanations of it and may be expected to vary in the future At first spirit and matter soul and body stood for a pair of equipollent substances quite on a par in weight and interest But one day Kant undermined the soul and brought in the transcendental ego and ever since then the bipolar relation has been very much off its balance The transcendental ego seems nowadays in rationalist quarters to stand for everything in empiricist quarters for almost nothing In the hands of such writers as Schuppe Rehmke Natorp Muensterberg at any rate in his earlier writings Schubert Soldern and others the spiritual principle attenuates itself to a thoroughly ghostly condition being only a name for the fact that the content of experience is known It loses personal form and activity these passing over to the content and becomes a bare Bewusstheit or Bewusstsein ueberhaupt of which in its own right absolutely nothing can be said I believe that consciousness when once it has evaporated to this estate of pure diaphaneity is on the point of disappearing altogether It is the name of a nonentity and has no right to a place among first principles Those who still cling to it are clinging to a mere echo the faint rumor left behind by the disappearing soul upon the air of philosophy During the past year I have read a number of articles whose authors seemed just on the point of abandoning the notion of consciousness three and substituting for it that of an absolute experience not due to two factors But they were not quite radical enough not quite daring enough in their negations For twenty years past I have mistrusted consciousness as an entity for seven or eight years past I have suggested its non existence to my students and tried to give them its pragmatic equivalent in realities of experience It seems to me that the hour is ripe for it to be openly and universally discarded To deny plumply that consciousness exists seems so absurd on the face of it for undeniably thoughts do exist that I fear some readers will follow me no farther Let me then immediately explain that I mean only to deny that the word stands for an entity but to insist most emphatically that it does stand for a function There is I mean no aboriginal stuff or quality of being four contrasted with that of which material objects are made out of which our thoughts of them are made but there is a function in experience which thoughts perform and for the performance of which this quality of being is invoked That function is knowing Consciousness is supposed necessary to explain the fact that things not only are but get reported are known Whoever blots out the notion of consciousness from his list of first principles must still provide in some way for that function s being carried on I My thesis is that if we start with the supposition that there is only one primal stuff or material in the world a stuff of which everything is composed and if we call that stuff pure experience then knowing can easily be explained as a particular sort of relation towards one another into which portions of pure experience may enter The relation itself is a part of pure experience one of its terms becomes the subject or bearer of the knowledge the knower five the other becomes the object known This will need much explanation before it can be understood The best way to get it understood is to contrast it with the alternative view and for that we may take the recentest alternative that in which the evaporation of the definite soul substance has proceeded as far as it can go without being yet complete If neo Kantism has expelled earlier forms of dualism we shall have expelled all forms if we are able to expel neo Kantism in its turn For the thinkers I call neo Kantian the word consciousness to day does no more than signalize the fact that experience is indefeasibly dualistic in structure It means that not subject not object but object plus subject is the minimum that can actually be The subject object distinction meanwhile is entirely different from that between mind and matter from that between body and soul Souls were detachable had separate destinies things could happen to them To consciousness as such nothing can happen for timeless itself it is only a witness of happenings in time in which it plays no part It is in a word but the logical correlative of content in an Experience of which the peculiarity is that fact comes to light in it that awareness of content takes place Consciousness as such is entirely impersonal self and its activities belong to the content To say that I am self conscious or conscious of putting forth volition means only that certain contents for which self and effort of will are the names are not without witness as they occur Thus for these belated drinkers at the Kantian spring we should have to admit consciousness as an epistemological necessity even if we had no direct evidence of its being there But in addition to this we are supposed by almost every one to have an immediate consciousness of consciousness itself When the world of outer fact ceases to be materially present and we merely recall it in memory or fancy it the consciousness is believed to stand out and to be felt as a kind of impalpable inner flowing which once known in this sort of experience may equally be detected in presentations of the outer world The moment we try to fix our attention upon consciousness and to see what distinctly it is says a recent writer it seems to vanish It seems as if we had before us a mere emptiness When we try to introspect the sensation of blue all we can see is the blue the other element is as if it were diaphanous Yet it can be distinguished if we look attentively enough and know that there is something to look for six Consciousness Bewusstheit says another philosopher is inexplicable and hardly describable yet all conscious experiences have this in common that what we call their content has this peculiar reference to a centre for which self is the name in virtue of which reference alone the content is subjectively given or appears While in this way consciousness or reference to a self is the only thing which distinguishes a conscious content from any sort of being that might be there with no one conscious of it yet this only ground of the distinction defies all closer explanations The existence of consciousness although it is the fundamental fact of psychology can indeed be laid down as certain can be brought out by analysis but can neither be defined nor deduced from anything but itself seven Can be brought out by analysis this author says This supposes that the consciousness is one element moment factor call it what you like of an experience of essentially dualistic inner constitution from which if you abstract the content the consciousness will remain revealed to its own eye Experience at this rate would be much like a paint of which the world pictures were made Paint has a dual constitution involving as it does a menstruum eight oil size or what not and a mass of content in the form of pigment suspended therein We can get the pure menstruum by letting the pigment settle and the pure pigment by pouring off the size or oil We operate here by physical subtraction and the usual view is that by mental subtraction we can separate the two factors of experience in an analogous way not isolating them entirely but distinguishing them enough to know that they are two II Now my contention is exactly the reverse of this Experience I believe has no such inner duplicity and the separation of it into consciousness and content comes not by way of subtraction but by way of addition the addition to a given concrete piece of it of other sets of experiences in connection with which severally its use or function may be of two different kinds The paint will also serve here as an illustration In a pot in a paint shop along with other paints it serves in its entirety as so much saleable matter Spread on a canvas with other paints around it it represents on the contrary a feature in a picture and performs a spiritual function Just so I maintain does a given undivided portion of experience taken in one context of associates play the part of a knower of a state of mind of consciousness while in a different context the same undivided bit of experience plays the part of a thing known of an objective content In a word in one group it figures as a thought in another group as a thing And since it can figure in both groups simultaneously we have every right to speak of it as subjective and objective both at once The dualism connoted by such double barrelled terms as experience phenomenon datum Vorfindung terms which in philosophy at any rate tend more and more to replace the single barrelled terms of thought and thing that dualism I say is still preserved in this account but reinterpreted so that instead of being mysterious and elusive it becomes verifiable and concrete It is an affair of relations it falls outside not inside the single experience considered and can always be particularized and defined The entering wedge for this more concrete way of understanding the dualism was fashioned by Locke when he made the word idea stand indifferently for thing and thought and by Berkeley when he said that what common sense means by realities is exactly what the philosopher means by ideas Neither Locke nor Berkeley thought his truth out into perfect clearness but it seems to me that the conception I am defending does little more than consistently carry out the pragmatic method which they were the first to use If the reader will take his own experiences he will see what I mean Let him begin with a perceptual experience the presentation so called of a physical object his actual field of vision the room he sits in with the book he is reading as its centre and let him for the present treat this complex object in the common sense way as being really what it seems to be namely a collection of physical things cut out from an environing world of other physical things with which these physical things have actual or potential relations Now at the same time it is just those self same things which his mind as we say perceives and the whole philosophy of perception from Democritus s time downwards has been just one long wrangle over the paradox that what is evidently one reality should be in two places at once both in outer space and in a person s mind Representative theories of perception avoid the logical paradox but on the other hand they violate the reader s sense of life which knows no intervening mental image but seems to see the room and the book immediately just as they physically exist The puzzle of how the one identical room can be in two places is at bottom just the puzzle of how one identical point can be on two lines It can if it be situated at their intersection and similarly if the pure experience of the room were a place of intersection of two processes which connected it with different groups of associates respectively it could be counted twice over as belonging to either group and spoken of loosely as existing in two places although it would remain all the time a numerically single thing Well the experience is a member of diverse processes that can be followed away from it along entirely different lines The one self identical thing has so many relations to the rest of experience that you can take it in disparate systems of association and treat it as belonging with opposite contexts nine In one of these contexts it is your field of consciousness in another it is the room in which you sit and it enters both contexts in its wholeness giving no pretext for being said to attach itself to consciousness by one of its parts or aspects and to outer reality by another What are the two processes now into which the room experience simultaneously enters in this way One of them is the reader s personal biography the other is the history of the house of which the room is part The presentation the experience the that in short for until we have decided what it is it must be a mere that is the last term of a train of sensations emotions decisions movements classifications expectations et cetera ending in the present and the first term of a series of similar inner operations extending into the future on the reader s part On the other hand the very same that is the terminus ad quem of a lot of previous physical operations carpentering papering furnishing warming et cetera and the terminus a quo of a lot of future ones in which it will be concerned when undergoing the destiny of a physical room The physical and the mental operations form curiously incompatible groups As a room the experience has occupied that spot and had that environment for thirty years As your field of consciousness it may never have existed until now As a room attention will go on to discover endless new details in it As your mental state merely few new ones will emerge under attention s eye As a room it will take an earthquake or a gang of men and in any case a certain amount of time to destroy it As your subjective state the closing of your eyes or any instantaneous play of your fancy will suffice In the real world fire will consume it In your mind you can let fire play over it without effect As an outer object you must pay so much a month to inhabit it As an inner content you may occupy it for any length of time rent free If in short you follow it in the mental direction taking it along with events of personal biography solely all sorts of things are true of it which are false and false of it which are true if you treat it as a real thing experienced follow it in the physical direction and relate it to associates in the outer world III So far all seems plain sailing but my thesis will probably grow less plausible to the reader when I pass from percepts to concepts or from the case of things presented to that of things remote I believe nevertheless that here also the same law holds good If we take conceptual manifolds or memories or fancies they also are in their first intention mere bits of pure experience and as such are single thats which act in one context as objects and in another context figure as mental states By taking them in their first intention I mean ignoring their relation to possible perceptual experiences with which they may be connected which they may lead to and terminate in and which then they may be supposed to represent Taking them in this way first we confine the problem to a world merely thought of and not directly felt or seen ten This world just like the world of percepts comes to us at first as a chaos of experiences but lines of order soon get traced We find that any bit of it which we may cut out as an example is connected with distinct groups of associates just as our perceptual experiences are that these associates link themselves with it by different relations eleven and that one forms the inner history of a person while the other acts as an impersonal objective world either spatial and temporal or else merely logical or mathematical or otherwise ideal The first obstacle on the part of the reader to seeing that these non perceptual experiences have objectivity as well as subjectivity will probably be due to the intrusion into his mind of percepts that third group of associates with which the non perceptual experiences have relations and which as a whole they represent standing to them as thoughts to things This important function of the non perceptual experiences complicates the question and confuses it for so used are we to treat percepts as the sole genuine realities that unless we keep them out of the discussion we tend altogether to overlook the objectivity that lies in non perceptual experiences by themselves We treat them knowing percepts as they do as through and through subjective and say that they are wholly constituted of the stuff called consciousness using this term now for a kind of entity after the fashion which I am seeking to refute twelve Abstracting then from percepts altogether what I maintain is that any single non perceptual experience tends to get counted twice over just as a perceptual experience does figuring in one context as an object or field of objects in another as a state of mind and all this without the least internal self diremption on its own part into consciousness and content It is all consciousness in one taking and in the other all content I find this objectivity of non perceptual experiences this complete parallelism in point of reality between the presently felt and the remotely thought so well set forth in a page of Muensterberg s Grundzuege that I will quote it as it stands I may only think of my objects says Professor Muensterberg yet in my living thought they stand before me exactly as perceived objects would do no matter how different the two ways of apprehending them may be in their genesis The book here lying on the table before me and the book in the next room of which I think and which I mean to get are both in the same sense given realities for me realities which I acknowledge and of which I take account If you agree that the perceptual object is not an idea within me but that percept and thing as indistinguishably one are really experienced there outside you ought not to believe that the merely thought of object is hid away inside of the thinking subject The object of which I think and of whose existence I take cognizance without letting it now work upon my senses occupies its definite place in the outer world as much as does the object which I directly see What is true of the here and the there is also true of the now and the then I know of the thing which is present and perceived but I know also of the thing which yesterday was but is no more and which I only remember Both can determine my present conduct both are parts of the reality of which I keep account It is true that of much of the past I am uncertain just as I am uncertain of much of what is present if it be but dimly perceived But the interval of time does not in principle alter my relation to the object does not transform it from an object known into a mental state The things in the room here which I survey and those in my distant home of which I think the things of this minute and those of my long vanished boyhood influence and decide me alike with a reality which my experience of them directly feels They both make up my real world they make it directly they do not have first to be introduced to me and mediated by ideas which now and here arise within me This not me character of my recollections and expectations does not imply that the external objects of which I am aware in those experiences should necessarily be there also for others The objects of dreamers and hallucinated persons are wholly without general validity But even were they centaurs and golden mountains they still would be off there in fairy land and not inside of ourselves thirteen This certainly is the immediate primary naif or practical way of taking our thought of world Were there no perceptual world to serve as its reductive in Taine s sense by being stronger and more genuinely outer so that the whole merely thought of world seems weak and inner in comparison our world of thought would be the only world and would enjoy complete reality in our belief This actually happens in our dreams and in our day dreams so long as percepts do not interrupt them And yet just as the seen room to go back to our late example is also a field of consciousness so the conceived or recollected room is also a state of mind and the doubling up of the experience has in both cases similar grounds The room thought of namely has many thought of couplings with many thought of things Some of these couplings are inconstant others are stable In the reader s personal history the room occupies a single date he saw it only once perhaps a year ago Of the house s history on the other hand it forms a permanent ingredient Some couplings have the curious stubbornness to borrow Royce s term of fact others show the fluidity of fancy we let them come and go as we please Grouped with the rest of its house with the name of its town of its owner builder value decorative plan the room maintains a definite foothold to which if we try to loosen it it tends to return and to reassert itself with force fourteen With these associates in a word it coheres while to other houses other towns other owners et cetera it shows no tendency to cohere at all The two collections first of its cohesive and second of its loose associates inevitably come to be contrasted We call the first collection the system of external realities in the midst of which the room as real exists the other we call the stream of our internal thinking in which as a mental image it for a moment floats fifteen The room thus again gets counted twice over It plays two different roles being Gedanke and Gedachtes the thought of an object and the object thought of both in one and all this without paradox or mystery just as the same material thing may be both low and high or small and great or bad and good because of its relations to opposite parts of an environing world As subjective we say that the experience represents as objective it is represented What represents and what is represented is here numerically the same but we must remember that no dualism of being represented and representing resides in the experience per se In its pure state or when isolated there is no self splitting of it into consciousness and what the consciousness is of Its subjectivity and objectivity are functional attributes solely realized only when the experience is taken i e talked of twice considered along with its two differing contexts respectively by a new retrospective experience of which that whole past complication now forms the fresh content The instant field of the present is at all times what I call the pure experience It is only virtually or potentially either object or subject as yet For the time being it is plain unqualified actuality or existence a simple that In this naif immediacy it is of course valid it is there we act upon it and the doubling of it in retrospection into a state of mind and a reality intended thereby is just one of the acts The state of mind first treated explicitly as such in retrospection will stand corrected or confirmed and the retrospective experience in its turn will get a similar treatment but the immediate experience in its passing is always truth sixteen practical truth something to act on at its own movement If the world were then and there to go out like a candle it would remain truth absolute and objective for it would be the last word would have no critic and no one would ever oppose the thought in it to the reality intended seventeen I think I may now claim to have made my thesis clear Consciousness connotes a kind of external relation and does not denote a special stuff or way of being The peculiarity of our experiences that they not only are but are known which their conscious quality is invoked to explain is better explained by their relations these relations themselves being experiences to one another IV Were I now to go on to treat of the knowing of perceptual by conceptual experiences it would again prove to be an affair of external relations One experience would be the knower the other the reality known and I could perfectly well define without the notion of consciousness what the knowing actually and practically amounts to leading towards namely and terminating in percepts through a series of transitional experiences which the world supplies But I will not treat of this space being insufficient eighteen I will rather consider a few objections that are sure to be urged against the entire theory as it stands V First of all this will be asked If experience has not conscious existence if it be not partly made of consciousness of what then is it made Matter we know and thought we know and conscious content we know but neutral and simple pure experience is something we know not at all Say what it consists of for it must consist of something or be willing to give it up To this challenge the reply is easy Although for fluency s sake I myself spoke early in this article of a stuff of pure experience I have now to say that there is no general stuff of which experience at large is made There are as many stuffs as there are natures in the things experienced If you ask what any one bit of pure experience is made of the answer is always the same It is made of that of just what appears of space of intensity of flatness brownness heaviness or what not Shadworth Hodgson s analysis here leaves nothing to be desired nineteen Experience is only a collective name for all these sensible natures and save for time and space and if you like for being there appears no universal element of which all things are made VI The next objection is more formidable in fact it sounds quite crushing when one hears it first If it be the self same piece of pure experience taken twice over that serves now as thought and now as thing so the objection runs how comes it that its attributes should differ so fundamentally in the two takings As thing the experience is extended as thought it occupies no space or place As thing it is red hard heavy but who ever heard of a red hard or heavy thought Yet even now you said that an experience is made of just what appears and what appears is just such adjectives How can the one experience in its thing function be made of them consist of them carry them as its own attributes while in its thought function it disowns them and attributes them elsewhere There is a self contradiction here from which the radical dualism of thought and thing is the only truth that can save us Only if the thought is one kind of being can the adjectives exist in it intentionally to use the scholastic term only if the thing is another kind can they exist in it constitutively and energetically No simple subject can take the same adjectives and at one time be qualified by it and at another time be merely of it as of something only meant or known The solution insisted on by this objector like many other common sense solutions grows the less satisfactory the more one turns it in one s mind To begin with are thought and thing as heterogeneous as is commonly said No one denies that they have some categories in common Their relations to time are identical Both moreover may have parts for psychologists in general treat thoughts as having them and both may be complex or simple Both are of kinds can be compared added and subtracted and arranged in serial orders All sorts of adjectives qualify our thoughts which appear incompatible with consciousness being as such a bare diaphaneity For instance they are natural and easy or laborious They are beautiful happy intense interesting wise idiotic focal marginal insipid confused vague precise rational casual general particular and many things besides Moreover the chapters on Perception in the psychology books are full of facts that make for the essential homogeneity of thought with thing How if subject and object were separated by the whole diameter of being and had no attributes in common could it be so hard to tell in a presented and recognized material object what part comes in through the sense organs and what part comes out of one s own head Sensations and apperceptive ideas fuse here so intimately that you can no more tell where one begins and the other ends than you can tell in those cunning circular panoramas that have lately been exhibited where the real foreground and the painted canvas join together twenty Descartes for the first time defined thought as the absolutely unextended and later philosophers have accepted the description as correct But what possible meaning has it to say that when we think of a foot rule or a square yard extension is not attributable to our thought Of every extended object the adequate mental picture must have all the extension of the object itself The difference between objective and subjective extension is one of relation to a context solely In the mind the various extents maintain no necessarily stubborn order relatively to each other while in the physical world they bound each other stably and added together make the great enveloping Unit which we believe in and call real Space As outer they carry themselves adversely so to speak to one another exclude one another and maintain their distances while as inner their order is loose and they form a durcheinander in which unity is lost twenty one But to argue from this that inner experience is absolutely inextensive seems to me little short of absurd The two worlds differ not by the presence or absence of extension but by the relations of the extensions which in both worlds exist Does not this case of extension now put us on the track of truth in the case of other qualities It does and I am surprised that the facts should not have been noticed long ago Why for example do we call a fire hot and water wet and yet refuse to say that our mental state when it is of these objects is either wet or hot Intentionally at any rate and when the mental state is a vivid image hotness and wetness are in it just as much as they are in the physical experience The reason is this that as the general chaos of all our experiences gets sifted we find that there are some fires that will always burn sticks and always warm our bodies and that there are some waters that will always put out fires while there are other fires and waters that will not act at all The general group of experiences that act that do not only possess their natures intrinsically but wear them adjectively and energetically turning them against one another comes inevitably to be contrasted with the group whose members having identically the same natures fail to manifest them in the energetic way twenty two I make for myself now an experience of blazing fire I place it near my body but it does not warm me in the least I lay a stick upon it and the stick either burns or remains green as I please I call up water and pour it on the fire and absolutely no difference ensues I account for all such facts by calling this whole train of experiences unreal a mental train Mental fire is what won t burn real sticks mental water is what won t necessarily though of course it may put out even a mental fire Mental knives may be sharp but they won t cut real wood Mental triangles are pointed but their points won t wound With real objects on the contrary consequences always accrue and thus the real experiences get sifted from the mental ones the things from our thoughts of them fanciful or true and precipitated together as the stable part of the whole experience chaos under the name of the physical world Of this our perceptual experiences are the nucleus they being the originally strong experiences We add a lot of conceptual experiences to them making these strong also in imagination and building out the remoter parts of the physical world by their means and around this core of reality the world of laxly connected fancies and mere rhapsodical objects floats like a bank of clouds In the clouds all sorts of rules are violated which in the core are kept Extensions there can be indefinitely located motion there obeys no Newton s laws VII There is a peculiar class of experiences to which whether we take them as subjective or as objective we assign their several natures as attributes because in both contexts they affect their associates actively though in neither quite as strongly or as sharply as things affect one another by their physical energies I refer here to appreciations which form an ambiguous sphere of being belonging with emotion on the one hand and having objective value on the other yet seeming not quite inner nor quite outer as if a diremption had begun but had not made itself complete twenty three Experiences of painful objects for example are usually also painful experiences perceptions of loveliness of ugliness tend to pass muster as lovely or as ugly perceptions intuitions of the morally lofty are lofty intuitions Sometimes the adjective wanders as if uncertain where to fix itself Shall we speak of seductive visions or of visions of seductive things Of wicked desires or of desires for wickedness Of healthy thoughts or of thoughts of healthy objects Of good impulses or of impulses towards the good Of feelings of anger or of angry feelings Both in the mind and in the thing these natures modify their context exclude certain associates and determine others have their mates and incompatibles Yet not as stubbornly as in the case of physical qualities for beauty and ugliness love and hatred pleasant and painful can in certain complex experiences coexist If one were to make an evolutionary construction of how a lot of originally chaotic pure experiences became gradually differentiated into an orderly inner and outer world the whole theory would turn upon one s success in explaining how or why the quality of an experience once active could become less so and from being an energetic attribute in some cases elsewhere lapse into the status of an inert or merely internal nature This would be the evolution of the psychical from the bosom of the physical in which the esthetic moral and otherwise emotional experiences would represent a halfway stage VIII But a last cry of non possumus will probably go up from many readers All very pretty as a piece of ingenuity they will say but our consciousness itself intuitively contradicts you We for our part know that we are conscious We feel our thought flowing as a life within us in absolute contrast with the objects which it so unremittingly escorts We can not be faithless to this immediate intuition The dualism is a fundamental datum Let no man join what God has put asunder My reply to this is my last word and I greatly grieve that to many it will sound materialistic I can not help that however for I too have my intuitions and I must obey them Let the case be what it may in others I am as confident as I am of anything that in myself the stream of thinking which I recognize emphatically as a phenomenon is only a careless name for what when scrutinized reveals itself to consist chiefly of the stream of my breathing The I think which Kant said must be able to accompany all my objects is the I breathe which actually does accompany them There are other internal facts besides breathing intracephalic muscular adjustments et cetera of which I have said a word in my larger Psychology and these increase the assets of consciousness so far as the latter is subject to immediate perception twenty four but breath which was ever the original of spirit breath moving outwards between the glottis and the nostrils is I am persuaded the essence out of which philosophers have constructed the entity known to them as consciousness That entity is fictitious while thoughts in the concrete are fully real But thoughts in the concrete are made of the same stuff as things are I wish I might believe myself to have made that plausible in this article

not to notice a curious unrest in the philosophic atmosphere of the time a loosening of old landmarks a softening of oppositions a mutual borrowing from one another on the part of systems anciently closed and an interest in new suggestions however vague as if the one thing sure were the inadequacy of the extant school solutions The dissatisfaction with these seems due for the most part to a feeling that they are too abstract and academic Life is confused and superabundant and what the younger generation appears to crave is more of the temperament of life in its philosophy even though it were at some cost of logical rigor and of formal purity Transcendental idealism is inclining to let the world wag incomprehensibly in spite of its Absolute Subject and his unity of purpose Berkeleyan idealism is abandoning the principle of parsimony and dabbling in panpsychic speculations Empiricism flirts with teleology and strangest of all natural realism so long decently buried raises its head above the turf and finds glad hands outstretched from the most unlikely quarters to help it to its feet again We are all biased by our personal feelings I know and I am personally discontented with extant solutions so I seem to read the signs of a great unsettlement as if the upheaval of more real conceptions and more fruitful methods were imminent as if a true landscape might result less clipped straight edged and artificial If philosophy be really on the eve of any considerable rearrangement the time should be propitious for any one who has suggestions of his own to bring forward For many years past my mind has been growing into a certain type of Weltanschauung Rightly or wrongly I have got to the point where I can hardly see things in any other pattern I propose therefore to describe the pattern as clearly as I can consistently with great brevity and to throw my description into the bubbling vat of publicity where jostled by rivals and torn by critics it will eventually either disappear from notice or else if better luck befall it quietly subside to the profundities and serve as a possible ferment of new growths or a nucleus of new crystallization I RADICAL EMPIRICISM I give the name of radical empiricism to my Weltanschauung Empiricism is known as the opposite of rationalism Rationalism tends to emphasize universals and to make wholes prior to parts in the order of logic as well as in that of being Empiricism on the contrary lays the explanatory stress upon the part the element the individual and treats the whole as a collection and the universal as an abstraction My description of things accordingly starts with the parts and makes of the whole a being of the second order It is essentially a mosaic philosophy a philosophy of plural facts like that of Hume and his descendants who refer these facts neither to Substances in which they inhere nor to an Absolute Mind that creates them as its objects But it differs from the Humian type of empiricism in one particular which makes me add the epithet radical To be radical an empiricism must neither admit into its constructions any element that is not directly experienced nor exclude from them any element that is directly experienced For such a philosophy the relations that connect experiences must themselves be experienced relations and any kind of relation experienced must be accounted as real as anything else in the system Elements may indeed be redistributed the original placing of things getting corrected but a real place must be found for every kind of thing experienced whether term or relation in the final philosophic arrangement Now ordinary empiricism in spite of the fact that conjunctive and disjunctive relations present themselves as being fully company ordinate parts of experience has always shown a tendency to do away with the connections of things and to insist most on the disjunctions Berkeley s nominalism Hume s statement that whatever things we distinguish are as loose and separate as if they had no manner of connection James Mill s denial that similars have anything really in common the resolution of the causal tie into habitual sequence John Mill s account of both physical things and selves as composed of discontinuous possibilities and the general pulverization of all Experience by association and the mind dust theory are examples of what I mean twenty six The natural result of such a world picture has been the efforts of rationalism to correct its incoherencies by the addition of trans experiential agents of unification substances intellectual categories and powers or Selves whereas if empiricism had only been radical and taken everything that comes without disfavor conjunction as well as separation each at its face value the results would have called for no such artificial correction Radical empiricism as I understand it does full justice to conjunctive relations without however treating them as rationalism always tends to treat them as being true in some supernal way as if the unity of things and their variety belonged to different orders of truth and vitality altogether II CONJUNCTIVE RELATIONS Relations are of different degrees of intimacy Merely to be with one another in a universe of discourse is the most external relation that terms can have and seems to involve nothing whatever as to farther consequences Simultaneity and time interval come next and then space adjacency and distance After them similarity and difference carrying the possibility of many inferences Then relations of activity tying terms into series involving change tendency resistance and the causal order generally Finally the relation experienced between terms that form states of mind and are immediately conscious of continuing each other The organization of the Self as a system of memories purposes strivings fulfilments or disappointments is incidental to this most intimate of all relations the terms of which seem in many cases actually to compenetrate and suffuse each other s being twenty seven Philosophy has always turned on grammatical particles With near next like from towards against because for through my these words designate types of conjunctive relation arranged in a roughly ascending order of intimacy and inclusiveness A priori we can imagine a universe of withness but no nextness or one of nextness but no likeness or of likeness with no activity or of activity with no purpose or of purpose with no ego These would be universes each with its own grade of unity The universe of human experience is by one or another of its parts of each and all these grades Whether or not it possibly enjoys some still more absolute grade of union does not appear upon the surface Taken as it does appear our universe is to a large extent chaotic No one single type of connection runs through all the experiences that compose it If we take space relations they fail to connect minds into any regular system Causes and purposes obtain only among special series of facts The self relation seems extremely limited and does not link two different selves together Prima facie if you should liken the universe of absolute idealism to an aquarium a crystal globe in which goldfish are swimming you would have to compare the empiricist universe to something more like one of those dried human heads with which the Dyaks of Borneo deck their lodges The skull forms a solid nucleus but innumerable feathers leaves strings beads and loose appendices of every description float and dangle from it and save that they terminate in it seem to have nothing to do with one another Even so my experiences and yours float and dangle terminating it is true in a nucleus of common perception but for the most part out of sight and irrelevant and unimaginable to one another This imperfect intimacy this bare relation of withness between some parts of the sum total of experience and other parts is the fact that ordinary empiricism over emphasizes against rationalism the latter always tending to ignore it unduly Radical empiricism on the contrary is fair to both the unity and the disconnection It finds no reason for treating either as illusory It allots to each its definite sphere of description and agrees that there appear to be actual forces at work which tend as time goes on to make the unity greater The conjunctive relation that has given most trouble to philosophy is the co conscious transition so to call it by which one experience passes into another when both belong to the same self About the facts there is no question My experiences and your experiences are with each other in various external ways but mine pass into mine and yours pass into yours in a way in which yours and mine never pass into one another Within each of our personal histories subject object interest and purpose are continuous or may be continuous twenty eight Personal histories are processes of change in time and the change itself is one of the things immediately experienced Change in this case means continuous as opposed to discontinuous transition But continuous transition is one sort of a conjunctive relation and to be a radical empiricist means to hold fast to this conjunctive relation of all others for this is the strategic point the position through which if a hole be made all the corruptions of dialectics and all the metaphysical fictions pour into our philosophy The holding fast to this relation means taking it at its face value neither less nor more and to take it at its face value means first of all to take it just as we feel it and not to confuse ourselves with abstract talk about it involving words that drive us to invent secondary conceptions in order to neutralize their suggestions and to make our actual experience again seem rationally possible What I do feel simply when a later moment of my experience succeeds an earlier one is that though they are two moments the transition from the one to the other is continuous Continuity here is a definite sort of experience just as definite as is the discontinuity experience which I find it impossible to avoid when I seek to make the transition from an experience of my own to one of yours In this latter case I have to get on and off again to pass from a thing lived to another thing only conceived and the break is positively experienced and noted Though the functions exerted by my experience and by yours may be the same e g the same objects known and the same purposes followed yet the sameness has in this case to be ascertained expressly and often with difficulty and uncertainty after the break has been felt whereas in passing from one of my own moments to another the sameness of object and interest is unbroken and both the earlier and the later experience are of things directly lived There is no other nature no other whatness than this absence of break and this sense of continuity in that most intimate of all conjunctive relations the passing of one experience into another when they belong to the same self And this whatness is real empirical content just as the whatness of separation and discontinuity is real content in the contrasted case Practically to experience one s personal continuum in this living way is to know the originals of the ideas of continuity and of sameness to know what the words stand for concretely to own all that they can ever mean But all experiences have their conditions and over subtle intellects thinking about the facts here and asking how they are possible have ended by substituting a lot of static objects of conception for the direct perceptual experiences Sameness they have said must be a stark numerical identity it can t run on from next to next Continuity can t mean mere absence of gap for if you say two things are in immediate contact at the contact how can they be two If on the other hand you put a relation of transition between them that itself is a third thing and needs to be related or hitched to its terms An infinite series is involved and so on The result is that from difficulty to difficulty the plain conjunctive experience has been discredited by both schools the empiricists leaving things permanently disjoined and the rationalist remedying the looseness by their Absolutes or Substances or whatever other fictitious agencies of union they may have employed twenty nine From all which artificiality we can be saved by a couple of simple reflections first that conjunctions and separations are at all events company ordinate phenomena which if we take experiences at their face value must be accounted equally real and second that if we insist on treating things as really separate when they are given as continuously joined invoking when union is required transcendental principles to overcome the separateness we have assumed then we ought to stand ready to perform the converse act We ought to invoke higher principles of dis union also to make our merely experienced disjunctions more truly real Failing thus we ought to let the originally given continuities stand on their own bottom We have no right to be lopsided or to blow capriciously hot and cold III THE COGNITIVE RELATION The first great pitfall from which such a radical standing by experience will save us is an artificial conception of the relations between knower and known Throughout the history of philosophy the subject and its object have been treated as absolutely discontinuous entities and thereupon the presence of the latter to the former or the apprehension by the former of the latter has assumed a paradoxical character which all sorts of theories had to be invented to overcome Representative theories put a mental representation image or content into the gap as a sort of intermediary Common sense theories left the gap untouched declaring our mind able to clear it by a self transcending leap Transcendentalist theories left it impossible to traverse by finite knowers and brought an Absolute in to perform the saltatory act All the while in the very bosom of the finite experience every conjunction required to make the relation intelligible is given in full Either the knower and the known are one the self same piece of experience taken twice over in different contexts or they are two two pieces of actual experience belonging to the same subject with definite tracts of conjunctive transitional experience between them or three the known is a possible experience either of that subject or another to which the said conjunctive transitions would lead if sufficiently prolonged To discuss all the ways in which one experience may function as the knower of another would be incompatible with the limits of this essay thirty I have just treated of type one the kind of knowledge called perception thirty one This is the type of case in which the mind enjoys direct acquaintance with a present object In the other types the mind has knowledge about an object not immediately there Of type two the simplest sort of conceptual knowledge I have given some account in two earlier articles thirty two Type three can always formally and hypothetically be reduced to type two so that a brief description of that type will put the present reader sufficiently at my point of view and make him see what the actual meanings of the mysterious cognitive relation may be Suppose me to be sitting here in my library at Cambridge at ten minutes walk from Memorial Hall and to be thinking truly of the latter object My mind may have before it only the name or it may have a clear image or it may have a very dim image of the hall but such intrinsic differences in the image make no difference in its cognitive function Certain extrinsic phenomena special experiences of conjunction are what impart to the image be it what it may its knowing office For instance if you ask me what hall I mean by my image and I can tell you nothing or if I fail to point or lead you towards the Harvard Delta or if being led by you I am uncertain whether the Hall I see be what I had in mind or not you would rightly deny that I had meant that particular hall at all even though my mental image might to some degree have resembled it The resemblance would count in that case as coincidental merely for all sorts of things of a kind resemble one another in this world without being held for that reason to take cognizance of one another On the other hand if I can lead you to the hall and tell you of its history and present uses if in its presence I feel my idea however imperfect it may have been to have led hither and to be now terminated if the associates of the image and of the felt hall run parallel so that each term of the one context corresponds serially as I walk with an answering term of the others why then my soul was prophetic and my idea must be and by common consent would be called cognizant of reality That percept was what I meant for into it my idea has passed by conjunctive experiences of sameness and fulfilled intention Nowhere is there jar but every later moment continues and corroborates an earlier one In this continuing and corroborating taken in no transcendental sense but denoting definitely felt transitions lies all that the knowing of a percept by an idea can possibly contain or signify Wherever such transitions are felt the first experience knows the last one Where they do not or where even as possibles they can not intervene there can be no pretence of knowing In this latter case the extremes will be connected if connected at all by inferior relations bare likeness or succession or by withness alone Knowledge of sensible realities thus comes to life inside the tissue of experience It is made and made by relations that unroll themselves in time Whenever certain intermediaries are given such that as they develop towards their terminus there is experience from point to point of one direction followed and finally of one process fulfilled the result is that their starting point thereby becomes a knower and their terminus an object meant or known That is all that knowing in the simple case considered can be known as that is the whole of its nature put into experiential terms Whenever such is the sequence of our experiences we may freely say that we had the terminal object in mind from the outset even although at the outset nothing was there in us but a flat piece of substantive experience like any other with no self transcendency about it and no mystery save the mystery of coming into existence and of being gradually followed by other pieces of substantive experience with conjunctively transitional experiences between That is what we mean here by the object s being in mind Of any deeper more real way of being in mind we have no positive conception and we have no right to discredit our actual experience by talking of such a way at all I know that many a reader will rebel at this Mere intermediaries he will say even though they be feelings of continuously growing fulfilment only separate the knower from the known whereas what we have in knowledge is a kind of immediate touch of the one by the other an apprehension in the etymological sense of the word a leaping of the chasm as by lightning an act by which two terms are smitten into one over the head of their distinctness All these dead intermediaries of yours are out of each other and outside of their termini still But do not such dialectic difficulties remind us of the dog dropping his bone and snapping at its image in the water If we knew any more real kind of union aliunde we might be entitled to brand all our empirical unions as a sham But unions by continuous transition are the only ones we know of whether in this matter of a knowledge about that terminates in an acquaintance whether in personal identity in logical predication through the copula is or elsewhere If anywhere there were more absolute unions realized they could only reveal themselves to us by just such conjunctive results These are what the unions are worth these are all that we can ever practically mean by union by continuity Is it not time to repeat what Lotze said of substances that to act like one is to be one thirty three Should we not say here that to be experienced as continuous is to be really continuous in a world where experience and reality come to the same thing In a picture gallery a painted hook will serve to hang a painted chain by a painted cable will hold a painted ship In a world where both the terms and their distinctions are affairs of experience conjunctions that are experienced must be at least as real as anything else They will be absolutely real conjunctions if we have no transphenomenal Absolute ready to derealize the whole experienced world by at a stroke If on the other hand we had such an Absolute not one of our opponents theories of knowledge could remain standing any better than ours could for the distinctions as well as the conjunctions of experience would impartially fall its prey The whole question of how one thing can know another would cease to be a real one at all in a world where otherness itself was an illusion thirty four So much for the essentials of the cognitive relation where the knowledge is conceptual in type or forms knowledge about an object It consists in intermediary experiences possible if not actual of continuously developing progress and finally of fulfilment when the sensible percept which is the object is reached The percept here not only verifies the concept proves its function of knowing that percept to be true but the percept s existence as the terminus of the chain of intermediaries creates the function Whatever terminates that chain was because it now proves itself to be what the concept had in mind The towering importance for human life of this kind of knowing lies in the fact that an experience that knows another can figure as its representative not in any quasi miraculous epistemological sense but in the definite practical sense of being its substitute in various operations sometimes physical and sometimes mental which lead us to its associates and results By experimenting on our ideas of reality we may save ourselves the trouble of experimenting on the real experiences which they severally mean The ideas form related systems corresponding point for point to the systems which the realities form and by letting an ideal term call up its associates systematically we may be led to a terminus which the corresponding real term would have led to in case we had operated on the real world And this brings us to the general question of substitution IV SUBSTITUTION In Taine s brilliant book on Intelligence substitution was for the first time named as a cardinal logical function though of course the facts had always been familiar enough What exactly in a system of experiences does the substitution of one of them for another mean According to my view experience as a whole is a process in time whereby innumerable particular terms lapse and are superseded by others that follow upon them by transitions which whether disjunctive or conjunctive in content are themselves experiences and must in general be accounted at least as real as the terms which they relate What the nature of the event called superseding signifies depends altogether on the kind of transition that obtains Some experiences simply abolish their predecessors without continuing them in any way Others are felt to increase or to enlarge their meaning to carry out their purpose or to bring us nearer to their goal They represent them and may fulfil their function better than they fulfilled it themselves But to fulfil a function in a world of pure experience can be conceived and defined in only one possible way In such a world transitions and arrivals or terminations are the only events that happen though they happen by so many sorts of path The only function that one experience can perform is to lead into another experience and the only fulfilment we can speak of is the reaching of a certain experienced end When one experience leads to or can lead to the same end as another they agree in function But the whole system of experiences as they are immediately given presents itself as a quasi chaos through which one can pass out of an initial term in many directions and yet end in the same terminus moving from next to next by a great many possible paths Either one of these paths might be a functional substitute for another and to follow one rather than another might on occasion be an advantageous thing to do As a matter of fact and in a general way the paths that run through conceptual experiences that is through thoughts or ideas that know the things in which they terminate are highly advantageous paths to follow Not only do they yield inconceivably rapid transitions but owing to the universal character thirty five which they frequently possess and to their capacity for association with one another in great systems they outstrip the tardy consecutions of the things themselves and sweep us on towards our ultimate termini in a far more labor saving way than the following of trains of sensible perception ever could Wonderful are the new cuts and the short circuits which the thought paths make Most thought paths it is true are substitutes for nothing actual they end outside the real world altogether in wayward fancies utopias fictions or mistakes But where they do re enter reality and terminate therein we substitute them always and with these substitutes we pass the greater number of our hours This is why I called our experiences taken all together a quasi chaos There is vastly more discontinuity in the sum total of experiences than we commonly suppose The objective nucleus of every man s experience his own body is it is true a continuous percept and equally continuous as a percept though we may be inattentive to it is the material environment of that body changing by gradual transition when the body moves But the distant parts of the physical world are at all times absent from us and form conceptual objects merely into the perceptual reality of which our life inserts itself at points discrete and relatively rare Round their several objective nuclei partly shared and common and partly discrete of the real physical world innumerable thinkers pursuing their several lines of physically true cogitation trace paths that intersect one another only at discontinuous perceptual points and the rest of the time are quite incongruent and around all the nuclei of shared reality as around the Dyak s head of my late metaphor floats the vast cloud of experiences that are wholly subjective that are non substitutional that find not even an eventual ending for themselves in the perceptual world the mere day dreams and joys and sufferings and wishes of the individual minds These exist with one another indeed and with the objective nuclei but out of them it is probable that to all eternity no interrelated system of any kind will ever be made This notion of the purely substitutional or conceptual physical world brings us to the most critical of all the steps in the development of a philosophy of pure experience The paradox of self transcendency in knowledge comes back upon us here but I think that our notions of pure experience and of substitution and our radically empirical view of conjunctive transitions are Denkmittel that will carry us safely through the pass V WHAT OBJECTIVE REFERENCE IS Whosoever feels his experience to be something substitutional even while he has it may be said to have an experience that reaches beyond itself From inside of its own entity it says more and postulates reality existing elsewhere For the transcendentalist who holds knowing to consist in a salto mortale across an epistemological chasm such an idea presents no difficulty but it seems at first sight as if it might be inconsistent with an empiricism like our own Have we not explained that conceptual knowledge is made such wholly by the existence of things that fall outside of the knowing experience itself by intermediary experiences and by a terminus that fulfils Can the knowledge be there before these elements that constitute its being have come And if knowledge be not there how can objective reference occur The key to this difficulty lies in the distinction between knowing as verified and completed and the same knowing as in transit and on its way To recur to the Memorial Hall example lately used it is only when our idea of the Hall has actually terminated in the percept that we know for certain that from the beginning it was truly cognitive of that Until established by the end of the process its quality of knowing that or indeed of knowing anything could still be doubted and yet the knowing really was there as the result now shows We were virtual knowers of the Hall long before we were certified to have been its actual knowers by the percept s retroactive validating power Just so we are mortal all the time by reason of the virtuality of the inevitable event which will make us so when it shall have come Now the immensely greater part of all our knowing never gets beyond this virtual stage It never is completed or nailed down I speak not merely of our ideas of imperceptibles like ether waves or dissociated ions or of ejects like the contents of our neighbors minds I speak also of ideas which we might verify if we would take the trouble but which we hold for true although unterminated perceptually because nothing says no to us and there is no contradicting truth in sight To continue thinking unchallenged is ninety nine times out of a hundred our practical substitute for knowing in the completed sense As each experience runs by cognitive transition into the next one and we nowhere feel a collision with what we elsewhere count as truth or fact we commit ourselves to the current as if the port were sure We live as it were upon the front edge of an advancing wave crest and our sense of a determinate direction in falling forward is all we cover of the future of our path It is as if a differential quotient should be conscious and treat itself as an adequate substitute for a traced out curve Our experience inter alia is of variations of rate and of direction and lives in these transitions more than in the journey s end The experiences of tendency are sufficient to act upon what more could we have done at those moments even if the later verification comes complete This is what as a radical empiricist I say to the charge that the objective reference which is so flagrant a character of our experiences involves a chasm and a mortal leap A positively conjunctive transition involves neither chasm nor leap Being the very original of what we mean by continuity it makes a continuum wherever it appears I know full well that such brief words as these will leave the hardened transcendentalist unshaken Conjunctive experiences separate their terms he will still say they are third things interposed that have themselves to be conjoined by new links and to invoke them makes our trouble infinitely worse To feel our motion forward is impossible Motion implies terminus and how can terminus be felt before we have arrived The barest start and sally forwards the barest tendency to leave the instant involves the chasm and the leap Conjunctive transitions are the most superficial of appearances illusions of our sensibility which philosophical reflection pulverizes at a touch Conception is our only trustworthy instrument conception and the Absolute working hand in hand Conception disintegrates experience utterly but its disjunctions are easily overcome again when the Absolute takes up the task Such transcendentalists I must leave provisionally at least in full possession of their creed thirty six I have no space for polemics in this article so I shall simply formulate the empiricist doctrine as my hypothesis leaving it to work or not work as it may Objective reference I say then is an incident of the fact that so much of our experience comes as an insufficient and consists of process and transition Our fields of experience have no more definite boundaries than have our fields of view Both are fringed forever by a more that continuously develops and that continuously supersedes them as life proceeds The relations generally speaking are as real here as the terms are and the only complaint of the transcendentalist s with which I could at all sympathize would be his charge that by first making knowledge to consist in external relations as I have done and by then confessing that nine tenths of the time these are not actually but only virtually there I have knocked the solid bottom out of the whole business and palmed off a substitute of knowledge for the genuine thing Only the admission such a critic might say that our ideas are self transcendent and true already in advance of the experiences that are to terminate them can bring solidity back to knowledge in a world like this in which transitions and terminations are only by exception fulfilled This seems to me an excellent place for applying the pragmatic method When a dispute arises that method consists in auguring what practical consequences would be different if one side rather than the other were true If no difference can be thought of the dispute is a quarrel over words What then would the self transcendency affirmed to exist in advance of all experiential mediation or termination be known as What would it practically result in for us were it true It could only result in our orientation in the turning of our expectations and practical tendencies into the right path and the right path here so long as we and the object are not yet face to face or can never get face to face as in the case of ejects would be the path that led us into the object s nearest neighborhood Where direct acquaintance is lacking knowledge about is the next best thing and an acquaintance with what actually lies about the object and is most closely related to it puts such knowledge within our grasp Ether waves and your anger for example are things in which my thoughts will never perceptually terminate but my concepts of them lead me to their very brink to the chromatic fringes and to the hurtful words and deeds which are their really next effects Even if our ideas did in themselves carry the postulated self transcendency it would still remain true that their putting us into possession of such effects would be the sole cash value of the self transcendency for us And this cash value it is needless to say is verbatim et literatim what our empiricist account pays in On pragmatist principles therefore a dispute over self transcendency is a pure logomachy Call our concepts of ejective things self transcendent or the reverse it makes no difference so long as we don t differ about the nature of that exalted virtue s fruits fruits for us of course humanistic fruits If an Absolute were proved to exist for other reasons it might well appear that his knowledge is terminated in innumerable cases where ours is still incomplete That however would be a fact indifferent to our knowledge The latter would grow neither worse nor better whether we acknowledged such an Absolute or left him out So the notion of a knowledge still in transitu and on its way joins hands here with that notion of a pure experience which I tried to explain in my essay entitled Does Consciousness Exist The instant field of the present is always experience in its pure state plain unqualified actuality a simple that as yet undifferentiated into thing and thought and only virtually classifiable as objective fact or as some one s opinion about fact This is as true when the field is conceptual as when it is perceptual Memorial Hall is there in my idea as much as when I stand before it I proceed to act on its account in either case Only in the later experience that supersedes the present one is this naif immediacy retrospectively split into two parts a consciousness and its content and the content corrected or confirmed While still pure or present any experience mine for example of what I write about in these very lines passes for truth The morrow may reduce it to opinion The transcendentalist in all his particular knowledges is as liable to this reduction as I am his Absolute does not save him Why then need he quarrel with an account of knowing that merely leaves it liable to this inevitable condition Why insist that knowing is a static relation out of time when it practically seems so much a function of our active life For a thing to be valid says Lotze is the same as to make itself valid When the whole universe seems only to be making itself valid and to be still incomplete else why its ceaseless changing why of all things should knowing be exempt Why should it not be making itself valid like everything else That some parts of it may be already valid or verified beyond dispute the empirical philosopher of course like any one else may always hope VI THE CONTERMINOUSNESS OF DIFFERENT MINDS thirty seven With transition and prospect thus enthroned in pure experience it is impossible to subscribe to the idealism of the English school Radical empiricism has in fact more affinities with natural realism than with the views of Berkeley or of Mill and this can be easily shown For the Berkeleyan school ideas the verbal equivalent of what I term experiences are discontinuous The content of each is wholly immanent and there are no transitions with which they are consubstantial and through which their beings may unite Your Memorial Hall and mine even when both are percepts are wholly out of connection with each other Our lives are a congeries of solipsisms out of which in strict logic only a God could compose a universe even of discourse No dynamic currents run between my objects and your objects Never can our minds meet in the same The incredibility of such a philosophy is flagrant It is cold strained and unnatural in a supreme degree and it may be doubted whether even Berkeley himself who took it so religiously really believed when walking through the streets of London that his spirit and the spirits of his fellow wayfarers had absolutely different towns in view To me the decisive reason in favor of our minds meeting in some common objects at least is that unless I make that supposition I have no motive for assuming that your mind exists at all Why do I postulate your mind Because I see your body acting in a certain way Its gestures facial movements words and conduct generally are expressive so I deem it actuated as my own is by an inner life like mine This argument from analogy is my reason whether an instinctive belief runs before it or not But what is your body here but a percept in my field It is only as animating that object my object that I have any occasion to think of you at all If the body that you actuate be not the very body that I see there but some duplicate body of your own with which that has nothing to do we belong to different universes you and I and for me to speak of you is folly Myriads of such universes even now may coexist irrelevant to one another my concern is solely with the universe with which my own life is connected In that perceptual part of my universe which I call your body your mind and my mind meet and may be called conterminous Your mind actuates that body and mine sees it my thoughts pass into it as into their harmonious cognitive fulfilment your emotions and volitions pass into it as causes into their effects But that percept hangs together with all our other physical percepts They are of one stuff with it and if it be our common possession they must be so likewise For instance your hand lays hold of one end of a rope and my hand lays hold of the other end We pull against each other Can our two hands be mutual objects in this experience and the rope not be mutual also What is true of the rope is true of any other percept Your objects are over and over again the same as mine If I ask you where some object of yours is our old Memorial Hall for example you point to my Memorial Hall with your hand which I see If you alter an object in your world put out a candle for example when I am present my candle ipso facto goes out It is only as altering my objects that I guess you to exist If your objects do not coalesce with my objects if they be not identically where mine are they must be proved to be positively somewhere else But no other location can be assigned for them so their place must be what it seems to be the same thirty eight Practically then our minds meet in a world of objects which they share in common which would still be there if one or several of the minds were destroyed I can see no formal objection to this supposition s being literally true On the principles which I am defending a mind or personal consciousness is the name for a series of experiences run together by certain definite transitions and an objective reality is a series of similar experiences knit by different transitions If one and the same experience can figure twice once in a mental and once in a physical context as I have tried in my article on Consciousness to show that it can one does not see why it might not figure thrice or four times or any number of times by running into as many different mental contexts just as the same point lying at their intersection can be continued into many different lines Abolishing any number of contexts would not destroy the experience itself or its other contexts any more than abolishing some of the point s linear continuations would destroy the others or destroy the point itself I well know the subtle dialectic which insists that a term taken in another relation must needs be an intrinsically different term The crux is always the old Greek one that the same man can t be tall in relation to one neighbor and short in relation to another for that would make him tall and short at once In this essay I can not stop to refute this dialectic so I pass on leaving my flank for the time exposed thirty nine But if my reader will only allow that the same now both ends his past and begins his future or that when he buys an acre of land from his neighbor it is the same acre that successively figures in the two estates or that when I pay him a dollar the same dollar goes into his pocket that came out of mine he will also in consistency have to allow that the same object may conceivably play a part in as being related to the rest of any number of otherwise entirely different minds This is enough for my present point the common sense notion of minds sharing the same object offers no special logical or epistemological difficulties of its own it stands or falls with the general possibility of things being in conjunctive relation with other things at all In principle then let natural realism pass for possible Your mind and mine may terminate in the same percept not merely against it as if it were a third external thing but by inserting themselves into it and coalescing with it for such is the sort of conjunctive union that appears to be experienced when a perceptual terminus fulfils Even so two hawsers may embrace the same pile and yet neither one of them touch any other part except that pile of what the other hawser is attached to It is therefore not a formal question but a question of empirical fact solely whether when you and I are said to know the same Memorial Hall our minds do terminate at or in a numerically identical percept Obviously as a plain matter of fact they do not Apart from color blindness and such possibilities we see the Hall in different perspectives You may be on one side of it and I on another The percept of each of us as he sees the surface of the Hall is moreover only his provisional terminus The next thing beyond my percept is not your mind but more percepts of my own into which my first percept develops the interior of the Hall for instance or the inner structure of its bricks and mortar If our minds were in a literal sense con terminous neither could get beyond the percept which they had in common it would be an ultimate barrier between them unless indeed they flowed over it and became company conscious over a still larger part of their content which thought transference apart is not supposed to be the case In point of fact the ultimate common barrier can always be pushed by both minds farther than any actual percept of either until at last it resolves itself into the mere notion of imperceptibles like atoms or ether so that where we do terminate in percepts our knowledge is only speciously completed being in theoretic strictness only a virtual knowledge of those remoter objects which conception carries out Is natural realism permissible in logic refuted then by empirical fact Do our minds have no object in common after all Yes they certainly have Space in common On pragmatic principles we are obliged to predicate sameness wherever we can predicate no assignable point of difference If two named things have every quality and function indiscernible and are at the same time in the same place they must be written down as numerically one thing under two different names But there is no test discoverable so far as I know by which it can be shown that the place occupied by your percept of Memorial Hall differs from the place occupied by mine The percepts themselves may be shown to differ but if each of us be asked to point out where his percept is we point to an identical spot All the relations whether geometrical or causal of the Hall originate or terminate in that spot wherein our hands meet and where each of us begins to work if he wishes to make the Hall change before the other s eyes Just so it is with our bodies That body of yours which you actuate and feel from within must be in the same spot as the body of yours which I see or touch from without There for me means where I place my finger If you do not feel my finger s contact to be there in my sense when I place it on your body where then do you feel it Your inner actuations of your body meet my finger there it is there that you resist its push or shrink back or sweep the finger aside with your hand Whatever farther knowledge either of us may acquire of the real constitution of the body which we thus feel you from within and I from without it is in that same place that the newly conceived or perceived constituents have to be located and it is through that space that your and my mental intercourse with each other has always to be carried on by the mediation of impressions which I convey thither and of the reactions thence which those impressions may provoke from you In general terms then whatever differing contents our minds may eventually fill a place with the place itself is a numerically identical content of the two minds a piece of common property in which through which and over which they join The receptacle of certain of our experiences being thus common the experiences themselves might some day become common also If that day ever did come our thoughts would terminate in a complete empirical identity there would be an end so far as those experiences went to our discussions about truth No points of difference appearing they would have to count as the same VII CONCLUSION With this we have the outlines of a philosophy of pure experience before us At the outset of my essay I called it a mosaic philosophy In actual mosaics the pieces are held together by their bedding for which bedding the Substances transcendental Egos or Absolutes of other philosophies may be taken to stand In radical empiricism there is no bedding it is as if the pieces clung together by their edges the transitions experienced between them forming their cement Of course such a metaphor is misleading for in actual experience the more substantive and the more transitive parts run into each other continuously there is in general no separateness needing to be overcome by an external cement and whatever separateness is actually experienced is not overcome it stays and counts as separateness to the end But the metaphor serves to symbolize the fact that Experience itself taken at large can grow by its edges That one moment of it proliferates into the next by transitions which whether conjunctive or disjunctive continue the experiential tissue can not I contend be denied Life is in the transitions as much as in the terms connected often indeed it seems to be there more emphatically as if our spurts and sallies forward were the real firing line of the battle were like the thin line of flame advancing across the dry autumnal field which the farmer proceeds to burn In this line we live prospectively as well as retrospectively It is of the past inasmuch as it comes expressly as the past s continuation it is of the future in so far as the future when it comes will have continued it These relations of continuous transition experienced are what make our experiences cognitive In the simplest and completest cases the experiences are cognitive of one another When one of them terminates a previous series of them with a sense of fulfilment it we say is what those other experiences had in view The knowledge in such a case is verified the truth is salted down Mainly however we live on speculative investments or on our prospects only But living on things in posse is as good as living in the actual so long as our credit remains good It is evident that for the most part it is good and that the universe seldom protests our drafts In this sense we at every moment can continue to believe in an existing beyond It is only in special cases that our confident rush forward gets rebuked The beyond must of course always in our philosophy be itself of an experiential nature If not a future experience of our own or a present one of our neighbor it must be a thing in itself in doctor Prince s and Professor Strong s sense of the term that is it must be an experience for itself whose relation to other things we translate into the action of molecules ether waves or whatever else the physical symbols may be forty This opens the chapter of the relations of radical empiricism to panpsychism into which I can not enter now forty one The beyond can in any case exist simultaneously for it can be experienced to have existed simultaneously with the experience that practically postulates it by looking in its direction or by turning or changing in the direction of which it is the goal Pending that actuality of union in the virtuality of which the truth even now of the postulation consists the beyond and its knower are entities split off from each other The world is in so far forth a pluralism of which the unity is not fully experienced as yet But as fast as verifications come trains of experience once separate run into one another and that is why I said earlier in my article that the unity of the world is on the whole undergoing increase The universe continually grows in quantity by new experiences that graft themselves upon the older mass but these very new experiences often help the mass to a more consolidated form These are the main features of a philosophy of pure experience It has innumerable other aspects and arouses innumerable questions but the points I have touched on seem enough to make an entering wedge In my own mind such a philosophy harmonizes best with a radical pluralism with novelty and indeterminism moralism and theism and with the humanism lately sprung upon us by the Oxford and the Chicago schools forty two I can not however be sure that all these doctrines are its necessary and indispensable allies It presents so many points of difference both from the common sense and from the idealism that have made our philosophic language that it is almost as difficult to state it as it is to think it out clearly and if it is ever to grow into a respectable system it will have to be built up by the contributions of many company operating minds It seems to me as I said at the outset of this essay that many minds are in point of fact now turning in a direction that points towards radical empiricism If they are carried farther by my words and if then they add their stronger voices to my feebler one the publication of this essay will have been worth while FOOTNOTES twenty five Reprinted from the Journal of Philosophy Psychology and Scientific Methods vol I nineteen oh four No

perfectly fluent The active sense of living which we all enjoy before reflection shatters our instinctive world for us is self luminous and suggests no paradoxes Its difficulties are disappointments and uncertainties They are not intellectual contradictions When the reflective intellect gets at work however it discovers incomprehensibilities in the flowing process Distinguishing its elements and parts it gives them separate names and what it thus disjoins it can not easily put together Pyrrhonism accepts the irrationality and revels in its dialectic elaboration Other philosophies try some by ignoring some by resisting and some by turning the dialectic procedure against itself negating its first negations to restore the fluent sense of life again and let redemption take the place of innocence The perfection with which any philosophy may do this is the measure of its human success and of its importance in philosophic history In the last essay A World of Pure Experience I tried my own hand sketchily at the problem resisting certain first steps of dialectics by insisting in a general way that the immediately experienced conjunctive relations are as real as anything else If my sketch is not to appear too naif I must come closer to details and in the present essay I propose to do so I Pure experience is the name which I gave to the immediate flux of life which furnishes the material to our later reflection with its conceptual categories Only new born babes or men in semi coma from sleep drugs illnesses or blows may be assumed to have an experience pure in the literal sense of a that which is not yet any definite what tho ready to be all sorts of whats full both of oneness and of manyness but in respects that don t appear changing throughout yet so confusedly that its phases interpenetrate and no points either of distinction or of identity can be caught Pure experience in this state is but another name for feeling or sensation But the flux of it no sooner comes than it tends to fill itself with emphases and these salient parts become identified and fixed and abstracted so that experience now flows as if shot through with adjectives and nouns and prepositions and conjunctions Its purity is only a relative term meaning the proportional amount of unverbalized sensation which it still embodies Far back as we go the flux both as a whole and in its parts is that of things conjunct and separated The great continua of time space and the self envelope everything betwixt them and flow together without interfering The things that they envelope come as separate in some ways and as continuous in others Some sensations coalesce with some ideas and others are irreconcilable Qualities compenetrate one space or exclude each other from it They cling together persistently in groups that move as units or else they separate Their changes are abrupt or discontinuous and their kinds resemble or differ and as they do so they fall into either even or irregular series In all this the continuities and the discontinuities are absolutely company ordinate matters of immediate feeling The conjunctions are as primordial elements of fact as are the distinctions and disjunctions In the same act by which I feel that this passing minute is a new pulse of my life I feel that the old life continues into it and the feeling of continuance in no wise jars upon the simultaneous feeling of a novelty They too compenetrate harmoniously Prepositions copulas and conjunctions is isn t then before in on beside between next like unlike as but flower out of the stream of pure experience the stream of concretes or the sensational stream as naturally as nouns and adjectives do and they melt into it again as fluidly when we apply them to a new portion of the stream II If now we ask why we must thus translate experience from a more concrete or pure into a more intellectualized form filling it with ever more abounding conceptual distinctions rationalism and naturalism give different replies The rationalistic answer is that the theoretic life is absolute and its interests imperative that to understand is simply the duty of man and that who questions this need not be argued with for by the fact of arguing he gives away his case The naturalist answer is that the environment kills as well as sustains us and that the tendency of raw experience to extinguish the experient himself is lessened just in the degree in which the elements in it that have a practical bearing upon life are analyzed out of the continuum and verbally fixed and coupled together so that we may know what is in the wind for us and get ready to react in time Had pure experience the naturalist says been always perfectly healthy there would never have arisen the necessity of isolating or verbalizing any of its terms We should just have experienced inarticulately and unintellectually enjoyed This leaning on reaction in the naturalist account implies that whenever we intellectualize a relatively pure experience we ought to do so for the sake of redescending to the purer or more concrete level again and that if an intellect stays aloft among its abstract terms and generalized relations and does not reinsert itself with its conclusions into some particular point of the immediate stream of life it fails to finish out its function and leaves its normal race unrun Most rationalists nowadays will agree that naturalism gives a true enough account of the way in which our intellect arose at first but they will deny these latter implications The case they will say resembles that of sexual love Originating in the animal need of getting another generation born this passion has developed secondarily such imperious spiritual needs that if you ask why another generation ought to be born at all the answer is Chiefly that love may go on Just so with our intellect it originated as a practical means of serving life but it has developed incidentally the function of understanding absolute truth and life itself now seems to be given chiefly as a means by which that function may be prosecuted But truth and the understanding of it lie among the abstracts and universals so the intellect now carries on its higher business wholly in this region without any need of redescending into pure experience again If the contrasted tendencies which I thus designate as naturalistic and rationalistic are not recognized by the reader perhaps an example will make them more concrete mister Bradley for instance is an ultra rationalist He admits that our intellect is primarily practical but says that for philosophers the practical need is simply Truth Truth moreover must be assumed consistent Immediate experience has to be broken into subjects and qualities terms and relations to be understood as truth at all Yet when so broken it is less consistent than ever Taken raw it is all un distinguished Intellectualized it is all distinction without oneness Such an arrangement may work but the theoretic problem is not solved The question is how the diversity can exist in harmony with the oneness To go back to pure experience is unavailing Mere feeling gives no answer to our riddle Even if your intuition is a fact it is not an understanding It is a mere experience and furnishes no consistent view The experience offered as facts or truths I find that my intellect rejects because they contradict themselves They offer a complex of diversities conjoined in a way which it feels is not its way and which it can not repeat as its own For to be satisfied my intellect must understand and it can not understand by taking a congeries in the lump forty four So mister Bradley in the sole interests of understanding as he conceives that function turns his back on finite experience forever Truth must lie in the opposite direction the direction of the Absolute and this kind of rationalism and naturalism or as I will now call it pragmatism walk thenceforward upon opposite paths For the one those intellectual products are most true which turning their face towards the Absolute come nearest to symbolizing its ways of uniting the many and the one For the other those are most true which most successfully dip back into the finite stream of feeling and grow most easily confluent with some particular wave or wavelet Such confluence not only proves the intellectual operation to have been true as an addition may prove that a subtraction is already rightly performed but it constitutes according to pragmatism all that we mean by calling it true Only in so far as they lead us successfully or unsuccessfully back into sensible experience again are our abstracts and universals true or false at all forty five III In Section VI of the last essay I adopted in a general way the common sense belief that one and the same world is cognized by our different minds but I left undiscussed the dialectical arguments which maintain that this is logically absurd The usual reason given for its being absurd is that it assumes one object to wit the world to stand in two relations at once to my mind namely and again to yours whereas a term taken in a second relation can not logically be the same term which it was at first I have heard this reason urged so often in discussing with absolutists and it would destroy my radical empiricism so utterly if it were valid that I am bound to give it an attentive ear and seriously to search its strength For instance let the matter in dispute be term M asserted to be on the one hand related to L and on the other to N and let the two cases of relation be symbolized by L M and M N respectively When now I assume that the experience may immediately come and be given in the shape L M N with no trace of doubling or internal fission in the M I am told that this is all a popular delusion that L M N logically means two different experiences L M and M N namely and that although the Absolute may and indeed must from its superior point of view read its own kind of unity into M s two editions yet as elements in finite experience the two M s lie irretrievably asunder and the world between them is broken and unbridged In arguing this dialectic thesis one must avoid slipping from the logical into the physical point of view It would be easy in taking a concrete example to fix one s ideas by to choose one in which the letter M should stand for a collective noun of some sort which noun being related to L by one of its parts and to N by another would inwardly be two things when it stood outwardly in both relations Thus one might say David Hume who weighed so many stone by his body influences posterity by his doctrine The body and the doctrine are two things between which our finite minds can discover no real sameness though the same name covers both of them And then one might continue Only an Absolute is capable of uniting such a non identity We must I say avoid this sort of example for the dialectic insight if true at all must apply to terms and relations universally It must be true of abstract units as well as of nouns collective and if we prove it by concrete examples we must take the simplest so as to avoid irrelevant material suggestions Taken thus in all its generality the absolutist contention seems to use as its major premise Hume s notion that all our distinct perceptions are distinct existences and that the mind never perceives any real connexion among distinct existences forty six Undoubtedly since we use two phrases in talking first about M s relation to L and then about M s relation to N we must be having or must have had two distinct perceptions and the rest would then seem to follow duly But the starting point of the reasoning here seems to be the fact of the two phrases and this suggests that the argument may be merely verbal Can it be that the whole dialectic consists in attributing to the experience talked about a constitution similar to that of the language in which we describe it Must we assert the objective double ness of the M merely because we have to name it twice over when we name its two relations Candidly I can think of no other reason than this for the dialectic conclusion forty seven for if we think not of our words but of any simple concrete matter which they may be held to signify the experience itself belies the paradox asserted We use indeed two separate concepts in analyzing our object but we know them all the while to be but substitutional and that the M in L M and the M in M N mean i e are capable of leading to and terminating in one self same piece M of sensible experience This persistent identity of certain units or emphases or points or objects or members call them what you will of the experience continuum is just one of those conjunctive features of it on which I am obliged to insist so emphatically forty eight For samenesses are parts of experience s indefeasible structure When I hear a bell stroke and as life flows on its after image dies away I still hark back to it as that same bell stroke When I see a thing M with L to the left of it and N to the right of it I see it as one M and if you tell me I have had to take it twice I reply that if I took it a thousand times I should still see it as a unit forty nine Its unity is aboriginal just as the multiplicity of my successive takings is aboriginal It comes unbroken as that M as a singular which I encounter they come broken as those takings as my plurality of operations The unity and the separateness are strictly company ordinate I do not easily fathom why my opponents should find the separateness so much more easily understandable that they must needs infect the whole of finite experience with it and relegate the unity now taken as a bare postulate and no longer as a thing positively perceivable to the region of the Absolute s mysteries I do not easily fathom this I say for the said opponents are above mere verbal quibbling yet all that I can catch in their talk is the substitution of what is true of certain words for what is true of what they signify They stay with the words not returning to the stream of life whence all the meaning of them came and which is always ready to reabsorb them IV For aught this argument proves then we may continue to believe that one thing can be known by many knowers But the denial of one thing in many relations is but one application of a still profounder dialectic difficulty Man can t be good said the sophists for man is man and good is good and Hegel fifty and Herbart in their day more recently A Spir fifty one and most recently and elaborately of all mister Bradley informs us that a term can logically only be a punctiform unit and that not one of the conjunctive relations between things which experience seems to yield is rationally possible Of course if true this cuts off radical empiricism without even a shilling Radical empiricism takes conjunctive relations at their face value holding them to be as real as the terms united by them fifty two The world it represents as a collection some parts of which are conjunctively and others disjunctively related Two parts themselves disjoined may nevertheless hang together by intermediaries with which they are severally connected and the whole world eventually may hang together similarly inasmuch as some path of conjunctive transition by which to pass from one of its parts to another may always be discernible Such determinately various hanging together may be called concatenated union to distinguish it from the through and through type of union each in all and all in each union of total conflux as one might call it which monistic systems hold to obtain when things are taken in their absolute reality In a concatenated world a partial conflux often is experienced Our concepts and our sensations are confluent successive states of the same ego and feelings of the same body are confluent Where the experience is not of conflux it may be of conterminousness things with but one thing between or of contiguousness nothing between or of likeness or of nearness or of simultaneousness or of in ness or of on ness or of for ness or of simple with ness or even of mere and ness which last relation would make of however disjointed a world otherwise at any rate for that occasion a universe of discourse Now mister Bradley tells us that none of these relations as we actually experience them can possibly be real fifty three My next duty accordingly must be to rescue radical empiricism from mister Bradley Fortunately as it seems to me his general contention that the very notion of relation is unthinkable clearly has been successfully met by many critics fifty four It is a burden to the flesh and an injustice both to readers and to the previous writers to repeat good arguments already printed So in noticing mister Bradley I will confine myself to the interests of radical empiricism solely V The first duty of radical empiricism taking given conjunctions at their face value is to class some of them as more intimate and some as more external When two terms are similar their very natures enter into the relation Being what they are no matter where or when the likeness never can be denied if asserted It continues predicable as long as the terms continue Other relations the where and the when for example seem adventitious The sheet of paper may be off or on the table for example and in either case the relation involves only the outside of its terms Having an outside both of them they contribute by it to the relation It is external the term s inner nature is irrelevant to it Any book any table may fall into the relation which is created pro hac vice not by their existence but by their casual situation It is just because so many of the conjunctions of experience seem so external that a philosophy of pure experience must tend to pluralism in its ontology So far as things have space relations for example we are free to imagine them with different origins even If they could get to be and get into space at all then they may have done so separately Once there however they are additives to one another and with no prejudice to their natures all sorts of space relations may supervene between them The question of how things could come to be anyhow is wholly different from the question what their relations once the being accomplished may consist in mister Bradley now affirms that such external relations as the space relations which we here talk of must hold of entirely different subjects from those of which the absence of such relations might a moment previously have been plausibly asserted Not only is the situation different when the book is on the table but the book itself is different as a book from what it was when it was off the table fifty five He admits that such external relations seem possible and even existing That you do not alter what you compare or rearrange in space seems to common sense quite obvious and that on the other side there are as obvious difficulties does not occur to common sense at all And I will begin by pointing out these difficulties There is a relation in the result and this relation we hear is to make no difference in its terms But if so to what does it make a difference Doesn t it make a difference to us onlookers at least and what is the meaning and sense of qualifying the terms by it Surely the meaning is to tell the truth about their relative position fifty six If in short it is external to the terms how can it possibly be true of them Is it the intimacy suggested by the little word of here which I have underscored that is the root of mister Bradley s trouble If the terms from their inner nature do not enter into the relation then so far as they are concerned they seem related for no reason at all Things are spatially related first in one way and then become related in another way and yet in no way themselves are altered for the relations it is said are but external But I reply that if so I can not understand the leaving by the terms of one set of relations and their adoption of another fresh set The process and its result to the terms if they contribute nothing to it Surely they contribute to it all there is of it seem irrational throughout If irrational here means simply non rational or nondeductible from the essence of either term singly it is no reproach if it means contradicting such essence mister Bradley should show wherein and how But if they contribute anything they must surely be affected internally Why so if they contribute only their surface In such relations as on a foot away between next et cetera only surfaces are in question If the terms contribute anything whatever then the terms are affected inwardly altered by the arrangement That for working purposes we treat and do well to treat some relations as external merely I do not deny and that of course is not the question at issue here That question is whether in the end and in principle a mere external relation i e a relation which can change without forcing its terms to change their nature simultaneously is possible and forced on us by the facts fifty seven mister Bradley next reverts to the antinomies of space which according to him prove it to be unreal although it appears as so prolific a medium of external relations and he then concludes that Irrationality and externality can not be the last truth about things Somewhere there must be a reason why this and that appear together And this reason and reality must reside in the whole from which terms and relations are abstractions a whole in which their internal connection must lie and out of which from the background appear those fresh results which never could have come from the premises And he adds that Where the whole is different the terms that qualify and contribute to it must so far be different They are altered so far only How far farther than externally yet not through and through but still they are altered I must insist that in each case the terms are qualified by their whole Qualified how Do their external relations situations dates et cetera changed as these are in the new whole fail to qualify them far enough and that in the second case there is a whole which differs both logically and psychologically from the first whole and I urge that in contributing to the change the terms so far are altered Not merely the relations then but the terms are altered und zwar so far But just how far is the whole problem and through and through would seem in spite of mister Bradley s somewhat undecided utterances fifty eight to be the full Bradleyan answer The whole which he here treats as primary and determinative of each part s manner of contributing simply must when it alters alter in its entirety There must be total conflux of its parts each into and through each other The must appears here as a Machtspruch as an ipse dixit of mister Bradley s absolutistically tempered understanding for he candidly confesses that how the parts do differ as they contribute to different wholes is unknown to him fifty nine Although I have every wish to comprehend the authority by which mister Bradley s understanding speaks his words leave me wholly unconverted External relations stand with their withers all unwrung and remain for aught he proves to the contrary not only practically workable but also perfectly intelligible factors of reality VI mister Bradley s understanding shows the most extraordinary power of perceiving separations and the most extraordinary impotence in comprehending conjunctions One would naturally say neither or both but not so mister Bradley When a common man analyzes certain whats from out the stream of experience he understands their distinctness as thus isolated But this does not prevent him from equally well understanding their combination with each other as originally experienced in the concrete or their confluence with new sensible experiences in which they recur as the same Returning into the stream of sensible presentation nouns and adjectives and thats and abstract whats grow confluent again and the word is names all these experiences of conjunction mister Bradley understands the isolation of the abstracts but to understand the combination is to him impossible sixty To understand a complex AB he says I must begin with A or B And beginning say with A if I then merely find B I have either lost A or I have got beside A the word beside seems here vital as meaning a conjunction external and therefore unintelligible something else and in neither case have I understood sixty one For my intellect can not simply unite a diversity nor has it in itself any form or way of togetherness and you gain nothing if beside A and B you offer me their conjunction in fact For to my intellect that is no more than another external element And facts once for all are for my intellect not true unless they satisfy it The intellect has in its nature no principle of mere togetherness sixty two Of course mister Bradley has a right to define intellect as the power by which we perceive separations but not unions provided he give due notice to the reader But why then claim that such a maimed and amputated power must reign supreme in philosophy and accuse on its behoof the whole empirical world of irrationality It is true that he elsewhere attributes to the intellect a proprius motus of transition but says that when he looks for these transitions in the detail of living experience he is unable to verify such a solution sixty three Yet he never explains what the intellectual transitions would be like in case we had them He only defines them negatively they are not spatial temporal predicative or causal or qualitatively or otherwise serial or in any way relational as we naively trace relations for relations separate terms and need themselves to be hooked on ad infinitum The nearest approach he makes to describing a truly intellectual transition is where he speaks of A and B as being united each from its own nature in a whole which is the nature of both alike sixty four But this which pace mister Bradley seems exquisitely analogous to taking a congeries in a lump if not to swamping suggests nothing but that conflux which pure experience so abundantly offers as when space white and sweet are confluent in a lump of sugar or kinesthetic dermal and optical sensations confluent in my hand sixty five All that I can verify in the transitions which mister Bradley s intellect desiderates as its proprius motus is a reminiscence of these and other sensible conjunctions especially space conjunctions but a reminiscence so vague that its originals are not recognized Bradley in short repeats the fable of the dog the bone and its image in the water With a world of particulars given in loveliest union in conjunction definitely various and variously definite the how of which you understand as soon as you see the fact of them sixty six for there is no how except the constitution of the fact as given with all this given him I say in pure experience he asks for some ineffable union in the abstract instead which if he gained it would only be a duplicate of what he has already in his full possession Surely he abuses the privilege which society grants to all us philosophers of being puzzle headed Polemic writing like this is odious but with absolutism in possession in so many quarters omission to defend my radical empiricism against its best known champion would count as either superficiality or inability I have to conclude that its dialectic has not invalidated in the least degree the usual conjunctions by which the world as experienced hangs so variously together In particular it leaves an empirical theory of knowledge sixty seven intact and lets us continue to believe with common sense that one object may be known if we have any ground for thinking that it is known to many knowers In the next essay I shall return to this last supposition which seems to me to offer other difficulties much harder for a philosophy of pure experience to deal with than any of absolutism s dialectic objections FOOTNOTES forty three Reprinted from The

us At a railway station we may take our own train and not the one that fills our window to be moving We here put motion in the wrong place in the world but in its original place the motion is a part of reality What mister Bradley means is nothing like this but rather that such things as motion are nowhere real and that even in their aboriginal and empirically incorrigible seats relations are impossible of comprehension fifty four Particularly so by Andrew Seth Pringle Pattison in his Man and the Cosmos by L T Hobhouse in chapter XII The Validity of Judgment of his Theory of Knowledge and

slip from logical into physical situations Of course if the table be wet it will moisten the book or if it be slight enough and the book heavy enough the book will break it down But such collateral phenomena are not the point at issue The point is whether the successive relations on and not on can rationally not physically hold of the same constant terms abstractly taken Professor A E Taylor

Metaphysics p one hundred forty five Note the substitution for related of the word affected which begs the whole question fifty six But is there any sense asks mister Bradley peevishly on p five hundred seventy nine and if so what sense in truth that is only outside and about things Surely such a question may be left unanswered fifty seven Appearance and Reality second edition pp five hundred seventy five five hundred seventy six fifty eight I say undecided because apart from the so far which sounds terribly half hearted there are passages in these very pages in which mister Bradley admits the pluralistic thesis Read for example what he says on p five hundred seventy eight of a billiard ball keeping its character unchanged though in its change of place its existence gets altered or what he says on p five hundred seventy nine of the possibility that an abstract quality A B or C in a thing may throughout remain unchanged although the thing be altered or his admission that in red hairedness both as analyzed out of a man and when given with the rest of him there may be no change p five hundred eighty Why does he immediately add that for the pluralist to plead the non mutation of such abstractions would be an ignoratio elenchi It is impossible to admit it to be such The entire elenchus and inquest is just as to whether parts which you can abstract from existing wholes can also contribute to other wholes without changing their inner nature If they can thus mould various wholes into new gestaltqualitaeten then it follows that the same elements are logically able to exist in different wholes whether physically able would depend on additional hypotheses that partial changes are thinkable and through and through change not a dialectic necessity that monism is only an hypothesis and that an additively constituted universe is a rationally respectable hypothesis also All the theses of radical empiricism in short follow fifty nine Op cit pp five hundred seventy seven five hundred seventy nine sixty So far as I catch his state of mind it is somewhat like this Book table on how does the existence of these three abstract elements result in this book being livingly on this table Why isn t the table on the book Or why doesn t the on connect itself with another book or something that is not a table Mustn t something in each of the three elements already determine the two others to it so that they do not settle elsewhere or float vaguely Mustn t the whole fact be pre figured in each part and exist de jure before it can exist de facto But if so in what can the jural existence consist if not in a spiritual miniature of the whole fact s constitution actuating every partial factor as its purpose But is this anything but the old metaphysical fallacy of looking behind a fact in esse for the ground of the fact and finding it in the shape of the very same fact in posse Somewhere we must leave off with a constitution behind which there is nothing sixty one Apply this to the case of book on table W J sixty two Op cit pp five hundred seventy five hundred seventy two sixty three Op cit pp five hundred sixty eight five hundred sixty nine sixty four Op cit p five

be related again to each Both Bradley op cit pp thirty two thirty three and Royce The World and the Individual vol I p one hundred twenty eight lovingly repeat this piece of profundity sixty six The why and the whence are entirely other questions not under discussion as I understand mister Bradley Not how experience gets itself born but how it can be what it is after it is born is the puzzle sixty seven Above p fifty two IV HOW TWO MINDS CAN KNOW ONE THING sixty eight In the essay entitled Does Consciousness Exist I have tried to show that when we call an experience conscious that does not mean that it is suffused throughout with a peculiar modality of being psychic being as stained glass may be suffused with light but rather that it stands in certain determinate relations to other portions of experience extraneous to itself These form one peculiar context for it while taken in another context of experiences we class it as a fact in the physical world This pen for example is in the first instance a bald that a datum fact phenomenon content or whatever other neutral or ambiguous name you may prefer to apply I called it in that article a pure experience To get classed either as a physical pen or as some one s percept of a pen it must assume a function and that can only happen in a more complicated world So far as in that world it is a stable feature holds ink marks paper and obeys the guidance of a hand it is a physical pen That is what we mean by being physical in a pen So far as it is instable on the contrary coming and going with the movements of my eyes altering with what I call my fancy continuous with subsequent experiences of its having been in the past tense it is the percept of a pen in my mind Those peculiarities are what we mean by being conscious in a pen In Section VI of another essay sixty nine I tried to show that the same that the same numerically identical pen of pure experience can enter simultaneously into many conscious contexts or in other words be an object for many different minds I admitted that I had not space to treat of certain possible objections in that article but in the last essay I took some of the objections up At the end of that essay I said that still more formidable sounding objections remained so to leave my pure experience theory in as strong a state as possible I propose to consider those objections now I The objections I previously tried to dispose of were purely logical or dialectical No one identical term whether physical or psychical it had been said could be the subject of two relations at once This thesis I sought to prove unfounded The objections that now confront us arise from the nature supposed to inhere in psychic facts specifically Whatever may be the case with physical objects a fact of consciousness it is alleged and indeed very plausibly can not without self contradiction be treated as a portion of two different minds and for the following reasons In the physical world we make with impunity the assumption that one and the same material object can figure in an indefinitely large number of different processes at once When for instance a sheet of rubber is pulled at its four corners a unit of rubber in the middle of the sheet is affected by all four of the pulls It transmits them each as if it pulled in four different ways at once itself So an air particle or an ether particle compounds the different directions of movement imprinted on it without obliterating their several individualities It delivers them distinct on the contrary at as many several receivers ear eye or what not as may be tuned to that effect The apparent paradox of a distinctness like this surviving in the midst of compounding is a thing which I fancy the analyses made by physicists have by this time sufficiently cleared up But if on the strength of these analogies one should ask Why if two or more lines can run through one and the same geometrical point or if two or more distinct processes of activity can run through one and the same physical thing so that it simultaneously plays a role in each and every process might not two or more streams of personal consciousness include one and the same unit of experience so that it would simultaneously be a part of the experience of all the different minds one would be checked by thinking of a certain peculiarity by which phenomena of consciousness differ from physical things While physical things namely are supposed to be permanent and to have their states a fact of consciousness exists but once and is a state Its esse is sentiri it is only so far as it is felt and it is unambiguously and unequivocally exactly what is felt The hypothesis under consideration would however oblige it to be felt equivocally felt now as part of my mind and again at the same time not as a part of my mind but of yours for my mind is not yours and this would seem impossible without doubling it into two distinct things or in other words without reverting to the ordinary dualistic philosophy of insulated minds each knowing its object representatively as a third thing and that would be to give up the pure experience scheme altogether Can we see then any way in which a unit of pure experience might enter into and figure in two diverse streams of consciousness without turning itself into the two units which on our hypothesis it must not be II There is a way and the first step towards it is to see more precisely how the unit enters into either one of the streams of consciousness alone Just what from being pure does its becoming conscious once mean It means first that new experiences have supervened and second that they have borne a certain assignable relation to the unit supposed Continue if you please to speak of the pure unit as the pen So far as the pen s successors do but repeat the pen or being different from it are energetically seventy related to it it and they will form a group of stably existing physical things So far however as its successors differ from it in another well determined way the pen will figure in their context not as a physical but as a mental fact It will become a passing percept my percept of that pen What now is that decisive well determined way In the chapter on The Self in my Principles of Psychology I explained the continuous identity of each personal consciousness as a name for the practical fact that new experiences seventy one come which look back on the old ones find them warm and greet and appropriate them as mine These operations mean when analyzed empirically several tolerably definite things viz one That the new experience has past time for its content and in that time a pen that was two That warmth was also about the pen in the sense of a group of feelings interest aroused attention turned eyes employed et cetera that were closely connected with it and that now recur and evermore recur with unbroken vividness though from the pen of now which may be only an image all such vividness may have gone three That these feelings are the nucleus of me four That whatever once was associated with them was at least for that one moment mine my implement if associated with hand feelings my percept only if only eye feelings and attention feelings were involved The pen realized in this retrospective way as my percept thus figures as a fact of conscious life But it does so only so far as appropriation has occurred and appropriation is part of the content of a later experience wholly additional to the originally pure pen That pen virtually both objective and subjective is at its own moment actually and intrinsically neither It has to be looked back upon and used in order to be classed in either distinctive way But its use so called is in the hands of the other experience while it stands throughout the operation passive and unchanged If this pass muster as an intelligible account of how an experience originally pure can enter into one consciousness the next question is as to how it might conceivably enter into two III Obviously no new kind of condition would have to be supplied All that we should have to postulate would be a second subsequent experience collateral and contemporary with the first subsequent one in which a similar act of appropriation should occur The two acts would interfere neither with one another nor with the originally pure pen It would sleep undisturbed in its own past no matter how many such successors went through their several appropriative acts Each would know it as my percept each would class it as a conscious fact Nor need their so classing it interfere in the least with their classing it at the same time as a physical pen Since the classing in both cases depends upon the taking of it in one group or another of associates if the superseding experience were of wide enough span it could think the pen in both groups simultaneously and yet distinguish the two groups It would then see the whole situation conformably to what we call the representative theory of cognition and that is what we all spontaneously do As a man philosophizing popularly I believe that what I see myself writing with is double I think it in its relations to physical nature and also in its relations to my personal life I see that it is in my mind but that it also is a physical pen The paradox of the same experience figuring in two consciousnesses seems thus no paradox at all To be conscious means not simply to be but to be reported known to have awareness of one s being added to that being and this is just what happens when the appropriative experience supervenes The pen experience in its original immediacy is not aware of itself it simply is and the second experience is required for what we call awareness of it to occur seventy two The difficulty of understanding what happens here is therefore not a logical difficulty there is no contradiction involved It is an ontological difficulty rather Experiences come on an enormous scale and if we take them all together they come in a chaos of incommensurable relations that we can not straighten out We have to abstract different groups of them and handle these separately if we are to talk of them at all But how the experiences ever get themselves made or why their characters and relations are just such as appear we can not begin to understand Granting however that by hook or crook they can get themselves made and can appear in the successions that I have so schematically described then we have to confess that even although as I began by quoting from the adversary a feeling only is as it is felt there is still nothing absurd in the notion of its being felt in two different ways at once as yours namely and as mine It is indeed mine only as it is felt as mine and yours only as it is felt as yours But it is felt as neither by itself but only when owned by our two several remembering experiences just as one undivided estate is owned by several heirs IV One word now before I close about the corollaries of the views set forth Since the acquisition of conscious quality on the part of an experience depends upon a context coming to it it follows that the sum total of all experiences having no context can not strictly be called conscious at all It is a that an Absolute a pure experience on an enormous scale undifferentiated and undifferentiable into thought and thing This the post Kantian idealists have always practically acknowledged by calling their doctrine an Identitaetsphilosophie The question of the Beseelung of the All of things ought not then even to be asked No more ought the question of its truth to be asked for truth is a relation inside of the sum total obtaining between thoughts and something else and thoughts as we have seen can only be contextual things In these respects the pure experiences of our philosophy are in themselves considered so many little absolutes the philosophy of pure experience being only a more comminuted Identitaetsphilosophie seventy three Meanwhile a pure experience can be postulated with any amount whatever of span or field If it exert the retrospective and appropriative function on any other piece of experience the latter thereby enters into its own conscious stream And in this operation time intervals make no essential difference After sleeping my retrospection is as perfect as it is between two successive waking moments of my time Accordingly if millions of years later a similarly retrospective experience should anyhow come to birth my present thought would form a genuine portion of its long span conscious life Form a portion I say but not in the sense that the two things could be entitatively or substantively one they cannot for they are numerically discrete facts but only in the sense that the functions of my present thought its knowledge its purpose its content and consciousness in short being inherited would be continued practically unchanged Speculations like Fechner s of an Earth soul of wider spans of consciousness enveloping narrower ones throughout the cosmos are therefore philosophically quite in order provided they distinguish the functional from the entitative point of view and do not treat the minor consciousness under discussion as a kind of standing material of which the wider ones consist seventy four

911_128684_000004_000000	train-clean-100	Common sense and popular philosophy are as dualistic as it is possible to be 
911_128684_000004_000001	train-clean-100	Thoughts we all naturally think are made of one kind of substance and things of another 
911_128684_000004_000002	train-clean-100	Consciousness flowing inside of us in the forms of conception or judgment or concentrating itself in the shape of passion or emotion can be directly felt as the spiritual activity which it is and known in contrast with the space filling objective content which it envelopes and accompanies 
none	none	In opposition to this dualistic philosophy I tried in the first essay to show that thoughts and things are absolutely homogeneous as to their material and that their opposition is only one of relation and of function There is no thought stuff different from thing stuff I said but the same identical piece of pure experience which was the name I gave to the materia prima of everything can stand alternately for a fact of consciousness or for a physical reality according as it is taken in one context or in another For the right understanding of what follows I shall have to presuppose that the reader will have read that essay seventy six The commonest objection which the doctrine there laid down runs up against is drawn from the existence of our affections In our pleasures and pains our loves and fears and angers in the beauty comicality importance or preciousness of certain objects and situations we have I am told by many critics a great realm of experience intuitively recognized as spiritual made and felt to be made of consciousness exclusively and different in nature from the space filling kind of being which is enjoyed by physical objects 
911_128684_000005_000001	train-clean-100	In Section VII of the first essay I treated of this class of experiences very inadequately because I had to be so brief 
911_128684_000005_000002	train-clean-100	I now return to the subject because I believe that so far from invalidating my general thesis these phenomena when properly analyzed afford it powerful support 
911_128684_000006_000000	train-clean-100	The central point of the pure experience theory is that outer and inner are names for two groups into which we sort experiences according to the way in which they act upon their neighbors 
none	none	Any one content such as hard let us say can be assigned to either group In the outer group it is strong it acts energetically and aggressively 
911_128684_000006_000002	train-clean-100	Here whatever is hard interferes with the space its neighbors occupy 
911_128684_000006_000003	train-clean-100	It dents them is impenetrable by them and we call the hardness then a physical hardness 
none	none	In the mind on the contrary the hard thing is nowhere in particular it dents nothing it suffuses through its mental neighbors as it were and interpenetrates them Taken in this group we call both it and them ideas or sensations and the basis of the two groups respectively is the different type of interrelation the mutual impenetrability on the one hand and the lack of physical interference and interaction on the other That what in itself is one and the same entity should be able to function thus differently in different contexts is a natural consequence of the extremely complex reticulations in which our experiences come 
911_128684_000007_000001	train-clean-100	To her offspring a tigress is tender but cruel to every other living thing both cruel and tender therefore at once 
none	none	A mass in movement resists every force that operates contrariwise to its own direction but to forces that pursue the same direction or come in at right angles it is absolutely inert 
911_128684_000007_000003	train-clean-100	It is thus both energetic and inert and the same is true if you vary the associates properly of every other piece of experience 
911_128684_000007_000004	train-clean-100	It is only towards certain specific groups of associates that the physical energies as we call them of a content are put forth In another group it may be quite inert 
911_128684_000008_000000	train-clean-100	It is possible to imagine a universe of experiences in which the only alternative between neighbors would be either physical interaction or complete inertness 
none	none	In such a world the mental or the physical status of any piece of experience would be unequivocal 
911_128684_000008_000002	train-clean-100	When active it would figure in the physical and when inactive in the mental group 
911_128684_000009_000000	train-clean-100	But the universe we live in is more chaotic than this and there is room in it for the hybrid or ambiguous group of our affectional experiences of our emotions and appreciative perceptions 
911_128684_000009_000001	train-clean-100	In the paragraphs that follow I shall try to show 
911_128684_000010_000000	train-clean-100	 one That the popular notion that these experiences are intuitively given as purely inner facts is hasty and erroneous and
none	none	 two That their ambiguity illustrates beautifully my central thesis that subjectivity and objectivity are affairs not of what an experience is aboriginally made of but of its classification 
911_128684_000011_000001	train-clean-100	Classifications depend on our temporary purposes 
none	none	For certain purposes it is convenient to take things in one set of relations for other purposes in another set 
911_128684_000011_000003	train-clean-100	In the two cases their contexts are apt to be different 
none	none	In the case of our affectional experiences we have no permanent and steadfast purpose that obliges us to be consistent so we find it easy to let them float ambiguously sometimes classing them with our feelings sometimes with more physical realities according to caprice or to the convenience of the moment 
911_128684_000011_000005	train-clean-100	Thus would these experiences so far from being an obstacle to the pure experience philosophy serve as an excellent corroboration of its truth 
911_128684_000012_000000	train-clean-100	First of all then it is a mistake to say with the objectors whom I began by citing that anger love and fear are affections purely of the mind 
none	none	That to a great extent at any rate they are simultaneously affections of the body is proved by the whole literature of the James Lange theory of emotion seventy seven All our pains moreover are local and we are always free to speak of them in objective as well as in subjective terms 
911_128684_000012_000002	train-clean-100	We can say that we are aware of a painful place filling a certain bigness in our organism or we can say that we are inwardly in a state of pain 
none	none	All our adjectives of worth are similarly ambiguous I instanced some of the ambiguities in the first essay seventy eight Is the preciousness of a diamond a quality of the gem or is it a feeling in our mind Practically we treat it as both or as either according to the temporary direction of our thought Beauty says Professor Santayana is pleasure objectified and in Sections ten and eleven of his work The Sense of Beauty he treats in a masterly way of this equivocal realm The various pleasures we receive from an object may count as feelings when we take them singly but when they combine in a total richness we call the result the beauty of the object and treat it as an outer attribute which our mind perceives 
911_128684_000012_000007	train-clean-100	We discover beauty just as we discover the physical properties of things 
911_128684_000012_000008	train-clean-100	Training is needed to make us expert in either line 
none	none	Single sensations also may be ambiguous 
911_128684_000012_000010	train-clean-100	Shall we say an agreeable degree of heat or an agreeable feeling occasioned by the degree of heat 
911_128684_000012_000011	train-clean-100	Either will do and language would lose most of its esthetic and rhetorical value were we forbidden to project words primarily connoting our affections upon the objects by which the affections are aroused 
911_128684_000012_000012	train-clean-100	The man is really hateful the action really mean the situation really tragic all in themselves and quite apart from our opinion 
911_128684_000012_000013	train-clean-100	We even go so far as to talk of a weary road a giddy height a jocund morning or a sullen sky and the term indefinite while usually applied only to our apprehensions functions as a fundamental physical qualification of things in Spencer s law of evolution and doubtless passes with most readers for all right 
911_128684_000013_000000	train-clean-100	Psychologists studying our perceptions of movement have unearthed experiences in which movement is felt in general but not ascribed correctly to the body that really moves 
none	none	Thus in optical vertigo caused by unconscious movements of our eyes both we and the external universe appear to be in a whirl 
911_128684_000013_000002	train-clean-100	When clouds float by the moon it is as if both clouds and moon and we ourselves shared in the motion 
911_128684_000013_000003	train-clean-100	In the extraordinary case of amnesia of the reverend 
none	none	mister Hanna published by Sidis and Goodhart in their important work on Multiple Personality we read that when the patient first recovered consciousness and noticed an attendant walk across the room he identified the movement with that of his own He did not yet discriminate between his own movements and those outside himself seventy nine Such experiences point to a primitive stage of perception in which discriminations afterwards needful have not yet been made 
911_128684_000013_000006	train-clean-100	A piece of experience of a determinate sort is there but there at first as a pure fact 
none	none	Motion originally simply is only later is it confined to this thing or to that 
911_128684_000013_000008	train-clean-100	Something like this is true of every experience however complex at the moment of its actual presence 
911_128684_000013_000009	train-clean-100	Let the reader arrest himself in the act of reading this article now 
none	none	Now this is a pure experience a phenomenon or datum a mere that or content of fact Reading simply is is there and whether there for some one s consciousness or there for physical nature is a question not yet put 
911_128684_000013_000012	train-clean-100	At the moment it is there for neither later we shall probably judge it to have been there for both 
911_128684_000014_000000	train-clean-100	With the affectional experiences which we are considering the relatively pure condition lasts 
911_128684_000014_000001	train-clean-100	In practical life no urgent need has yet arisen for deciding whether to treat them as rigorously mental or as rigorously physical facts 
911_128684_000014_000002	train-clean-100	So they remain equivocal and as the world goes their equivocality is one of their great conveniences 
none	none	The shifting place of secondary qualities in the history of philosophy eighty is another excellent proof of the fact that inner and outer are not coefficients with which experiences come to us aboriginally stamped but are rather results of a later classification performed by us for particular needs 
911_128684_000015_000001	train-clean-100	The common sense stage of thought is a perfectly definite practical halting place the place where we ourselves can proceed to act unhesitatingly 
911_128684_000015_000002	train-clean-100	On this stage of thought things act on each other as well as on us by means of their secondary qualities 
none	none	Sound as such goes through the air and can be intercepted The heat of the fire passes over as such into the water which it sets a boiling 
911_128684_000015_000004	train-clean-100	It is the very light of the arc lamp which displaces the darkness of the midnight street et cetera 
911_128684_000015_000005	train-clean-100	By engendering and translocating just these qualities actively efficacious as they seem to be we ourselves succeed in altering nature so as to suit us and until more purely intellectual as distinguished from practical needs had arisen no one ever thought of calling these qualities subjective 
none	none	When however Galileo Descartes and others found it best for philosophic purposes to class sound heat and light along with pain and pleasure as purely mental phenomena they could do so with impunity eighty one 
911_128684_000016_000000	train-clean-100	Even the primary qualities are undergoing the same fate 
911_128684_000016_000001	train-clean-100	Hardness and softness are effects on us of atomic interactions and the atoms themselves are neither hard nor soft nor solid nor liquid 
none	none	Size and shape are deemed subjective by Kantians time itself is subjective according to many philosophers eighty two and even the activity and causal efficacy which lingered in physics long after secondary qualities were banished are now treated as illusory projections outwards of phenomena of our own consciousness There are no activities or effects in nature for the most intellectual contemporary school of physical speculation Nature exhibits only changes which habitually coincide with one another so that their habits are describable in simple laws eighty three 
911_128684_000017_000000	train-clean-100	There is no original spirituality or materiality of being intuitively discerned then but only a translocation of experiences from one world to another a grouping of them with one set or another of associates for definitely practical or intellectual ends 
none	none	I will say nothing here of the persistent ambiguity of relations 
911_128684_000018_000001	train-clean-100	They are undeniable parts of pure experience yet while common sense and what I call radical empiricism stand for their being objective both rationalism and the usual empiricism claim that they are exclusively the work of the mind the finite mind or the absolute mind as the case may be 
911_128684_000019_000000	train-clean-100	Turn now to those affective phenomena which more directly concern us 
none	none	We soon learn to separate the ways in which things appeal to our interests and emotions from the ways in which they act upon one another It does not work to assume that physical objects are going to act outwardly by their sympathetic or antipathetic qualities 
911_128684_000020_000001	train-clean-100	The beauty of a thing or its value is no force that can be plotted in a polygon of compositions nor does its use or significance affect in the minutest degree its vicissitudes or destiny at the hands of physical nature 
911_128684_000020_000002	train-clean-100	Chemical affinities are a purely verbal metaphor and as I just said even such things as forces tensions and activities can at a pinch be regarded as anthropomorphic projections 
911_128684_000020_000003	train-clean-100	So far then as the physical world means the collection of contents that determine in each other certain regular changes the whole collection of our appreciative attributes has to be treated as falling outside of it 
911_128684_000020_000004	train-clean-100	If we mean by physical nature whatever lies beyond the surface of our bodies these attributes are inert throughout the whole extent of physical nature 
911_128684_000021_000000	train-clean-100	Why then do men leave them as ambiguous as they do and not class them decisively as purely spiritual 
911_128684_000022_000000	train-clean-100	The reason would seem to be that although they are inert as regards the rest of physical nature they are not inert as regards that part of physical nature which our own skin covers 
911_128684_000022_000001	train-clean-100	It is those very appreciative attributes of things their dangerousness beauty rarity utility et cetera that primarily appeal to our attention 
none	none	In our commerce with nature these attributes are what give emphasis to objects and for an object to be emphatic whatever spiritual fact it may mean means also that it produces immediate bodily effects upon us alterations of tone and tension of heart beat and breathing of vascular and visceral action 
911_128684_000022_000003	train-clean-100	The interesting aspects of things are thus not wholly inert physically though they be active only in these small corners of physical nature which our bodies occupy 
911_128684_000022_000004	train-clean-100	That however is enough to save them from being classed as absolutely non objective 
none	none	The attempt if any one should make it to sort experiences into two absolutely discrete groups with nothing but inertness in one of them and nothing but activities in the other would thus receive one check It would receive another as soon as we examined the more distinctively mental group for though in that group it be true that things do not act on one another by their physical properties do not dent each other or set fire to each other they yet act on each other in the most energetic way by those very characters which are so inert extracorporeally 
911_128684_000023_000001	train-clean-100	It is by the interest and importance that experiences have for us by the emotions they excite and the purposes they subserve by their affective values in short that their consecution in our several conscious streams as thoughts of ours is mainly ruled 
911_128684_000023_000002	train-clean-100	Desire introduces them interest holds them fitness fixes their order and connection 
none	none	I need only refer for this aspect of our mental life to Wundt s article Ueber psychische Causalitaet which begins Volume X of his Philosophische Studien eighty four It thus appears that the ambiguous or amphibious status which we find our epithets of value occupying is the most natural thing in the world It would however be an unnatural status if the popular opinion which I cited at the outset were correct 
911_128684_000024_000001	train-clean-100	If physical and mental meant two different kinds of intrinsic nature immediately intuitively and infallibly discernible and each fixed forever in whatever bit of experience it qualified one does not see how there could ever have arisen any room for doubt or ambiguity 
911_128684_000024_000002	train-clean-100	But if on the contrary these words are words of sorting ambiguity is natural 
911_128684_000024_000003	train-clean-100	For then as soon as the relations of a thing are sufficiently various it can be sorted variously 
none	none	Take a mass of carrion for example and the disgustingness which for us is part of the experience 
911_128684_000024_000005	train-clean-100	The sun caresses it and the zephyr wooes it as if it were a bed of roses 
none	none	So the disgustingness fails to operate within the realm of suns and breezes it does not function as a physical quality But the carrion turns our stomach by what seems a direct operation it does function physically therefore in that limited part of physics We can treat it as physical or as non physical according as we take it in the narrower or in the wider context and conversely of course we must treat it as non mental or as mental 
911_128684_000025_000000	train-clean-100	Our body itself is the palmary instance of the ambiguous 
911_128684_000025_000001	train-clean-100	Sometimes I treat my body purely as a part of outer nature 
911_128684_000025_000002	train-clean-100	Sometimes again I think of it as mine I sort it with the me and then certain local changes and determinations in it pass for spiritual happenings 
none	none	Its breathing is my thinking its sensorial adjustments are my attention its kinesthetic alterations are my efforts its visceral perturbations are my emotions The obstinate controversies that have arisen over such statements as these which sound so paradoxical and which can yet be made so seriously prove how hard it is to decide by bare introspection what it is in experiences that shall make them either spiritual or material 
911_128684_000025_000004	train-clean-100	It surely can be nothing intrinsic in the individual experience 
911_128684_000025_000005	train-clean-100	It is their way of behaving towards each other their system of relations their function and all these things vary with the context in which we find it opportune to consider them 
none	none	I think I may conclude then and I hope that my readers are now ready to conclude with me that the pretended spirituality of our emotions and of our attributes of value so far from proving an objection to the philosophy of pure experience does when rightly discussed and accounted for serve as one of its best corroborations FOOTNOTES seventy five Reprinted from The Journal of Philosophy

farther reflections on the subject in my address on The Experience of Activity The next essay Cf especially p one hundred sixty nine ED VI THE EXPERIENCE OF ACTIVITY eighty five BRETHREN OF THE PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION In casting about me for a subject for your President this year to talk about it has seemed to me that our experiences of activity would form a good one not only because the topic is so naturally interesting and because it has lately led to a good deal of rather inconclusive discussion but because I myself am growing more and more interested in a certain systematic way of handling questions and want to get others interested also and this question strikes me as one in which although I am painfully aware of my inability to communicate new discoveries or to reach definitive conclusions I yet can show in a rather definite manner how the method works The way of handling things I speak of is as you already will have suspected that known sometimes as the pragmatic method sometimes as humanism sometimes as Deweyism and in France by some of the disciples of Bergson as the Philosophie nouvelle Professor Woodbridge s Journal of Philosophy eighty six seems unintentionally to have become a sort of meeting place for those who follow these tendencies in America There is only a dim identity among them and the most that can be said at present is that some sort of gestation seems to be in the atmosphere and that almost any day a man with a genius for finding the right word for things may hit upon some unifying and conciliating formula that will make so much vaguely similar aspiration crystallize into more definite form I myself have given the name of radical empiricism to that version of the tendency in question which I prefer and I propose if you will now let me to illustrate what I mean by radical empiricism by applying it to activity as an example hoping at the same time incidentally to leave the general problem of activity in a slightly I fear very slightly more manageable shape than before mister Bradley calls the question of activity a scandal to philosophy and if one turns to the current literature of the subject his own writings included one easily gathers what he means The opponents cannot even understand one another mister Bradley says to mister Ward I do not care what your oracle is and your preposterous psychology may here be gospel if you please but if the revelation does contain a meaning I will commit myself to this either the oracle is so confused that its signification is not discoverable or upon the other hand if it can be pinned down to any definite statement then that statement will be false eighty seven mister Ward in turn says of mister Bradley I cannot even imagine the state of mind to which his description applies It reads like an unintentional travesty of Herbartian psychology by one who has tried to improve upon it without being at the pains to master it eighty eight Muensterberg excludes a view opposed to his own by saying that with any one who holds it a Verstaendigung with him is grundsaetzlich ausgeschlossen and Royce in a review of Stout eighty nine hauls him over the coals at great length for defending efficacy in a way which I for one never gathered from reading him and which I have heard Stout himself say was quite foreign to the intention of his text In these discussions distinct questions are habitually jumbled and different points of view are talked of durcheinander one There is a psychological question Have we perceptions of activity and if so what are they like and when and where do we have them two There is a metaphysical question Is there a fact of activity and if so what idea must we frame of it What is it like and what does it do if it does anything And finally there is a logical question three Whence do we know activity By our own feelings of it solely or by some other source of information Throughout page after page of the literature one knows not which of these questions is before one and mere description of the surface show of experience is proferred as if it implicitly answered every one of them No one of the disputants moreover tries to show what pragmatic consequences his own view would carry or what assignable particular differences in any one s experience it would make if his adversary s were triumphant It seems to me that if radical empiricism be good for anything it ought with its pragmatic method and its principle of pure experience to be able to avoid such tangles or at least to simplify them somewhat The pragmatic method starts from the postulate that there is no difference of truth that doesn t make a difference of fact somewhere and it seeks to determine the meaning of all differences of opinion by making the discussion hinge as soon as possible upon some practical or particular issue The principle of pure experience is also a methodical postulate Nothing shall be admitted as fact it says except what can be experienced at some definite time by some experient and for every feature of fact ever so experienced a definite place must be found somewhere in the final system of reality In other words Everything real must be experienceable somewhere and every kind of thing experienced must somewhere be real Armed with these rules of method let us see what face the problems of activity present to us By the principle of pure experience either the word activity must have no meaning at all or else the original type and model of what it means must lie in some concrete kind of experience that can be definitely pointed out Whatever ulterior judgments we may eventually come to make regarding activity that sort of thing will be what the judgments are about The first step to take then is to ask where in the stream of experience we seem to find what we speak of as activity What we are to think of the activity thus found will be a later question Now it is obvious that we are tempted to affirm activity wherever we find anything going on Taken in the broadest sense any apprehension of something doing is an experience of activity Were our world describable only by the words nothing happening nothing changing nothing doing we should unquestionably call it an inactive world Bare activity then as we may call it means the bare fact of event or change Change taking place is a unique content of experience one of those conjunctive objects which radical empiricism seeks so earnestly to rehabilitate and preserve The sense of activity is thus in the broadest and vaguest way synonymous with the sense of life We should feel our own subjective life at least even in noticing and proclaiming an otherwise inactive world Our own reaction on its monotony would be the one thing experienced there in the form of something coming to pass This seems to be what certain writers have in mind when they insist that for an experient to be at all is to be active It seems to justify or at any rate to explain mister Ward s expression that we are only as we are active ninety for we are only as experients and it rules out mister Bradley s contention that there is no original experience of anything like activity ninety one What we ought to say about activities thus elementary whose they are what they effect or whether indeed they effect anything at all these are later questions to be answered only when the field of experience is enlarged Bare activity would thus be predicable though there were no definite direction no actor and no aim Mere restless zigzag movement or a wild Ideenflucht or Rhapsodie der Wahrnehmungen as Kant would say ninety two would constitute an active as distinguished from an inactive world But in this actual world of ours as it is given a part at least of the activity comes with definite direction it comes with desire and sense of goal it comes complicated with resistances which it overcomes or succumbs to and with the efforts which the feeling of resistance so often provokes and it is in complex experiences like these that the notions of distinct agents and of passivity as opposed to activity arise Here also the notion of causal efficacy comes to birth Perhaps the most elaborate work ever done in descriptive psychology has been the analysis by various recent writers of the more complex activity situations ninety three In their descriptions exquisitely subtle some of them ninety four the activity appears as the gestaltqualitaet or the fundirte inhalt or as whatever else you may please to call the conjunctive form which the content falls into when we experience it in the ways which the describers set forth Those factors in those relations are what we mean by activity situations and to the possible enumeration and accumulation of their circumstances and ingredients there would seem to be no natural bound Every hour of human life could contribute to the picture gallery and this is the only fault that one can find with such descriptive industry where is it going to stop Ought we to listen forever to verbal pictures of what we have already in concrete form in our own breasts ninety five They never take us off the superficial plane We knew the facts already less spread out and separated to be sure but we knew them still We always felt our own activity for example as the expansion of an idea with which our Self is identified against an obstacle ninety six and the following out of such a definition through a multitude of cases elaborates the obvious so as to be little more than an exercise in synonymic speech All the descriptions have to trace familiar outlines and to use familiar terms The activity is for example attributed either to a physical or to a mental agent and is either aimless or directed If directed it shows tendency The tendency may or may not be resisted If not we call the activity immanent as when a body moves in empty space by its momentum or our thoughts wander at their own sweet will If resistance is met its agent complicates the situation If now in spite of resistance the original tendency continues effort makes its appearance and along with effort strain or squeeze Will in the narrower sense of the word then comes upon the scene whenever along with the tendency the strain and squeeze are sustained But the resistance may be great enough to check the tendency or even to reverse its path In that case we if we were the original agents or subjects of the tendency are overpowered The phenomenon turns into one of tension simply or of necessity succumbed to according as the opposing power is only equal or is superior to ourselves Whosoever describes an experience in such terms as these describes an experience of activity If the word have any meaning it must denote what there is found There is complete activity in its original and first intention What it is known as is what there appears The experiencer of such a situation possesses all that the idea contains He feels the tendency the obstacle the will the strain the triumph or the passive giving up just as he feels the time the space the swiftness or intensity the movement the weight and color the pain and pleasure the complexity or whatever remaining characters the situation may involve He goes through all that ever can be imagined where activity is supposed If we suppose activities to go on outside of our experience it is in forms like these that we must suppose them or else give them some other name for the word activity has no imaginable content whatever save these experiences of process obstruction striving strain or release ultimate qualia as they are of the life given us to be known Were this the end of the matter one might think that whenever we had successfully lived through an activity situation we should have to be permitted without provoking contradiction to say that we had been really active that we had met real resistance and had really prevailed Lotze somewhere says that to be an entity all that is necessary is to gelten as an entity to operate or be felt experienced recognized or in any way realized as such ninety seven In our activity experiences the activity assuredly fulfils Lotze s demand It makes itself gelten It is witnessed at its work No matter what activities there may really be in this extraordinary universe of ours it is impossible for us to conceive of any one of them being either lived through or authentically known otherwise than in this dramatic shape of something sustaining a felt purpose against felt obstacles and overcoming or being overcome What sustaining means here is clear to anyone who has lived through the experience but to no one else just as loud red sweet mean something only to beings with ears eyes and tongues The percipi in these originals of experience is the esse the curtain is the picture If there is anything hiding in the background it ought not to be called activity but should get itself another name This seems so obviously true that one might well experience astonishment at finding so many of the ablest writers on the subject flatly denying that the activity we live through in these situations is real Merely to feel active is not to be active in their sight The agents that appear in the experience are not real agents the resistances do not really resist the effects that appear are not really effects at all ninety eight It is evident from this that mere descriptive analysis of any one of our activity experiences is not the whole story that there is something still to tell about them that has led such able writers to conceive of a Simon pure activity of an activity an sich that does and doesn t merely appear to us to do and compared with whose real doing all this phenomenal activity is but a specious sham The metaphysical question opens here and I think that the state of mind of one possessed by it is often something like this It is all very well we may imagine him saying to talk about certain experience series taking on the form of feelings of activity just as they might take on musical or geometric forms Suppose that they do so suppose we feel a will to stand a strain Does our feeling do more than record the fact that the strain is sustained The real activity meanwhile is the doing of the fact and what is the doing made of before the record is made What in the will enables it to act thus And these trains of experience themselves in which activities appear what makes them go at all Does the activity in one bit of experience bring the next bit into being As an empiricist you cannot say so for you have just declared activity to be only a kind of synthetic object or conjunctive relation experienced between bits of experience already made But what made them at all What propels experience ueberhaupt into being There is the activity that operates the activity felt is only its superficial sign To the metaphysical question popped upon us in this way I must pay serious attention ere I end my remarks but before doing so let me show that without leaving the immediate reticulations of experience or asking what makes activity itself act we still find the distinction between less real and more real activities forced upon us and are driven to much soul searching on the purely phenomenal plane We must not forget namely in talking of the ultimate character of our activity experiences that each of them is but a portion of a wider world one link in the vast chain of processes of experience out of which history is made Each partial process to him who lives through it defines itself by its origin and its goal but to an observer with a wider mind span who should live outside of it that goal would appear but as a provisional halting place and the subjectively felt activity would be seen to continue into objective activities that led far beyond We thus acquire a habit in discussing activity experiences of defining them by their relation to something more If an experience be one of narrow span it will be mistaken as to what activity it is and whose You think that you are acting while you are only obeying someone s push You think you are doing this but you are doing something of which you do not dream For instance you think you are but drinking this glass but you are really creating the liver cirrhosis that will end your days You think you are just driving this bargain but as Stevenson says somewhere you are laying down a link in the policy of mankind Generally speaking the onlooker with his wider field of vision regards the ultimate outcome of an activity as what it is more really doing and the most previous agent ascertainable being the first source of action he regards as the most real agent in the field The others but transmit that agent s impulse on him we put responsibility we name him when one asks us Who s to blame But the most previous agents ascertainable instead of being of longer span are often of much shorter span than the activity in view Brain cells are our best example My brain cells are believed to excite each other from next to next by contiguous transmission of katabolic alteration let us say and to have been doing so long before this present stretch of lecturing activity on my part began If any one cell group stops its activity the lecturing will cease or show disorder of form Cessante causa cessat et effectus does not this look as if the short span brain activities were the more real activities and the lecturing activities on my part only their effects Moreover as Hume so clearly pointed out ninety nine in my mental activity situation the words physically to be uttered are represented as the activity s immediate goal These words however cannot be uttered without intermediate physical processes in the bulb and vagi nerves which processes nevertheless fail to figure in the mental activity series at all That series therefore since it leaves out vitally real steps of action cannot represent the real activities It is something purely subjective the facts of activity are elsewhere They are something far more interstitial so to speak than what my feelings record The real facts of activity that have in point of fact been systematically pleaded for by philosophers have so far as my information goes been of three principal types The first type takes a consciousness of wider time span than ours to be the vehicle of the more real activity Its will is the agent and its purpose is the action done The second type assumes that ideas struggling with one another are the agents and that the prevalence of one set of them is the action The third type believes that nerve cells are the agents and that resultant motor discharges are the acts achieved Now if we must de realize our immediately felt activity situations for the benefit of either of these types of substitute we ought to know what the substitution practically involves What practical difference ought it to make if instead of saying naively that I am active now in delivering this address I say that a wider thinker is active or that certain ideas are active or that certain nerve cells are active in producing the result This would be the pragmatic meaning of the three hypotheses Let us take them in succession in seeking a reply If we assume a wider thinker it is evident that his purposes envelope mine I am really lecturing for him and although I cannot surely know to what end yet if I take him religiously I can trust it to be a good end and willingly connive I can be happy in thinking that my activity transmits his impulse and that his ends prolong my own So long as I take him religiously in short he does not de realize my activities He tends rather to corroborate the reality of them so long as I believe both them and him to be good When now we turn to ideas the case is different inasmuch as ideas are supposed by the association psychology to influence each other only from next to next The span of an idea or pair of ideas is assumed to be much smaller instead of being larger than that of my total conscious field The same results may get worked out in both cases for this address is being given anyhow But the ideas supposed to really work it out had no prevision of the whole of it and if I was lecturing for an absolute thinker in the former case so by similar reasoning are my ideas now lecturing for me that is accomplishing unwittingly a result which I approve and adopt But when this passing lecture is over there is nothing in the bare notion that ideas have been its agents that would seem to guarantee that my present purposes in lecturing will be prolonged I may have ulterior developments in view but there is no certainty that my ideas as such will wish to or be able to work them out The like is true if nerve cells be the agents The activity of a nerve cell must be conceived of as a tendency of exceedingly short reach an impulse barely spanning the way to the next cell for surely that amount of actual process must be experienced by the cells if what happens between them is to deserve the name of activity at all But here again the gross resultant as I perceive it is indifferent to the agents and neither wished or willed or foreseen Their being agents now congruous with my will gives me no guarantee that like results will recur again from their activity In point of fact all sorts of other results do occur My mistakes impotencies perversions mental obstructions and frustrations generally are also results of the activity of cells Although these are letting me lecture now on other occasions they make me do things that I would willingly not do The question Whose is the real activity is thus tantamount to the question What will be the actual results Its interest is dramatic how will things work out If the agents are of one sort one way if of another sort they may work out very differently The pragmatic meaning of the various alternatives in short is great It makes no merely verbal difference which opinion we take up You see it is the old dispute come back Materialism and teleology elementary short span actions summing themselves blindly or far foreseen ideals coming with effort into act Naively we believe and humanly and dramatically we like to believe that activities both of wider and of narrower span are at work in life together that both are real and that the long span tendencies yoke the others in their service encouraging them in the right direction and damping them when they tend in other ways But how to represent clearly the modus operandi of such steering of small tendencies by large ones is a problem which metaphysical thinkers will have to ruminate upon for many years to come Even if such control should eventually grow clearly picturable the question how far it is successfully exerted in this actual world can be answered only by investigating the details of fact No philosophic knowledge of the general nature and constitution of tendencies or of the relation of larger to smaller ones can help us to predict which of all the various competing tendencies that interest us in this universe are likeliest to prevail We know as an empirical fact that far seeing tendencies often carry out their purpose but we know also that they are often defeated by the failure of some contemptibly small process on which success depends A little thrombus in a statesman s meningeal artery will throw an empire out of gear I can therefore not even hint at any solution of the pragmatic issue I have only wished to show you that that issue is what gives the real interest to all inquiries into what kinds of activity may be real Are the forces that really act in the world more foreseeing or more blind As between our activities as we experience them and those of our ideas or of our brain cells the issue is well defined I said a while back one hundred that I should return to the metaphysical question before ending so with a few words about that I will now close my remarks In whatever form we hear this question propounded I think that it always arises from two things a belief that causality must be exerted in activity and a wonder as to how causality is made If we take an activity situation at its face value it seems as if we caught in flagrante delicto the very power that makes facts come and be I now am eagerly striving for example to get this truth which I seem half to perceive into words which shall make it show more clearly If the words come it will seem as if the striving itself had drawn or pulled them into actuality out from the state of merely possible being in which they were How is this feat performed How does the pulling pull How do I get my hold on words not yet existent and when they come by what means have I made them come Really it is the problem of creation for in the end the question is How do I make them be Real activities are those that really make things be without which the things are not and with which they are there Activity so far as we merely feel it on the other hand is only an impression of ours it may be maintained and an impression is for all this way of thinking only a shadow of another fact Arrived at this point I can do little more than indicate the principles on which as it seems to me a radically empirical philosophy is obliged to rely in handling such a dispute If there be real creative activities in being radical empiricism must say somewhere they must be immediately lived Somewhere the that of efficacious causing and the what of it must be experienced in one just as the what and the that of cold are experienced in one whenever a man has the sensation of cold here and now It boots not to say that our sensations are fallible They are indeed but to see the thermometer contradict us when we say it is cold does not abolish cold as a specific nature from the universe Cold is in the arctic circle if not here Even so to feel that our train is moving when the train beside our window moves to see the moon through a telescope come twice as near or to see two pictures as one solid when we look through a stereoscope at them leaves motion nearness and solidity still in being if not here yet each in its proper seat elsewhere And wherever the seat of real causality is as ultimately known for true in nerve processes if you will that cause our feelings of activity as well as the movements which these seem to prompt a philosophy of pure experience can consider the real causation as no other nature of thing than that which even in our most erroneous experiences appears to be at work Exactly what appears there is what we mean by working though we may later come to learn that working was not exactly there Sustaining persevering striving paying with effort as we go hanging on and finally achieving our intention this is action this is effectuation in the only shape in which by a pure experience philosophy the whereabouts of it anywhere can be discussed Here is creation in its first intention here is causality at work one hundred one To treat this offhand as the bare illusory surface of a world whose real causality is an unimaginable ontological principle hidden in the cubic deeps is for the more empirical way of thinking only animism in another shape You explain your given fact by your principle but the principle itself when you look clearly at it turns out to be nothing but a previous little spiritual copy of the fact Away from that one and only kind of fact your mind considering causality can never get one hundred two I conclude then that real effectual causation as an ultimate nature as a category if you like of reality is just what we feel it to be just that kind of conjunction which our own activity series reveal We have the whole butt and being of it in our hands and the healthy thing for philosophy is to leave off grubbing underground for what effects effectuation or what makes action act and to try to solve the concrete questions of where effectuation in this world is located of which things are the true causal agents there and of what the more remote effects consist From this point of view the greater sublimity traditionally attributed to the metaphysical inquiry the grubbing inquiry entirely disappears If we could know what causation really and transcendentally is in itself the only use of the knowledge would be to help us to recognize an actual cause when we had one and so to track the future course of operations more intelligently out The mere abstract inquiry into causation s hidden nature is not more sublime than any other inquiry equally abstract Causation inhabits no more sublime level than anything else It lives apparently in the dirt of the world as well as in the absolute or in man s unconquerable mind The worth and interest of the world consists not in its elements be these elements things or be they the conjunctions of things it exists rather in the dramatic outcome in the whole process and in the meaning of the succession stages which the elements work out My colleague and master Josiah Royce in a page of his review of Stout s Analytic Psychology one hundred three has some fine words on this point with which I cordially agree I cannot agree with his separating the notion of efficacy from that of activity altogether this I understand to be one contention of his for activities are efficacious whenever they are real activities at all But the inner nature both of efficacy and of activity are superficial problems I understand Royce to say and the only point for us in solving them would be their possible use in helping us to solve the far deeper problem of the course and meaning of the world of life Life says our colleague is full of significance of meaning of success and of defeat of hoping and of striving of longing of desire and of inner value It is a total presence that embodies worth To live our own lives better in this presence is the true reason why we wish to know the elements of things so even we psychologists must end on this pragmatic note The urgent problems of activity are thus more concrete They are all problems of the true relation of longer span to shorter span activities When for example a number of ideas to use the name traditional in psychology grow confluent in a larger field of consciousness do the smaller activities still company exist with the wider activities then experienced by the conscious subject And if so do the wide activities accompany the narrow ones inertly or do they exert control Or do they perhaps utterly supplant and replace them and short circuit their effects Again when a mental activity process and a brain cell series of activities both terminate in the same muscular movement does the mental process steer the neural processes or not Or on the other hand does it independently short circuit their effects Such are the questions that we must begin with But so far am I from suggesting any definitive answer to such questions that I hardly yet can put them clearly They lead however into that region of panpsychic and ontologic speculation of which Professors Bergson and Strong have lately enlarged the literature in so able and interesting a way one hundred four The results of these authors seem in many respects dissimilar and I understand than as yet but imperfectly but I cannot help suspecting that the direction of their work is very promising and that they have the hunter s instinct for the fruitful trails FOOTNOTES eighty five President s Address

sense of activity is not looked at in another way an experience of activity at all It is a mere sensation shut up within which you could by no reflection get the idea of activity Whether this experience is or is not later on a character essential to our perception and our idea of activity it as it comes first is not in itself an experience of activity at all It as it comes first is only so for extraneous reasons and only so for an outside observer Bradley Appearance and Reality second edition p six hundred five In dem Taetigkeitsgefuehle liegt an sich nicht der geringste Beweis fuer das Vorhandensein einer psychischen Taetigkeit Muensterberg Grundzuege der Psychologie I could multiply similar quotations and would have introduced some of them into my text to make it more concrete save that the mingling of different points of view in most of these author s discussions not in Muensterberg s make it impossible to disentangle exactly what they mean I am sure in any case to be accused of misrepresenting them totally even in this note by omission of the context so the less I name names and the more I stick to abstract characterization of a merely possible style of opinion the safer it will be And apropos of misunderstandings I may add to this note a complaint on my own account Professor Stout in the excellent chapter on Mental Activity in vol I of his Analytic Psychology takes me to task for identifying spiritual activity with certain muscular feelings and gives quotations to bear him out They are from certain paragraphs on the Self in which my attempt was to show what the central nucleus of the activities that we call ours is Principles of Psychology vol I pp two hundred ninety nine three hundred five I found it in certain intracephalic movements which we habitually oppose as subjective to the activities of the transcorporeal world I sought to show that there is no direct evidence that we feel the activity of an inner spiritual agent as such I should now say the activity of consciousness as such see the first essay Does Consciousness Exist There are in fact three distinguishable activities in the field of discussion the elementary activity involved in the mere that of experience in the fact that something is going on and the farther specification of this something into two whats an activity felt as ours and an activity ascribed to objects Stout as I apprehend him identifies our activity with that of the total experience process and when I circumscribe it as a part thereof accuses me of treating it as a sort of external appendage to itself Stout op cit vol I pp one hundred sixty two one hundred sixty three as if I separated the activity from the process which is active But all the processes in question are active and their activity is inseparable from their being My book raised only the question of which activity deserved the name of ours So far as we are persons and contrasted and opposed to an environment movements in our body figure as our activities and I am unable to find any other activities that are ours in this strictly personal sense There is a wider sense in which the whole choir of heaven and furniture of the earth and their activities are ours for they are our objects But we are here only another name for the total process of experience another name for all that is in fact and I was dealing with the personal and individualized self exclusively in the passages with which Professor Stout finds fault The individualized self which I believe to be the only thing properly called self is a part of the content of the world experienced The world experienced otherwise called the field of consciousness comes at all times with our body as its centre centre of vision centre of action centre of interest Where the body is is here when the body acts is now what the body touches is this all other things are there and then and that These words of emphasized position imply a systematization of things with reference to a focus of action and interest which lies in the body and the systematization is now so instinctive was it ever not so that no developed or active experience exists for us at all except in that ordered form So far as thoughts and feelings can be active their activity terminates in the activity of the body and only through first arousing its activities can they begin to change those of the rest of the world Cf also A Pluralistic Universe p three hundred forty four note eight ED The body is the storm centre the origin of company ordinates the constant place of stress in all that experience train Everything circles round it and is felt from its point of view The word I then is primarily a noun of position just like this and here Activities attached to this position have prerogative emphasis and if activities have feelings must be felt in a peculiar way The word my designates the kind of emphasis I see no inconsistency whatever in defending on the one hand my activities as unique and opposed to those of outer nature and on the other hand in affirming after introspection that they consist in movements in the head The my of them is the emphasis the feeling of perspective interest in which they are dyed ninety nine Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding sect VII part I Selby Bigge s edition pp sixty five ff one hundred Page one hundred seventy two one hundred one Let me not be told that this contradicts the first essay Does Consciousness Exist see especially page thirty two in which it was said that while thoughts and things have the same natures the natures work energetically on each other in the things fire burns water wets et cetera but not in the thoughts Mental activity trains are composed of thoughts yet their members do work on each other they check sustain and introduce They do so when the activity is merely associational as well as when effort is there But and this is my reply they do so by other parts of their nature than those that energize physically One thought in every developed activity series is a desire or thought of purpose and all the other thoughts acquire a feeling tone from their relation of harmony or oppugnancy to this The interplay of these secondary tones among which interest difficulty and effort figure runs the drama in the mental series In what we term the physical drama these qualities play absolutely no part The subject needs careful working out but I can see no inconsistency one hundred two I have found myself more than once accused in print of being the assertor of a metaphysical principle of activity Since literary misunderstandings retard the settlement of problems I should like to say that such an interpretation of the pages I have published on Effort and on Will is absolutely foreign to what I meant to express Principles of Psychology vol II ch XXVI I owe all my doctrines on this subject to Renouvier and Renouvier as I understand him is or at any rate then was an out and out phenomenist a denier of forces in the most strenuous sense Cf Ch Renouvier Esquisse d une Classification Systematique des Doctrines Philosophiques eighteen eighty five vol II pp three hundred ninety three hundred ninety two Essais de Critique Generale eighteen fifty nine vol II Secs ix xiii For an acknowledgment of the author s general indebtedness to Renouvier cf Some Problems of Philosophy p one hundred sixty five note ED Single clauses in my writing or sentences read out of their connection may possibly have been compatible with a transphenomenal principle of energy but I defy anyone to show a single sentence which taken with its context should be naturally held to advocate that view The misinterpretation probably arose at first from my defending after Renouvier the indeterminism of our efforts Free will was supposed by my critics to involve a supernatural agent As a matter of plain history the only free will I have ever thought of defending is the character of novelty in fresh activity situations If an activity process is the form of a whole field of consciousness and if each field of consciousness is not only in its totality unique as is now commonly admitted but has its elements unique since in that situation they are all dyed in the total then novelty is perpetually entering the world and what happens there is not pure repetition as the dogma of the literal uniformity of nature requires Activity situations come in short each with an original touch A principle of free will if there were one would doubtless manifest itself in such phenomena but I never saw nor do I now see what the principle could do except rehearse the phenomenon beforehand or why it ever should be invoked one hundred three Mind N S vol VI eighteen ninety seven cf pp three

ED VII THE ESSENCE OF HUMANISM one hundred five Humanism is a ferment that has come to stay one hundred six It is not a single hypothesis or theorem and it dwells on no new facts It is rather a slow shifting in the philosophic perspective making things appear as from a new centre of interest or point of sight Some writers are strongly conscious of the shifting others half unconscious even though their own vision may have undergone much change The result is no small confusion in debate the half conscious humanists often taking part against the radical ones as if they wished to count upon the other side one hundred seven If humanism really be the name for such a shifting of perspective it is obvious that the whole scene of the philosophic stage will change in some degree if humanism prevails The emphasis of things their foreground and background distribution their sizes and values will not keep just the same one hundred eight If such pervasive consequences be involved in humanism it is clear that no pains which philosophers may take first in defining it and then in furthering checking or steering its progress will be thrown away It suffers badly at present from incomplete definition Its most systematic advocates Schiller and Dewey have published fragmentary programs only and its bearing on many vital philosophic problems has not been traced except by adversaries who scenting heresies in advance have showered blows on doctrines subjectivism and scepticism for example that no good humanist finds it necessary to entertain By their still greater reticences the anti humanists have in turn perplexed the humanists Much of the controversy has involved the word truth It is always good in debate to know your adversary s point of view authentically But the critics of humanism never define exactly what the word truth signifies when they use it themselves The humanists have to guess at their view and the result has doubtless been much beating of the air Add to all this great individual differences in both camps and it becomes clear that nothing is so urgently needed at the stage which things have reached at present as a sharper definition by each side of its central point of view Whoever will contribute any touch of sharpness will help us to make sure of what s what and who is who Anyone can contribute such a definition and without it no one knows exactly where he stands If I offer my own provisional definition of humanism one hundred nine now and here others may improve it some adversary may be led to define his own creed more sharply by the contrast and a certain quickening of the crystallization of general opinion may result I The essential service of humanism as I conceive the situation is to have seen that though one part of our experience may lean upon another part to make it what it is in any one of several aspects in which it may be considered experience as a whole is self containing and leans on nothing Since this formula also expresses the main contention of transcendental idealism it needs abundant explication to make it unambiguous It seems at first sight to confine itself to denying theism and pantheism But in fact it need not deny either everything would depend on the exegesis and if the formula ever became canonical it would certainly develop both right wing and left wing interpreters I myself read humanism theistically and pluralistically If there be a God he is no absolute all experiencer but simply the experiencer of widest actual conscious span Read thus humanism is for me a religion susceptible of reasoned defence though I am well aware how many minds there are to whom it can appeal religiously only when it has been monistically translated Ethically the pluralistic form of it takes for me a stronger hold on reality than any other philosophy I know of it being essentially a social philosophy a philosophy of co in which conjunctions do the work But my primary reason for advocating it is its matchless intellectual economy It gets rid not only of the standing problems that monism engenders problem of evil problem of freedom and the like but of other metaphysical mysteries and paradoxes as well It gets rid for example of the whole agnostic controversy by refusing to entertain the hypothesis of trans empirical reality at all It gets rid of any need for an absolute of the Bradleyan type avowedly sterile for intellectual purposes by insisting that the conjunctive relations found within experience are faultlessly real It gets rid of the need of an absolute of the Roycean type similarly sterile by its pragmatic treatment of the problem of knowledge a treatment of which I have already given a version in two very inadequate articles one hundred ten As the views of knowledge reality and truth imputed to humanism have been those so far most fiercely attacked it is in regard to these ideas that a sharpening of focus seems most urgently required I proceed therefore to bring the views which I impute to humanism in these respects into focus as briefly as I can II If the central humanistic thesis printed above in italics be accepted it will follow that if there be any such thing at all as knowing the knower and the object known must both be portions of experience One part of experience must therefore either one Know another part of experience in other words parts must as Professor Woodbridge says one hundred eleven represent one another instead of representing realities outside of consciousness this case is that of conceptual knowledge or else two They must simply exist as so many ultimate thats or facts of being in the first instance and then as a secondary complication and without doubling up its entitative single ness any one and the same that must figure alternately as a thing known and as a knowledge of the thing by reason of two divergent kinds of context into which in the general course of experience it gets woven one hundred twelve This second case is that of sense perception There is a stage of thought that goes beyond common sense and of it I shall say more presently but the common sense stage is a perfectly definite halting place of thought primarily for purposes of action and so long as we remain on the common sense stage of thought object and subject fuse in the fact of presentation or sense perception the pen and hand which I now see writing for example are the physical realities which those words designate In this case there is no self transcendency implied in the knowing Humanism here is only a more comminuted Identitaetsphilosophie one hundred thirteen In case one on the contrary the representative experience does transcend itself in knowing the other experience that is its object No one can talk of the knowledge of the one by the other without seeing them as numerically distinct entities of which the one lies beyond the other and away from it along some direction and with some interval that can be definitely named But if the talker be a humanist he must also see this distance interval concretely and pragmatically and confess it to consist of other intervening experiences of possible ones at all events if not of actual To call my present idea of my dog for example cognitive of the real dog means that as the actual tissue of experience is constituted the idea is capable of leading into a chain of other experiences on my part that go from next to next and terminate at last in vivid sense perceptions of a jumping barking hairy body Those are the real dog the dog s full presence for my common sense If the supposed talker is a profound philosopher although they may not be the real dog for him they mean the real dog are practical substitutes for the real dog as the representation was a practical substitute for them that real dog being a lot of atoms say or of mind stuff that lie where the sense perceptions lie in his experience as well as in my own III The philosopher here stands for the stage of thought that goes beyond the stage of common sense and the difference is simply that he interpolates and extrapolates where common sense does not For common sense two men see the same identical real dog Philosophy noting actual differences in their perceptions points out the duality of these latter and interpolates something between them as a more real terminus first organs viscera et cetera next cells then ultimate atoms lastly mind stuff perhaps The original sense termini of the two men instead of coalescing with each other and with the real dog object as at first supposed are thus held by philosophers to be separated by invisible realities with which at most they are conterminous Abolish now one of the percipients and the interpolation changes into extrapolation The sense terminus of the remaining percipient is regarded by the philosopher as not quite reaching reality He has only carried the procession of experiences the philosopher thinks to a definite because practical halting place somewhere on the way towards an absolute truth that lies beyond The humanist sees all the time however that there is no absolute transcendency even about the more absolute realities thus conjectured or believed in The viscera and cells are only possible percepts following upon that of the outer body The atoms again though we may never attain to human means of perceiving them are still defined perceptually The mind stuff itself is conceived as a kind of experience and it is possible to frame the hypothesis such hypotheses can by no logic be excluded from philosophy of two knowers of a piece of mind stuff and the mind stuff itself becoming confluent at the moment at which our imperfect knowing might pass into knowing of a completed type Even so do you and I habitually represent our two perceptions and the real dog as confluent though only provisionally and for the common sense stage of thought If my pen be inwardly made of mind stuff there is no confluence now between that mind stuff and my visual perception of the pen But conceivably there might come to be such confluence for in the case of my hand the visual sensations and the inward feelings of the hand its mind stuff so to speak are even now as confluent as any two things can be There is thus no breach in humanistic epistemology Whether knowledge be taken as ideally perfected or only as true enough to pass muster for practice it is hung on one continuous scheme Reality howsoever remote is always defined as a terminus within the general possibilities of experience and what knows it is defined as an experience that represents it in the sense of being substitutable for it in our thinking because it leads to the same associates or in the sense of pointing to it through a chain of other experiences that either intervene or may intervene Absolute reality here bears the same relation to sensation as sensation bears to conception or imagination Both are provisional or final termini sensation being only the terminus at which the practical man habitually stops while the philosopher projects a beyond in the shape of more absolute reality These termini for the practical and the philosophical stages of thought respectively are self supporting They are not true of anything else they simply are are real They lean on nothing as my italicized formula said Rather does the whole fabric of experience lean on them just as the whole fabric of the solar system including many relative positions leans for its absolute position in space on any one of its constituent stars Here again one gets a new Identitaetsphilosophie in pluralistic form one hundred fourteen IV If I have succeeded in making this at all clear though I fear that brevity and abstractness between them may have made me fail the reader will see that the truth of our mental operations must always be an intra experiential affair A conception is reckoned true by common sense when it can be made to lead to a sensation The sensation which for common sense is not so much true as real is held to be provisionally true by the philosopher just in so far as it covers abuts at or occupies the place of a still more absolutely real experience in the possibility of which to some remoter experient the philosopher finds reason to believe Meanwhile what actually does count for true to any individual trower whether he be philosopher or common man is always a result of his apperceptions If a novel experience conceptual or sensible contradict too emphatically our pre existent system of beliefs in ninety nine cases out of a hundred it is treated as false Only when the older and the newer experiences are congruous enough to mutually apperceive and modify each other does what we treat as an advance in truth result Having written of this point in an article in reply to mister Joseph s criticism of my humanism I will say no more about truth here but refer the reader to that review one hundred fifteen In no case however need truth consist in a relation between our experiences and something archetypal or trans experiential Should we ever reach absolutely terminal experiences experiences in which we all agreed which were superseded by no revised continuations these would not be true they would be real they would simply be and be indeed the angles corners and linchpins of all reality on which the truth of everything else would be stayed Only such other things as led to these by satisfactory conjunctions would be true Satisfactory connection of some sort with such termini is all that the word truth means On the common sense stage of thought sense presentations serve as such termini Our ideas and concepts and scientific theories pass for true only so far as they harmoniously lead back to the world of sense I hope that many humanists will endorse this attempt of mine to trace the more essential features of that way of viewing things I feel almost certain that Messrs Dewey and Schiller will do so If the attackers will also take some slight account of it it may be that discussion will be a little less wide of the mark than it has hitherto been FOOTNOTES one hundred five Reprinted

and Truth Once More ED VIII LA NOTION DE CONSCIENCE one hundred sixteen Je voudrais vous communiquer quelques doutes qui me sont venus au sujet de la notion de Conscience qui regne dans tous nos traites de psychologie On definit habituellement la Psychologie comme la Science des faits de Conscience ou des phenomenes ou encore des etats de la Conscience Qu on admette qu elle se rattache a des moi personnels ou bien qu on la croie impersonnelle a la facon du moi transcendental de Kant de la Bewusstheit ou du Bewusstsein ueberhaupt de nos contemporains en Allemagne cette conscience est toujours regardee comme possedant une essence propre absolument distincte de l essence des choses materielles qu elle a le don mysterieux de representer et de connaitre Les faits materiels pris dans leur materialite ne sont pas eprouves ne sont pas objets d experience ne se rapportent pas Pour qu ils prennent la forme du systeme dans lequel nous nous sentons vivre il faut qu ils apparaissent et ce fait d apparaitre surajoute a leur existence brute s appelle la conscience que nous en avons ou peut etre selon l hypothese panpsychiste qu ils ont d eux memes Voila ce dualisme invetere qu il semble impossible de chasser de notre vue du monde Ce monde peut bien exister en soi mais nous n en savons rien car pour nous il est exclusivement un objet d experience et la condition indispensable a cet effet c est qu il soit rapporte a des temoins qu il soit connu par un sujet ou par des sujets spirituels Objet et sujet voila les deux jambes sans lesquelles il semble que la philosophie ne saurait faire un pas en avant Toutes les ecoles sont d accord la dessus scolastique cartesianisme kantisme neo kantisme tous admettent le dualisme fondamental Le positivisme ou agnosticisme de nos jours qui se pique de relever des sciences naturelles se donne volontiers il est vrai le nom de monisme Mais ce n est qu un monisme verbal Il pose une realite inconnue mais nous dit que cette realite se presente toujours sous deux aspects un cote conscience et un cote matiere et ces deux cotes demeurent aussi irreductibles que les attributs fondamentaux etendue et pensee du Dieu de Spinoza Au fond le monisme contemporain est du spinozisme pur Or comment se represente t on cette conscience dont nous sommes tous si portes a admettre l existence Impossible de la definir nous dit on mais nous en avons tous une intuition immediate tout d abord la conscience a conscience d elle meme Demandez a la premiere personne que vous rencontrerez homme ou femme psychologue ou ignorant et elle vous repondra qu elle se sent penser jouir souffrir vouloir tout comme elle se sent respirer Elle percoit directement sa vie spirituelle comme une espece de courant interieur actif leger fluide delicat diaphane pour ainsi dire et absolument oppose a quoi que ce soit de materiel Bref la vie subjective ne parait pas seulement etre une condition logiquement indispensable pour qu il y ait un monde objectif qui apparaisse c est encore un element de l experience meme que nous eprouvons directement au meme titre que nous eprouvons notre propre corps Idees et Choses comment donc ne pas reconnaitre leur dualisme Sentiments et Objets comment douter de leur heterogeneite absolue La psychologie soi disant scientifique admet cette heterogeneite comme l ancienne psychologie spiritualiste l admettait Comment ne pas l admettre Chaque science decoupe arbitrairement dans la trame des faits un champ ou elle se parque et dont elle decrit et etudie le contenu La psychologie prend justement pour son domaine le champ des faits de conscience Elle les postule sans les critiquer elle les oppose aux faits materiels et sans critiquer non plus la notion de ces derniers elle les rattache a la conscience par le lien mysterieux de la connaissance de l aperception qui pour elle est un troisieme genre de fait fondamental et ultime En suivant cette voie la psychologie contemporaine a fete de grands triomphes Elle a pu faire une esquisse de l evolution de la vie consciente en concevant cette derniere comme s adaptant de plus en plus completement au milieu physique environnant Elle a pu etablir un parallelisme dans le dualisme celui des faits psychiques et des evenements cerebraux Elle a explique les illusions les hallucinations et jusqu a un certain point les maladies mentales Ce sont de beaux progres mais il reste encore bien des problemes La philosophie generale surtout qui a pour devoir de scruter tous les postulats trouve des paradoxes et des empechements la ou la science passe outre et il n y a que les amateurs de science populaire qui ne sont jamais perplexes Plus on va au fond des choses plus on trouve d enigmes et j avoue pour ma part que depuis que je m occupe serieusement de psychologie ce vieux dualisme de matiere et de pensee cette heterogeneite posee comme absolue des deux essences m a toujours presente des difficultes C est de quelques unes de ces difficultes que je voudrais maintenant vous entretenir D abord il y en a une laquelle j en suis convaincu vous aura frappes tous Prenons la perception exterieure la sensation directe que nous donnent par exemple les murs de cette salle Peut on dire ici que le psychique et le physique sont absolument heterogenes Au contraire ils sont si peu heterogenes que si nous nous placons au point de vue du sens commun si nous faisons abstraction de toutes les inventions explicatives des molecules et des ondulations etherees par exemple qui au fond sont des entites metaphysiques si en un mot nous prenons la realite naivement et telle qu elle nous est donnee tout d abord cette realite sensible d ou dependent nos interets vitaux et sur laquelle se portent toutes nos actions eh bien cette realite sensible et la sensation que nous en avons sont au moment ou la sensation se produit absolument identiques l une a l autre La realite est l aperception meme Les mots murs de cette salle ne signifient que cette blancheur fraiche et sonore qui nous entoure coupee par ces fenetres bornee par ces lignes et ces angles Le physique ici n a pas d autre contenu que le psychique Le sujet et l objet se confondent C est Berkeley qui le premier a mis cette verite en honneur Esse est percipi Nos sensations ne sont pas de petits duplicats interieurs des choses elles sont les choses memes en tant que les choses nous sont presentes Et quoi que l on veuille penser de la vie absente cachee et pour ainsi dire privee des choses et quelles que soient les constructions hypothetiques qu on en fasse il reste vrai que la vie publique des choses cette actualite presente par laquelle elles nous confrontent d ou derivent toutes nos constructions theoriques et a laquelle elles doivent toutes revenir et se rattacher sous peine de flotter dans l air et dans l irreel cette actualite dis je est homogene et non pas seulement homogene mais numeriquement une avec une certaine partie de notre vie interieure Voila pour la perception exterieure Quand on s adresse a l imagination a la memoire ou aux facultes de representation abstraite bien que les faits soient ici beaucoup plus compliques je crois que la meme homogeneite essentielle se degage Pour simplifier le probleme excluons d abord toute realite sensible Prenons la pensee pure telle qu elle s effectue dans le reve ou la reverie ou dans la memoire du passe Ici encore l etoffe de l experience ne fait elle pas double emploi le physique et le psychique ne se confondent ils pas Si je reve d une montagne d or elle n existe sans doute pas en dehors du reve mais dans le reve elle est de nature ou d essence parfaitement physique c est comme physique qu elle m apparait Si en ce moment je me permets de me souvenir de ma maison en Amerique et des details de mon embarquement recent pour l Italie le phenomene pur le fait qui se produit qu est il C est dit on ma pensee avec son contenu Mais encore ce contenu qu est il Il porte la forme d une partie du monde reel partie distante il est vrai de six mille kilometres d espace et de six semaines de temps mais reliee a la salle ou nous sommes par une foule de choses objets et evenements homogenes d une part avec la salle et d autre part avec l objet de mes souvenirs Ce contenu ne se donne pas comme etant d abord un tout petit fait interieur que je projetterais ensuite au loin il se presente d emblee comme le fait eloigne meme Et l acte de penser ce contenu la conscience que j en ai que sont ils Sont ce au fond autre chose que des manieres retrospectives de nommer le contenu lui meme lorsqu on l aura separe de tous ces intermediaires physiques et relie a un nouveau groupe d associes qui le font rentrer dans ma vie mentale les emotions par exemple qu il a eveillees en moi l attention que j y porte mes idees de tout a l heure qui l ont suscite comme souvenir Ce n est qu en se rapportant a ces derniers associes que le phenomene arrive a etre classe comme pensee tant qu il ne se rapporte qu aux premiers il demeure phenomene objectif Il est vrai que nous opposons habituellement nos images interieures aux objets et que nous les considerons comme de petites copies comme des calques ou doubles affaiblis de ces derniers C est qu un objet present a une vivacite et une nettete superieures a celles de l image Il lui fait ainsi contraste et pour me servir de l excellent mot de Taine il lui sert de reducteur Quand les deux sont presents ensemble l objet prend le premier plan et l image recule devient une chose absente Mais cet objet present qu est il en lui meme De quelle etoffe est il fait De la meme etoffe que l image Il est fait de sensations il est chose percue Son esse est percipi et lui et l image sont generiquement homogenes Si je pense en ce moment a mon chapeau que j ai laisse tout a l heure au vestiaire ou est le dualisme le discontinu entre le chapeau pense et le chapeau reel C est d un vrai chapeau absent que mon esprit s occupe J en tiens compte pratiquement comme d une realite S il etait present sur cette table le chapeau determinerait un mouvement de ma main je l enleverais De meme ce chapeau concu ce chapeau en idee determinera tantot la direction de mes pas J irai le prendre L idee que j en ai se continuera jusqu a la presence sensible du chapeau et s y fondra harmonieusement Je conclus donc que bien qu il y ait un dualisme pratique puisque les images se distinguent des objets en tiennent lieu et nous y menent il n y a pas lieu de leur attribuer une difference de nature essentielle Pensee et actualite sont faites d une seule et meme etoffe qui est l etoffe de l experience en general La psychologie de la perception exterieure nous mene a la meme conclusion Quand j apercois l objet devant moi comme une table de telle forme a telle distance on m explique que ce fait est du a deux facteurs a une matiere de sensation qui me penetre par la voie des yeux et qui donne l element d exteriorite reelle et a des idees qui se reveillent vont a la rencontre de cette realite la classent et l interpretent Mais qui peut faire la part dans la table concretement apercue de ce qui est sensation et de ce qui est idee L externe et l interne l etendu et l inetendu se fusionnent et font un mariage indissoluble Cela rappelle ces panoramas circulaires ou des objets reels rochers herbe chariots brises et cetera qui occupent l avant plan sont si ingenieusement relies a la toile qui fait le fond et qui represente une bataille ou un vaste paysage que l on ne sait plus distinguer ce qui est objet de ce qui est peinture Les coutures et les joints sont imperceptibles Cela pourrait il advenir si l objet et l idee etaient absolument dissemblables de nature Je suis convaincu que des considerations pareilles a celles que je viens d exprimer auront deja suscite chez vous aussi des doutes au sujet du dualisme pretendu Et d autres raisons de douter surgissent encore Il y a toute une sphere d adjectifs et d attributs qui ne sont ni objectifs ni subjectifs d une maniere exclusive mais que nous employons tantot d une maniere et tantot d une autre comme si nous nous complaisions dans leur ambiguite Je parle des qualites que nous apprecions pour ainsi dire dans les choses leur cote esthetique moral leur valeur pour nous La beaute par exemple ou reside t elle Est elle dans la statue dans la sonate ou dans notre esprit Mon collegue a Harvard George Santayana a ecrit un livre d esthetique one hundred seventeen ou il appelle la beaute le plaisir objectifie et en verite c est bien ici qu on pourrait parler de projection au dehors On dit indifferemment une chaleur agreable ou une sensation agreable de chaleur La rarete le precieux du diamant nous en paraissent des qualites essentielles Nous parlons d un orage affreux d un homme haissable d une action indigne et nous croyons parler objectivement bien que ces termes n expriment que des rapports a notre sensibilite emotive propre Nous disons meme un chemin penible un ciel triste un coucher de soleil superbe Toute cette maniere animiste de regarder les choses qui parait avoir ete la facon primitive de penser des hommes peut tres bien s expliquer et M Santayana dans un autre livre tout recent one hundred eighteen l a bien expliquee ainsi par l habitude d attribuer a l objet tout ce que nous ressentons en sa presence Le partage du subjectif et de l objectif est le fait d une reflexion tres avancee que nous aimons encore ajourner dans beaucoup d endroits Quand les besoins pratiques ne nous en tirent pas forcement il semble que nous aimons a nous bercer dans le vague Les qualites secondes elles memes chaleur son lumiere n ont encore aujourd hui qu une attribution vague Pour le sens commun pour la vie pratique elles sont absolument objectives physiques Pour le physicien elles sont subjectives Pour lui il n y a que la forme la masse le mouvement qui aient une realite exterieure Pour le philosophe idealiste au contraire forme et mouvement sont tout aussi subjectifs que lumiere et chaleur et il n y a que la chose en soi inconnue le noumene qui jouisse d une realite extramentale complete Nos sensations intimes conservent encore de cette ambiguite Il y a des illusions de mouvement qui prouvent que nos premieres sensations de mouvement etaient generalisees C est le monde entier avec nous qui se mouvait Maintenant nous distinguons notre propre mouvement de celui des objets qui nous entourent et parmi les objets nous en distinguons qui demeurent en repos Mais il est des etats de vertige ou nous retombons encore aujourd hui dans l indifferenciation premiere Vous connaissez tous sans doute cette theorie qui a voulu faire des emotions des sommes de sensations viscerales et musculaires Elle a donne lieu a bien des controverses et aucune opinion n a encore conquis l unanimite des suffrages Vous connaissez aussi les controverses sur la nature de l activite mentale Les uns soutiennent qu elle est une force purement spirituelle que nous sommes en etat d apercevoir immediatement comme telle Les autres pretendent que ce que nous nommons activite mentale effort attention par exemple n est que le reflet senti de certains effets dont notre organisme est le siege tensions musculaires au crane et au gosier arret ou passage de la respiration afflux de sang et cetera De quelque maniere que se resolvent ces controverses leur existence prouve bien clairement une chose c est qu il est tres difficile ou meme absolument impossible de savoir par la seule inspection intime de certains phenomenes s ils sont de nature physique occupant de l etendue et cetera ou s ils sont de nature purement psychique et interieure Il nous faut toujours trouver des raisons pour appuyer notre avis il nous faut chercher la classification la plus probable du phenomene et en fin de compte il pourrait bien se trouver que toutes nos classifications usuelles eussent eu leurs motifs plutot dans les besoins de la pratique que dans quelque faculte que nous aurions d apercevoir deux essences ultimes et diverses qui composeraient ensemble la trame des choses Le corps de chacun de nous offre un contraste pratique presque violent a tout le reste du milieu ambiant Tout ce qui arrive au dedans de ce corps nous est plus intime et important que ce qui arrive ailleurs Il s identifie avec notre moi il se classe avec lui Ame vie souffle qui saurait bien les distinguer exactement Meme nos images et nos souvenirs qui n agissent sur le monde physique que par le moyen de notre corps semblent appartenir a ce dernier Nous les traitons comme internes nous les classons avec nos sentiments affectifs Il faut bien avouer en somme que la question du dualisme de la pensee et de la matiere est bien loin d etre finalement resolue Et voila terminee la premiere partie de mon discours J ai voulu vous penetrer Mesdames et Messieurs de mes doutes et de la realite aussi bien que de l importance du probleme Quant a moi apres de longues annees d hesitation j ai fini par prendre mon parti carrement Je crois que la conscience telle qu on se la represente communement soit comme entite soit comme activite pure mais en tout cas comme fluide inetendue diaphane vide de tout contenu propre mais se connaissant directement elle meme spirituelle enfin je crois dis je que cette conscience est une pure chimere et que la somme de realites concretes que le mot conscience devrait couvrir merite une toute autre description description du reste qu une philosophie attentive aux faits et sachant faire un peu d analyse serait desormais en etat de fournir ou plutot de commencer a fournir Et ces mots m amenent a la seconde partie de mon discours Elle sera beaucoup plus courte que la premiere parce que si je la developpais sur la meme echelle elle serait beaucoup trop longue Il faut par consequent que je me restreigne aux seules indications indispensables Admettons que la conscience la Bewusstheit concue comme essence entite activite moitie irreductible de chaque experience soit supprimee que le dualisme fondamental et pour ainsi dire ontologique soit aboli et que ce que nous supposions exister soit seulement ce qu on a appele jusqu ici le contenu le Inhalt de la conscience comment la philosophie va t elle se tirer d affaire avec l espece de monisme vague qui en resultera Je vais tacher de vous insinuer quelques suggestions positives la dessus bien que je craigne que faute du developpement necessaire mes idees ne repandront pas une clarte tres grande Pourvu que j indique un commencement de sentier ce sera peut etre assez Au fond pourquoi nous accrochons nous d une maniere si tenace a cette idee d une conscience surajoutee a l existence du contenu des choses Pourquoi la reclamons nous si fortement que celui qui la nierait nous semblerait plutot un mauvais plaisant qu un penseur N est ce pas pour sauver ce fait indeniable que le contenu de l experience n a pas seulement une existence propre et comme immanente et intrinseque mais que chaque partie de ce contenu deteint pour ainsi dire sur ses voisines rend compte d elle meme a d autres sort en quelque sorte de soi pour etre sue et qu ainsi tout le champ de l experience se trouve etre transparent de part en part ou constitue comme un espace qui serait rempli de miroirs Cette bilateralite des parties de l experience a savoir d une part qu elles sont avec des qualites propres d autre part qu elles sont rapportees a d autres parties et sues l opinion regnante la constate et l explique par un dualisme fondamental de constitution appartenant a chaque morceau d experience en propre Dans cette feuille de papier il n y a pas seulement dit on le contenu blancheur minceur et cetera mais il y a ce second fait de la conscience de cette blancheur et de cette minceur Cette fonction d etre rapporte de faire partie de la trame entiere d une experience plus comprehensive on l erige en fait ontologique et on loge ce fait dans l interieur meme du papier en l accouplant a sa blancheur et a sa minceur Ce n est pas un rapport extrinseque qu on suppose c est une moitie du phenomene meme Je crois qu en somme on se represente la realite comme constituee de la facon dont sont faites les couleurs qui nous servent a la peinture Il y a d abord des matieres colorantes qui repondent au contenu et il y a un vehicule huile ou colle qui les tient en suspension et qui repond a la conscience C est un dualisme complet ou en employant certains procedes on peut separer chaque element de l autre par voie de soustraction C est ainsi qu on nous assure qu en faisant un grand effort d abstraction introspective nous pouvons saisir notre conscience sur le vif comme une activite spirituelle pure en negligeant a peu pres completement les matieres qu a un moment donne elle eclaire Maintenant je vous demande si on ne pourrait pas tout aussi bien renverser absolument cette maniere de voir Supposons en effet que la realite premiere soit de nature neutre et appelons la par quelque nom encore ambigu comme phenomene donne Vorfindung Moi meme j en parle volontiers au pluriel et je lui donne le nom d experiences pures Ce sera un monisme si vous voulez mais un monisme tout a fait rudimentaire et absolument oppose au soi disant monisme bilateral du positivisme scientifique ou spinoziste Ces experiences pures existent et se succedent entrent dans des rapports infiniment varies les unes avec les autres rapports qui sont eux memes des parties essentielles de la trame des experiences Il y a Conscience de ces rapports au meme titre qu il y a Conscience de leurs termes Il en resulte que des groupes d experiences se font remarquer et distinguer et qu une seule et meme experience vu la grande variete de ses rapports peut jouer un role dans plusieurs groupes a la fois C est ainsi que dans un certain contexte de voisins elle serait classee comme un phenomene physique tandis que dans un autre entourage elle figurerait comme un fait de conscience a peu pres comme une meme particule d encre peut appartenir simultanement a deux lignes l une verticale l autre horizontale pourvu qu elle soit situee a leur intersection Prenons pour fixer nos idees l experience que nous avons a ce moment du local ou nous sommes de ces murailles de cette table de ces chaises de cet espace Dans cette experience pleine concrete et indivise telle qu elle est la donnee le monde physique objectif et le monde interieur et personnel de chacun de nous se rencontrent et se fusionnent comme des lignes se fusionnent a leur intersection Comme chose physique cette salle a des rapports avec tout le reste du batiment batiment que nous autres nous ne connaissons et ne connaitrons pas Elle doit son existence a toute une histoire de financiers d architectes d ouvriers Elle pese sur le sol elle durera indefiniment dans le temps si le feu y eclatait les chaises et la table qu elle contient seraient vite reduites en cendres Comme experience personnelle au contraire comme chose rapportee connue consciente cette salle a de tout autres tenants et aboutissants Ses antecedents ne sont pas des ouvriers ce sont nos pensees respectives de tout a l heure Bientot elle ne figurera que comme un fait fugitif dans nos biographies associe a d agreables souvenirs Comme experience psychique elle n a aucun poids son ameublement n est pas combustible Elle n exerce de force physique que sur nos seuls cerveaux et beaucoup d entre nous nient encore cette influence tandis que la salle physique est en rapport d influence physique avec tout le reste du monde Et pourtant c est de la meme salle absolument qu il s agit dans les deux cas Tant que nous ne faisons pas de physique speculative tant que nous nous placons dans le sens commun c est la salle vue et sentie qui est bien la salle physique De quoi parlons nous donc si ce n est de cela de cette meme partie de la nature materielle que tous nos esprits a ce meme moment embrassent qui entre telle quelle dans l experience actuelle et intime de chacun de nous et que notre souvenir regardera toujours comme une partie integrante de notre histoire C est absolument une meme etoffe qui figure simultanement selon le contexte que l on considere comme fait materiel et physique ou comme fait de conscience intime Je crois donc qu on ne saurait traiter conscience et matiere comme etant d essence disparate On n obtient ni l une ni l autre par soustraction en negligeant chaque fois l autre moitie d une experience de composition double Les experiences sont au contraire primitivement de nature plutot simple Elles deviennent conscientes dans leur entier elles deviennent physiques dans leur entier et c est par voie d addition que ce resultat se realise Pour autant que des experiences se prolongent dans le temps entrent dans des rapports d influence physique se brisant se chauffant s eclairant et cetera mutuellement nous en faisons un groupe a part que nous appelons le monde physique Pour autant au contraire qu elles sont fugitives inertes physiquement que leur succession ne suit pas d ordre determine mais semble plutot obeir a des caprices emotifs nous en faisons un autre groupe que nous appelons le monde psychique C est en entrant a present dans un grand nombre de ces groupes psychiques que cette salle devient maintenant chose consciente chose rapportee chose sue En faisant desormais partie de nos biographies respectives elle ne sera pas suivie de cette sotte et monotone repetition d elle meme dans le temps qui caracterise son existence physique Elle sera suivie au contraire par d autres experiences qui seront discontinues avec elle ou qui auront ce genre tout particulier de continuite que nous appelons souvenir Demain elle aura eu sa place dans chacun de nos passes mais les presents divers auxquels tous ces passes seront lies demain seront bien differents du present dont cette salle jouira demain comme entite physique Les deux genres de groupes sont formes d experiences mais les rapports des experiences entre elles different d un groupe a l autre C est donc par addition d autres phenomenes qu un phenomene donne devient conscient ou connu ce n est pas par un dedoublement d essence interieure La connaissance des choses leur survient elle ne leur est pas immanente Ce n est le fait ni d un moi transcendental ni d une Bewusstheit ou acte de conscience qui les animerait chacune Elles se connaissent l une l autre ou plutot il y en a qui connaissent les autres et le rapport que nous nommons connaissance n est lui meme dans beaucoup de cas qu une suite d experiences intermediaires parfaitement susceptibles d etre decrites en termes concrets Il n est nullement le mystere transcendant ou se sont complus tant de philosophes Mais ceci nous menerait beaucoup trop loin Je ne puis entrer ici dans tous les replis de la theorie de la connaissance ou de ce que vous autres Italiens vous appelez la gnoseologie Je dois me contenter de ces remarques ecourtees ou simples suggestions qui sont je le crains encore bien obscures faute des developpements necessaires Permettez donc que je me resume trop sommairement et en style dogmatique dans les six theses suivantes one o La Conscience telle qu on l entend ordinairement n existe pas pas plus que la Matiere a laquelle Berkeley a donne le coup de grace two o Ce qui existe et forme la part de verite que le mot de Conscience recouvre c est la susceptibilite que possedent les parties de l experience d etre rapportees ou connues three o Cette susceptibilite s explique par le fait que certaines experiences peuvent mener les unes aux autres par des experiences intermediaires nettement caracterisees de telle sorte que les unes se trouvent jouer le role de choses connues les autres celui de sujets connaissants four o On peut parfaitement definir ces deux roles sans sortir de la trame de l experience meme et sans invoquer rien de transcendant five o Les attributions sujet et objet represente et representatif chose et pensee signifient donc une distinction pratique qui est de la derniere importance mais qui est d ordre FONCTIONNEL seulement et nullement ontologique comme le dualisme classique se la represente six o En fin de compte les choses et les pensees ne sont point foncierement heterogenes mais elles sont faites d une meme etoffe etoffe qu on ne peut definir comme telle mais seulement eprouver et que l on peut nommer si on veut l etoffe de l experience en general FOOTNOTES one hundred sixteen A communication made in French at the Fifth International Congress of Psychology in Rome April thirty nineteen oh five It is reprinted from the Archives de Psychologie vol V No seventeen June nineteen oh five Cette communication est le resume forcement tres condense de vues que l auteur a exposees au cours de ces derniers mois en une serie d articles publies dans le Journal of Philosophy Psychology and Scientific Methods nineteen oh four et nineteen oh five The series of articles referred to is reprinted above ED one hundred seventeen The Sense of Beauty pp forty four ff one hundred eighteen The Life of Reason vol I Reason in Common Sense p one hundred forty two IX IS RADICAL EMPIRICISM SOLIPSISTIC one hundred nineteen If all the criticisms which the humanistic Weltanschauung is receiving were as sachgemaess as mister Bode s one hundred twenty the truth of the matter would more rapidly clear up Not only is it excellently well written but it brings its own point of view out clearly and admits of a perfectly straight reply The argument unless I fail to catch it can be expressed as follows If a series of experiences be supposed no one of which is endowed immediately with the self transcendent function of reference to a reality beyond itself no motive will occur within the series for supposing anything beyond it to exist It will remain subjective and contentedly subjective both as a whole and in its several parts Radical empiricism trying as it does to account for objective knowledge by means of such a series egregiously fails It can not explain how the notion of a physical order as distinguished from a subjectively biographical order of experiences ever arose It pretends to explain the notion of a physical order but does so by playing fast and loose with the concept of objective reference On the one hand it denies that such reference implies self transcendency on the part of any one experience on the other hand it claims that experiences point But critically considered there can be no pointing unless self transcendency be also allowed The conjunctive function of pointing as I have assumed it is according to my critic vitiated by the fallacy of attaching a bilateral relation to a term a quo as if it could stick out substantively and maintain itself in existence in advance of the term ad quem which is equally required for it to be a concretely experienced fact If the relation be made concrete the term ad quem is involved which would mean if I succeed in apprehending mister Bode rightly that this latter term although not empirically there is yet noetically there in advance in other words it would mean that any experience that points must already have transcended itself in the ordinary epistemological sense of the word transcend Something like this if I understand mister Bode s text is the upshot of his state of mind It is a reasonable sounding state of mind but it is exactly the state of mind which radical empiricism by its doctrine of the reality of conjunctive relations seeks to dispel I very much fear so difficult does mutual understanding seem in these exalted regions that my able critic has failed to understand that doctrine as it is meant to be understood I suspect that he performs on all these conjunctive relations of which the aforesaid pointing is only one the usual rationalistic act of substitution he takes them not as they are given in their first intention as parts constitutive of experience s living flow but only as they appear in retrospect each fixed as a determinate object of conception static therefore and contained within itself Against this rationalistic tendency to treat experience as chopped up into discontinuous static objects radical empiricism protests It insists on taking conjunctions at their face value just as they come Consider for example such conjunctions as and with near plus towards While we live in such conjunctions our state is one of transition in the most literal sense We are expectant of a more to come and before the more has come the transition nevertheless is directed towards it I fail otherwise to see how if one kind of more comes there should be satisfaction and feeling of fulfilment but disappointment if the more comes in another shape One more will continue another more will arrest or deflect the direction in which our experience is moving even now We can not it is true name our different living ands or withs except by naming the different terms towards which they are moving us but we live their specifications and differences before those terms explicitly arrive Thus though the various ands are all bilateral relations each requiring a term ad quem to define it when viewed in retrospect and articulately conceived yet in its living moment any one of them may be treated as if it stuck out from its term a quo and pointed in a special direction much as a compass needle to use mister Bode s excellent simile points at the pole even though it stirs not from its box In Professor Hoeffding s massive little article in The Journal of Philosophy Psychology and Scientific Methods one hundred twenty one he quotes a saying of Kierkegaard s to the effect that we live forwards but we understand backwards Understanding backwards is it must be confessed a very frequent weakness of philosophers both of the rationalistic and of the ordinary empiricist type Radical empiricism alone insists on understanding forwards also and refuses to substitute static concepts of the understanding for transitions in our moving life A logic similar to that which my critic seems to employ here should it seems to me forbid him to say that our present is while present directed towards our future or that any physical movement can have direction until its goal is actually reached At this point does it not seem as if the quarrel about self transcendency in knowledge might drop Is it not a purely verbal dispute Call it self transcendency or call it pointing whichever you like it makes no difference so long as real transitions towards real goals are admitted as things given in experience and among experience s most indefeasible parts Radical empiricism unable to close its eyes to the transitions caught in actu accounts for the self transcendency or the pointing whichever you may call it as a process that occurs within experience as an empirically mediated thing of which a perfectly definite description can be given Epistemology on the other hand denies this and pretends that the self transcendency is unmediated or if mediated then mediated in a super empirical world To justify this pretension epistemology has first to transform all our conjunctions into static objects and this I submit is an absolutely arbitrary act But in spite of mister Bode s mal treatment of conjunctions as I understand them and as I understand him I believe that at bottom we are fighting for nothing different but are both defending the same continuities of experience in different forms of words There are other criticisms in the article in question but as this seems the most vital one I will for the present at any rate leave them untouched FOOTNOTES one hundred nineteen Reprinted from The Journal of

hundred twenty two Although mister Pitkin does not name me in his acute article on radical empiricism one hundred twenty three I fear that some readers knowing me to have applied that name to my own doctrine may possibly consider themselves to have been in at my death In point of fact my withers are entirely unwrung I have indeed said one hundred twenty four that to be radical an empiricism must not admit into its constructions any element that is not directly experienced But in my own radical empiricism this is only a methodological postulate not a conclusion supposed to flow from the intrinsic absurdity of transempirical objects I have never felt the slightest respect for the idealistic arguments which mister Pitkin attacks and of which Ferrier made such striking use and I am perfectly willing to admit any number of noumenal beings or events into philosophy if only their pragmatic value can be shown Radical empiricism and pragmatism have so many misunderstandings to suffer from that it seems my duty not to let this one go any farther uncorrected mister Pitkin s reply to me one hundred twenty five perplexes me by the obscurity of style which I find in almost all our younger philosophers He asks me however two direct questions which I understand so I take the liberty of answering First he asks Do not experience and science show that countless things are one hundred twenty six experienced as that which they are not or are only partially I reply Yes assuredly as for example things distorted by refractive media molecules or whatever else is taken to be more ultimately real than the immediate content of the perceptive moment Secondly If experience is self supporting one hundred twenty seven in any intelligible sense does this fact preclude the possibility of a something not experienced and b action of experience upon a noumenon My reply is Assuredly not the possibility of either how could it Yet in my opinion we should be wise not to consider any thing or action of that nature and to restrict our universe of philosophic discourse to what is experienced or at least experienceable one hundred twenty eight FOOTNOTES one hundred twenty two Reprinted

p one hundred note ED XI HUMANISM AND TRUTH ONCE MORE one hundred twenty nine mister Joseph s criticism of my article Humanism and Truth one hundred thirty is a useful contribution to the general clearing up He has seriously tried to comprehend what the pragmatic movement may intelligibly mean and if he has failed it is the fault neither of his patience nor of his sincerity but rather of stubborn tricks of thought which he could not easily get rid of Minute polemics in which the parties try to rebut every detail of each of the other s charges are a useful exercise only to the disputants They can but breed confusion in a reader I will therefore ignore as much as possible the text of both our articles mine was inadequate enough and treat once more the general objective situation As I apprehend the movement towards humanism it is based on no particular discovery or principle that can be driven into one precise formula which thereupon can be impaled upon a logical skewer It is much more like one of those secular changes that come upon public opinion over night as it were borne upon tides too full for sound or foam that survive all the crudities and extravagances of their advocates that you can pin to no one absolutely essential statement nor kill by any one decisive stab Such have been the changes from aristocracy to democracy from classic to romantic taste from theistic to pantheistic feeling from static to evolutionary ways of understanding life changes of which we all have been spectators Scholasticism still opposes to such changes the method of confutation by single decisive reasons showing that the new view involves self contradiction or traverses some fundamental principle This is like stopping a river by planting a stick in the middle of its bed Round your obstacle flows the water and gets there all the same In reading mister Joseph I am not a little reminded of those Catholic writers who refute Darwinism by telling us that higher species can not come from lower because minus nequit gignere plus or that the notion of transformation is absurd for it implies that species tend to their own destruction and that would violate the principle that every reality tends to persevere in its own shape The point of view is too myopic too tight and close to take in the inductive argument You can not settle questions of fact by formal logic I feel as if mister Joseph almost pounced on my words singly without giving the sentences time to get out of my mouth The one condition of understanding humanism is to become inductive minded oneself to drop rigorous definitions and follow lines of least resistance on the whole In other words mister Joseph may probably say resolve your intellect into a kind of slush Even so I make reply if you will consent to use no politer word For humanism conceiving the more true as the more satisfactory Dewey s term has to renounce sincerely rectilinear arguments and ancient ideals of rigor and finality It is in just this temper of renunciation so different from that of pyrrhonistic scepticism that the spirit of humanism essentially consists Satisfactoriness has to be measured by a multitude of standards of which some for aught we know may fail in any given case and what is more satisfactory than any alternative in sight may to the end be a sum of pluses and minuses concerning which we can only trust that by ulterior corrections and improvements a maximum of the one and a minimum of the other may some day be approached It means a real change of heart a break with absolutistic hopes when one takes up this view of the conditions of belief That humanism s critics have never imagined this attitude inwardly is shown by their invariable tactics They do not get into it far enough to see objectively and from without what their own opposite notion of truth is mister Joseph is possessed by some such notion he thinks his readers to be full of it he obeys it works from it but never even essays to tell us what it is The nearest he comes to doing so is where one hundred thirty one he says it is the way we ought to think whether we be psychologically compelled to or not Of course humanism agrees to this it is only a manner of calling truth an ideal But humanism explicates the summarizing word ought into a mass of pragmatic motives from the midst of which our critics think that truth itself takes flight Truth is a name of double meaning It stands now for an abstract something defined only as that to which our thought ought to conform and again it stands for the concrete propositions within which we believe that conformity already reigns they being so many truths Humanism sees that the only conformity we ever have to deal with concretely is that between our subjects and our predicates using these words in a very broad sense It sees moreover that this conformity is validated to use mister Schiller s term by an indefinite number of pragmatic tests that vary as the predicates and subjects vary If an S gets superseded by an SP that gives our mind a completer sum of satisfactions we always say humanism points out that we have advanced to a better position in regard to truth Now many of our judgments thus attained are retrospective The S es so the judgment runs were SP s already ere the fact was humanly recorded Common sense struck by this state of things now rearranges the whole field and traditional philosophy follows her example The general requirement that predicates must conform to their subject they translate into an ontological theory A most previous Subject of all is substituted for the lesser subjects and conceived of as an archetypal Reality and the conformity required of predicates in detail is reinterpreted as a relation which our whole mind with all its subjects and predicates together must get into with respect to this Reality It meanwhile is conceived as eternal static and unaffected by our thinking Conformity to a non human Archetype like this is probably the notion of truth which my opponent shares with common sense and philosophic rationalism When now Humanism fully admitting both the naturalness and the grandeur of this hypothesis nevertheless points to its sterility and declines to chime in with the substitution keeping to the concrete and still lodging truth between the subjects and the predicates in detail it provokes the outcry which we hear and which my critic echoes One of the commonest parts of the outcry is that humanism is subjectivistic altogether it is supposed to labor under a necessity of denying trans perceptual reality one hundred thirty two It is not hard to see how this misconception of humanism may have arisen and humanistic writers partly from not having sufficiently guarded their expressions and partly from not having yet got round in the poverty of their literature to a full discussion of the subject are doubtless in some degree to blame But I fail to understand how any one with a working grasp of their principles can charge them wholesale with subjectivism I myself have never thought of humanism as being subjectivistic farther than to this extent that inasmuch as it treats the thinker as being himself one portion of reality it must also allow that some of the realities that he declares for true are created by his being there Such realities of course are either acts of his or relations between other things and him or relations between things which but for him would never have been traced Humanists are subjectivistic also in this that unlike rationalists who think they carry a warrant for the absolute truth of what they now believe in in their present pocket they hold all present beliefs as subject to revision in the light of future experience The future experience however may be of things outside the thinker and that this is so the humanist may believe as freely as any other kind of empiricist philosopher The critics of humanism though here I follow them but darkly appear to object to any infusion whatever of subjectivism into truth All must be archetypal every truth must pre exist to its perception Humanism sees that an enormous quantity of truth must be written down as having pre existed to its perception by us humans In countless instances we find it most satisfactory to believe that though we were always ignorant of the fact it always was a fact that S was SP But humanism separates this class of cases from those in which it is more satisfactory to believe the opposite e g that S is ephemeral or P a passing event or SP created by the perceiving act Our critics seem on the other hand to wish to universalize the retrospective type of instance Reality must pre exist to every assertion for which truth is claimed And not content with this overuse of one particular type of judgment our critics claim its monopoly They appear to wish to cut off Humanism from its rights to any retrospection at all Humanism says that satisfactoriness is what distinguishes the true from the false But satisfactoriness is both a subjective quality and a present one Ergo the critics appear to reason an object qua true must always for humanism be both present and subjective and a humanist s belief can never be in anything that lives outside of the belief itself or ante dates it Why so preposterous a charge should be so current I find it hard to say Nothing is more obvious than the fact that both the objective and the past existence of the object may be the very things about it that most seem satisfactory and that most invite us to believe them The past tense can figure in the humanist s world as well of belief as of representation quite as harmoniously as in the world of any one else mister Joseph gives a special turn to this accusation He charges me one hundred thirty three with being self contradictory when I say that the main categories of thought were evolved in the course of experience itself For I use these very categories to define the course of experience by Experience as I talk about it is a product of their use and yet I take it as true anteriorly to them This seems to mister Joseph to be an absurdity I hope it does not seem such to his readers for if experiences can suggest hypotheses at all and they notoriously do so I can see no absurdity whatever in the notion of a retrospective hypothesis having for its object the very train of experiences by which its own being along with that of other things has been brought about If the hypothesis is satisfactory we must of course believe it to have been true anteriorly to its formulation by ourselves Every explanation of a present by a past seems to involve this kind of circle which is not a vicious circle The past is causa existendi of the present which in turn is causa cognoscendi of the past If the present were treated as causa existendi of the past the circle might indeed be vicious Closely connected with this pseudo difficulty is another one of wider scope and greater complication more excusable therefore one hundred thirty four Humanism namely asking how truth in point of fact is reached and seeing that it is by ever substituting more satisfactory for less satisfactory opinions is thereby led into a vague historic sketch of truth s development The earliest opinions it thinks must have been dim unconnected feelings and only little by little did more and more orderly views of things replace them Our own retrospective view of this whole evolution is now let us say the latest candidate for truth as yet reached in the process To be a satisfactory candidate it must give some definite sort of a picture of what forces keep the process going On the subjective side we have a fairly definite picture sensation association interest hypothesis these account in a general way for the growth into a cosmos of the relative chaos with which the mind began But on the side of the object so to call it roughly our view is much less satisfactory Of which of our many objects are we to believe that it truly was there and at work before the human mind began Time space kind number serial order cause consciousness are hard things not to objectify even transcendental idealism leaves them standing as empirically real Substance matter force fall down more easily before criticism and secondary qualities make almost no resistance at all Nevertheless when we survey the field of speculation from Scholasticism through Kantism to Spencerism we find an ever recurring tendency to convert the pre human into a merely logical object an unknowable ding an sich that but starts the process or a vague materia prima that but receives our forms one hundred thirty five The reasons for this are not so much logical as they are material We can postulate an extra mental that freely enough though some idealists have denied us the privilege but when we have done so the what of it is hard to determine satisfactorily because of the oppositions and entanglements of the variously proposed whats with one another and with the history of the human mind The literature of speculative cosmology bears witness to this difficulty Humanism suffers from it no more than any other philosophy suffers but it makes all our cosmogonic theories so unsatisfactory that some thinkers seek relief in the denial of any primal dualism Absolute Thought or pure experience is postulated and endowed with attributes calculated to justify the belief that it may run itself Both these truth claiming hypotheses are non dualistic in the old mind and matter sense but the one is monistic and the other pluralistic as to the world process itself Some humanists are non dualists of this sort I myself am one und zwar of the pluralistic brand But doubtless dualistic humanists also exist as well as non dualistic ones of the monistic wing mister Joseph pins these general philosophic difficulties on humanism alone or possibly on me alone My article spoke vaguely of a most chaotic pure experience coming first and building up the mind one hundred thirty six But how can two structureless things interact so as to produce a structure my critic triumphantly asks Of course they can t as purely so named entities We must make additional hypotheses We must beg a minimum of structure for them The kind of minimum that might have tended to increase towards what we now find actually developed is the philosophical desideratum here The question is that of the most materially satisfactory hypothesis mister Joseph handles it by formal logic purely as if he had no acquaintance with the logic of hypothesis at all mister Joseph again is much bewildered as to what a humanist can mean when he uses the word knowledge He tries to convict me one hundred thirty seven of vaguely identifying it with any kind of good Knowledge is a difficult thing to define briefly and mister Joseph shows his own constructive hand here even less than in the rest of his article I have myself put forth on several occasions a radically pragmatist account of knowledge one hundred thirty eight the existence of which account my critic probably does not know of so perhaps I had better not say anything about knowledge until he reads and attacks that I will say however that whatever the relation called knowing may itself prove to consist in I can think of no conceivable kind of object which may not become an object of knowledge on humanistic principles as well as on the principles of any other philosophy one hundred thirty nine I confess that I am pretty steadily hampered by the habit on the part of humanism s critics of assuming that they have truer ideas than mine of truth and knowledge the nature of which I must know of and can not need to have re defined I have consequently to reconstruct these ideas in order to carry on the discussion I have e g had to do so in some parts of this article and I thereby expose myself to charges of caricature In one part of mister Joseph s attack however I rejoice that we are free from this embarrassment It is an important point and covers probably a genuine difficulty so I take it up last When following Schiller and Dewey I define the true as that which gives the maximal combination of satisfactions and say that satisfaction is a many dimensional term that can be realized in various ways mister Joseph replies rightly enough that the chief satisfaction of a rational creature must always be his thought that what he believes is true whether the truth brings him the satisfaction of collateral profits or not This would seem however to make of truth the prior concept and to relegate satisfaction to a secondary place Again if to be satisfactory is what is meant by being true whose satisfactions and which of his satisfactions are to count Discriminations notoriously have to be made and the upshot is that only rational candidates and intellectual satisfactions stand the test We are then driven to a purely theoretic notion of truth and get out of the pragmatic atmosphere altogether And with this mister Joseph leaves us truth is truth and there is an end of the matter But he makes a very pretty show of convicting me of self stultification in according to our purely theoretic satisfactions any place in the humanistic scheme They crowd the collateral satisfactions out of house and home he thinks and pragmatism has to go into bankruptcy if she recognizes them at all There is no room for disagreement about the facts here but the destructive force of the reasoning disappears as soon as we talk concretely instead of abstractly and ask in our quality of good pragmatists just what the famous theoretic needs are known as and in what the intellectual satisfactions consist mister Joseph faithful to the habits of his party makes no attempt at characterizing them but assumes that their nature is self evident to all Are they not all mere matters of consistency and emphatically not of consistency between an Absolute Reality and the mind s copies of it but of actually felt consistency among judgments objects and manners of reacting in the mind And are not both our need of such consistency and our pleasure in it conceivable as outcomes of the natural fact that we are beings that develop mental habits habit itself proving adaptively beneficial in an environment where the same objects or the same kinds of objects recur and follow law If this were so what would have come first would have been the collateral profits of habit and the theoretic life would have grown up in aid of these In point of fact this seems to have been the probable case At life s origin any present perception may have been true if such a word could then be applicable Later when reactions became organized the reactions became true whenever expectation was fulfilled by them Otherwise they were false or mistaken reactions But the same class of objects needs the same kind of reaction so the impulse to react consistently must gradually have been established with a disappointment felt whenever the results frustrated expectation Here is a perfectly plausible germ for all our higher consistencies Nowadays if an object claims from us a reaction of the kind habitually accorded only to the opposite class of objects our mental machinery refuses to run smoothly The situation is intellectually unsatisfactory To gain relief we seek either to preserve the reaction by re interpreting the object or leaving the object as it is we react in a way contrary to the way claimed of us Neither solution is easy Such a situation might be that of mister Joseph with me claiming assent to humanism from him He can not apperceive it so as to permit him to gratify my claim but there is enough appeal in the claim to induce him to write a whole article in justification of his refusal If he should assent to humanism on the other hand that would drag after it an unwelcome yea incredible alteration of his previous mental beliefs Whichever alternative he might adopt however a new equilibrium of intellectual consistency would in the end be reached He would feel whichever way he decided that he was now thinking truly But if with his old habits unaltered he should simply add to them the new one of advocating humanism quietly or noisily his mind would be rent into two systems each of which would accuse the other of falsehood The resultant situation being profoundly unsatisfactory would also be instable Theoretic truth is thus no relation between our mind and archetypal reality It falls within the mind being the accord of some of its processes and objects with other processes and objects accord consisting here in well definable relations So long as the satisfaction of feeling such an accord is denied us whatever collateral profits may seem to inure from what we believe in are but as dust in the balance provided always that we are highly organized intellectually which the majority of us are not The amount of accord which satisfies most men and women is merely the absence of violent clash between their usual thoughts and statements and the limited sphere of sense perceptions in which their lives are cast The theoretic truth that most of us think we ought to attain to is thus the possession of a set of predicates that do not contradict their subjects We preserve it as often as not by leaving other predicates and subjects out In some men theory is a passion just as music is in others The form of inner consistency is pursued far beyond the line at which collateral profits stop Such men systematize and classify and schematize and make synoptical tables and invent ideal objects for the pure love of unifying Too often the results glowing with truth for the inventors seem pathetically personal and artificial to bystanders Which is as much as to say that the purely theoretic criterion of truth can leave us in the lurch as easily as any other criterion I think that if mister Joseph will but consider all these things a little more concretely he may find that the humanistic scheme and the notion of theoretic truth fall into line consistently enough to yield him also intellectual satisfaction FOOTNOTES one hundred twenty nine Reprinted without change from Mind N S vol XIV No fifty four

seeker of truth can fail to rejoice at the terre a terre sort of discussion of the issues between Empiricism and Transcendentalism or as the champions of the latter would probably prefer to say between Irrationalism and Rationalism that seems to have begun in Mind one hundred forty one It would seem as if over concrete examples like mister J S Haldane s both parties ought inevitably to come to a better understanding As a reader with a strong bias towards Irrationalism I have studied his article one hundred forty two with the liveliest admiration of its temper and its painstaking effort to be clear But the cases discussed failed to satisfy me and I was at first tempted to write a Note animadverting upon them in detail The growth of the limb the sea s contour the vicarious functioning of the nerve centre the digitalis curing the heart are unfortunately not cases where we can see any through and through conditioning of the parts by the whole They are all cases of reciprocity where subjects supposed independently to exist acquire certain attributes through their relations to other subjects That they also exist through similar relations is only an ideal supposition not verified to our understanding in these or any other concrete cases whatsoever If however one were to urge this solemnly mister Haldane s friends could easily reply that he only gave us such examples on account of the hardness of our hearts He knew full well their imperfection but he hoped that to those who would not spontaneously ascend to the Notion of the Totality these cases might prove a spur and suggest and symbolize something better than themselves No particular case that can be brought forward is a real concrete They are all abstractions from the Whole and of course the through and through character can not be found in them Each of them still contains among its elements what we call things grammatical subjects forming a sort of residual caput mortuum of Existence after all the relations that figure in the examples have been told off On this existence thinks popular philosophy things may live on like the winter bears on their own fat never entering relations at all or if entering them entering an entirely different set of them from those treated of in mister Haldane s examples Thus if the digitalis were to weaken instead of strengthening the heart and to produce death as sometimes happens it would determine itself through determining the organism to the function of kill instead of that of cure The function and relation seem adventitious depending on what kind of a heart the digitalis gets hold of the digitalis and the heart being facts external and so to speak accidental to each other But this popular view mister Haldane s friends will continue is an illusion What seems to us the existence of digitalis and heart outside of the relations of killing or curing is but a function in a wider system of relations of which pro hac vice we take no account The larger system determines the existence just as absolutely as the system kill or the system cure determined the function of the digitalis Ascend to the absolute system instead of biding with these relative and partial ones and you shall see that the law of through and throughness must and does obtain Of course this argument is entirely reasonable and debars us completely from chopping logic about the concrete examples mister Haldane has chosen It is not his fault if his categories are so fine an instrument that nothing but the sum total of things can be taken to show us the manner of their use It is simply our misfortune that he has not the sum total of things to show it by Let us fall back from all concrete attempts and see what we can do with his notion of through and throughness avowedly taken in abstracto In abstract systems the through and through Ideal is realized on every hand In any system as such the members are only members in the system Abolish the system and you abolish its members for you have conceived them through no other property than the abstract one of membership Neither rightness nor leftness except through bi laterality Neither mortgager nor mortgagee except through mortgage The logic of these cases is this If A then B but if B then A wherefore if either Both and if not Both Nothing It costs nothing not even a mental effort to admit that the absolute totality of things may be organized exactly after the pattern of one of these through and through abstractions In fact it is the pleasantest and freest of mental movements Husband makes and is made by wife through marriage one makes other by being itself other everything self created through its opposite you go round like a squirrel in a cage But if you stop and reflect upon what you are about you lay bare the exact point at issue between common sense and the through and through school What in fact is the logic of these abstract systems It is as we said above If any Member then the Whole System if not the Whole System then Nothing But how can Logic possibly do anything more with these two hypotheses than combine them into the single disjunctive proposition Either this Whole System just as it stands or Nothing at all Is not that disjunction the ultimate word of Logic in the matter and can any disjunction as such resolve itself It may be that mister Haldane sees how one horn the concept of the Whole System carries real existence with it But if he has been as unsuccessful as I in assimilating the Hegelian re editings of the Anselmian proof one hundred forty three he will have to say that though Logic may determine what the system must be if it is something else than Logic must tell us that it is mister Haldane in this case would probably consciously or unconsciously make an appeal to Fact the disjunction is decided since nobody can dispute that now as a matter of fact something and not nothing is We must therefore he would probably say go on to admit the Whole System in the desiderated sense Is not then the validity of the Anselmian proof the nucleus of the whole question between Logic and Fact Ought not the efforts of mister Haldane and his friends to be principally devoted to its elucidation Is it not the real door of separation between Empiricism and Rationalism And if the Rationalists leave that door for a moment off its hinges can any power keep that abstract opaque unmediated external irrational and irresponsible monster known to the vulgar as bare Fact from getting in and contaminating the whole sanctuary with his presence Can anything prevent Faust from changing Am Anfang war das Wort into Am Anfang war die That Nothing in earth or heaven Only the Anselmian proof can keep Fact out of philosophy The question Shall Fact be recognized as an ultimate principle is the whole issue between the Rationalists and the Empiricism of vulgar thought Of course if so recognized Fact sets a limit to the through and through character of the world s rationality That rationality might then mediate between all the members of our conception of the world but not between the conception itself and reality Reality would have to be given not by Reason but by Fact Fact holds out blankly brutally and blindly against that universal deliquescence of everything into logical relations which the Absolutist Logic demands and it is the only thing that does hold out Hence the ire of the Absolutist Logic hence its non recognition its cutting of Fact The reasons it gives for the cutting are that Fact is speechless a mere word for the negation of thought a vacuous unknowability a dog in the manger in truth which having no rights of its own can find nothing else to do than to keep its betters out of theirs There are two points involved here first the claim that certain things have rights that are absolute ubiquitous and all pervasive and in regard to which nothing else can possibly exist in its own right and second that anything that denies this assertion is pure negativity with no positive context whatsoever Take the latter point first Is it true that what is negative in one way is thereby convicted of incapacity to be positive in any other way The word Fact is like the word Accident like the word Absolute itself They all have their negative connotation In truth their whole connotation is negative and relative All it says is that whatever the thing may be that is denoted by the words other things do not control it Where fact where accident is they must be silent it alone can speak But that does not prevent its speaking as loudly as you please in its own tongue It may have an inward life self transparent and active in the maximum degree An indeterminate future volition on my part for example would be a strict accident as far as my present self is concerned But that could not prevent it in the moment in which it occurred from being possibly the most intensely living and luminous experience I ever had Its quality of being a brute fact ab extra says nothing whatever as to its inwardness It simply says to outsiders Hands off And this brings us back to the first point of the Absolutist indictment of Fact Is that point really anything more than a fantastic dislike to letting anything say Hands off What else explains the contempt the Absolutist authors exhibit for a freedom defined simply on its negative side as freedom from et cetera What else prompts them to deride such freedom But dislike for dislike who shall decide Why is not their dislike at having me from them entirely on a par with mine at having them through me I know very well that in talking of dislikes to those who never mention them I am doing a very coarse thing and making a sort of intellectual Orson of myself But for the life of me I can not help it because I feel sure that likes and dislikes must be among the ultimate factors of their philosophy as well as of mine Would they but admit it How sweetly we then could hold converse together There is something finite about us both as we now stand We do not know the Absolute Whole yet Part of it is still negative to us Among the whats of it still stalks a mob of opaque thats without which we cannot think But just as I admit that this is all possibly provisional that even the Anselmian proof may come out all right and creation may be a rational system through and through why might they not also admit that it may all be otherwise and that the shadow the opacity the negativity the from ness the plurality that is ultimate may never be wholly driven from the scene We should both then be avowedly making hypotheses playing with Ideals Ah Why is the notion of hypothesis so abhorrent to the Hegelian mind And once down on our common level of hypothesis we might then admit scepticism since the Whole is not yet revealed to be the soundest logical position But since we are in the main not sceptics we might go on and frankly confess to each other the motives for our several faiths I frankly confess mine I can not but think that at bottom they are of an aesthetic and not of a logical sort The through and through universe seems to suffocate me with its infallible impeccable all pervasiveness Its necessity with no possibilities its relations with no subjects make me feel as if I had entered into a contract with no reserved rights or rather as if I had to live in a large seaside boarding house with no private bed room in which I might take refuge from the society of the place I am distinctly aware moreover that the old quarrel of sinner and pharisee has something to do with the matter Certainly to my personal knowledge all Hegelians are not prigs but I somehow feel as if all prigs ought to end if developed by becoming Hegelians There is a story of two clergymen asked by mistake to conduct the same funeral One came first and had got no farther than I am the Resurrection and the Life when the other entered I am the Resurrection and the Life cried the latter The through and through philosophy as it actually exists reminds many of us of that clergyman It seems too buttoned up and white chokered and clean shaven a thing to speak for the vast slow breathing unconscious Kosmos with its dread abysses and its unknown tides The freedom we want to see there is not the freedom with a string tied to its leg and warranted not to fly away of that philosophy Let it fly away we say from us What then Again I know I am exhibiting my mental grossness But again Ich kann nicht anders I show my feelings why will they not show theirs I know they have a personal feeling about the through and through universe which is entirely different from mine and which I should very likely be much the better for gaining if they would only show me how Their persistence in telling me that feeling has nothing to do with the question that it is a pure matter of absolute reason keeps me for ever out of the pale Still seeing a that in things which Logic does not expel the most I can do is to aspire to the expulsion At present I do not even aspire Aspiration is a feeling What can kindle feeling but the example of feeling And if the Hegelians will refuse to set an example what can they expect the rest of us to do To speak more seriously the one fundamental quarrel Empiricism has with Absolutism is over this repudiation by Absolutism of the personal and aesthetic factor in the construction of philosophy That we all of us have feelings Empiricism feels quite sure That they may be as prophetic and anticipatory of truth as anything else we have and some of them more so than others can not possibly be denied But what hope is there of squaring and settling opinions unless Absolutism will hold parley on this common ground and will admit that all philosophies are hypotheses to which all our faculties emotional as well as logical help us and the truest of which will at the final integration of things be found in possession of the men whose faculties on the whole had the best divining power FOOTNOTES one hundred forty Reprinted from Mind vol IX No thirty four April eighteen eighty four one hundred forty one In eighteen eighty four one
