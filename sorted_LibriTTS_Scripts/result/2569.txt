VOLUME one Produced by An Anonymous Project Gutenberg Volunteer THE DAY S WORK By Rudyard Kipling CONTENTS THE BRIDGE BUILDERS A WALKING DELEGATE THE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF THE TOMB OF HIS ANCESTORS THE DEVIL AND THE DEEP SEA WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR seven THE MALTESE CAT BREAD UPON THE WATERS AN ERROR IN THE FOURTH DIMENSION MY SUNDAY AT HOME THE BRUSHWOOD BOY THE BRIDGE BUILDERS The least that Findlayson of the Public Works Department expected was a C I E he dreamed of a C S I indeed his friends told him that he deserved more For three years he had endured heat and cold disappointment discomfort danger and disease with responsibility almost too heavy for one pair of shoulders and day by day through that time the great Kashi Bridge over the Ganges had grown under his charge Now in less than three months if all went well his Excellency the Viceroy would open the bridge in state an archbishop would bless it and the first trainload of soldiers would come over it and there would be speeches Findlayson C E sat in his trolley on a construction line that ran along one of the main revetments the huge stone faced banks that flared away north and south for three miles on either side of the river and permitted himself to think of the end With its approaches his work was one mile and three quarters fin length a lattice girder bridge trussed with the Findlayson truss standing on seven and twenty brick pies Each one of those piers was twenty four feet in diameter capped with red Agra stone and sunk eighty feet below the shifting sand of the Ganges bed Above them was a railway line fifteen feet broad above that again a cart road of eighteen feet flanked with footpaths At either end rose towers of red brick loopholed for musketry and pierced for big guns and the ramp of the road was being pushed forward to their haunches The raw earth ends were crawling and alive with hundreds upon hundreds of tiny asses climbing out of the yawning borrow pit below with sackfuls of stuff and the hot afternoon air was filled with the noise of hooves the rattle of the drivers sticks and the swish and roll down of the dirt The river was very low and on the dazzling white sand between the three centre piers stood squat cribs of railway sleepers filled within and daubed without with mud to support the last of the girders as those were riveted up In the little deep water left by the drought an overhead crane travelled to and fro along its spile pier jerking sections of iron into place snorting and backing and grunting as an elephant grunts in the timber yard Riveters by the hundred swarmed about the lattice side work and the iron roof of the railway line hung from invisible staging under the bellies of the girders clustered round the throats of the piers and rode on the overhang of the footpath stanchions their fire pots and the spurts of flame that answered each hammer stroke showing no more than pale yellow in the sun s glare East and west and north and south the construction trains rattled and shrieked up and down the embankments the piled trucks of brown and white stone banging behind them till the side boards were unpinned and with a roar and a grumble a few thousand tons more material were flung out to hold the river in place Findlayson C E turned on his trolley and looked over the face of the country that he had changed for seven miles around Looked back on the humming village of five thousand workmen up stream and down along the vista of spurs and sand across the river to the far piers lessening in the haze overhead to the guard towers and only he knew how strong those were and with a sigh of contentment saw that his work was good There stood his bridge before him in the sunlight lacking only a few weeks work on the girders of the three middle piers his bridge raw and ugly as original sin but pukka permanent to endure when all memory of the builder yea even of the splendid Findlayson truss had perished Practically the thing was done Hitchcock his assistant cantered along the line on a little switch tailed Kabuli pony who through long practice could have trotted securely over a trestle and nodded to his chief All but said he with a smile I ve been thinking about it the senior answered Not half a bad job for two men is it One and a half Gad what a Cooper s Hill cub I was when I came on the works Hitchcock felt very old in the crowded experiences of the past three years that had taught him power and responsibility You were rather a colt said Findlayson I wonder how you ll like going back to office work when this job s over I shall hate it said the young man and as he went on his eye followed Findlayson s and he muttered Isn t it damned good I think we ll go up the service together Findlayson said to himself You re too good a youngster to waste on another man Cub thou wart assistant thou art Personal assistant and at Simla thou shalt be if any credit comes to me out of the business Indeed the burden of the work had fallen altogether on Findlayson and his assistant the young man whom he had chosen because of his rawness to break to his own needs There were labour contractors by the half hundred fitters and riveters European borrowed from the railway workshops with perhaps twenty white and half caste subordinates to direct under direction the bevies of workmen but none knew better than these two who trusted each other how the underlings were not to be trusted They had been tried many times in sudden crises by slipping of booms by breaking of tackle failure of cranes and the wrath of the river but no stress had brought to light any man among men whom Findlayson and Hitchcock would have honoured by working as remorselessly as they worked themselves Findlayson thought it over from the beginning the months of office work destroyed at a blow when the Government of India at the last moment added two feet to the width of the bridge under the impression that bridges were cut out of paper and so brought to ruin at least half an acre of calculations and Hitchcock new to disappointment buried his head in his arms and wept the heart breaking delays over the filling of the contracts in England the futile correspondences hinting at great wealth of commissions if one only one rather doubtful consignment were passed the war that followed the refusal the careful polite obstruction at the other end that followed the war till young Hitchcock putting one month s leave to another month and borrowing ten days from Findlayson spent his poor little savings of a year in a wild dash to London and there as his own tongue asserted and the later consignments proved put the fear of God into a man so great that he feared only Parliament and said so till Hitchcock wrought with him across his own dinner table and he feared the Kashi Bridge and all who spoke in its name Then there was the cholera that came in the night to the village by the bridge works and after the cholera smote the Smallpox The fever they had always with them Hitchcock had been appointed a magistrate of the third class with whipping powers for the better government of the community and Findlayson watched him wield his powers temperately learning what to overlook and what to look after It was a long long reverie and it covered storm sudden freshets death in every manner and shape violent and awful rage against red tape half frenzying a mind that knows it should be busy on other things drought sanitation finance birth wedding burial and riot in the village of twenty warring castes argument expostulation persuasion and the blank despair that a man goes to bed upon thankful that his rifle is all in pieces in the gun case Behind everything rose the black frame of the Kashi Bridge plate by plate girder by girder span by span and each pier of it recalled Hitchcock the all round man who had stood by his chief without failing from the very first to this last So the bridge was two men s work unless one counted Peroo as Peroo certainly counted himself He was a Lascar a Kharva from Bulsar familiar with every port between Rockhampton and London who had risen to the rank of sarang on the British India boats but wearying of routine musters and clean clothes had thrown up the service and gone inland where men of his calibre were sure of employment For his knowledge of tackle and the handling of heavy weights Peroo was worth almost any price he might have chosen to put upon his services but custom decreed the wage of the overhead men and Peroo was not within many silver pieces of his proper value Neither running water nor extreme heights made him afraid and as an ex serang he knew how to hold authority No piece of iron was so big or so badly placed that Peroo could not devise a tackle to lift it a loose ended sagging arrangement rigged with a scandalous amount of talking but perfectly equal to the work in hand It was Peroo who had saved the girder of Number Seven pier from destruction when the new wire rope jammed in the eye of the crane and the huge plate tilted in its slings threatening to slide out sideways Then the native workmen lost their heads with great shoutings and Hitchcock s right arm was broken by a falling T plate and he buttoned it up in his coat and swooned and came to and directed for four hours till Peroo from the top of the crane reported All s well and the plate swung home There was no one like Peroo serang to lash and guy and hold to control the donkey engines to hoist a fallen locomotive craftily out of the borrow pit into which it had tumbled to strip and dive if need be to see how the concrete blocks round the piers stood the scouring of Mother Gunga or to adventure up stream on a monsoon night and report on the state of the embankment facings He would interrupt the field councils of Findlayson and Hitchcock without fear till his wonderful English or his still more wonderful lingua franca half Portuguese and half Malay ran out and he was forced to take string and show the knots that he would recommend He controlled his own gang of tacklemen mysterious relatives from Kutch Mandvi gathered month by month and tried to the uttermost No consideration of family or kin allowed Peroo to keep weak hands or a giddy head on the pay roll My honour is the honour of this bridge he would say to the about to be dismissed What do I care for your honour Go and work on a steamer That is all you are fit for The little cluster of huts where he and his gang lived centred round the tattered dwelling of a sea priest one who had never set foot on black water but had been chosen as ghostly counsellor by two generations of sea rovers all unaffected by port missions or those creeds which are thrust upon sailors by agencies along Thames bank The priest of the Lascara had nothing to do with their caste or indeed with anything at all He ate the offerings of his church and slept and smoked and slept again for said Peroo who had haled him a thousand miles inland he is a very holy man He never cares what you eat so long as you do not eat beef and that is good because on land we worship Shiva we Kharvas but at sea on the Kumpani s boats we attend strictly to the orders of the Burra Malum the first mate and on this bridge we observe what Finlinson Sahib says Finlinson Sahib had that day given orders to clear the scaffolding from the guard tower on the right bank and Peroo with his mates was casting loose and lowering down the bamboo poles and planks as swiftly as ever they had whipped the cargo out of a coaster From his trolley he could hear the whistle of the serang s silver pipe and the creak and clatter of the pulleys Peroo was standing on the topmost coping of the tower clad in the blue dungaree of his abandoned service and as Findlayson motioned to him to be careful for his was no life to throw away he gripped the last pole and shading his eyes ship fashion answered with the long drawn wail of the fo c sle lookout Ham dekhta hai I am looking out Findlayson laughed and then sighed It was years since he had seen a steamer and he was sick for home As his trolley passed under the tower Peroo descended by a rope ape fashion and cried It looks well now Sahib Our bridge is all but done What think you Mother Gunga will say when the rail runs over She has said little so far It was never Mother Gunga that delayed us There is always time for her and none the less there has been delay Has the Sahib forgotten last autumn s flood when the stoneboats were sunk without warning or only a half day s warning Yes but nothing save a big flood could hurt us now The spurs are holding well on the west bank Mother Gunga eats great allowances There is always room for more stone on the revetments I tell this to the Chota Sahib he meant Hitchcock and he laughs No matter Peroo Another year thou wilt be able to build a bridge in thine own fashion The Lascar grinned Then it will not be in this way with stonework sunk under water as the Quetta was sunk I like sus suspen sheen bridges that fly from bank to bank with one big step like a gang plank Then no water can hurt When does the Lord Sahib come to open the bridge In three months when the weather is cooler Ho ho He is like the Burra Malum He sleeps below while the work is being done Then he comes upon the quarter deck and touches with his finger and says This is not clean Dam jibboonwallah But the Lord Sahib does not call me a dam jibboonwallah Peroo No Sahib but he does not come on deck till the work is all finished Even the Burra Malum of the Nerbudda said once at Tuticorin Bah Go I am busy I also said Peroo with an unshaken countenance May I take the light dinghy now and row along the spurs To hold them with thy hands They are I think sufficiently heavy Nay Sahib It is thus At sea on the Black Water we have room to be blown up and down without care Here we have no room at all Look you we have put the river into a dock and run her between stone sills Findlayson smiled at the we We have bitted and bridled her She is not like the sea that can beat against a soft beach She is Mother Gunga in irons His voice fell a little Peroo thou hast been up and down the world more even than I Speak true talk now How much dolt thou in thy heart believe of Mother Gunga All that our priest says London is London Sahib Sydney is Sydney and Port Darwin is Port Darwin Also Mother Gunga is Mother Gunga and when I come back to her banks I know this and worship In London I did poojah to the big temple by the river for the sake of the God within Yes I will not take the cushions in the dinghy Findlayson mounted his horse and trotted to the shed of a bungalow that he shared with his assistant The place had become home to him in the last three years He had grilled in the heat sweated in the rains and shivered with fever under the rude thatch roof the lime wash beside the door was covered with rough drawings and formulae and the sentry path trodden in the matting of the verandah showed where he had walked alone There is no eight hour limit to an engineer s work and the evening meal with Hitchcock was eaten booted and spurred over their cigars they listened to the hum of the village as the gangs came up from the river bed and the lights began to twinkle Peroo has gone up the spurs in your dinghy He s taken a couple of nephews with him and he s lolling in the stern like a commodore said Hitchcock That s all right He s got something on his mind You d think that ten years in the British India boats would have knocked most of his religion out of him So it has said Hitchcock chuckling I overheard him the other day in the middle of a most atheistical talk with that fat old guru of theirs Peroo denied the efficacy of prayer and wanted the guru to go to sea and watch a gale out with him and see if he could stop a monsoon All the same if you carried off his gurus he d leave us like a shot He was yarning away to me about praying to the dome of saint Paul s when he was in London He told me that the first time he went into the engine room of a steamer when he was a boy he prayed to the low pressure cylinder Not half a bad thing to pray to either He s propitiating his own Gods now and he wants to know what Mother Gunga will think of a bridge being run across her Who s there A shadow darkened the doorway and a telegram was put into Hitchcock s hand She ought to be pretty well used to it by this time Only a tar It ought to be Ralli s answer about the new rivets Great Heavens Hitchcock jumped to his feet What is it said the senior and took the form That s what Mother Gunga thinks is it he said reading Keep cool young un We ve got all our work cut out for us Let s see Muir wired half an hour ago Floods on the Ramgunga Look out Well that gives us one two nine and a half for the flood to reach Melipur Ghaut and seven s sixteen and a half to Lataoli say fifteen hours before it comes down to us Curse that hill fed sewer of a Ramgunga Findlayson this is two months before anything could have been expected and the left bank is littered up with stuff still Two full months before the time That s why it comes I ve only known Indian rivers for five and twenty years and I don t pretend to understand Here comes another tar Findlayson opened the telegram Cockran this time from the Ganges Canal Heavy rains here Bad He might have saved the last word Well we don t want to know any more We ve got to work the gangs all night and clean up the river bed You ll take the east bank and work out to meet me in the middle Get every thing that floats below the bridge we shall have quite enough rivercraft coming down adrift anyhow without letting the stone boats ram the piers What have you got on the east bank that needs looking after Pontoon one big pontoon with the overhead crane on it T other overhead crane on the mended pontoon with the cart road rivets from Twenty to Twenty three piers two construction lines and a turning spur The pilework must take its chance said Hitchcock All right Roll up everything you can lay hands on We ll give the gang fifteen minutes more to eat their grub Close to the verandah stood a big night gong never used except for flood or fire in the village Hitchcock had called for a fresh horse and was off to his side of the bridge when Findlayson took the cloth bound stick and smote with the rubbing stroke that brings out the full thunder of the metal Long before the last rumble ceased every night gong in the village had taken up the warning To these were added the hoarse screaming of conches in the little temples the throbbing of drums and tom toms and from the European quarters where the riveters lived McCartney s bugle a weapon of offence on Sundays and festivals brayed desperately calling to Stables Engine after engine toiling home along the spurs at the end of her day s work whistled in answer till the whistles were answered from the far bank Then the big gong thundered thrice for a sign that it was flood and not fire conch drum and whistle echoed the call and the village quivered to the sound of bare feet running upon soft earth The order in all cases was to stand by the day s work and wait instructions The gangs poured by in the dusk men stopping to knot a loin cloth or fasten a sandal gang foremen shouting to their subordinates as they ran or paused by the tool issue sheds for bars and mattocks locomotives creeping down their tracks wheel deep in the crowd till the brown torrent disappeared into the dusk of the river bed raced over the pilework swarmed along the lattices clustered by the cranes and stood still each man in his place Then the troubled beating of the gong carried the order to take up everything and bear it beyond highwater mark and the flare lamps broke out by the hundred between the webs of dull iron as the riveters began a night s work racing against the flood that was to come The girders of the three centre piers those that stood on the cribs were all but in position They needed just as many rivets as could be driven into them for the flood would assuredly wash out their supports and the ironwork would settle down on the caps of stone if they were not blocked at the ends A hundred crowbars strained at the sleepers of the temporary line that fed the unfinished piers It was heaved up in lengths loaded into trucks and backed up the bank beyond flood level by the groaning locomotives The tool sheds on the sands melted away before the attack of shouting armies and with them went the stacked ranks of Government stores iron bound boxes of rivets pliers cutters duplicate parts of the riveting machines spare pumps and chains The big crane would be the last to be shifted for she was hoisting all the heavy stuff up to the main structure of the bridge The concrete blocks on the fleet of stone boats were dropped overside where there was any depth of water to guard the piers and the empty boats themselves were poled under the bridge down stream It was here that Peroo s pipe shrilled loudest for the first stroke of the big gong had brought the dinghy back at racing speed and Peroo and his people were stripped to the waist working for the honour and credit which are better than life I knew she would speak he cried I knew but the telegraph gives us good warning O sons of unthinkable begetting children of unspeakable shame are we here for the look of the thing It was two feet of wire rope frayed at the ends and it did wonders as Peroo leaped from gunnel to gunnel shouting the language of the sea Findlayson was more troubled for the stone boats than anything else McCartney with his gangs was blocking up the ends of the three doubtful spans but boats adrift if the flood chanced to be a high one might endanger the girders and there was a very fleet in the shrunken channel Get them behind the swell of the guard tower he shouted down to Peroo It will be dead water there Get them below the bridge Accha Very good I know we are mooring them with wire rope was the answer Heh I Listen to the Chota Sahib He is working hard From across the river came an almost continuous whistling of locomotives backed by the rumble of stone Hitchcock at the last minute was spending a few hundred more trucks of Tarakee stone in reinforcing his spurs and embankments The bridge challenges Mother Gunga said Peroo with a laugh But when she talks I know whose voice will be the loudest For hours the naked men worked screaming and shouting under the lights It was a hot moonless night the end of it was darkened by clouds and a sudden squall that made Findlayson very grave She moves said Peroo just before the dawn Mother Gunga is awake Hear He dipped his hand over the side of a boat and the current mumbled on it A little wave hit the side of a pier with a crisp slap Six hours before her time said Findlayson mopping his forehead savagely Now we can t depend on anything We d better clear all hands out of the river bed Again the big gong beat and a second time there was the rushing of naked feet on earth and ringing iron the clatter of tools ceased In the silence men heard the dry yawn of water crawling over thirsty sand Foreman after foreman shouted to Findlayson who had posted himself by the guard tower that his section of the river bed had been cleaned out and when the last voice dropped Findlayson hurried over the bridge till the iron plating of the permanent way gave place to the temporary plank walk over the three centre piers and there he met Hitchcock All clear your side said Findlayson The whisper rang in the box of latticework Yes and the east channel s filling now We re utterly out of our reckoning When is this thing down on us There s no saying She s filling as fast as she can Look Findlayson pointed to the planks below his feet where the sand burned and defiled by months of work was beginning to whisper and fizz What orders said Hitchcock Call the roll count stores sit on your hunkers and pray for the bridge That s all I can think of Good night Don t risk your life trying to fish out anything that may go down stream Oh I ll be as prudent as you are Night Heavens how she s filling Here s the rain in earnest Findlayson picked his way back to his bank sweeping the last of McCartney s riveters before him The gangs had spread themselves along the embankments regardless of the cold rain of the dawn and there they waited for the flood Only Peroo kept his men together behind the swell of the guard tower where the stone boats lay tied fore and aft with hawsers wire rope and chains A shrill wail ran along the line growing to a yell half fear and half wonder the face of the river whitened from bank to bank between the stone facings and the faraway spurs went out in spouts of foam Mother Gunga had come bank high in haste and a wall of chocolate coloured water was her messenger There was a shriek above the roar of the water the complaint of the spans coming down on their blocks as the cribs were whirled out from under their bellies The stone boats groaned and ground each other in the eddy that swung round the abutment and their clumsy masts rose higher and higher against the dim sky line Before she was shut between these walls we knew what she would do Now she is thus cramped God only knows what she will do said Peroo watching the furious turmoil round the guard tower Ohe Fight then Fight hard for it is thus that a woman wears herself out But Mother Gunga would not fight as Peroo desired After the first down stream plunge there came no more walls of water but the river lifted herself bodily as a snake when she drinks in midsummer plucking and fingering along the revetments and banking up behind the piers till even Findlayson began to recalculate the strength of his work When day came the village gasped Only last night men said turning to each other it was as a town in the river bed Look now And they looked and wondered afresh at the deep water the racing water that licked the throat of the piers The farther bank was veiled by rain into which the bridge ran out and vanished the spurs up stream were marked by no more than eddies and spoutings and down stream the pent river once freed of her guide lines had spread like a sea to the horizon Then hurried by rolling in the water dead men and oxen together with here and there a patch of thatched roof that melted when it touched a pier Big flood said Peroo and Findlayson nodded It was as big a flood as he had any wish to watch His bridge would stand what was upon her now but not very much more and if by any of a thousand chances there happened to be a weakness in the embankments Mother Gunga would carry his honour to the sea with the other raffle Worst of all there was nothing to do except to sit still and Findlayson sat still under his macintosh till his helmet became pulp on his head and his boots were over ankle in mire He took no count of time for the river was marking the hours inch by inch and foot by foot along the embankment and he listened numb and hungry to the straining of the stone boats the hollow thunder under the piers and the hundred noises that make the full note of a flood Once a dripping servant brought him food but he could not eat and once he thought that he heard a faint toot from a locomotive across the river and then he smiled The bridge s failure would hurt his assistant not a little but Hitchcock was a young man with his big work yet to do For himself the crash meant everything everything that made a hard life worth the living They would say the men of his own profession he remembered the half pitying things that he himself had said when Lockhart s new waterworks burst and broke down in brickheaps and sludge and Lockhart s spirit broke in him and he died He remembered what he himself had said when the Sumao Bridge went out in the big cyclone by the sea and most he remembered poor Hartopp s face three weeks later when the shame had marked it His bridge was twice the size of Hartopp s and it carried the Findlayson truss as well as the new pier shoe the Findlayson bolted shoe There were no excuses in his service Government might listen perhaps but his own kind would judge him by his bridge as that stood or fell He went over it in his head plate by plate span by span brick by brick pier by pier remembering comparing estimating and recalculating lest there should be any mistake and through the long hours and through the flights of formulae that danced and wheeled before him a cold fear would come to pinch his heart His side of the sum was beyond question but what man knew Mother Gunga s arithmetic Even as he was making all sure by the multiplication table the river might be scooping a pot hole to the very bottom of any one of those eighty foot piers that carried his reputation Again a servant came to him with food but his mouth was dry and he could only drink and return to the decimals in his brain And the river was still rising Peroo in a mat shelter coat crouched at his feet watching now his face and now the face of the river but saying nothing At last the Lascar rose and floundered through the mud towards the village but he was careful to leave an ally to watch the boats Presently he returned most irreverently driving before him the priest of his creed a fat old man with a grey beard that whipped the wind with the wet cloth that blew over his shoulder Never was seen so lamentable a guru What good are offerings and little kerosene lamps and dry grain shouted Peroo if squatting in the mud is all that thou canst do Thou hast dealt long with the Gods when they were contented and well wishing Now they are angry Speak to them What is a man against the wrath of Gods whined the priest cowering as the wind took him Let me go to the temple and I will pray there Son of a pig pray here Is there no return for salt fish and curry powder and dried onions Call aloud Tell Mother Gunga we have had enough Bid her be still for the night I cannot pray but I have been serving in the Kumpani s boats and when men did not obey my orders I A flourish of the wire rope colt rounded the sentence and the priest breaking free from his disciple fled to the village Fat pig said Peroo After all that we have done for him When the flood is down I will see to it that we get a new guru Finlinson Sahib it darkens for night now and since yesterday nothing has been eaten Be wise Sahib No man can endure watching and great thinking on an empty belly Lie down Sahib The river will do what the river will do The bridge is mine I cannot leave it Wilt thou hold it up with thy hands then said Peroo laughing I was troubled for my boats and sheers before the flood came Now we are in the hands of the Gods The Sahib will not eat and lie down Take these then They are meat and good toddy together and they kill all weariness besides the fever that follows the rain I have eaten nothing else to day at all He took a small tin tobacco box from his sodden waistbelt and thrust it into Findlayson s hand saying Nay do not be afraid It is no more than opium clean Malwa opium Findlayson shook two or three of the dark brown pellets into his hand and hardly knowing what he did swallowed them The stuff was at least a good guard against fever the fever that was creeping upon him out of the wet mud and he had seen what Peroo could do in the stewing mists of autumn on the strength of a dose from the tin box Peroo nodded with bright eyes In a little in a little the Sahib will find that he thinks well again I too will He dived into his treasure box resettled the rain coat over his head and squatted down to watch the boats It was too dark now to see beyond the first pier and the night seemed to have given the river new strength Findlayson stood with his chin on his chest thinking There was one point about one of the piers the seventh that he had not fully settled in his mind The figures would not shape themselves to the eye except one by one and at enormous intervals of time There was a sound rich and mellow in his ears like the deepest note of a double bass an entrancing sound upon which he pondered for several hours as it seemed Then Peroo was at his elbow shouting that a wire hawser had snapped and the stone boats were loose Findlayson saw the fleet open and swing out fanwise to a long drawn shriek of wire straining across gunnels A tree hit them They will all go cried Peroo The main hawser has parted What does the Sahib do An immensely complex plan had suddenly flashed into Findlayson s mind He saw the ropes running from boat to boat in straight lines and angles each rope a line of white fire But there was one rope which was the master rope He could see that rope If he could pull it once it was absolutely and mathematically certain that the disordered fleet would reassemble itself in the backwater behind the guard tower But why he wondered was Peroo clinging so desperately to his waist as he hastened down the bank It was necessary to put the Lascar aside gently and slowly because it was necessary to save the boats and further to demonstrate the extreme ease of the problem that looked so difficult And then but it was of no conceivable importance a wirerope raced through his hand burning it the high bank disappeared and with it all the slowly dispersing factors of the problem He was sitting in the rainy darkness sitting in a boat that spun like a top and Peroo was standing over him I had forgotten said the Lascar slowly that to those fasting and unused the opium is worse than any wine Those who die in Gunga go to the Gods Still I have no desire to present myself before such great ones Can the Sahib swim What need He can fly fly as swiftly as the wind was the thick answer He is mad muttered Peroo under his breath And he threw me aside like a bundle of dung cakes Well he will not know his death The boat cannot live an hour here even if she strike nothing It is not good to look at death with a clear eye He refreshed himself again from the tin box squatted down in the bows of the reeling pegged and stitched craft staring through the mist at the nothing that was there A warm drowsiness crept over Findlayson the Chief Engineer whose duty was with his bridge The heavy raindrops struck him with a thousand tingling little thrills and the weight of all time since time was made hung heavy on his eyelids He thought and perceived that he was perfectly secure for the water was so solid that a man could surely step out upon it and standing still with his legs apart to keep his balance this was the most important point would be borne with great and easy speed to the shore But yet a better plan came to him It needed only an exertion of will for the soul to hurl the body ashore as wind drives paper to waft it kite fashion to the bank Thereafter the boat spun dizzily suppose the high wind got under the freed body Would it tower up like a kite and pitch headlong on the far away sands or would it duck about beyond control through all eternity Findlayson gripped the gunnel to anchor himself for it seemed that he was on the edge of taking the flight before he had settled all his plans Opium has more effect on the white man than the black Peroo was only comfortably indifferent to accidents She cannot live he grunted Her seams open already If she were even a dinghy with oars we could have ridden it out but a box with holes is no good Finlinson Sahib she fills Accha I am going away Come thou also In his mind Findlayson had already escaped from the boat and was circling high in air to find a rest for the sole of his foot His body he was really sorry for its gross helplessness lay in the stern the water rushing about its knees How very ridiculous he said to himself from his eyrie that is Findlayson chief of the Kashi Bridge The poor beast is going to be drowned too Drowned when it s close to shore I m I m onshore already Why doesn t it come along To his intense disgust he found his soul back in his body again and that body spluttering and choking in deep water The pain of the reunion was atrocious but it was necessary also to fight for the body He was conscious of grasping wildly at wet sand and striding prodigiously as one strides in a dream to keep foothold in the swirling water till at last he hauled himself clear of the hold of the river and dropped panting on wet earth Not this night said Peroo in his ear The Gods have protected us The Lascar moved his feet cautiously and they rustled among dried stumps This is some island of last year s indigo crop he went on We shall find no men here but have great care Sahib all the snakes of a hundred miles have been flooded out Here comes the lightning on the heels of the wind Now we shall be able to look but walk carefully Findlayson was far and far beyond any fear of snakes or indeed any merely human emotion He saw after he had rubbed the water from his eyes with an immense clearness and trod so it seemed to himself with world encompassing strides Somewhere in the night of time he had built a bridge a bridge that spanned illimitable levels of shining seas but the Deluge had swept it away leaving this one island under heaven for Findlayson and his companion sole survivors of the breed of Man An incessant lightning forked and blue showed all that there was to be seen on the little patch in the flood a clump of thorn a clump of swaying creaking bamboos and a grey gnarled peepul overshadowing a Hindoo shrine from whose dome floated a tattered red flag The holy man whose summer resting place it was had long since abandoned it and the weather had broken the red daubed image of his god The two men stumbled heavy limbed and heavy eyed over the ashes of a brick set cooking place and dropped down under the shelter of the branches while the rain and river roared together The stumps of the indigo crackled and there was a smell of cattle as a huge and dripping Brahminee bull shouldered his way under the tree The flashes revealed the trident mark of Shiva on his flank the insolence of head and hump the luminous stag like eyes the brow crowned with a wreath of sodden marigold blooms and the silky dewlap that almost swept the ground There was a noise behind him of other beasts coming up from the floodline through the thicket a sound of heavy feet and deep breathing Here be more beside ourselves said Findlayson his head against the tree pole looking through half shut eyes wholly at ease Truly said Peroo thickly and no small ones What are they then I do not see clearly The Gods Who else Look Ah true The Gods surely the Gods Findlayson smiled as his head fell forward on his chest Peroo was eminently right After the Flood who should be alive in the land except the Gods that made it the Gods to whom his village prayed nightly the Gods who were in all men s mouths and about all men s ways He could not raise his head or stir a finger for the trance that held him and Peroo was smiling vacantly at the lightning The Bull paused by the shrine his head lowered to the damp earth A green Parrot in the branches preened his wet wings and screamed against the thunder as the circle under the tree filled with the shifting shadows of beasts There was a black Buck at the Bull s heels such a Buck as Findlayson in his far away life upon earth might have seen in dreams a Buck with a royal head ebon back silver belly and gleaming straight horns Beside him her head bowed to the ground the green eyes burning under the heavy brows with restless tail switching the dead grass paced a Tigress full bellied and deep jowled The Bull crouched beside the shrine and there leaped from the darkness a monstrous grey Ape who seated himself man wise in the place of the fallen image and the rain spilled like jewels from the hair of his neck and shoulders Other shadows came and went behind the circle among them a drunken Man flourishing staff and drinking bottle Then a hoarse bellow broke out from near the ground The flood lessens even now it cried Hour by hour the water falls and their bridge still stands My bridge said Findlayson to himself That must be very old work now What have the Gods to do with my bridge His eyes rolled in the darkness following the roar A Mugger the blunt nosed ford haunting Mugger of the Ganges draggled herself before the beasts lashing furiously to right and left with her tail They have made it too strong for me In all this night I have only torn away a handful of planks The walls stand The towers stand They have chained my flood and the river is not free any more Heavenly Ones take this yoke away Give me clear water between bank and bank It is I Mother Gunga that speak The Justice of the Gods Deal me the Justice of the Gods What said I whispered Peroo This is in truth a Punchayet of the Gods Now we know that all the world is dead save you and I Sahib The Parrot screamed and fluttered again and the Tigress her ears flat to her head snarled wickedly Somewhere in the shadow a great trunk and gleaming tusks swayed to and fro and a low gurgle broke the silence that followed on the snarl We be here said a deep voice the Great Ones One only and very many Shiv my father is here with Indra Kali has spoken already Hanuman listens also Kashi is without her Kotwal tonight shouted the Man with the drinking bottle flinging his staff to the ground while the island rang to the baying of hounds Give her the Justice of the Gods Ye were still when they polluted my waters the great Crocodile bellowed Ye made no sign when my river was trapped between the walls I had no help save my own strength and that failed the strength of Mother Gunga failed before their guard towers What could I do I have done everything Finish now Heavenly Ones I brought the death I rode the spotted sickness from hut to hut of their workmen and yet they would not cease A nose slitten hide worn Ass lame scissor legged and galled limped forward I cast the death at them out of my nostrils but they would not cease Peroo would have moved but the opium lay heavy upon him Bah he said spitting Here is Sitala herself Mata the smallpox Has the Sahib a handkerchief to put over his face Little help They fed me the corpses for a month and I flung them out on my sand bars but their work went forward Demons they are and sons of demons And ye left Mother Gunga alone for their fire carriage to make a mock of The Justice of the Gods on the bridge builders The Bull turned the cud in his mouth and answered slowly If the Justice of the Gods caught all who made a mock of holy things there would be many dark altars in the land mother But this goes beyond a mock said the Tigress darting forward a griping paw Thou knowest Shiv and ye too Heavenly Ones ye know that they have defiled Gunga Surely they must come to the Destroyer Let Indra judge The Buck made no movement as he answered How long has this evil been Three years as men count years said the Mugger close pressed to the earth Does Mother Gunga die then in a year that she is so anxious to see vengeance now The deep sea was where she runs but yesterday and tomorrow the sea shall cover her again as the Gods count that which men call time Can any say that this their bridge endures till tomorrow said the Buck There was along hush and in the clearing of the storm the full moon stood up above the dripping trees Judge ye then said the River sullenly I have spoken my shame The flood falls still I can do no more For my own part it was the voice of the great Ape seated within the shrine it pleases me well to watch these men remembering that I also builded no small bridge in the world s youth They say too snarled the Tiger that these men came of the wreck of thy armies Hanuman and therefore thou hast aided They toil as my armies toiled in Lanka and they believe that their toil endures Indra is too high but Shiv thou knowest how the land is threaded with their fire carriages Yea I know said the Bull Their Gods instructed them in the matter A laugh ran round the circle Their Gods What should their Gods know They were born yesterday and those that made them are scarcely yet cold said the Mugger tomorrow their Gods will die Ho said Peroo Mother Gunga talks good talk I told that to the padre sahib who preached on the Mombassa and he asked the Burra Malum to put me in irons for a great rudeness Surely they make these things to please their Gods said the Bull again Not altogether the Elephant rolled forth It is for the profit of my mahajuns fat money lenders that worship me at each new year when they draw my image at the head of the account books I looking over their shoulders by lamplight see that the names in the books are those of men in far places for all the towns are drawn together by the fire carriage and the money comes and goes swiftly and the account books grow as fat as myself And I who am Ganesh of Good Luck I bless my peoples They have changed the face of the land which is my land They have killed and made new towns on my banks said the Mugger It is but the shifting of a little dirt Let the dirt dig in the dirt if it pleases the dirt answered the Elephant But afterwards said the Tiger Afterwards they will see that Mother Gunga can avenge no insult and they fall away from her first and later from us all one by one In the end Ganesh we are left with naked altars The drunken Man staggered to his feet and hiccupped vehemently Kali lies My sister lies Also this my stick is the Kotwal of Kashi and he keeps tally of my pilgrims When the time comes to worship Bhairon and it is always time the fire carriages move one by one and each hears a thousand pilgrims They do not come afoot any more but rolling upon wheels and my honour is increased Gunga I have seen thy bed at Pryag black with the pilgrims said the Ape leaning forward and but for the fire carriage they would have come slowly and in fewer numbers Remember They come to me always Bhairon went on thickly By day and night they pray to me all the Common People in the fields and the roads Who is like Bhairon today What talk is this of changing faiths Is my staff Kotwal of Kashi for nothing He keeps the tally and he says that never were so many altars as today and the fire carriage serves them well Bhairon am I Bhairon of the Common People and the chiefest of tithe Heavenly Ones today Also my staff says Peace thou lowed the Bull The worship of the schools is mine and they talk very wisely asking whether I be one or many as is the delight of my people and ye know what I am Kali my wife thou knowest also Yea I know said the Tigress with lowered head Greater am I than Gunga also For ye know who moved the minds of men that they should count Gunga holy among the rivers Who die in that water ye know how men say come to us without punishment and Gunga knows that the fire carriage has borne to her scores upon scores of such anxious ones and Kali knows that she has held her chiefest festivals among the pilgrimages that are fed by the fire carriage Who smote at Pooree under the Image there her thousands in a day and a night and bound the sickness to the wheels of the fire carriages so that it ran from one end of the land to the other Who but Kali Before the fire carriage came it was a heavy toil The fire carriages have served thee well Mother of Death But I speak for mine own altars who am not Bhairon of the Common Folk but Shiv Men go to and fro making words and telling talk of strange Gods and I listen Faith follows faith among my people in the schools and I have no anger for when all words are said and the new talk is ended to Shiv men return at the last True It is true murmured Hanuman To Shiv and to the others mother they return I creep from temple to temple in the North where they worship one God and His Prophet and presently my image is alone within their shrines Small thanks said the Buck turning his head slowly I am that One and His Prophet also Even so father said Hanuman And to the South I go who am the oldest of the Gods as men know the Gods and presently I touch the shrines of the New Faith and the Woman whom we know is hewn twelve armed and still they call her Mary Small thanks brother said the Tigress I am that Woman Even so sister and I go West among the fire carriages and stand before the bridge builders in many shapes and because of me they change their faiths and are very wise Ho ho I am the builder of bridges indeed bridges between this and that and each bridge leads surely to Us in the end Be content Gunga Neither these men nor those that follow them mock thee at all Am I alone then Heavenly Ones Shall I smooth out my flood lest unhappily I bear away their walls Will Indra dry my springs in the hills and make me crawl humbly between their wharfs Shall I bury me in the sand ere I offend And all for the sake of a little iron bar with the fire carriage atop Truly Mother Gunga is always young said Ganesh the Elephant A child had not spoken more foolishly Let the dirt dig in the dirt ere it return to the dirt I know only that my people grow rich and praise me Shiv has said that the men of the schools do not forget Bhairon is content for his crowd of the Common People and Hanuman laughs Surely I laugh said the Ape My altars are few beside those of Ganesh or Bhairon but the fire carriages bring me new worshippers from beyond the Black Water the men who believe that their God is toil I run before them beckoning and they follow Hanuman Give them the toil that they desire then said the River Make a bar across my flood and throw the water back upon the bridge Once thou wast strong in Lanka Hanuman Stoop and lift my bed Who gives life can take life The Ape scratched in the mud with a long forefinger And yet who would profit by the killing Very many would die There came up from the water a snatch of a love song such as the boys sing when they watch their cattle in the noon heats of late spring The Parrot screamed joyously sidling along his branch with lowered head as the song grew louder and in a patch of clear moonlight stood revealed the young herd the darling of the Gopis the idol of dreaming maids and of mothers ere their children are born Krishna the Well beloved He stooped to knot up his long wet hair and the parrot fluttered to his shoulder Fleeting and singing and singing and fleeting hiccupped Bhairon Those make thee late for the council brother And then said Krishna with a laugh throwing back his head Ye can do little without me or Karma here He fondled the Parrot s plumage and laughed again What is this sitting and talking together I heard Mother Gunga roaring in the dark and so came quickly from a but where I lay warm And what have ye done to Karma that he is so wet and silent And what does Mother Gunga here Are the heavens full that ye must come paddling in the mud beast wise Karma what do they do Gunga has prayed for a vengeance on the bridgebuilders and Kali is with her Now she bids Hanuman whelm the bridge that her honour may be made great cried the Parrot I waited here knowing that thou wouldst come O my master And the Heavenly Ones said nothing Did Gunga and the Mother of Sorrows out talk them Did none speak for my people Nay said Ganesh moving uneasily from foot to foot I said it was but dirt at play and why should we stamp it flat I was content to let them toil well content said Hanuman What had I to do with Gunga s anger said the Bull I am Bhairon of the Common Folk and this my staff is Kotwal of all Kashi I spoke for the Common People Thou The young God s eyes sparkled Am I not the first of the Gods in their mouths today returned Bhairon unabashed For the sake of the Common People I said very many wise things which I have now forgotten but this my staff Krishna turned impatiently saw the Mugger at his feet and kneeling slipped an arm round the cold neck Mother he said gently get thee to thy flood again This matter is not for thee What harm shall thy honour take of this live dirt Thou hast given them their fields new year after year and by thy flood they are made strong They come all to thee at the last What need to slay them now Have pity mother for a little and it is only for a little If it be only for a little the slow beast began Are they Gods then Krishna returned with a laugh his eyes looking into the dull eyes of the River Be certain that it is only for a little The Heavenly Ones have heard thee and presently justice will be done Go now mother to the flood again Men and cattle are thick on the waters the banks fall the villages melt because of thee But the bridge the bridge stands The Mugger turned grunting into the undergrowth as Krishna rose It is ended said the Tigress viciously There is no more justice from the Heavenly Ones Ye have made shame and sport of Gunga who asked no more than a few score lives Of my people who lie under the leaf roofs of the village yonder of the young girls and the young men who sing to them in the dark of the child that will be born next morn of that which was begotten tonight said Krishna And when all is done what profit Tomorrow sees them at work Ay if ye swept the bridge out from end to end they would begin anew Hear me Bhairon is drunk always Hanuman mocks his people with new riddles Nay but they are very old ones the Ape said laughing Shiv hears the talk of the schools and the dreams of the holy men Ganesh thinks only of his fat traders but I I live with these my people asking for no gifts and so receiving them hourly And very tender art thou of thy people said the Tigress They are my own The old women dream of me turning in their sleep the maids look and listen for me when they go to fill their lotahs by the river I walk by the young men waiting without the gates at dusk and I call over my shoulder to the whitebeards Ye know Heavenly Ones that I alone of us all walk upon the earth continually and have no pleasure in our heavens so long as a green blade springs here or there are two voices at twilight in the standing crops Wise are ye but ye live far off forgetting whence ye came So do I not forget And the fire carriage feeds your shrines ye say And the fire carriages bring a thousand pilgrims where but ten came in the old years True That is true today But tomorrow they are dead brother said Ganesh Peace said the Bull as Hanuman leaned forward again And tomorrow beloved what of tomorrow This only A new word creeping from mouth to mouth among the Common Folk a word that neither man nor God can lay hold of an evil word a little lazy word among the Common Folk saying and none know who set that word afoot that they weary of ye Heavenly Ones The Gods laughed together softly And then beloved they said And to cover that weariness they my people will bring to thee Shiv and to thee Ganesh at first greater offerings and a louder noise of worship But the word has gone abroad and after they will pay fewer dues to our fat Brahmins Next they will forget your altars but so slowly that no man can say how his forgetfulness began I knew I knew I spoke this also but they would not hear said the Tigress We should have slain we should have slain It is too late now Ye should have slain at the beginning when the men from across the water had taught our folk nothing Now my people see their work and go away thinking They do not think of the Heavenly Ones altogether They think of the fire carriage and the other things that the bridge builders have done and when your priests thrust forward hands asking alms they give a little unwillingly That is the beginning among one or two or five or ten for I moving among my people know what is in their hearts And the end Jester of the Gods What shall the end be said Ganesh The end shall be as it was in the beginning O slothful son of Shiv The flame shall die upon the altars and the prayer upon the tongue till ye become little Gods again Gods of the jungle names that the hunters of rats and noosers of dogs whisper in the thicket and among the caves rag Gods pot Godlings of the tree and the villagemark as ye were at the beginning That is the end Ganesh for thee and for Bhairon Bhairon of the Common People It is very far away grunted Bhairon Also it is a lie Many women have kissed Krishna They told him this to cheer their own hearts when the grey hairs came and he has told us the tale said the Bull below his breath Their Gods came and we changed them I took the Woman and made her twelve armed So shall we twist all their Gods said Hanuman Their Gods This is no question of their Gods one or three man or woman The matter is with the people They move and not the Gods of the bridgebuilders said Krishna So be it I have made a man worship the fire carriage as it stood still breathing smoke and he knew not that he worshipped me said Hanuman the Ape They will only change a little the names of their Gods I shall lead the builders of the bridges as of old Shiv shall be worshipped in the schools by such as doubt and despise their fellows Ganesh shall have his mahajuns and Bhairon the donkey drivers the pilgrims and the sellers of toys Beloved they will do no more than change the names and that we have seen a thousand times Surely they will do no more than change the names echoed Ganesh but there was an uneasy movement among the Gods They will change more than the names Me alone they cannot kill so long as a maiden and a man meet together or the spring follows the winter rains Heavenly Ones not for nothing have I walked upon the earth My people know not now what they know but I who live with them I read their hearts Great Kings the beginning of the end is born already The fire carriages shout the names of new Gods that are not the old under new names Drink now and eat greatly Bathe your faces in the smoke of the altars before they grow cold Take dues and listen to the cymbals and the drums Heavenly Ones while yet there are flowers and songs As men count time the end is far off but as we who know reckon it is today I have spoken The young God ceased and his brethren looked at each other long in silence This I have not heard before Peroo whispered in his companion s ear And yet sometimes when I oiled the brasses in the engine room of the Goorkha I have wondered if our priests were so wise so wise The day is coming Sahib They will be gone by the morning A yellow light broadened in the sky and the tone of the river changed as the darkness withdrew Suddenly the Elephant trumpeted aloud as though man had goaded him Let Indra judge Father of all speak thou What of the things we have heard Has Krishna lied indeed Or Ye know said the Buck rising to his feet Ye know the Riddle of the Gods When Brahm ceases to dream the Heavens and the Hells and Earth disappear Be content Brahm dreams still The dreams come and go and the nature of the dreams changes but still Brahm dreams Krishna has walked too long upon earth and yet I love him the more for the tale he has told The Gods change beloved all save One Ay all save one that makes love in the hearts of men said Krishna knotting his girdle It is but a little time to wait and ye shall know if I lie Truly it is but a little time as thou sayest and we shall know Get thee to thy huts again beloved and make sport for the young things for still Brahm dreams Go my children Brahm dreams and till he wakes the Gods die not Whither went they said the Lascar awe struck shivering a little with the cold God knows said Findlayson The river and the island lay in full daylight now and there was never mark of hoof or pug on the wet earth under the peepul Only a parrot screamed in the branches bringing down showers of water drops as he fluttered his wings Up We are cramped with cold Has the opium died out Canst thou move Sahib Findlayson staggered to his feet and shook himself His head swam and ached but the work of the opium was over and as he sluiced his forehead in a pool the Chief Engineer of the Kashi Bridge was wondering how he had managed to fall upon the island what chances the day offered of return and above all how his work stood Peroo I have forgotten much I was under the guard tower watching the river and then Did the flood sweep us away No The boats broke loose Sahib and if the Sahib had forgotten about the opium decidedly Peroo would not remind him in striving to retie them so it seemed to me but it was darka rope caught the Sahib and threw him upon a boat Considering that we two with Hitchcock Sahib built as it were that bridge I came also upon the boat which came riding on horseback as it were on the nose of this island and so splitting cast us ashore I made a great cry when the boat left the wharf and without doubt Hitchcock Sahib will come for us As for the bridge so many have died in the building that it cannot fall A fierce sun that drew out all the smell of the sodden land had followed the storm and in that clear light there was no room for a man to think of the dreams of the dark Findlayson stared up stream across the blaze of moving water till his eyes ached There was no sign of any bank to the Ganges much less of a bridgeline We came down far he said It was wonderful that we were not drowned a hundred times That was the least of the wonder for no man dies before his time I have seen Sydney I have seen London and twenty great ports but Peroo looked at the damp discoloured shrine under the peopul never man has seen that we saw here What Has the Sahib forgotten or do we black men only see the Gods There was a fever upon me Findlayson was still looking uneasily across the water It seemed that the island was full of beasts and men talking but I do not remember A boat could live in this water now I think Oho Then it is true When Brahm ceases to dream the Gods die Now I know indeed what he meant Once too the guru said as much to me but then I did not understand Now I am wise What said Findlayson over his shoulder Peroo went on as if he were talking to himself Six seven ten monsoons since I was watch on the fo c sle of the ehwah the Kumpani s big boat and there was a big tufan green and black water beating and I held fast to the life lines choking under the waters Then I thought of the Gods of Those whom we saw tonight he stared curiously at Findlayson s back but the white man was looking across the flood Yes I say of Those whom we saw this night past and I called upon Them to protect me And while I prayed still keeping my lookout a big wave came and threw me forward upon the ring of the great black bowanchor and the Rewah rose high and high leaning towards the lefthand side and the water drew away from beneath her nose and I lay upon my belly holding the ring and looking down into those great deeps Then I thought even in the face of death If I lose hold I die and for me neither the Rewah nor my place by the galley where the rice is cooked nor Bombay nor Calcutta nor even London will be any more for me How shall I be sure I said that the Gods to whom I pray will abide at all This I thought and the Rewah dropped her nose as a hammer falls and all the sea came in and slid me backwards along the fo c sle and over the break of the fo c sle and I very badly bruised my shin against the donkey engine but I did not die and I have seen the Gods They are good for live men but for the dead They have spoken Themselves Therefore when I come to the village I will beat the guru for talking riddles which are no riddles When Brahm ceases to dream the Gods go Look up stream The light blinds Is there smoke yonder Peroo shaded his eyes with his hands He is a wise man and quick Hitchcock Sahib would not trust a rowboat He has borrowed the Rao Sahib s steam launch and comes to look for us I have always said that there should have been a steam launch on the bridge works for us The territory of the Rao of Baraon lay within ten miles of the bridge and Findlayson and Hitchcock had spent a fair portion of their scanty leisure in playing billiards and shooting black buck with the young man He had been bear led by an English tutor of sporting tastes for some five or six years and was now royally wasting the revenues accumulated during his minority by the Indian Government His steam launch with its silverplated rails striped silk awning and mahogany decks was a new toy which Findlayson had found horribly in the way when the Rao came to look at the bridge works It s great luck murmured Findlayson but he was none the less afraid wondering what news might be of the bridge The gaudy blue and white funnel came down stream swiftly They could see Hitchcock in the bows with a pair of opera glasses and his face was unusually white Then Peroo hailed and the launch made for the tail of the island The Rao Sahib in tweed shooting suit and a seven hued turban waved his royal hand and Hitchcock shouted But he need have asked no questions for Findlayson s first demand was for his bridge All serene Gad I never expected to see you again Findlayson You re seven koss down stream Yes there s not a stone shifted anywhere but how are you I borrowed the Rao Sahib s launch and he was good enough to come along Jump in Ah Finlinson you are very well eh That was most unprecedented calamity last night eh My royal palace too it leaks like the devil and the crops will also be short all about my country Now you shall back her out Hitchcock I I do not understand steam engines You are wet You are cold Finlinson I have some things to eat here and you will take a good drink I m immensely grateful Rao Sahib I believe you ve saved my life How did Hitchcock Oho His hair was upon end He rode to me in the middle of the night and woke me up in the arms of Morpheus I was most truly concerned Finlinson so I came too My head priest he is very angry just now We will go quick Mister Hitchcock I am due to attend at twelve forty five in the state temple where we sanctify some new idol If not so I would have asked you to spend the day with me They are dam bore these religious ceremonies Finlinson eh Peroo well known to the crew had possessed himself of the inlaid wheel and was taking the launch craftily up stream But while he steered he was in his mind handling two feet of partially untwisted wire rope and the back upon which he beat was the back of his guru A WALKING DELEGATE According to the custom of Vermont Sunday afternoon is salting time on the farm and unless something very important happens we attend to the salting ourselves Dave and Pete the red oxen are treated first they stay in the home meadow ready for work on Monday Then come the cows with Pan the calf who should have been turned into veal long ago but survived on account of his manners and lastly the horses scattered through the seventy acres of the Back Pasture You must go down by the brook that feeds the clicking bubbling water ram up through the sugar bush where the young maple undergrowth closes round you like a shallow sea next follow the faint line of an old county road running past two green hollows fringed with wild rose that mark the cellars of two ruined houses then by Lost Orchard where nobody ever comes except in cider time then across another brook and so into the Back Pasture Half of it is pine and hemlock and Spruce with sumach and little juniper bushes and the other half is grey rock and boulder and moss with green streaks of brake and swamp but the horses like it well enough our own and the others that are turned down there to feed at fifty cents a week Most people walk to the Back Pasture and find it very rough work but one can get there in a buggy if the horse knows what is expected of him The safest conveyance is our coupe This began life as a buckboard and we bought it for five dollars from a sorrowful man who had no other sort of possessions and the seat came off one night when we were turning a corner in a hurry After that alteration it made a beautiful salting machine if you held tight because there was nothing to catch your feet when you fell out and the slats rattled tunes One Sunday afternoon we went out with the salt as usual It was a broiling hot day and we could not find the horses anywhere till we let Tedda Gabler the bobtailed mare who throws up the dirt with her big hooves exactly as a tedder throws hay have her head Clever as she is she tipped the coupe over in a hidden brook before she came out on a ledge of rock where all the horses had gathered and were switching flies The Deacon was the first to call to her He is a very dark iron grey four year old son of Grandee He has been handled since he was two was driven in a light cart before he was three and now ranks as an absolutely steady lady s horse proof against steam rollers grade crossings and street processions Salt said the Deacon joyfully You re dreffle late Tedda Any any place to cramp the coupe Tedda panted It weighs turr ble this weather I d a come sooner but they didn t know what they wanted ner haow Fell out twice both of em I don t understand sech foolishness You look consider ble het up Guess you d better cramp her under them pines an cool off a piece Tedda scrambled on the ledge and cramped the coupe in the shade of a tiny little wood of pines while my companion and I lay down among the brown silky needles and gasped All the home horses were gathered round us enjoying their Sunday leisure There were Rod and Rick the seniors on the farm They were the regular road pair bay with black points full brothers aged sons of a Hambletonian sire and a Morgan dam There were Nip and Tuck seal browns rising six brother and sister Black Hawks by birth perfectly matched just finishing their education and as handsome a pair as man could wish to find in a forty mile drive There was Muldoon our ex car horse bought at a venture and any colour you choose that is not white and Tweezy who comes from Kentucky with an affliction of his left hip which makes him a little uncertain how his hind legs are moving He and Muldoon had been hauling gravel all the week for our new road The Deacon you know already Last of all and eating something was our faithful Marcus Aurelius Antoninus the black buggy horse who had seen us through every state of weather and road the horse who was always standing in harness before some door or other a philosopher with the appetite of a shark and the manners of an archbishop Tedda Gabler was a new trade with a reputation for vice which was really the result of bad driving She had one working gait which she could hold till further notice a Roman nose a large prominent eye a shaving brush of a tail and an irritable temper She took her salt through her bridle but the others trotted up nuzzling and wickering for theirs till we emptied it on the clean rocks They were all standing at ease on three legs for the most part talking the ordinary gossip of the Back Pasture about the scarcity of water and gaps in the fence and how the early windfalls tasted that season when little Rick blew the last few grains of his allowance into a crevice and said Hurry boys Might ha knowed that livery plug would be around We heard a clatter of hooves and there climbed up from the ravine below a fifty center transient a wall eyed yellow frame house of a horse sent up to board from a livery stable in town where they called him The Lamb and never let him out except at night and to strangers My companion who knew and had broken most of the horses looked at the ragged hammer head as it rose and said quietly Ni ice beast Man eater if he gets the chance see his eye Kicker too see his hocks Western horse The animal lumbered up snuffling and grunting His feet showed that he had not worked for weeks and weeks and our creatures drew together significantly As usual he said with an underhung sneer bowin your heads before the Oppressor that comes to spend his leisure gloatin over you Mine s done said the Deacon he licked up the remnant of his salt dropped his nose in his master s hand and sang a little grace all to himself The Deacon has the most enchanting manners of any one I know An fawnin on them for what is your inalienable right It s humiliatin said the yellow horse sniffing to see if he could find a few spare grains Go daown hill then Boney the Deacon replied Guess you ll find somethin to eat still if yer hain t hogged it all You ve ett more n any three of us to day an day fore that an the last two months sence you ve been here I am not addressin myself to the young an immature I am speakin to those whose opinion an experience commands respect I saw Rod raise his head as though he were about to make a remark then he dropped it again and stood three cornered like a plough horse Rod can cover his mile in a shade under three minutes on an ordinary road to an ordinary buggy He is tremendously powerful behind but like most Hambletonians he grows a trifle sullen as he gets older No one can love Rod very much but no one can help respecting him I wish to wake those the yellow horse went on to an abidin sense o their wrongs an their injuries an their outrages Haow s that said Marcus Aurelius Antoninus dreamily He thought Boney was talking of some kind of feed An when I say outrages and injuries Boney waved his tail furiously I mean em too Great Oats That s just what I do mean plain an straight The gentleman talks quite earnest said Tuck the mare to Nip her brother There s no doubt thinkin broadens the horizons o the mind His language is quite lofty Hesh sis Nip answered He hain t widened nothin cep the circle he s ett in pasture They feed words fer beddin where he comes from It s elegant talkin though Tuck returned with an unconvinced toss of her pretty lean little head The yellow horse heard her and struck an attitude which he meant to be extremely impressive It made him look as though he had been badly stuffed Now I ask you I ask you without prejudice an without favour what has Man the Oppressor ever done for you Are you not inalienably entitled to the free air o heaven blowin acrost this boundless prairie Hev ye ever wintered here said the Deacon merrily while the others snickered It s kinder cool Not yet said Boney I come from the boundless confines o Kansas where the noblest of our kind have their abidin place among the sunflowers on the threshold o the settin sun in his glory An they sent you ahead as a sample said Rick with an amused quiver of his long beautifully groomed tail as thick and as fine and as wavy as a quadroon s back hair Kansas sir needs no advertisement Her native sons rely on themselves an their native sires Yes sir Then Tweezy lifted up his wise and polite old head His affliction makes him bashful as a rule but he is ever the most courteous of horses Excuse me suh he said slowly but unless I have been misinfohmed most of your prominent siahs suh are impo ted from Kentucky an I m from Paduky There was the least little touch of pride in the last words Any horse dat knows beans said Muldoon suddenly he had been standing with his hairy chin on Tweezy s broad quarters gits outer Kansas fore dey crip his shoes I blew in dere from Ioway in de days o me youth an innocence an I wuz grateful when dey boxed me fer N York You can t tell me anything about Kansas I don t wanter fergit De Belt Line stables ain t no Hoffman House but dey re Vanderbilts longside o Kansas What the horses o Kansas think to day the horses of America will think to morrow an I tell you that when the horses of America rise in their might the day o the Oppressor is ended There was a pause till Rick said with a little grunt Ef you put it that way every one of us has riz in his might cep Marcus mebbe Marky j ever rise in yer might Nope said Marcus Aurelius Antoninus thoughtfully quidding over a mouthful of grass I seen a heap o fools try though You admit that you riz said the Kansas horse excitedly Then why why in Kansas did you ever go under again Horse can t walk on his hind legs all the time said the Deacon Not when he s jerked over on his back fore he knows what fetched him We ve all done it Boney said Rick Nip an Tuck they tried it spite o what the Deacon told em an the Deacon he tried it spite o what me an Rod told him an me an Rod tried it spite o what Grandee told us an I guess Grandee he tried it spite o what his dam told him It s the same old circus from generation to generation Colt can t see why he s called on to back Same old rearm on end straight up Same old feelin that you ve bested em this time Same old little yank at your mouth when you re up good an tall Same old Pegasus act wonderin where you ll light Same old wop when you hit the dirt with your head where your tail should be and your in ards shook up like a bran mash Same old voice in your ear Waal ye little fool an what did you reckon to make by that We re through with risin in our might on this farm We go to pole er single accordin ez we re hitched An Man the Oppressor sets an gloats over you same as he s settin now Hain t that been your experience madam This last remark was addressed to Tedda and any one could see with half an eye that poor old anxious fidgety Tedda stamping at the flies must have left a wild and tumultuous youth behind her Pends on the man she answered shifting from one foot to the other and addressing herself to the home horses They abused me dreffle when I was young I guess I was sperrity an nervous some but they didn t allow for that Twas in Monroe County Noo York an sence then till I come here I ve run away with more men than u d fill a boardin house Why the man that sold me here he says to the boss s he Mind now I ve warned you Twon t be none of my fault if she sheds you daown the road Don t you drive her in a top buggy ner thout winkers s he ner thought this bit ef you look to come home behind her N the fust thing the boss did was to git the top buggy Can t say as I like top buggies said Rick they don t balance good Suit me to a ha ar said Marcus Aurelius Antoninus Top buggy means the baby s in behind an I kin stop while she gathers the pretty flowers yes an pick a maouthful too The women folk all say I hev to be humoured an I don t kerry things to the sweatin point Course I ve no prejudice against a top buggy s long s I can see it Tedda went on quickly It s ha f seein the pesky thing bobbin an balancn behind the winkers gits on my nerves Then the boss looked at the bit they d sold with me an s he Jiminy Christmas This u d make a clothes horse Stan n end Then he gave me a plain bar bit an fitted it s if there was some feelin to my maouth Hain t ye got any Miss Tedda said Tuck who has a mouth like velvet and knows it Might a had Miss Tuck but I ve forgot Then he give me an open bridle my style s an open bridle an I dunno as I ought to tell this by rights he give me a kiss My said Tuck I can t tell fer the shoes o me what makes some men so fresh Pshaw sis said Nip what s the sense in actin so You git a kiss reg lar s hitchin up time Well you needn t tell smarty said Tuck with a squeal and a kick I d heard o kisses o course Tedda went on but they hadn t come my way specially I don t mind tellin I was that took aback at that man s doin s he might ha lit fire crackers on my saddle Then we went out jest s if a kiss was nothin an I wasn t three strides into my gait fore I felt the boss knoo his business an was trustin me So I studied to please him an he never took the whip from the dash a whip drives me plumb distracted an the upshot was that waal I ve come up the Back Pasture to day an the coupe s tipped clear over twice an I ve waited till twuz fixed each time You kin judge for yourselves I don t set up to be no better than my neighbours specially with my tail snipped off the way tis but I want you all to know Tedda s quit fightin in harness or out of it cep when there s a born fool in the pasture stuffin his stummick with board that ain t rightly hisn cause he hain t earned it Meanin me madam said the yellow horse Ef the shoe fits clinch it said Tedda snorting I named no names though to be sure some folks are mean enough an greedy enough to do thout em There s a deal to be forgiven to ignorance said the yellow horse with an ugly look in his blue eye Seemin ly yes or some folks u d ha been kicked raound the pasture bout onct a minute sence they came board er no board But what you do not understand if you will excuse me madam is that the whole principle o servitood which includes keep an feed starts from a radically false basis an I am proud to say that me an the majority o the horses o Kansas think the entire concern should be relegated to the limbo of exploded superstitions I say we re too progressive for that I say we re too enlightened for that Twas good enough s long s we didn t think but naow but naow a new loominary has arisen on the horizon Meanin you said the Deacon The horses o Kansas are behind me with their multitoodinous thunderin hooves an we say simply but grandly that we take our stand with all four feet on the inalienable rights of the horse pure and simple the high toned child o nature fed by the same wavin grass cooled by the same ripplin brook yes an warmed by the same general rous sun as falls impartially on the outside an the inside of the pampered machine o the trottin track or the bloated coupe horses o these yere Eastern cities Are we not the same flesh an blood Not by a bushel an a half said the Deacon under his breath Grandee never was in Kansas My Ain t that elegant though abaout the wavin grass an the ripplin brooks Tuck whispered in Nip s ear The gentleman s real convincin I think I say we are the same flesh an blood Are we to be separated horse from horse by the artificial barriers of a trottin record or are we to look down upon each other on the strength o the gifts o nature an extry inch below the knee or slightly more powerful quarters What s the use o them advantages to you Man the Oppressor comes along an sees you re likely an good lookin an grinds you to the face o the earth What for For his own pleasure for his own convenience Young an old black an bay white an grey there s no distinctions made between us We re ground up together under the remorseless teeth o the engines of oppression Guess his breechin must ha broke goin daown hill said the Deacon Slippery road maybe an the buggy come onter him an he didn t know nough to hold back That don t feel like teeth though Maybe he busted a shaft an it pricked him An I come to you from Kansas wavin the tail o friendship to all an sundry an in the name of the uncounted millions o pure minded high toned horses now strugglin towards the light o freedom I say to you Rub noses with us in our sacred an holy cause The power is yourn Without you I say Man the Oppressor cannot move himself from place to place Without you he cannot reap he cannot sow he cannot plough Mighty odd place Kansas said Marcus Aurelius Antoninus Seemin ly they reap in the spring an plough in the fall Guess it s right fer them but twould make me kinder giddy The produc s of your untirin industry would rot on the ground if you did not weakly consent to help him Let em rot I say Let him call you to the stables in vain an nevermore Let him shake his ensnarin oats under your nose in vain Let the Brahmas roost in the buggy an the rats run riot round the reaper Let him walk on his two hind feet till they blame well drop off Win no more soul destroyn races for his pleasure Then an not till then will Man the Oppressor know where he s at Quit workin fellow sufferers an slaves Kick Rear Plunge Lie down on the shafts an woller Smash an destroy The conflict will be but short an the victory is certain After that we can press our inalienable rights to eight quarts o oats a day two good blankets an a fly net an the best o stablin The yellow horse shut his yellow teeth with a triumphant snap and Tuck said with a sigh Seems s if somethin ought to be done Don t seem right somehow oppressin us an all to my way o thinkin Said Muldoon in a far away and sleepy voice Who in Vermont s goin to haul de inalienable oats Dey weigh like Sam Hill an sixty bushel at dat allowance ain t goin to last t ree weeks here An dere s de winter hay for five mont s We can settle those minor details when the great cause is won said the yellow horse Let us return simply but grandly to our inalienable rights the right o freedom on these yere verdant hills an no invijjus distinctions o track an pedigree What in stables jer call an invijjus distinction said the Deacon stiffly Fer one thing bein a bloated pampered trotter jest because you happen to be raised that way an couldn t no more help trottin than eatin Do ye know anythin about trotters said the Deacon I ve seen em trot That was enough for me I don t want to know any more Trottin s immoral Waal I ll tell you this much They don t bloat an they don t pamp much I don t hold out to be no trotter myself though I am free to say I had hopes that way onct But I do say fer I ve seen em trained that a trotter don t trot with his feet he trots with his head an he does more work ef you know what that is in a week than you er your sire ever done in all your lives He s everlastingly at it a trotter is an when he isn t he s studyin haow You seen em trot Much you hev You was hitched to a rail back o the stand in a buckboard with a soap box nailed on the slats an a frowzy buff lo atop while your man peddled rum fer lemonade to little boys as thought they was actin manly till you was both run off the track an jailed you intoed shufflin sway backed wind suckin skate you Don t get het up Deacon said Tweezy quietly Now suh would you consider a fox trot an single foot an rack an pace an amble distinctions not worth distinguishin I assuah you gentlemen there was a time befo I was afflicted in my hip if you ll pardon me Miss Tuck when I was quite celebrated in Paduky for all those gaits an in my opinion the Deacon s company rect when he says that a ho se of any position in society gets his gaits by his haid an not by his ah limbs Miss Tuck I reckon I m very little good now but I m rememberin the things I used to do befo I took to transpo tin real estate with the help an assistance of this gentleman here He looked at Muldoon Invijjus arterficial hind legs said the ex carhorse with a grunt of contempt On de Belt Line we don t reckon no horse wuth his keep less he kin switch de car off de track run her round on de cobbles an dump her in ag in ahead o de truck what s blockin him Dere is a way o swingin yer quarters when de driver says Yank her out boys dat takes a year to learn Onct yer git onter it youse kin yank a cable car outer a manhole I don t advertise myself for no circus horse but I knew dat trick better than most an dey was good to me in de stables fer I saved time on de Belt an time s what dey hunt in N York But the simple child o nature the yellow horse began Oh go an unscrew yer splints You re talkin through yer bandages said Muldoon with a horse laugh Dere ain t no loose box for de simple child o nature on de Belt Line wid de Paris comin in an de Teutonic goin out an de trucks an de coupe s sayin things an de heavy freight movin down fer de Boston boat bout t ree o clock of an August afternoon in de middle of a hot wave when de fat Kanucks an Western horses drops dead on de block De simple child o nature had better chase himself inter de water Every man at de end of his lines is mad or loaded or silly an de cop s madder an loadeder an sillier than de rest Dey all take it outer de horses Dere s no wavin brooks ner ripplin grass on de Belt Line Run her out on de cobbles wid de sparks flyin an stop when de cop slugs you on de bone o yer nose Dat s N York see I was always told s ciety in Noo York was dreffle refined an high toned said Tuck We re lookin to go there one o these days Nip an me Oh you won t see no Belt business where you ll go miss De man dat wants you ll want bad an he ll summer you on Long Island er at Newport wid a winky pinky silver harness an an English coachman You ll make a star hitch you an yer brother miss But I guess you won t have no nice smooth bar bit Dey checks em an dey bangs deir tails an dey bits em de city folk an dey says it s English ye know an dey darsen t cut a horse loose ca se o de cops N York s no place fer a horse less he s on de Belt an can go round wid de boys Wisht I was in de Fire Department But did you never stop to consider the degradin servitood of it all said the yellow horse You don t stop on de Belt cully You re stopped An we was all in de servitood business man an horse an Jimmy dat sold de papers Guess de passengers weren t out to grass neither by de way dey acted I done my turn an I m none o Barnum s crowd but any horse dat s worked on de Belt four years don t train wid no simple child o nature not by de whole length o N York But can it be possible that with your experience and at your time of life you do not believe that all horses are free and equal said the yellow horse Not till they re dead Muldoon answered quietly An den it depends on de gross total o buttons an mucilage dey gits outer youse at Barren Island They tell me you re a prominent philosopher The yellow horse turned to Marcus Can you deny a basic and pivotal statement such as this I don t deny anythin said Marcus Aurelius Antoninus cautiously but ef you ast me I should say twuz more different sorts o clipped oats of a lie than anythin I ve had my teeth into sence I wuz foaled Are you a horse said the yellow horse Them that knows me best low I am Ain t I a horse Yep one kind of Then ain t you an me equal How fer kin you go in a day to a loaded buggy drawin five hundred pounds Marcus asked carelessly That has nothing to do with the case the yellow horse answered excitedly There s nothing I know hez more to do with the case Marcus replied Kin ye yank a full car outer de tracks ten times in de mornin said Muldoon Kin ye go to Keene forty two mile in an afternoon with a mate said Rick an turn out bright an early next mornin Was there evah any time in your careah suh I am not referrin to the present circumstances but our mutual glorious past when you could carry a pretty girl to market hahnsome an let her knit all the way on account o the smoothness o the motion said Tweezy Kin you keep your feet through the West River Bridge with the narrer gage comin in on one side an the Montreal flyer the other an the old bridge teeterin between said the Deacon Kin you put your nose down on the cow catcher of a locomotive when you re waitin at the depot an let em play Curfew shall not ring to night with the big brass bell Kin you hold back when the brichin breaks Kin you stop fer orders when your nigh hind leg s over your trace an ye feel good of a frosty mornin said Nip who had only learned that trick last winter and thought it was the crown of horsely knowledge What s the use o talk in said Tedda Gabler scornfully What kin ye do I rely on my simple rights the inalienable rights o my unfettered horsehood An I am proud to say I have never since my first shoes lowered myself to obeyin the will o man Must ha had a heap o whips broke over yer yaller back said Tedda Hev ye found it paid any Sorrer has been my portion since the day I was foaled Blows an boots an whips an insults injury outrage an oppression I would not endoor the degradin badges o servitood that connect us with the buggy an the farm wagon It s amazin difficult to draw a buggy thout traces er collar er breast strap er somefin said Marcus A Power machine for sawin wood is most the only thing there s no straps to I ve helped saw s much as three cord in an afternoon in a Power machine Slep too most o the time I did but tain t half as interestin ez goin daown taown in the Concord Concord don t hender you goin to sleep any said Nip My throat lash D you remember when you lay down in the sharves last week waitin at the piazza Pshaw That didn t hurt the sharves They wuz good an wide an I lay down keerful The folks kep me hitched up nigh an hour fore they started an larfed why they all but lay down themselves with larfin Say Boney if you ve got to be hitched to anything that goes on wheels you ve got to be hitched with somefin Go an jine a circus said Muldoon an walk on your hind legs All de horses dat knows too much to work he pronounced it woik New York fashion jine de circus I am not sayin anythin again work said the yellow horse work is the finest thing in the world Seems too fine fer some of us Tedda snorted I only ask that each horse should work for himself an enjoy the profit of his labours Let him work intelligently an not as a machine There ain t no horse that works like a machine Marcus began There s no way o workin that doesn t mean goin to pole er single they never put me in the Power machine er under saddle said Rick Oh shucks We re talkin same ez we graze said Nip raound an raound in circles Rod we hain t heard from you yet an you ve more know how than any span here Rod the off horse of the pair had been standing with one hip lifted like a tired cow and you could only tell by the quick flutter of the haw across his eye from time to time that he was paying any attention to the argument He thrust his jaw out sidewise as his habit is when he pulls and changed his leg His voice was hard and heavy and his ears were close to his big plain Hambletonian head How old are you he said to the yellow horse Nigh thirteen I guess Mean age ugly age I m gettin that way myself How long hev ye been pawin this firefanged stable litter If you mean my principles I ve held em sence I was three Mean age ugly age teeth give heaps o trouble then Set a colt to actin crazy fer a while You ve kep it up seemin ly D ye talk much to your neighbours fer a steady thing I uphold the principles o the Cause wherever I am pastured Done a heap o good I guess I am proud to say I have taught a few of my companions the principles o freedom an liberty Meanin they ran away er kicked when they got the chanst I was talkin in the abstrac an not in the concrete My teachin s educated them What a horse specially a young horse hears in the abstrac he s liable to do in the Concord You was handled late I presoom Four risin five That s where the trouble began Driv by a woman like ez not eh Not fer long said the yellow horse with a snap of his teeth Spilled her I heerd she never drove again Any childern Buckboards full of em Men too I have shed conside ble men in my time By kickin Any way that come along Fallin back over the dash is as handy as most They must be turr ble afraid o you daown taown They ve sent me here to get rid o me I guess they spend their time talkin over my campaigns I wanter know Yes sir Now all you gentlemen have asked me what I can do I ll just show you See them two fellers lyin down by the buggy Yep one of em owns me T other broke me said Rod Get em out here in the open an I ll show you something Lemme hide back o you peoples so s they won t see what I m at Meanin ter kill em Rod drawled There was a shudder of horror through the others but the yellow horse never noticed I ll catch em by the back o the neck an pile drive em a piece They can suit emselves about livin when I m through with em Shouldn t wonder ef they did said Rod The yellow horse had hidden himself very cleverly behind the others as they stood in a group and was swaying his head close to the ground with a curious scythe like motion looking side wise out of his wicked eyes You can never mistake a man eater getting ready to knock a man down We had had one to pasture the year before See that said my companion turning over on the pine needles Nice for a woman walking cross lots wouldn t it be Bring em out said the yellow horse hunching his sharp back There s no chance among them tall trees Bring out the oh Ouch It was a right and left kick from Muldoon I had no idea that the old car horse could lift so quickly Both blows caught the yellow horse full and fair in the ribs and knocked the breath out of him What s that for he said angrily when he recovered himself but I noticed he did not draw any nearer to Muldoon than was necessary Muldoon never answered but discoursed to himself in the whining grunt that he uses when he is going down hill in front of a heavy load We call it singing but I think it s something much worse really The yellow horse blustered and squealed a little and at last said that if it was a horse fly that had stung Muldoon he would accept an apology You ll get it said Muldoon in de sweet by and bye all de apology you ve any use for Excuse me interruptin you mister Rod but I m like Tweezy I ve a Southern drawback in me hind legs Naow I want you all here to take notice an you ll learn something Rod went on This yaller backed skate comes to our pastur Not havin paid his board put in Tedda Not havin earned his board an talks smooth to us abaout ripplin brooks an wavin grass an his high toned pure souled horsehood which don t hender him sheddin women an childern an fallin over the dash onter men You heard his talk an you thought it mighty fine some o you Tuck looked guilty here but she did not say anything Bit by bit he goes on ez you have heard I was talkin in the abstrac said the yellow horse in an altered voice Abstrac be switched Ez I ve said it s this yer blamed abstrac business that makes the young uns cut up in the Concord an abstrac or no abstrac he crep on an on till he come to killin plain an straight killin them as never done him no harm jest beca se they owned horses An knowed how to manage em said Tedda That makes it worse Waal he didn t kill em anyway said Marcus He d ha been half killed ef he had tried Makes no differ Rod answered He meant to an ef he hadn t s pose we want the Back Pasture turned into a biffin ground on our only day er rest S pose we want our men walkin round with bits er lead pipe an a twitch an their hands full o stones to throw at us same s if we wuz hogs er hooky keows More n that leavin out Tedda here an I guess it s more her maouth than her manners stands in her light there ain t a horse on this farm that ain t a woman s horse an proud of it An this yer bogspavined Kansas sunflower goes up an daown the length o the country traded off an traded on boastin as he s shed women an childern I don t say as a woman in a buggy ain t a fool I don t say as she ain t the lastin est kind er fool ner I don t say a child ain t worse spattin the lines an standin up an hollerin but I do say tain t none of our business to shed em daown the road We don t said the Deacon The baby tried to git some o my tail for a sooveneer last fall when I was up to the haouse an I didn t kick Boney s talk ain t goin to hurt us any We ain t colts Thet s what you think Bimeby you git into a tight corner Lection day er Valley Fair like s not daown taown when you re all het an lathery an pestered with flies an thirsty an sick o bein worked in an aout tween buggies Then somethin whispers inside o your winkers bringin up all that talk abaout servitood an inalienable truck an sech like an jest then a Militia gun goes off er your wheels hit an waal you re only another horse ez can t be trusted I ve been there time an again Boys fer I ve seen you all bought er broke on my solemn repitation fer a three minute clip I ain t givin you no bran mash o my own fixin I m tellin you my experiences an I ve had ez heavy a load an ez high a check s any horse here I wuz born with a splint on my near fore ez big s a walnut an the cussed three cornered Hambletonian temper that sours up an curdles daown ez you git older I ve favoured my splint even little Rick he don t know what it s cost me to keep my end up sometimes an I ve fit my temper in stall an harness hitched up an at pasture till the sweat trickled off my hooves an they thought I wuz off condition an drenched me When my affliction came said Tweezy gently I was very near to losin my manners Allow me to extend to you my sympathy suh Rick said nothing but he looked at Rod curiously Rick is a sunny tempered child who never bears malice and I don t think he quite understood He gets his temper from his mother as a horse should I ve been there too Rod said Tedda Open confession s good for the soul an all Monroe County knows I ve had my experriences But if you will excuse me suh that pusson Tweezy looked unspeakable things at the yellow horse that pusson who has insulted our intelligences comes from Kansas An what a ho se of his position an Kansas at that says cannot by any stretch of the halter concern gentlemen of our position There s no shadow of equal ty suh not even for one kick He s beneath our contempt Let him talk said Marcus It s always interestin to know what another horse thinks It don t tech us An he talks so too said Tuck I ve never heard anythin so smart for a long time Again Rod stuck out his jaws sidewise and went on slowly as though he were slugging on a plain bit at the end of a thirty mile drive I want all you here ter understand thet ther ain t no Kansas ner no Kentucky ner yet no Vermont in our business There s jest two kind o horse in the United States them ez can an will do their work after bein properly broke an handled an them as won t I m sick an tired o this everlastin tail switchin an wickerin abaout one State er another A horse kin be proud o his State an swap lies abaout it in stall or when he s hitched to a block ef he keers to put in fly time that way but he hain t no right to let that pride o hisn interfere with his work ner to make it an excuse fer claimin he s different That s colts talk an don t you fergit it Tweezy An Marcus you remember that hem a philosopher an anxious to save trouble fer you ate don t excuse you from jumpin with all your feet on a slack jawed crazy clay bank like Boney here It s leavin em alone that gives em their chance to ruin colts an kill folks An Tuck waal you re a mare anyways but when a horse comes along an covers up all his talk o killin with ripplin brooks an wavin grass an eight quarts of oats a day free after killn his man don t you be run away with by his yap You re too young an too nervous I ll I ll have nervous prostration sure ef there s a fight here said Tuck who saw what was in Rod s eye I m I m that sympathetic I d run away clear to next caounty Yep I know that kind o sympathy Jest lasts long enough to start a fuss an then lights aout to make new trouble I hain t been ten years in harness fer nuthin Naow we re goin to keep school with Boney fer a spell Say look a here you ain t goin to hurt me are you Remember I belong to a man in town cried the yellow horse uneasily Muldoon kept behind him so that he could not run away I know it There must be some pore delooded fool in this State hez a right to the loose end o your hitchin strap I m blame sorry fer him but he shall hev his rights when we re through with you said Rod If it s all the same gentlemen I d ruther change pasture Guess I ll do it now Can t always have your druthers Guess you won t said Rod But look a here All of you ain t so blame unfriendly to a stranger S pose we count noses What in Vermont fer said Rod putting up his eyebrows The idea of settling a question by counting noses is the very last thing that ever enters the head of a well broken horse To see how many s on my side Here s Miss Tuck anyway an Colonel Tweezy yonder s neutral an Judge Marcus an I guess the Reverend the yellow horse meant the Deacon might see that I had my rights He s the likeliest lookin Trotter I ve ever set eyes on Pshaw Boys You ain t goin to pound me be you Why we ve gone round in pasture all colts together this month o Sundays hain t we as friendly as could be There ain t a horse alive I don t care who he is has a higher opinion o you mister Rod than I have Let s do it fair an true an above the exe Let s count noses same s they do in Kansas Here he dropped his voice a little and turned to Marcus Say Judge there s some green food I know back o the brook no one hain t touched yet After this little fracas is fixed up you an me ll make up a party an tend to it Marcus did not answer for a long time then he said There s a pup up to the haouse bout eight weeks old He ll yap till he gits a lickin an when he sees it comin he lies on his back an yowls But he don t go through no cirkituous nose countin first I ve seen a noo light sence Rod spoke You ll better stand up to what s served I m goin to philosophise all over your carcass I m goin to do yer up in brown paper said Muldoon I can fit you on apologies Hold on Ef we all biffed you now these same men you ve been so dead anxious to kill u d call us off Guess we ll wait till they go back to the haouse an you ll have time to think cool an quiet said Rod Have you no respec whatever fer the dignity o our common horsehood the yellow horse squealed Nary respec onless the horse kin do something America s paved with the kind er horse you are jist plain yaller dog horse waitin ter be whipped inter shape We call em yearlings an colts when they re young When they re aged we pound em in this pastur Horse sonny is what you start from We know all about horse here an he ain t any high toned pure souled child o nature Horse plain horse same ez you is chock full o tricks an meannesses an cussednesses an shirkin s an monkey shines which he s took over from his sire an his dam an thickened up with his own special fancy in the way o goin crooked Thet s horse an thet s about his dignity an the size of his soul fore he s been broke an rawhided a piece Now we ain t goin to give ornery unswitched horse that hain t done nawthin wuth a quart of oats sence he wuz foaled pet names that would be good enough fer Nancy Hanks or Alix or Directum who hev Don t you try to back off acrost them rocks Wait where you are Ef I let my Hambletonian temper git the better o me I d frazzle you out finer than rye straw inside o three minutes you woman scarin kid killin dash breakin unbroke unshod ungaited pastur hoggin saw backed shark mouthed hair trunk thrown in in trade son of a bronco an a sewin machine I think we d better get home I said to my companion when Rod had finished and we climbed into the coupe Tedda whinnying as we bumped over the ledges Well I m dreffle sorry I can t stay fer the sociable but I hope an trust my friends ll take a ticket fer me Bet your natchul said Muldoon cheerfully and the horses scattered before us trotting into the ravine Next morning we sent back to the livery stable what was left of the yellow horse It seemed tired but anxious to go THE SHIP THAT FOUND HERSELF It was her first voyage and though she was but a cargo steamer of twenty five hundred tons she was the very best of her kind the outcome of forty years of experiments and improvements in framework and machinery and her designers and owner thought as much of her as though she had been the Lucania Any one can make a floating hotel that will pay expenses if he puts enough money into the saloon and charges for private baths suites of rooms and such like but in these days of competition and low freights every square inch of a cargo boat must be built for cheapness great hold capacity and a certain steady speed This boat was perhaps two hundred and forty feet long and thirty two feet wide with arrangements that enabled her to carry cattle on her main and sheep on her upper deck if she wanted to but her great glory was the amount of cargo that she could store away in her holds Her owners they were a very well known Scotch firm came round with her from the north where she had been launched and christened and fitted to Liverpool where she was to take cargo for New York and the owner s daughter Miss Frazier went to and fro on the clean decks admiring the new paint and the brass work and the patent winches and particularly the strong straight bow over which she had cracked a bottle of champagne when she named the steamer the Dimbula It was a beautiful September afternoon and the boat in all her newness she was painted lead colour with a red funnel looked very fine indeed Her house flag was flying and her whistle from time to time acknowledged the salutes of friendly boats who saw that she was new to the High and Narrow Seas and wished to make her welcome And now said Miss Frazier delightedly to the captain she s a real ship isn t she It seems only the other day father gave the order for her and now and now isn t she a beauty The girl was proud of the firm and talked as though she were the controlling partner Oh she s no so bad the skipper replied cautiously But I m sayin that it takes more than christenin to mak a ship In the nature o things Miss Frazier if ye follow me she s just irons and rivets and plates put into the form of a ship She has to find herself yet I thought father said she was exceptionally well found So she is said the skipper with a laugh But it s this way wi ships Miss Frazier She s all here but the parrts of her have not learned to work together yet They ve had no chance The engines are working beautifully I can hear them Yes indeed But there s more than engines to a ship Every inch of her ye ll understand has to be livened up and made to work wi its neighbour sweetenin her we call it technically And how will you do it the girl asked We can no more than drive and steer her and so forth but if we have rough weather this trip it s likely she ll learn the rest by heart For a ship ye ll obsairve Miss Frazier is in no sense a reegid body closed at both ends She s a highly complex structure o various an conflictin strains wi tissues that must give an tak accordin to her personal modulus of elasteecity mister Buchanan the chief engineer was coming towards them I m sayin to Miss Frazier here that our little Dimbula has to be sweetened yet and nothin but a gale will do it How s all wi your engines Buck Well enough true by plumb an rule o course but there s no spontaneeity yet He turned to the girl Take my word Miss Frazier and maybe ye ll comprehend later even after a pretty girl s christened a ship it does not follow that there s such a thing as a ship under the men that work her I was sayin the very same mister Buchanan the skipper interrupted That s more metaphysical than I can follow said Miss Frazier laughing Why so Ye re good Scotch an I knew your mother s father he was fra Dumfries ye ve a vested right in metapheesics Miss Frazier just as ye have in the Dimbula the engineer said Eh well we must go down to the deep watters an earn Miss Frazier her deevidends Will you not come to my cabin for tea said the skipper We ll be in dock the night and when you re goin back to Glasgie ye can think of us loadin her down an drivin her forth all for your sake In the next few days they stowed some four thousand tons dead weight into the Dimbula and took her out from Liverpool As soon as she met the lift of the open water she naturally began to talk If you lay your ear to the side of the cabin the next time you are in a steamer you will hear hundreds of little voices in every direction thrilling and buzzing and whispering and popping and gurgling and sobbing and squeaking exactly like a telephone in a thunder storm Wooden ships shriek and growl and grunt but iron vessels throb and quiver through all their hundreds of ribs and thousands of rivets The Dimbula was very strongly built and every piece of her had a letter or a number or both to describe it and every piece had been hammered or forged or rolled or punched by man and had lived in the roar and rattle of the shipyard for months Therefore every piece had its own separate voice in exact proportion to the amount of trouble spent upon it Cast iron as a rule says very little but mild steel plates and wrought iron and ribs and beams that have been much bent and welded and riveted talk continuously Their conversation of course is not half as wise as our human talk because they are all though they do not know it bound down one to the other in a black darkness where they cannot tell what is happening near them nor what will overtake them next As soon as she had cleared the Irish coast a sullen grey headed old wave of the Atlantic climbed leisurely over her straight bows and sat down on the steam capstan used for hauling up the anchor Now the capstan and the engine that drove it had been newly painted red and green besides which nobody likes being ducked Don t you do that again the capstan sputtered through the teeth of his cogs Hi Where s the fellow gone The wave had slouched overside with a plop and a chuckle but Plenty more where he came from said a brother wave and went through and over the capstan who was bolted firmly to an iron plate on the iron deck beams below Can t you keep still up there said the deckbeams What s the matter with you One minute you weigh twice as much as you ought to and the next you don t It isn t my fault said the capstan There s a green brute outside that comes and hits me on the head Tell that to the shipwrights You ve been in position for months and you ve never wriggled like this before If you aren t careful you ll strain us Talking of strain said a low rasping unpleasant voice are any of you fellows you deck beams we mean aware that those exceedingly ugly knees of yours happen to be riveted into our structure ours Who might you be the deck beams inquired Oh nobody in particular was the answer We re only the port and starboard upper deck stringers and if you persist in heaving and hiking like this we shall be reluctantly compelled to take steps Now the stringers of the ship are long iron girders so to speak that run lengthways from stern to bow They keep the iron frames what are called ribs in a wooden ship in place and also help to hold the ends of the deck beams which go from side to side of the ship Stringers always consider themselves most important because they are so long You will take steps will you This was a long echoing rumble It came from the frames scores and scores of them each one about eighteen inches distant from the next and each riveted to the stringers in four places We think you will have a certain amount of trouble in that and thousands and thousands of the little rivets that held everything together whispered You Will You will Stop quivering and be quiet Hold on brethren Hold on Hot Punches What s that Rivets have no teeth so they cannot chatter with fright but they did their best as a fluttering jar swept along the ship from stern to bow and she shook like a rat in a terrier s mouth An unusually severe pitch for the sea was rising had lifted the big throbbing screw nearly to the surface and it was spinning round in a kind of soda water half sea and half air going much faster than was proper because there was no deep water for it to work in As it sank again the engines and they were triple expansion three cylinders in a row snorted through all their three pistons Was that a joke you fellow outside It s an uncommonly poor one How are we to do our work if you fly off the handle that way I didn t fly off the handle said the screw twirling huskily at the end of the screw shaft If I had you d have been scrap iron by this time The sea dropped away from under me and I had nothing to catch on to That s all That s all d you call it said the thrust block whose business it is to take the push of the screw for if a screw had nothing to hold it back it would crawl right into the engine room It is the holding back of the screwing action that gives the drive to a ship I know I do my work deep down and out of sight but I warn you I expect justice All I ask for is bare justice Why can t you push steadily and evenly instead of whizzing like a whirligig and making me hot under all my collars The thrust block had six collars each faced with brass and he did not wish to get them heated All the bearings that supported the fifty feet of screw shaft as it ran to the stern whispered Justice give us justice I can only give you what I can get the screw answered Look out It s coming again He rose with a roar as the Dimbula plunged and whack flack whack whack went the engines furiously for they had little to check them I m the noblest outcome of human ingenuity mister Buchanan says so squealed the high pressure cylinder This is simply ridiculous The piston went up savagely and choked for half the steam behind it was mixed with dirty water Help Oiler Fitter Stoker Help I m choking it gasped Never in the history of maritime invention has such a calamity over taken one so young and strong And if I go who s to drive the ship Hush oh hush whispered the Steam who of course had been to sea many times before He used to spend his leisure ashore in a cloud or a gutter or a flower pot or a thunder storm or anywhere else where water was needed That s only a little priming a little carrying over as they call it It ll happen all night on and off I don t say it s nice but it s the best we can do under the circumstances What difference can circumstances make I m here to do my work on clean dry steam Blow circumstances the cylinder roared The circumstances will attend to the blowing I ve worked on the North Atlantic run a good many times it s going to be rough before morning It isn t distressingly calm now said the extra strong frames they were called web frames in the engine room There s an upward thrust that we don t understand and there s a twist that is very bad for our brackets and diamond plates and there s a sort of west northwesterly pull that follows the twist which seriously annoys us We mention this because we happened to cost a good deal of money and we feel sure that the owner would not approve of our being treated in this frivolous way I m afraid the matter is out of owner s hands for the present said the Steam slipping into the condenser You re left to your own devices till the weather betters I wouldn t mind the weather said a flat bass voice below it s this confounded cargo that s breaking my heart I m the garboard strake and I m twice as thick as most of the others and I ought to know something The garboard strake is the lowest plate in the bottom of a ship and the Dimbula s garboard strake was nearly three quarters of an inch mild steel The sea pushes me up in a way I should never have expected the strake grunted and the cargo pushes me down and between the two I don t know what I m supposed to do When in doubt hold on rumbled the Steam making head in the boilers Yes but there s only dark and cold and hurry down here and how do I know whether the other plates are doing their duty Those bulwark plates up above I ve heard ain t more than five sixteenths of an inch thick scandalous I call it I agree with you said a huge web frame by the main cargo hatch He was deeper and thicker than all the others and curved half way across the ship in the shape of half an arch to support the deck where deck beams would have been in the way of cargo coming up and down I work entirely unsupported and I observe that I am the sole strength of this vessel so far as my vision extends The responsibility I assure you is enormous I believe the money value of the cargo is over one hundred and fifty thousand pounds Think of that And every pound of it is dependent on my personal exertions Here spoke a sea valve that communicated directly with the water outside and was seated not very far from the garboard strake I rejoice to think that I am a Prince Hyde Valve with best Para rubber facings Five patents cover me I mention this without pride five separate and several patents each one finer than the other At present I am screwed fast Should I open you would immediately be swamped This is incontrovertible Patent things always use the longest words they can It is a trick that they pick up from their inventors That s news said a big centrifugal bilge pump I had an idea that you were employed to clean decks and things with At least I ve used you for that more than once I forget the precise number in thousands of gallons which I am guaranteed to throw per hour but I assure you my complaining friends that there is not the least danger I alone am capable of clearing any water that may find its way here By my Biggest Deliveries we pitched then The sea was getting up in workmanlike style It was a dead westerly gale blown from under a ragged opening of green sky narrowed on all sides by fat grey clouds and the wind bit like pincers as it fretted the spray into lacework on the flanks of the waves I tell you what it is the foremast telephoned down its wire stays I m up here and I can take a dispassionate view of things There s an organised conspiracy against us I m sure of it because every single one of these waves is heading directly for our bows The whole sea is concerned in it and so s the wind It s awful What s awful said a wave drowning the capstan for the hundredth time This organised conspiracy on your part the capstan gurgled taking his cue from the mast Organised bubbles and spindrift There has been a depression in the Gulf of Mexico Excuse me He leaped overside but his friends took up the tale one after another Which has advanced That wave hove green water over the funnel As far as Cape Hatteras He drenched the bridge And is now going out to sea to sea to sea The third went out in three surges making a clean sweep of a boat which turned bottom up and sank in the darkening troughs alongside while the broken falls whipped the davits That s all there is to it seethed the white water roaring through the scuppers There s no animus in our proceedings We re only meteorological corollaries Is it going to get any worse said the bow anchor chained down to the deck where he could only breathe once in five minutes Not knowing can t say Wind may blow a bit by midnight Thanks awfully Good bye The wave that spoke so politely had travelled some distance aft and found itself all mixed up on the deck amidships which was a well deck sunk between high bulwarks One of the bulwark plates which was hung on hinges to open outward had swung out and passed the bulk of the water back to the sea again with a clean smack Evidently that s what I m made for said the plate closing again with a sputter of pride Oh no you don t my friend The top of a wave was trying to get in from the outside but as the plate did not open in that direction the defeated water spurted back Not bad for five sixteenths of an inch said the bulwark plate My work I see is laid down for the night and it began opening and shutting as it was designed to do with the motion of the ship We are not what you might call idle groaned all the frames together as the Dimbula climbed a big wave lay on her side at the top and shot into the next hollow twisting in the descent A huge swell pushed up exactly under her middle and her bow and stern hung free with nothing to support them Then one joking wave caught her up at the bow and another at the stern while the rest of the water slunk away from under her just to see how she would like it so she was held up at her two ends only and the weight of the cargo and the machinery fell on the groaning iron keels and bilge stringers Ease off Ease off there roared the garboard strake I want one eighth of an inch fair play D you hear me you rivets Ease off Ease off cried the bilge stringers Don t hold us so tight to the frames Ease off grunted the deck beams as the Dimbula rolled fearfully You ve cramped our knees into the stringers and we can t move Ease off you flat headed little nuisances Then two converging seas hit the bows one on each side and fell away in torrents of streaming thunder Ease off shouted the forward collision bulkhead I want to crumple up but I m stiffened in every direction Ease off you dirty little forge filings Let me breathe All the hundreds of plates that are riveted to the frames and make the outside skin of every steamer echoed the call for each plate wanted to shift and creep a little and each plate according to its position complained against the rivets We can t help it We can t help it they murmured in reply We re put here to hold you and we re going to do it you never pull us twice in the same direction If you d say what you were going to do next we d try to meet your views As far as I could feel said the upper deck planking and that was four inches thick every single iron near me was pushing or pulling in opposite directions Now what s the sense of that My friends let us all pull together Pull any way you please roared the funnel so long as you don t try your experiments on me I need fourteen wire ropes all pulling in different directions to hold me steady Isn t that so We believe you my boy whistled the funnel stays through their clinched teeth as they twanged in the wind from the top of the funnel to the deck Nonsense We must all pull together the decks repeated Pull lengthways Very good said the stringers then stop pushing sideways when you get wet Be content to run gracefully fore and aft and curve in at the ends as we do No no curves at the end A very slight workmanlike curve from side to side with a good grip at each knee and little pieces welded on said the deck beams Fiddle cried the iron pillars of the deep dark hold Who ever heard of curves Stand up straight be a perfectly round column and carry tons of good solid weight like that There A big sea smashed on the deck above and the pillars stiffened themselves to the load Straight up and down is not bad said the frames who ran that way in the sides of the ship but you must also expand yourselves sideways Expansion is the law of life children Open out open out Come back said the deck beams savagely as the upward heave of the sea made the frames try to open Come back to your bearings you slack jawed irons Rigidity Rigidity Rigidity thumped the engines Absolute unvarying rigidity rigidity You see whined the rivets in chorus No two of you will ever pull alike and and you blame it all on us We only know how to go through a plate and bite down on both sides so that it can t and mustn t and sha n t move I ve got one fraction of an inch play at any rate said the garboard strake triumphantly So he had and all the bottom of the ship felt the easier for it Then we re no good sobbed the bottom rivets We were ordered we were ordered never to give and we ve given and the sea will come in and we ll all go to the bottom together First we re blamed for everything unpleasant and now we haven t the consolation of having done our work Don t say I told you whispered the Steam consolingly but between you and me and the last cloud I came from it was bound to happen sooner or later You had to give a fraction and you ve given without knowing it Now hold on as before What s the use a few hundred rivets chattered We ve given we ve given and the sooner we confess that we can t keep the ship together and go off our little heads the easier it will be No rivet forged can stand this strain No one rivet was ever meant to Share it among you the Steam answered The others can have my share I m going to pull out said a rivet in one of the forward plates If you go others will follow hissed the Steam There s nothing so contagious in a boat as rivets going Why I knew a little chap like you he was an eighth of an inch fatter though on a steamer to be sure she was only twelve hundred tons now I come to think of it in exactly the same place as you are He pulled out in a bit of a bobble of a sea not half as bad as this and he started all his friends on the same butt strap and the plates opened like a furnace door and I had to climb into the nearest fog bank while the boat went down Now that s peculiarly disgraceful said the rivet Fatter than me was he and in a steamer not half our tonnage Reedy little peg I blush for the family sir He settled himself more firmly than ever in his place and the Steam chuckled You see he went on quite gravely a rivet and especially a rivet in your position is really the one indispensable part of the ship The Steam did not say that he had whispered the very same thing to every single piece of iron aboard There is no sense in telling too much And all that while the little Dimbula pitched and chopped and swung and slewed and lay down as though she were going to die and got up as though she had been stung and threw her nose round and round in circles half a dozen times as she dipped for the gale was at its worst It was inky black in spite of the tearing white froth on the waves and to top everything the rain began to fall in sheets so that you could not see your hand before your face This did not make much difference to the ironwork below but it troubled the foremast a good deal Now it s all finished he said dismally The conspiracy is too strong for us There is nothing left but to Hurraar Brrrraaah Brrrrrrp roared the Steam through the fog horn till the decks quivered Don t be frightened below It s only me just throwing out a few words in case any one happens to be rolling round to night You don t mean to say there s any one except us on the sea in such weather said the funnel in a husky snuffle Scores of em said the Steam clearing its throat Rrrrrraaa Brraaaaa Prrrrp It s a trifle windy up here and Great Boilers how it rains We re drowning said the scuppers They had been doing nothing else all night but this steady thrash of rain above them seemed to be the end of the world That s all right We ll be easier in an hour or two First the wind and then the rain Soon you may make sail again Grrraaaaaah Drrrraaaa Drrrp I have a notion that the sea is going down already If it does you ll learn something about rolling We ve only pitched till now By the way aren t you chaps in the hold a little easier than you were There was just as much groaning and straining as ever but it was not so loud or squeaky in tone and when the ship quivered she did not jar stiffly like a poker hit on the floor but gave with a supple little waggle like a perfectly balanced golf club We have made a most amazing discovery said the stringers one after another A discovery that entirely changes the situation We have found for the first time in the history of ship building that the inward pull of the deck beams and the outward thrust of the frames locks us as it were more closely in our places and enables us to endure a strain which is entirely without parallel in the records of marine architecture The Steam turned a laugh quickly into a roar up the fog horn What massive intellects you great stringers have he said softly when he had finished We also began the deck beams are discoverers and geniuses We are of opinion that the support of the hold pillars materially helps us We find that we lock up on them when we are subjected to a heavy and singular weight of sea above Here the Dimbula shot down a hollow lying almost on her side righting at the bottom with a wrench and a spasm In these cases are you aware of this Steam the plating at the bows and particularly at the stern we would also mention the floors beneath us help us to resist any tendency to spring The frames spoke in the solemn awed voice which people use when they have just come across something entirely new for the very first time I m only a poor puffy little flutterer said the Steam but I have to stand a good deal of pressure in my business It s all tremendously interesting Tell us some more You fellows are so strong Watch us and you ll see said the bow plates proudly Ready behind there Here s the father and mother of waves coming Sit tight rivets all A great sluicing comber thundered by but through the scuffle and confusion the Steam could hear the low quick cries of the ironwork as the various strains took them cries like these Easy now easy Now push for all your strength Hold out Give a fraction Hold up Pull in Shove crossways Mind the strain at the ends Grip now Bite tight Let the water get away from under and there she goes The wave raced off into the darkness shouting Not bad that if it s your first run and the drenched and ducked ship throbbed to the beat of the engines inside her All three cylinders were white with the salt spray that had come down through the engine room hatch there was white fur on the canvas bound steam pipes and even the bright work deep below was speckled and soiled but the cylinders had learned to make the most of steam that was half water and were pounding along cheerfully How s the noblest outcome of human ingenuity hitting it said the Steam as he whirled through the engine room Nothing for nothing in this world of woe the cylinders answered as though they had been working for centuries and precious little for seventy five pounds head We ve made two knots this last hour and a quarter Rather humiliating for eight hundred horse power isn t it Well it s better than drifting astern at any rate You seem rather less how shall I put it stiff in the back than you were If you d been hammered as we ve been this night you wouldn t be stiff iff iff either Theoreti retti retti cally of course rigidity is the thing Purrr purr practically there has to be a little give and take We found that out by working on our sides for five minutes at a stretch chch chh How s the weather Sea s going down fast said the Steam Good business said the high pressure cylinder Whack her up boys They ve given us five pounds more steam and he began humming the first bars of Said the young Obadiah to the old Obadiah which as you may have noticed is a pet tune among engines not built for high speed Racing liners with twin screws sing The Turkish Patrol and the overture to the Bronze Horse and Madame Angot till something goes wrong and then they render Gounod s Funeral March of a Marionette with variations You ll learn a song of your own some fine day said the Steam as he flew up the fog horn for one last bellow Next day the sky cleared and the sea dropped a little and the Dimbula began to roll from side to side till every inch of iron in her was sick and giddy But luckily they did not all feel ill at the same time otherwise she would have opened out like a wet paper box The Steam whistled warnings as he went about his business it is in this short quick roll and tumble that follows a heavy sea that most of the accidents happen for then everything thinks that the worst is over and goes off guard So he orated and chattered till the beams and frames and floors and stringers and things had learned how to lock down and lock up on one another and endure this new kind of strain They found ample time to practise for they were sixteen days at sea and it was foul weather till within a hundred miles of New York The Dimbula picked up her pilot and came in covered with salt and red rust Her funnel was dirty grey from top to bottom two boats had been carried away three copper ventilators looked like hats after a fight with the police the bridge had a dimple in the middle of it the house that covered the steam steering gear was split as with hatchets there was a bill for small repairs in the engine room almost as long as the screw shaft the forward cargo hatch fell into bucket staves when they raised the iron cross bars and the steam capstan had been badly wrenched on its bed Altogether as the skipper said it was a pretty general average But she s soupled he said to mister Buchanan For all her dead weight she rode like a yacht Ye mind that last blow off the Banks I am proud of her Buck It s vera good said the chief engineer looking along the dishevelled decks Now a man judgin superfeecially would say we were a wreck but we know otherwise by experience Naturally everything in the Dimbula fairly stiffened with pride and the foremast and the forward collision bulkhead who are pushing creatures begged the Steam to warn the Port of New York of their arrival Tell those big boats all about us they said They seem to take us quite as a matter of course It was a glorious clear dead calm morning and in single file with less than half a mile between each their bands playing and their tugboats shouting and waving handkerchiefs were the Majestic the Paris the Touraine the Servia the Kaiser Wilhelm II and the Werkendam all statelily going out to sea As the Dimbula shifted her helm to give the great boats clear way the Steam who knows far too much to mind making an exhibition of himself now and then shouted Oyez Oyez Oyez Princes Dukes and Barons of the High Seas Know ye by these presents we are the Dimbula fifteen days nine hours from Liverpool having crossed the Atlantic with four thousand ton of cargo for the first time in our career We have not foundered We are here Eer Eer We are not disabled But we have had a time wholly unparalleled in the annals of ship building Our decks were swept We pitched we rolled We thought we were going to die Hi Hi But we didn t We wish to give notice that we have come to New York all the way across the Atlantic through the worst weather in the world and we are the Dimbula We are arr ha ha ha r r r The beautiful line of boats swept by as steadily as the procession of the Seasons The Dimbula heard the Majestic say Hmph and the Paris grunted How and the Touraine said Oui with a little coquettish flicker of steam and the Servia said Haw and the Kaiser and the Werkendam said Hoch Dutch fashion and that was absolutely all I did my best said the Steam gravely but I don t think they were much impressed with us somehow Do you It s simply disgusting said the bow plates They might have seen what we ve been through There isn t a ship on the sea that has suffered as we have is there now Well I wouldn t go so far as that said the Steam because I ve worked on some of those boats and sent them through weather quite as bad as the fortnight that we ve had in six days and some of them are a little over ten thousand tons I believe Now I ve seen the Majestic for instance ducked from her bows to her funnel and I ve helped the Arizona I think she was to back off an iceberg she met with one dark night and I had to run out of the Paris s engine room one day because there was thirty foot of water in it Of course I don t deny The Steam shut off suddenly as a tugboat loaded with a political club and a brass band that had been to see a New York Senator off to Europe crossed their bows going to Hoboken There was a long silence that reached without a break from the cut water to the propeller blades of the Dimbula Then a new big voice said slowly and thickly as though the owner had just waked up It s my conviction that I have made a fool of myself The Steam knew what had happened at once for when a ship finds herself all the talking of the separate pieces ceases and melts into one voice which is the soul of the ship Who are you he said with a laugh I am the Dimbula of course I ve never been anything else except that and a fool The tugboat which was doing its very best to be run down got away just in time its band playing clashily and brassily a popular but impolite air In the days of old Rameses are you on In the days of old Rameses are you on In the days of old Rameses That story had paresis Are you on are you on are you on Well I m glad you ve found yourself said the Steam To tell the truth I was a little tired of talking to all those ribs and stringers Here s Quarantine After that we ll go to our wharf and clean up a little and next month we ll do it all over again THE TOMB OF HIS ANCESTORS Some people will tell you that if there were but a single loaf of bread in all India it would be divided equally between the Plowdens the Trevors the Beadons and the Rivett Carnacs That is only one way of saying that certain families serve India generation after generation as dolphins follow in line across the open sea Let us take a small and obscure case There has been at least one representative of the Devonshire Chinns in or near Central India since the days of Lieutenant Fireworker Humphrey Chinn of the Bombay European Regiment who assisted at the capture of Seringapatam in seventeen ninety nine Alfred Ellis Chinn Humphrey s younger brother commanded a regiment of Bombay grenadiers from eighteen oh four to eighteen thirteen when he saw some mixed fighting and in eighteen thirty four John Chinn of the same family we will call him John Chinn the First came to light as a level headed administrator in time of trouble at a place called Mundesur He died young but left his mark on the new country and the Honourable the Board of Directors of the Honourable the East India Company embodied his virtues in a stately resolution and paid for the expenses of his tomb among the Satpura hills He was succeeded by his son Lionel Chinn who left the little old Devonshire home just in time to be severely wounded in the Mutiny He spent his working life within a hundred and fifty miles of John Chinn s grave and rose to the command of a regiment of small wild hill men most of whom had known his father His son John was born in the small thatched roofed mud walled cantonment which is even to day eighty miles from the nearest railway in the heart of a scrubby tigerish country Colonel Lionel Chinn served thirty years and retired In the Canal his steamer passed the outward bound troop ship carrying his son eastward to the family duty The Chinns are luckier than most folk because they know exactly what they must do A clever Chinn passes for the Bombay Civil Service and gets away to Central India where everybody is glad to see him A dull Chinn enters the Police Department or the Woods and Forest and sooner or later he too appears in Central India and that is what gave rise to the saying Central India is inhabited by Bhils Mairs and Chinns all very much alike The breed is small boned dark and silent and the stupidest of them are good shots John Chinn the Second was rather clever but as the eldest son he entered the army according to Chinn tradition His duty was to abide in his father s regiment for the term of his natural life though the corps was one which most men would have paid heavily to avoid They were irregulars small dark and blackish clothed in rifle green with black leather trimmings and friends called them the Wuddars which means a race of low caste people who dig up rats to eat But the Wuddars did not resent it They were the only Wuddars and their points of pride were these Firstly they had fewer English officers than any native regiment Secondly their subalterns were not mounted on parade as is the general rule but walked at the head of their men A man who can hold his own with the Wuddars at their quickstep must be sound in wind and limb Thirdly they were the most pukka shikarries out and out hunters in all India Fourthly up to one hundredthly they were the Wuddars Chinn s Irregular Bhil Levies of the old days but now henceforward and for ever the Wuddars No Englishman entered their mess except for love or through family usage The officers talked to their soldiers in a tongue not two hundred white folk in India understood and the men were their children all drawn from the Bhils who are perhaps the strangest of the many strange races in India They were and at heart are wild men furtive shy full of untold superstitions The races whom we call natives of the country found the Bhil in possession of the land when they first broke into that part of the world thousands of years ago The books call them Pre Aryan Aboriginal Dravidian and so forth and in other words that is what the Bhils call themselves When a Rajput chief whose bards can sing his pedigree backwards for twelve hundred years is set on the throne his investiture is not complete till he has been marked on the forehead with blood from the veins of a Bhil The Rajputs say the ceremony has no meaning but the Bhil knows that it is the last last shadow of his old rights as the long ago owner of the soil Centuries of oppression and massacre made the Bhil a cruel and half crazy thief and cattle stealer and when the English came he seemed to be almost as open to civilisation as the tigers of his own jungles But John Chinn the First father of Lionel grandfather of our John went into his country lived with him learned his language shot the deer that stole his poor crops and won his confidence so that some Bhils learned to plough and sow while others were coaxed into the Company s service to police their friends When they understood that standing in line did not mean instant execution they accepted soldiering as a cumbrous but amusing kind of sport and were zealous to keep the wild Bhils under control That was the thin edge of the wedge John Chinn the First gave them written promises that if they were good from a certain date the Government would overlook previous offences and since John Chinn was never known to break his word he promised once to hang a Bhil locally esteemed invulnerable and hanged him in front of his tribe for seven proved murders the Bhils settled down as steadily as they knew how It was slow unseen work of the sort that is being done all over India to day and though John Chinn s only reward came as I have said in the shape of a grave at Government expense the little people of the hills never forgot him Colonel Lionel Chinn knew and loved them too and they were very fairly civilised for Bhils before his service ended Many of them could hardly be distinguished from low caste Hindoo farmers but in the south where John Chinn the First was buried the wildest still clung to the Satpura ranges cherishing a legend that some day Jan Chinn as they called him would return to his own In the mean time they mistrusted the white man and his ways The least excitement would stampede them plundering at random and now and then killing but if they were handled discreetly they grieved like children and promised never to do it again The Bhils of the regiment the uniformed men were virtuous in many ways but they needed humouring They felt bored and homesick unless taken after tiger as beaters and their cold blooded daring all Wuddars shoot tigers on foot it is their caste mark made even the officers wonder They would follow up a wounded tiger as unconcernedly as though it were a sparrow with a broken wing and this through a country full of caves and rifts and pits where a wild beast could hold a dozen men at his mercy Now and then some little man was brought to barracks with his head smashed in or his ribs torn away but his companions never learned caution they contented themselves with settling the tiger Young John Chinn was decanted at the verandah of the Wuddars lonely mess house from the back seat of a two wheeled cart his gun cases cascading all round him The slender little hookey nosed boy looked forlorn as a strayed goat when he slapped the white dust off his knees and the cart jolted down the glaring road But in his heart he was contented After all this was the place where he had been born and things were not much changed since he had been sent to England a child fifteen years ago There were a few new buildings but the air and the smell and the sunshine were the same and the little green men who crossed the parade ground looked very familiar Three weeks ago John Chinn would have said he did not remember a word of the Bhil tongue but at the mess door he found his lips moving in sentences that he did not understand bits of old nursery rhymes and tail ends of such orders as his father used to give the men The Colonel watched him come up the steps and laughed Look he said to the Major No need to ask the young un s breed He s a pukka Chinn Might be his father in the Fifties over again Hope he ll shoot as straight said the Major He s brought enough ironmongery with him Wouldn t be a Chinn if he didn t Watch him blowin his nose Regular Chinn beak Flourishes his handkerchief like his father It s the second edition line for line Fairy tale by Jove said the Major peering through the slats of the jalousies If he s the lawful heir he ll Now old Chinn could no more pass that chick without fiddling with it than His son said the Colonel jumping up Well I be blowed said the Major The boy s eye had been caught by a split reed screen that hung on a slew between the veranda pillars and mechanically he had tweaked the edge to set it level Old Chinn had sworn three times a day at that screen for many years he could never get it to his satisfaction His son entered the anteroom in the middle of a fivefold silence They made him welcome for his father s sake and as they took stock of him for his own He was ridiculously like the portrait of the Colonel on the wall and when he had washed a little of the dust from his throat he went to his quarters with the old man s short noiseless jungle step So much for heredity said the Major That comes of four generations among the Bhils And the men know it said a Wing officer They ve been waiting for this youth with their tongues hanging out I am persuaded that unless he absolutely beats em over the head they ll lie down by companies and worship him Nothin like havin a father before you said the Major I m a parvenu with my chaps I ve only been twenty years in the regiment and my revered parent he was a simple squire There s no getting at the bottom of a Bhil s mind Now why is the superior bearer that young Chinn brought with him fleeing across country with his bundle He stepped into the verandah and shouted after the man a typical new joined subaltern s servant who speaks English and cheats in proportion What is it he called Plenty bad man here I going sar was the reply Have taken Sahib s keys and say will shoot Doocid lucid doocid convincin How those up country thieves can leg it He has been badly frightened by some one The Major strolled to his quarters to dress for mess Young Chinn walking like a man in a dream had fetched a compass round the entire cantonment before going to his own tiny cottage The captain s quarters in which he had been born delayed him for a little then he looked at the well on the parade ground where he had sat of evenings with his nurse and at the ten by fourteen church where the officers went to service if a chaplain of any official creed happened to come along It seemed very small as compared with the gigantic buildings he used to stare up at but it was the same place From time to time he passed a knot of silent soldiers who saluted They might have been the very men who had carried him on their backs when he was in his first knickerbockers A faint light burned in his room and as he entered hands clasped his feet and a voice murmured from the floor Who is it said young Chinn not knowing he spoke in the Bhil tongue I bore you in my arms Sahib when I was a strong man and you were a small one crying crying crying I am your servant as I was your father s before you We are all your servants Young Chinn could not trust himself to reply and the voice went on I have taken your keys from that fat foreigner and sent him away and the studs are in the shirt for mess Who should know if I do not know And so the baby has become a man and forgets his nurse but my nephew shall make a good servant or I will beat him twice a day Then there rose up with a rattle as straight as a Bhil arrow a little white haired wizened ape of a man with medals and orders on his tunic stammering saluting and trembling Behind him a young and wiry Bhil in uniform was taking the trees out of Chinn s mess boots Chinn s eyes were full of tears The old man held out his keys Foreigners are bad people He will never come back again We are all servants of your father s son Has the Sahib forgotten who took him to see the trapped tiger in the village across the river when his mother was so frightened and he was so brave The scene came back to Chinn in great magic lantern flashes Bukta he cried and all in a breath You promised nothing should hurt me Is it Bukta The man was at his feet a second time He has not forgotten He remembers his own people as his father remembered Now can I die But first I will live and show the Sahib how to kill tigers That that yonder is my nephew If he is not a good servant beat him and send him to me and I will surely kill him for now the Sahib is with his own people Ai Jan haba Jan haba My Jan haba I will stay here and see that this does his work well Take off his boots fool Sit down upon the bed Sahib and let me look It is Jan haba He pushed forward the hilt of his sword as a sign of service which is an honour paid only to viceroys governors generals or to little children whom one loves dearly Chinn touched the hilt mechanically with three fingers muttering he knew not what It happened to be the old answer of his childhood when Bukta in jest called him the little General Sahib The Major s quarters were opposite Chinn s and when he heard his servant gasp with surprise he looked across the room Then the Major sat on the bed and whistled for the spectacle of the senior native commissioned officer of the regiment an unmixed Bhil a Companion of the Order of British India with thirty five years spotless service in the army and a rank among his own people superior to that of many Bengal princelings valeting the last joined subaltern was a little too much for his nerves The throaty bugles blew the Mess call that has a long legend behind it First a few piercing notes like the shrieks of beaters in a far away cover and next large full and smooth the refrain of the wild song And oh and oh the green pulse of Mundore Mundore All little children were in bed when the Sahib heard that call last said Bukta passing Chinn a clean handkerchief The call brought back memories of his cot under the mosquito netting his mother s kiss and the sound of footsteps growing fainter as he dropped asleep among his men So he hooked the dark collar of his new mess jacket and went to dinner like a prince who has newly inherited his father s crown Old Bukta swaggered forth curling his whiskers He knew his own value and no money and no rank within the gift of the Government would have induced him to put studs in young officers shirts or to hand them clean ties Yet when he took off his uniform that night and squatted among his fellows for a quiet smoke he told them what he had done and they said that he was entirely right Thereat Bukta propounded a theory which to a white mind would have seemed raving insanity but the whispering level headed little men of war considered it from every point of view and thought that there might be a great deal in it At mess under the oil lamps the talk turned as usual to the unfailing subject of shikar big game shooting of every kind and under all sorts of conditions Young Chinn opened his eyes when he understood that each one of his companions had shot several tigers in the Wuddar style on foot that is making no more of the business than if the brute had been a dog In nine cases out of ten said the Major a tiger is almost as dangerous as a porcupine But the tenth time you come home feet first That set all talking and long before midnight Chinn s brain was in a whirl with stories of tigers man eaters and cattle killers each pursuing his own business as methodically as clerks in an office new tigers that had lately come into such and such a district and old friendly beasts of great cunning known by nicknames in the mess such as Puggy who was lazy with huge paws and missus Malaprop who turned up when you never expected her and made female noises Then they spoke of Bhil superstitions a wide and picturesque field till young Chinn hinted that they must be pulling his leg Deed we aren t said a man on his left We know all about you You re a Chinn and all that and you ve a sort of vested right here but if you don t believe what we re telling you what will you do when old Bukta begins his stories He knows about ghost tigers and tigers that go to a hell of their own and tigers that walk on their hind feet and your grandpapa s riding tiger as well Odd he hasn t spoken of that yet You know you ve an ancestor buried down Satpura way don t you said the Major as Chinn smiled irresolutely Of course I do said Chinn who had the chronicle of the Book of Chinn by heart It lies in a worn old ledger on the Chinese lacquer table behind the piano in the Devonshire home and the children are allowed to look at it on Sundays Well I wasn t sure Your revered ancestor my boy according to the Bhils has a tiger of his own a saddle tiger that he rides round the country whenever he feels inclined I don t call it decent in an ex Collector s ghost but that is what the Southern Bhils believe Even our men who might be called moderately cool don t care to beat that country if they hear that Jan Chinn is running about on his tiger It is supposed to be a clouded animal not stripy but blotchy like a tortoise shell tom cat No end of a brute it is and a sure sign of war or pestilence or or something There s a nice family legend for you What s the origin of it d you suppose said Chinn Ask the Satpura Bhils Old Jan Chinn was a mighty hunter before the Lord Perhaps it was the tiger s revenge or perhaps he s huntin em still You must go to his tomb one of these days and inquire Bukta will probably attend to that He was asking me before you came whether by any ill luck you had already bagged your tiger If not he is going to enter you under his own wing Of course for you of all men it s imperative You ll have a first class time with Bukta The Major was not wrong Bukta kept an anxious eye on young Chinn at drill and it was noticeable that the first time the new officer lifted up his voice in an order the whole line quivered Even the Colonel was taken aback for it might have been Lionel Chinn returned from Devonshire with a new lease of life Bukta had continued to develop his peculiar theory among his intimates and it was accepted as a matter of faith in the lines since every word and gesture on young Chinn s part so confirmed it The old man arranged early that his darling should wipe out the reproach of not having shot a tiger but he was not content to take the first or any beast that happened to arrive In his own villages he dispensed the high low and middle justice and when his people naked and fluttered came to him with word of a beast marked down he bade them send spies to the kills and the watering places that he might be sure the quarry was such an one as suited the dignity of such a man Three or four times the reckless trackers returned most truthfully saying that the beast was mangy undersized a tigress worn with nursing or a broken toothed old male and Bukta would curb young Chinn s impatience At last a noble animal was marked down a ten foot cattle killer with a huge roll of loose skin along the belly glossy hided full frilled about the neck whiskered frisky and young He had slain a man in pure sport they said Let him be fed quoth Bukta and the villagers dutifully drove out a cow to amuse him that he might lie up near by Princes and potentates have taken ship to India and spent great moneys for the mere glimpse of beasts one half as fine as this of Bukta s It is not good said he to the Colonel when he asked for shooting leave that my Colonel s son who may be that my Colonel s son should lose his maidenhead on any small jungle beast That may come after I have waited long for this which is a tiger He has come in from the Mair country In seven days we will return with the skin The mess gnashed their teeth enviously Bukta had he chosen might have invited them all But he went out alone with Chinn two days in a shooting cart and a day on foot till they came to a rocky glary valley with a pool of good water in it It was a parching day and the boy very naturally stripped and went in for a bathe leaving Bukta by the clothes A white skin shows far against brown jungle and what Bukta beheld on Chinn s back and right shoulder dragged him forward step by step with staring eyeballs I d forgotten it isn t decent to strip before a man of his position said Chinn flouncing in the water How the little devil stares What is it Bukta The Mark was the whispered answer It is nothing You know how it is with my people Chinn was annoyed The dull red birth mark on his shoulder something like a conventionalised Tartar cloud had slipped his memory or he would not have bathed It occurred so they said at home in alternate generations appearing curiously enough eight or nine years after birth and save that it was part of the Chinn inheritance would not be considered pretty He hurried ashore dressed again and went on till they met two or three Bhils who promptly fell on their faces My people grunted Bukta not condescending to notice them And so your people Sahib When I was a young man we were fewer but not so weak Now we are many but poor stock As may be remembered How will you shoot him Sahib From a tree from a shelter which my people shall build by day or by night On foot and in the daytime said young Chinn That was your custom as I have heard said Bukta to himself I will get news of him Then you and I will go to him I will carry one gun You have yours There is no need of more What tiger shall stand against thee He was marked down by a little water hole at the head of a ravine full gorged and half asleep in the May sunlight He was walked up like a partridge and he turned to do battle for his life Bukta made no motion to raise his rifle but kept his eyes on Chinn who met the shattering roar of the charge with a single shot it seemed to him hours as he sighted which tore through the throat smashing the backbone below the neck and between the shoulders The brute couched choked and fell and before Chinn knew well what had happened Bukta bade him stay still while he paced the distance between his feet and the ringing jaws Fifteen said Bukta Short paces No need for a second shot Sahib He bleeds cleanly where he lies and we need not spoil the skin I said there would be no need of these but they came in case Suddenly the sides of the ravine were crowned with the heads of Bukta s people a force that could have blown the ribs out of the beast had Chinn s shot failed but their guns were hidden and they appeared as interested beaters some five or six waiting the word to skin Bukta watched the life fade from the wild eyes lifted one hand and turned on his heel No need to show that we care said he Now after this we can kill what we choose Put out your hand Sahib Chinn obeyed It was entirely steady and Bukta nodded That also was your custom My men skin quickly They will carry the skin to cantonments Will the Sahib come to my poor village for the night and perhaps forget that I am his officer But those men the beaters They have worked hard and perhaps Oh if they skin clumsily we will skin them They are my people In the lines I am one thing Here I am another This was very true When Bukta doffed uniform and reverted to the fragmentary dress of his own people he left his civilisation of drill in the next world That night after a little talk with his subjects he devoted to an orgie and a Bhil orgie is a thing not to be safely written about Chinn flushed with triumph was in the thick of it but the meaning of the mysteries was hidden Wild folk came and pressed about his knees with offerings He gave his flask to the elders of the village They grew eloquent and wreathed him about with flowers Gifts and loans not all seemly were thrust upon him and infernal music rolled and maddened round red fires while singers sang songs of the ancient times and danced peculiar dances The aboriginal liquors are very potent and Chinn was compelled to taste them often but unless the stuff had been drugged how came he to fall asleep suddenly and to waken late the next day half a march from the village The Sahib was very tired A little before dawn he went to sleep Bukta explained My people carried him here and now it is time we should go back to cantonments The voice smooth and deferential the step steady and silent made it hard to believe that only a few hours before Bukta was yelling and capering with naked fellow devils of the scrub My people were very pleased to see the Sahib They will never forget When next the Sahib goes out recruiting he will go to my people and they will give him as many men as we need Chinn kept his own counsel except as to the shooting of the tiger and Bukta embroidered that tale with a shameless tongue The skin was certainly one of the finest ever hung up in the mess and the first of many When Bukta could not accompany his boy on shooting trips he took care to put him in good hands and Chinn learned more of the mind and desire of the wild Bhil in his marches and campings by talks at twilight or at wayside pools than an uninstructed man could have come at in a lifetime Presently his men in the regiment grew bold to speak of their relatives mostly in trouble and to lay cases of tribal custom before him They would say squatting in his verandah at twilight after the easy confidential style of the Wuddars that such and such a bachelor had run away with such and such a wife at a far off village Now how many cows would Chinn Sahib consider a just fine Or again if written order came from the Government that a Bhil was to repair to a walled city of the plains to give evidence in a law court would it be wise to disregard that order On the other hand if it were obeyed would the rash voyager return alive But what have I to do with these things Chinn demanded of Bukta impatiently I am a soldier I do not know the law Hoo Law is for fools and white men Give them a large and loud order and they will abide by it Thou art their law But wherefore Every trace of expression left Bukta s countenance The idea might have smitten him for the first time How can I say he replied Perhaps it is on account of the name A Bhil does not love strange things Give them orders Sahib two three four words at a time such as they can carry away in their heads That is enough Chinn gave orders then valiantly not realising that a word spoken in haste before mess became the dread unappealable law of villages beyond the smoky hills was in truth no less than the Law of Jan Chinn the First who so the whispered legend ran had come back to earth to oversee the third generation in the body and bones of his grandson There could be no sort of doubt in this matter All the Bhils knew that Jan Chinn reincarnated had honoured Bukta s village with his presence after slaying his first in this life tiger that he had eaten and drunk with the people as he was used and Bukta must have drugged Chinn s liquor very deeply upon his back and right shoulder all men had seen the same angry red Flying Cloud that the high Gods had set on the flesh of Jan Chinn the First when first he came to the Bhil As concerned the foolish white world which has no eyes he was a slim and young officer in the Wuddars but his own people knew he was Jan Chinn who had made the Bhil a man and believing they hastened to carry his words careful never to alter them on the way Because the savage and the child who plays lonely games have one horror of being laughed at or questioned the little folk kept their convictions to themselves and the Colonel who thought he knew his regiment never guessed that each one of the six hundred quick footed beady eyed rank and file to attention beside their rifles believed serenely and unshakenly that the subaltern on the left flank of the line was a demi god twice born tutelary deity of their land and people The Earth gods themselves had stamped the incarnation and who would dare to doubt the handiwork of the Earth gods Chinn being practical above all things saw that his family name served him well in the lines and in camp His men gave no trouble one does not commit regimental offences with a god in the chair of justice and he was sure of the best beaters in the district when he needed them They believed that the protection of Jan Chinn the First cloaked them and were bold in that belief beyond the utmost daring of excited Bhils His quarters began to look like an amateur natural history museum in spite of duplicate heads and horns and skulls that he sent home to Devonshire The people very humanly learned the weak side of their god It is true he was unbribable but bird skins butterflies beetles and above all news of big game pleased him In other respects too he lived up to the Chinn tradition He was fever proof A night s sitting out over a tethered goat in a damp valley that would have filled the Major with a month s malaria had no effect on him He was as they said salted before he was born Now in the autumn of his second year s service an uneasy rumour crept out of the earth and ran about among the Bhils Chinn heard nothing of it till a brother officer said across the mess table Your revered ancestor s on the rampage in the Satpura country You d better look him up I don t want to be disrespectful but I m a little sick of my revered ancestor Bukta talks of nothing else What s the old boy supposed to be doing now Riding cross country by moonlight on his processional tiger That s the story He s been seen by about two thousand Bhils skipping along the tops of the Satpuras and scaring people to death They believe it devoutly and all the Satpura chaps are worshipping away at his shrine tomb I mean like good uns You really ought to go down there Must be a queer thing to see your grandfather treated as a god What makes you think there s any truth in the tale said Chinn Because all our men deny it They say they ve never heard of Chinn s tiger Now that s a manifest lie because every Bhil has There s only one thing you ve overlooked said the Colonel thoughtfully When a local god reappears on earth it s always an excuse for trouble of some kind and those Satpura Bhils are about as wild as your grandfather left them young un It means something Meanin they may go on the war path said Chinn Can t say as yet Shouldn t be surprised a little bit I haven t been told a syllable Proves it all the more They are keeping something back Bukta tells me everything too as a rule Now why didn t he tell me that Chinn put the question directly to the old man that night and the answer surprised him Why should I tell what is well known Yes the Clouded Tiger is out in the Satpura country What do the wild Bhils think that it means They do not know They wait Sahib what is coming Say only one little word and we will be content We What have tales from the south where the jungly Bhils live to do with drilled men When Jan Chinn wakes is no time for any Bhil to be quiet But he has not waked Bukta Sahib the old man s eyes were full of tender reproof if he does not wish to be seen why does he go abroad in the moonlight We know he is awake but we do not know what he desires Is it a sign for all the Bhils or one that concerns the Satpura folk alone Say one little word Sahib that I may carry it to the lines and send on to our villages Why does Jan Chinn ride out Who has done wrong Is it pestilence Is it murrain Will our children die Is it a sword Remember Sahib we are thy people and thy servants and in this life I bore thee in my arms not knowing Bukta has evidently looked on the cup this evening Chinn thought but if I can do anything to soothe the old chap I must It s like the Mutiny rumours on a small scale He dropped into a deep wicker chair over which was thrown his first tiger skin and his weight on the cushion flapped the clawed paws over his shoulders He laid hold of them mechanically as he spoke drawing the painted hide cloak fashion about him Now will I tell the truth Bukta he said leaning forward the dried muzzle on his shoulder to invent a specious lie I see that it is the truth was the answer in a shaking voice Jan Chinn goes abroad among the Satpuras riding on the Clouded Tiger ye say Be it so Therefore the sign of the wonder is for the Satpura Bhils only and does not touch the Bhils who plough in the north and east the Bhils of the Khandesh or any others except the Satpura Bhils who as we know are wild and foolish It is then a sign for them Good or bad Beyond doubt good For why should Jan Chinn make evil to those whom he has made men The nights over yonder are hot it is ill to lie in one bed over long without turning and Jan Chinn would look again upon his people So he rises whistles his Clouded Tiger and goes abroad a little to breathe the cool air If the Satpura Bhils kept to their villages and did not wander after dark they would not see him Indeed Bukta it is no more than that he would see the light again in his own country Send this news south and say that it is my word Bukta bowed to the floor Good Heavens thought Chinn and this blinking pagan is a first class officer and as straight as a die I may as well round it off neatly He went on If the Satpura Bhils ask the meaning of the sign tell them that Jan Chinn would see how they kept their old promises of good living Perhaps they have plundered perhaps they mean to disobey the orders of the Government perhaps there is a dead man in the jungle and so Jan Chinn has come to see Is he then angry Bah Am I ever angry with my Bhils I say angry words and threaten many things Thou knowest Bukta I have seen thee smile behind the hand I know and thou knowest The Bhils are my children I have said it many times Ay We be thy children said Bukta And no otherwise is it with Jan Chinn my father s father He would see the land he loved and the people once again It is a good ghost Bukta I say it Go and tell them And I do hope devoutly he added that it will calm em down Flinging back the tiger skin he rose with a long unguarded yawn that showed his well kept teeth Bukta fled to be received in the lines by a knot of panting inquirers It is true said Bukta He wrapped him self in the skin and spoke from it He would see his own country again The sign is not for us and indeed he is a young man How should he lie idle of nights He says his bed is too hot and the air is bad He goes to and fro for the love of night running He has said it The grey whiskered assembly shuddered He says the Bhils are his children Ye know he does not lie He has said it to me But what of the Satpura Bhils What means the sign for them Nothing It is only night running as I have said He rides to see if they obey the Government as he taught them to do in his first life And what if they do not He did not say The light went out in Chinn s quarters Look said Bukta Now he goes away None the less it is a good ghost as he has said How shall we fear Jan Chinn who made the Bhil a man His protection is on us and ye know Jan Chinn never broke a protection spoken or written on paper When he is older and has found him a wife he will lie in his bed till morning A commanding officer is generally aware of the regimental state of mind a little before the men and this is why the Colonel said a few days later that some one had been putting the Fear of God into the Wuddars As he was the only person officially entitled to do this it distressed him to see such unanimous virtue It s too good to last he said I only wish I could find out what the little chaps mean The explanation as it seemed to him came at the change of the moon when he received orders to hold himself in readiness to allay any possible excitement among the Satpura Bhils who were to put it mildly uneasy because a paternal Government had sent up against them a Mahratta State educated vaccinator with lancets lymph and an officially registered calf In the language of State they had manifested a strong objection to all prophylactic measures had forcibly detained the vaccinator and were on the point of neglecting or evading their tribal obligations That means they are in a blue funk same as they were at census time said the Colonel and if we stampede them into the hills we ll never catch em in the first place and in the second they ll whoop off plundering till further orders Wonder who the God forsaken idiot is who is trying to vaccinate a Bhil I knew trouble was coming One good thing is that they ll only use local corps and we can knock up something we ll call a campaign and let them down easy Fancy us potting our best beaters because they don t want to be vaccinated They re only crazy with fear Don t you think sir said Chinn the next day that perhaps you could give me a fortnight s shooting leave Desertion in the face of the enemy by Jove The Colonel laughed I might but I d have to antedate it a little because we re warned for service as you might say However we ll assume that you applied for leave three days ago and are now well on your way south I d like to take Bukta with me Of course yes I think that will be the best plan You ve some kind of hereditary influence with the little chaps and they may listen to you when a glimpse of our uniforms would drive them wild You ve never been in that part of the world before have you Take care they don t send you to your family vault in your youth and innocence I believe you ll be all right if you can get em to listen to you I think so sir but if if they should accidentally put an make asses of emselves they might you know I hope you ll represent that they were only frightened There isn t an ounce of real vice in em and I should never forgive myself if any one of of my name got them into trouble The Colonel nodded but said nothing Chinn and Bukta departed at once Bukta did not say that ever since the official vaccinator had been dragged into the hills by indignant Bhils runner after runner had skulked up to the lines entreating with forehead in the dust that Jan Chinn should come and explain this unknown horror that hung over his people The portent of the Clouded Tiger was now too clear Let Jan Chinn comfort his own for vain was the help of mortal man Bukta toned down these beseechings to a simple request for Chinn s presence Nothing would have pleased the old man better than a rough and tumble campaign against the Satpuras whom he as an unmixed Bhil despised but he had a duty to all his nation as Jan Chinn s interpreter and he devoutly believed that forty plagues would fall on his village if he tampered with that obligation Besides Jan Chinn knew all things and he rode the Clouded Tiger They covered thirty miles a day on foot and pony raising the blue wall like line of the Satpuras as swiftly as might be Bukta was very silent They began the steep climb a little after noon but it was near sunset ere they reached the stone platform clinging to the side of a rifted jungle covered hill where Jan Chinn the First was laid as he had desired that he might overlook his people All India is full of neglected graves that date from the beginning of the eighteenth century tombs of forgotten colonels of corps long since disbanded mates of East India men who went on shooting expeditions and never came back factors agents writers and ensigns of the Honourable the East India Company by hundreds and thousands and tens of thousands English folk forget quickly but natives have long memories and if a man has done good in his life it is remembered after his death The weathered marble four square tomb of Jan Chinn was hung about with wild flowers and nuts packets of wax and honey bottles of native spirits and infamous cigars with buffalo horns and plumes of dried grass At one end was a rude clay image of a white man in the old fashioned top hat riding on a bloated tiger Bukta salamed reverently as they approached Chinn bared his head and began to pick out the blurred inscription So far as he could read it ran thus word for word and letter for letter To the Memory of JOHN CHINN esquire Late Collector of ithout Bloodshed or error of Authority Employ only cans of Conciliat and Confiden accomplished the tire Subjection a Lawless and Predatory Peop taching them to ish Government by a Conquest over Minds The most perma and rational Mode of Domini Governor General and Counc engal have ordered thi

Haunts and b is Command mended rais check a saint for spoil And s ing Hamlets prove his gene toil Humanit survey ights restor A Nation ield subdued without a Sword For some little time he leaned on the tomb thinking of this dead man of his own blood and of the house in Devonshire then nodding to the plains Yes it s a big work all of it even my little share He must have been worth knowing Bukta where are my people Not here Sahib No man comes here except in full sun They wait above Let us climb and see But Chinn remembering the first law of Oriental diplomacy in an even voice answered I have come this far only because the Satpura folk are foolish and dared not visit our lines Now bid them wait on me here I am not a servant but the master of Bhils I go I go clucked the old man Night was falling and at any moment Jan Chinn might whistle up his dreaded steed from the darkening scrub Now for the first time in a long life Bukta disobeyed a lawful command and deserted his leader for he did not come back but pressed to the flat table top of the hill and called softly Men stirred all about him little trembling men with bows and arrows who had watched the two since noon Where is he whispered one At his own place He bids you come said Bukta Now Now Rather let him loose the Clouded Tiger upon us We do not go Nor I though I bore him in my arms when he was a child in this his life Wait here till the day But surely he will be angry He will be very angry for he has nothing to eat But he has said to me many times that the Bhils are his children By sunlight I believe this but by moonlight I am not so sure What folly have ye Satpura pigs compassed that ye should need him at all One came to us in the name of the Government with little ghost knives and a magic calf meaning to turn us into cattle by the cutting off of our arms We were greatly afraid but we did not kill the man He is here bound a black man and we think he comes from the west He said it was an order to cut us all with knives especially the women and the children We did not hear that it was an order so we were afraid and kept to our hills Some of our men have taken ponies and bullocks from the plains and others pots and cloths and ear rings Are any slain By our men Not yet But the young men are blown to and fro by many rumours like flames upon a hill I sent runners asking for Jan Chinn lest worse should come to us It was this fear that he foretold by the sign of the Clouded Tiger He says it is otherwise said Bukta and he repeated with amplifications all that young Chinn had told him at the conference of the wicker chair Think you said the questioner at last that the Government will lay hands on us Not I Bukta rejoined Jan Chinn will give an order and ye will obey The rest is between the Government and Jan Chinn I myself know something of the ghost knives and the scratching It is a charm against the Smallpox But how it is done I cannot tell Nor need that concern you If he stands by us and before the anger of the Government we will most strictly obey Jan Chinn except except we do not go down to that place to night They could hear young Chinn below them shouting for Bukta but they cowered and sat still expecting the Clouded Tiger The tomb had been holy ground for nearly half a century If Jan Chinn chose to sleep there who had better right But they would not come within eyeshot of the place till broad day At first Chinn was exceedingly angry till it occurred to him that Bukta most probably had a reason which indeed he had and his own dignity might suffer if he yelled without answer He propped himself against the foot of the grave and alternately dozing and smoking came through the warm night proud that he was a lawful legitimate fever proof Chinn He prepared his plan of action much as his grandfather would have done and when Bukta appeared in the morning with a most liberal supply of food said nothing of the overnight desertion Bukta would have been relieved by an outburst of human anger but Chinn finished his victual leisurely and a cheroot ere he made any sign They are very much afraid said Bukta who was not too bold himself It remains only to give orders They said they will obey if thou wilt only stand between them and the Government That I know said Chinn strolling slowly to the table land A few of the elder men stood in an irregular semicircle in an open glade but the ruck of people women and children were hidden in the thicket They had no desire to face the first anger of Jan Chinn the First Seating himself on a fragment of split rock he smoked his cheroot to the butt hearing men breathe hard all about him Then he cried so suddenly that they jumped Bring the man that was bound A scuffle and a cry were followed by the appearance of a Hindoo vaccinator quaking with fear bound hand and foot as the Bhils of old were accustomed to bind their human sacrifices He was pushed cautiously before the presence but young Chinn did not look at him I said the man that was bound Is it a jest to bring me one tied like a buffalo Since when could the Bhil bind folk at his pleasure Cut Half a dozen hasty knives cut away the thongs and the man crawled to Chinn who pocketed his case of lancets and tubes of lymph Then sweeping the semicircle with one comprehensive forefinger and in the voice of compliment he said clearly and distinctly Pigs Ai whispered Bukta Now he speaks Woe to foolish people I have come on foot from my house the assembly shuddered to make clear a matter which any other Satpura Bhil would have seen with both eyes from a distance Ye know the Smallpox who pits and scars your children so that they look like wasp combs It is an order of the Government that whoso is scratched on the arm with these little knives which I hold up is charmed against her All Sahibs are thus charmed and very many Hindoos This is the mark of the charm Look He rolled back his sleeve to the armpit and showed the white scars of the vaccination mark on his white skin Come all and look A few daring spirits came up and nodded their heads wisely There was certainly a mark and they knew well what other dread marks were hidden by the shirt Merciful was Jan Chinn that then and there proclaimed his godhead Now all these things the man whom ye bound told you I did a hundred times but they answered with blows groaned the operator chafing his wrists and ankles But being pigs ye did not believe and so came I here to save you first from Smallpox next from a great folly of fear and lastly it may be from the rope and the jail It is no gain to me it is no pleasure to me but for the sake of that one who is yonder who made the Bhil a man he pointed down the hill I who am of his blood the son of his son come to turn your people And I speak the truth as did Jan Chinn The crowd murmured reverently and men stole out of the thicket by twos and threes to join it There was no anger in their god s face These are my orders Heaven send they ll take em but I seem to have impressed em so far I myself will stay among you while this man scratches your arms with the knives after the order of the Government In three or it may be five or seven days your arms will swell and itch and burn That is the power of Smallpox fighting in your base blood against the orders of the Government I will therefore stay among you till I see that Smallpox is conquered and I will not go away till the men and the women and the little children show me upon their arms such marks as I have even now showed you I bring with me two very good guns and a man whose name is known among beasts and men We will hunt together I and he and your young men and the others shall eat and lie still This is my order There was a long pause while victory hung in the balance A white haired old sinner standing on one uneasy leg piped up There are ponies and some few bullocks and other things for which we need a kowl protection They were not taken in the way of trade The battle was won and John Chinn drew a breath of relief The young Bhils had been raiding but if taken swiftly all could be put straight I will write a kowl so soon as the ponies the bullocks and the other things are counted before me and sent back whence they came But first we will put the Government mark on such as have not been visited by Smallpox In an undertone to the vaccinator If you show you are afraid you ll never see Poona again my friend There is not sufficient ample supply of vaccination for all this population said the man They destroyed the offeecial calf They won t know the difference Scrape em and give me a couple of lancets I ll attend to the elders The aged diplomat who had demanded protection was the first victim He fell to Chinn s hand and dared not cry out As soon as he was freed he dragged up a companion and held him fast and the crisis became as it were a child s sport for the vaccinated chased the unvaccinated to treatment vowing that all the tribe must suffer equally The women shrieked and the children ran howling but Chinn laughed and waved the pink tipped lancet It is an honour he cried Tell them Bukta how great an honour it is that I myself mark them Nay I cannot mark every one the Hindoo must also do his work but I will touch all marks that he makes so there will be an equal virtue in them Thus do the Rajputs stick pigs Ho brother with one eye Catch that girl and bring her to me She need not run away yet for she is not married and I do not seek her in marriage She will not come Then she shall be shamed by her little brother a fat boy a bold boy He puts out his arm like a soldier Look He does not flinch at the blood Some day he shall be in my regiment And now mother of many we will lightly touch thee for Smallpox has been before us here It is a true thing indeed that this charm breaks the power of Mata There will be no more pitted faces among the Satpuras and so ye can ask many cows for each maid to be wed And so on and so on quick poured showman s patter sauced in the Bhil hunting proverbs and tales of their own brand of coarse humour till the lancets were blunted and both operators worn out But nature being the same the world over the unvaccinated grew jealous of their marked comrades and came near to blows about it Then Chinn declared himself a court of justice no longer a medical board and made formal inquiry into the late robberies We are the thieves of Mahadeo said the Bhils simply It is our fate and we were frightened When we are frightened we always steal Simply and directly as children they gave in the tale of the plunder all but two bullocks and some spirits that had gone amissing these Chinn promised to make good out of his own pocket and ten ringleaders were despatched to the lowlands with a wonderful document written on the leaf of a note book and addressed to an Assistant District Superintendent of Police There was warm calamity in that note as Jan Chinn warned them but anything was better than loss of liberty Armed with this protection the repentant raiders went down hill They had no desire whatever to meet mister Dundas Fawne of the Police aged twenty two and of a cheerful countenance nor did they wish to revisit the scene of their robberies Steering a middle course they ran into the camp of the one Government chaplain allowed to the various irregular corps through a district of some fifteen thousand square miles and stood before him in a cloud of dust He was by way of being a priest they knew and what was more to the point a good sportsman who paid his beaters generously When he read Chinn s note he laughed which they deemed a lucky omen till he called up policemen who tethered the ponies and the bullocks by the piled house gear and laid stern hands upon three of that smiling band of the thieves of Mahadeo The chaplain himself addressed them magisterially with a riding whip That was painful but Jan Chinn had prophesied it They submitted but would not give up the written protection fearing the jail On their way back they met mister D Fawne who had heard about the robberies and was not pleased Certainly said the eldest of the gang when the second interview was at an end certainly Jan Chinn s protection has saved us our liberty but it is as though there were many beatings in one small piece of paper Put it away One climbed into a tree and stuck the letter into a cleft forty feet from the ground where it could do no harm Warmed sore but happy the ten returned to Jan Chinn next day where he sat among uneasy Bhils all looking at their right arms and all bound under terror of their god s disfavour not to scratch It was a good kowl said the leader First the chaplain who laughed took away our plunder and beat three of us as was promised Next we meet Fawne Sahib who frowned and asked for the plunder We spoke the truth and so he beat us all one after another and called us chosen names He then gave us these two bundles they set down a bottle of whisky and a box of cheroots and we came away The kowl is left in a tree because its virtue is that so soon as we show it to a Sahib we are beaten But for that kowl said Jan Chinn sternly ye would all have been marching to jail with a policeman on either side Ye come now to serve as beaters for me These people are unhappy and we will go hunting till they are well To night we will make a feast It is written in the chronicles of the Satpura Bhils together with many other matters not fit for print that through five days after the day that he had put his mark upon them Jan Chinn the First hunted for his people and on the five nights of those days the tribe was gloriously and entirely drunk Jan Chinn bought country spirits of an awful strength and slew wild pig and deer beyond counting so that if any fell sick they might have two good reasons Between head and stomach aches they found no time to think of their arms but followed Jan Chinn obediently through the jungles and with each day s returning confidence men women and children stole away to their villages as the little army passed by They carried news that it was good and right to be scratched with ghost knives that Jan Chinn was indeed reincarnated as a god of free food and drink and that of all nations the Satpura Bhils stood first in his favour if they would only refrain from scratching Henceforward that kindly demi god would be connected in their minds with great gorgings and the vaccine and lancets of a paternal Government And to morrow I go back to my home said Jan Chinn to his faithful few whom neither spirits overeating nor swollen glands could conquer It is hard for children and savages to behave reverently at all times to the idols of their make belief and they had frolicked excessively with Jan Chinn But the reference to his home cast a gloom on the people And the Sahib will not come again said he who had been vaccinated first That is to be seen answered Chinn warily Nay but come as a white man come as a young man whom we know and love for as thou alone knowest we are a weak people If we again saw thy thy horse They were picking up their courage I have no horse I came on foot with Bukta yonder What is this Thou knowest the thing that thou hast chosen for a night horse The little men squirmed in fear and awe Night horses Bukta what is this last tale of children Bukta had been a silent leader in Chinn s presence since the night of his desertion and was grateful for a chance flung question They know Sahib he whispered It is the Clouded Tiger That that comes from the place where thou didst once sleep It is thy horse as it has been these three generations My horse That was a dream of the Bhils It is no dream Do dreams leave the tracks of broad pugs on earth Why make two faces before thy people They know of the night ridings and they and they Are afraid and would have them cease Bukta nodded If thou hast no further need of him He is thy horse The thing leaves a trail then said Chinn We have seen it It is like a village road under the tomb Can ye find and follow it for me By daylight if one comes with us and above all stands near by I will stand close and we will see to it that Jan Chinn does not ride any more The Bhils shouted the last words again and again From Chinn s point of view the stalk was nothing more than an ordinary one down hill through split and crannied rocks unsafe perhaps if a man did not keep his wits by him but no worse than twenty others he had undertaken Yet his men they refused absolutely to beat and would only trail dripped sweat at every move They showed the marks of enormous pugs that ran always down hill to a few hundred feet below Jan Chinn s tomb and disappeared in a narrow mouthed cave It was an insolently open road a domestic highway beaten without thought of concealment The beggar might be paying rent and taxes Chinn muttered ere he asked whether his friend s taste ran to cattle or man Cattle was the answer Two heifers a week We drive them for him at the foot of the hill It is his custom If we did not he might seek us Blackmail and piracy said Chinn I can t say I fancy going into the cave after him What s to be done The Bhils fell back as Chinn lodged himself behind a rock with his rifle ready Tigers he knew were shy beasts but one who had been long cattle fed in this sumptuous style might prove overbold He speaks some one whispered from the rear He knows too Well of all the infernal cheek said Chinn There was an angry growl from the cave a direct challenge Come out then Chinn shouted Come out of that Let s have a look at you The brute knew well enough that there was some connection between brown nude Bhils and his weekly allowance but the white helmet in the sunlight annoyed him and he did not approve of the voice that broke his rest Lazily as a gorged snake he dragged himself out of the cave and stood yawning and blinking at the entrance The sunlight fell upon his flat right side and Chinn wondered Never had he seen a tiger marked after this fashion Except for his head which was staringly barred he was dappled not striped but dappled like a child s rocking horse in rich shades of smoky black on red gold That portion of his belly and throat which should have been white was orange and his tail and paws were black He looked leisurely for some ten seconds and then deliberately lowered his head his chin dropped and drawn in staring intently at the man The effect of this was to throw forward the round arch of his skull with two broad bands across it while below the bands glared the unwinking eyes so that head on as he stood he showed something like a diabolically scowling pantomime mask It was a piece of natural mesmerism that he had practised many times on his quarry and though Chinn was by no means a terrified heifer he stood for a while held by the extraordinary oddity of the attack The head the body seemed to have been packed away behind it the ferocious skull like head crept nearer to the switching of an angry tail tip in the grass Left and right the Bhils had scattered to let John Chinn subdue his own horse My word he thought He s trying to frighten me and fired between the saucer like eyes leaping aside upon the shot A big coughing mass reeking of carrion bounded past him up the hill and he followed discreetly The tiger made no attempt to turn into the jungle he was hunting for sight and breath nose up mouth open the tremendous fore legs scattering the gravel in spurts Scuppered said John Chinn watching the flight Now if he was a partridge he d tower Lungs must be full of blood The brute had jerked himself over a boulder and fallen out of sight the other side John Chinn looked over with a ready barrel But the red trail led straight as an arrow even to his grandfather s tomb and there among the smashed spirit bottles and the fragments of the mud image the life left with a flurry and a grunt If my worthy ancestor could see that said John Chinn he d have been proud of me Eyes lower jaw and lungs A very nice shot He whistled for Bukta as he drew the tape over the stiffening bulk Ten six eight by Jove It s nearly eleven call it eleven Fore arm twenty four five seven and a half A short tail too three feet one But what a skin Oh Bukta Bukta The men with the knives swiftly Is he beyond question dead said an awe stricken voice behind a rock That was not the way I killed my first tiger said Chinn I did not think that Bukta would run I had no second gun It it is the Clouded Tiger said Bukta un heeding the taunt He is dead Whether all the Bhils vaccinated and unvaccinated of the Satpuras had lain by to see the kill Chinn could not say but the whole hill s flank rustled with little men shouting singing and stamping And yet till he had made the first cut in the splendid skin not a man would take a knife and when the shadows fell they ran from the red stained tomb and no persuasion would bring them back till dawn So Chinn spent a second night in the open guarding the carcass from jackals and thinking about his ancestor He returned to the lowlands to the triumphal chant of an escorting army three hundred strong the Mahratta vaccinator close at his elbow and the rudely dried skin a trophy before him When that army suddenly and noiselessly disappeared as quail in high corn he argued he was near civilisation and a turn in the road brought him upon the camp of a wing of his own corps He left the skin on a cart tail for the world to see and sought the Colonel They re perfectly right he explained earnestly There isn t an ounce of vice in em They were only frightened I ve vaccinated the whole boiling and they like it awfully What are what are we doing here sir That s what I m trying to find out said the Colonel I don t know yet whether we re a piece of a brigade or a police force However I think we ll call ourselves a police force How did you manage to get a Bhil vaccinated Well sir said Chinn I ve been thinking it over and as far as I can make out I ve got a sort of hereditary influence over em So I know or I wouldn t have sent you but what exactly It s rather rummy It seems from what I can make out that I m my own grandfather reincarnated and I ve been disturbing the peace of the country by riding a pad tiger of nights If I hadn t done that I don t think they d have objected to the vaccination but the two together were more than they could stand And so sir I ve vaccinated em and shot my tiger horse as a sort o proof of good faith You never saw such a skin in your life The Colonel tugged his moustache thought fully Now how the deuce said he am I to include that in my report Indeed the official version of the Bhils anti vaccination stampede said nothing about Lieutenant John Chinn his godship But Bukta knew and the corps knew and every Bhil in the Satpura hills knew And now Bukta is zealous that John Chinn shall swiftly be wedded and impart his powers to a son for if the Chinn succession fails and the little Bhils are left to their own imaginings there will be fresh trouble in the Satpuras THE DEVIL AND THE DEEP SEA All supplies very bad and dear and there are no facilities for even the smallest repairs Sailing Directions Her nationality was British but you will not find her house flag in the list of our mercantile marine She was a nine hundred ton iron schooner rigged screw cargo boat differing externally in no way from any other tramp of the sea But it is with steamers as it is with men There are those who will for a consideration sail extremely close to the wind and in the present state of a fallen world such people and such steamers have their use From the hour that the Aglaia first entered the Clyde new shiny and innocent with a quart of cheap champagne trickling down her cut water Fate and her owner who was also her captain decreed that she should deal with embarrassed crowned heads fleeing Presidents financiers of over extended ability women to whom change of air was imperative and the lesser law breaking Powers Her career led her sometimes into the Admiralty Courts where the sworn statements of her skipper filled his brethren with envy The mariner cannot tell or act a lie in the face of the sea or mis lead a tempest but as lawyers have discovered he makes up for chances withheld when he returns to shore an affidavit in either hand The Aglaia figured with distinction in the great Mackinaw salvage case It was her first slip from virtue and she learned how to change her name but not her heart and to run across the sea As the Guiding Light she was very badly wanted in a South American port for the little matter of entering harbour at full speed colliding with a coal hulk and the State s only man of war just as that man of war was going to coal She put to sea without explanations though three forts fired at her for half an hour As the Julia M Gregor she had been concerned in picking up from a raft certain gentlemen who should have stayed in Noumea but who preferred making themselves vastly unpleasant to authority in quite another quarter of the world and as the Shah in Shah she had been overtaken on the high seas indecently full of munitions of war by the cruiser of an agitated Power at issue with its neighbour That time she was very nearly sunk and her riddled hull gave eminent lawyers of two countries great profit After a season she reappeared as the Martin Hunt painted a dull slate colour with pure saffron funnel and boats of robin s egg blue engaging in the Odessa trade till she was invited and the invitation could not well be disregarded to keep away from Black Sea ports altogether She had ridden through many waves of depression Freights might drop out of sight Seamen s Unions throw spanners and nuts at certificated masters or stevedores combine till cargo perished on the dock head but the boat of many names came and went busy alert and inconspicuous always Her skipper made no complaint of hard times and port officers observed that her crew signed and signed again with the regularity of Atlantic liner boatswains Her name she changed as occasion called her well paid crew never and a large percentage of the profits of her voyages was spent with an open hand on her engine room She never troubled the underwriters and very seldom stopped to talk with a signal station for her business was urgent and private But an end came to her tradings and she perished in this manner Deep peace brooded over Europe Asia Africa America Australasia and Polynesia The Powers dealt together more or less honestly banks paid their depositors to the hour diamonds of price came safely to the hands of their owners Republics rested content with their Dictators diplomats found no one whose presence in the least incommoded them monarchs lived openly with their lawfully wedded wives It was as though the whole earth had put on its best Sunday bib and tucker and business was very bad for the Martin Hunt The great virtuous calm engulfed her slate sides yellow funnel and all but cast up in another hemisphere the steam whaler Haliotis black and rusty with a manure coloured funnel a litter of dingy white boats and an enormous stove or furnace for boiling blubber on her forward well deck There could be no doubt that her trip was successful for she lay at several ports not too well known and the smoke of her trying out insulted the beaches Anon she departed at the speed of the average London four wheeler and entered a semi inland sea warm still and blue which is perhaps the most strictly preserved water in the world There she stayed for a certain time and the great stars of those mild skies beheld her playing puss in the corner among islands where whales are never found All that while she smelt abominably and the smell though fishy was not whalesome One evening calamity descended upon her from the island of Pygang Watai and she fled while her crew jeered at a fat black and brown gunboat puffing far behind They knew to the last revolution the capacity of every boat on those seas that they were anxious to avoid A British ship with a good conscience does not as a rule flee from the man of war of a foreign Power and it is also considered a breach of etiquette to stop and search British ships at sea These things the skipper of the Haliotis did not pause to prove but held on at an inspiriting eleven knots an hour till nightfall One thing only he overlooked The Power that kept an expensive steam patrol moving up and down those waters they had dodged the two regular ships of the station with an ease that bred contempt had newly brought up a third and a fourteen knot boat with a clean bottom to help the work and that was why the Haliotis driving hard from the east to the west found herself at daylight in such a position that she could not help seeing an arrangement of four flags a mile and a half behind which read Heave to or take the consequences She had her choice and she took it The end came when presuming on her lighter draught she tried to draw away northward over a friendly shoal The shell that arrived by way of the Chief Engineer s cabin was some five inches in diameter with a practice not a bursting charge It had been intended to cross her bows and that was why it knocked the framed portrait of the Chief Engineer s wife and she was a very pretty girl on to the floor splintered his wash hand stand crossed the alleyway into the engine room and striking on a grating dropped directly in front of the forward engine where it burst neatly fracturing both the bolts that held the connecting rod to the forward crank What follows is worth consideration The forward engine had no more work to do Its released piston rod therefore drove up fiercely with nothing to check it and started most of the nuts of the cylinder cover It came down again the full weight of the steam behind it and the foot of the disconnected connecting rod useless as the leg of a man with a sprained ankle flung out to the right and struck the starboard or right hand cast iron supporting column of the forward engine cracking it clean through about six inches above the base and wedging the upper portion outwards three inches towards the ship s side There the connecting rod jammed Meantime the after engine being as yet unembarrassed went on with its work and in so doing brought round at its next revolution the crank of the forward engine which smote the already jammed connecting rod bending it and therewith the piston rod cross head the big cross piece that slides up and down so smoothly The cross head jammed sideways in the guides and in addition to putting further pressure on the already broken starboard supporting column cracked the port or left hand supporting column in two or three places There being nothing more that could be made to move the engines brought up all standing with a hiccup that seemed to lift the Haliotis a foot out of the water and the engine room staff opening every steam outlet that they could find in the confusion arrived on deck somewhat scalded but calm There was a sound below of things happening a rushing clicking purring grunting rattling noise that did not last for more than a minute It was the machinery adjusting itself on the spur of the moment to a hundred altered conditions mister Wardrop one foot on the upper grating inclined his ear sideways and groaned You cannot stop engines working at twelve knots an hour in three seconds without disorganising them The Haliotis slid forward in a cloud of steam shrieking like a wounded horse There was nothing more to do The five inch shell with a reduced charge had settled the situation And when you are full all three holds of strictly preserved pearls when you have cleaned out the Tanna Bank the Sea Horse Bank and four other banks from one end to the other of the Amanala Sea when you have ripped out the very heart of a rich Government monopoly so that five years will not repair your wrong doings you must smile and take what is in store But the skipper reflected as a launch put out from the man of war that he had been bombarded on the high seas with the British flag several of them picturesquely disposed above him and tried to find comfort from the thought Where said the stolid naval lieutenant hoisting himself aboard where are those dam pearls They were there beyond evasion No affidavit could do away with the fearful smell of decayed oysters the diving dresses and the shell littered hatches They were there to the value of seventy thousand pounds more or less and every pound poached The man of war was annoyed for she had used up many tons of coal she had strained her tubes and worse than all her officers and crew had been hurried Every one on the Haliotis was arrested and rearrested several times as each officer came aboard then they were told by what they esteemed to be the equivalent of a midshipman that they were to consider themselves prisoners and finally were put under arrest It s not the least good said the skipper suavely You d much better send us a tow Be still you are arrest was the reply Where the devil do you expect we are going to escape to We re helpless You ve got to tow us into somewhere and explain why you fired on us mister Wardrop we re helpless aren t we Ruined from end to end said the man of machinery If she rolls the forward cylinder will come down and go through her bottom Both columns are clean cut through There s nothing to hold anything up The council of war clanked off to see if mister Wardrop s words were true He warned them that it was as much as a man s life was worth to enter the engine room and they contented themselves with a distant inspection through the thinning steam The Haliotis lifted to the long easy swell and the starboard supporting column ground a trifle as a man grits his teeth under the knife The forward cylinder was depending on that unknown force men call the pertinacity of materials which now and then balances that other heartbreaking power the perversity of inanimate things You see said mister Wardrop hurrying them away The engines aren t worth their price as old iron We tow was the answer Afterwards we shall confiscate The man of war was short handed and did not see the necessity for putting a prize crew aboard the Haliotis So she sent one sublieutenant whom the skipper kept very drunk for he did not wish to make the tow too easy and moreover he had an inconspicuous little rope hanging from the stem of his ship Then they began to tow at an average speed of four knots an hour The Haliotis was very hard to move and the gunnery lieutenant who had fired the five inch shell had leisure to think upon consequences mister Wardrop was the busy man He borrowed all the crew to shore up the cylinders with spars and blocks from the bottom and sides of the ship It was a day s risky work but anything was better than drowning at the end of a tow rope and if the forward cylinder had fallen it would have made its way to the sea bed and taken the Haliotis after Where are we going to and how long will they tow us he asked of the skipper God knows and this prize lieutenant s drunk What do you think you can do There s just the bare chance mister Wardrop whispered though no one was within hearing there s just the bare chance o repairin her if a man knew how They ve twisted the very guts out of her bringing her up with that jerk but I m saying that with time and patience there s just the chance o making steam yet We could do it The skipper s eye brightened Do you mean he began that she is any good Oh no said mister Wardrop She ll need three thousand pounds in repairs at the lowest if she s to take the sea again an that apart from any injury to her structure She s like a man fallen down five pair o stairs We can t tell for months what has happened but we know she ll never be good again without a new inside Ye should see the condenser tubes an the steam connections to the donkey for two things only I m not afraid of them repairin her I m afraid of them stealin things They ve fired on us They ll have to explain that Our reputation s not good enough to ask for explanations Let s take what we have and be thankful Ye would not have consuls remembern the Guidin Light an the Shah in Shah an the Aglaia at this most alarmin crisis We ve been no better than pirates these ten years Under Providence we re no worse than thieves now We ve much to be thankful for if we e er get back to her Make it your own way then said the skipper If there s the least chance I ll leave none said mister Wardrop none that they ll dare to take Keep her heavy on the tow for we need time The skipper never interfered with the affairs of the engine room and mister Wardrop an artist in his profession turned to and composed a work terrible and forbidding His background was the dark grained sides of the engine room his material the metals of power and strength helped out with spars baulks and ropes The man of war towed sullenly and viciously The Haliotis behind her hummed like a hive before swarming With extra and totally unneeded spars her crew blocked up the space round the forward engine till it resembled a statue in its scaffolding and the butts of the shores interfered with every view that a dispassionate eye might wish to take And that the dispassionate mind might be swiftly shaken out of its calm the well sunk bolts of the shores were wrapped round untidily with loose ends of ropes giving a studied effect of most dangerous insecurity Next mister Wardrop took up a collection from the after engine which as you will remember had not been affected in the general wreck The cylinder escape valve he abolished with a flogging hammer It is difficult in far off ports to come by such valves unless like mister Wardrop you keep duplicates in store At the same time men took off the nuts of two of the great holding down bolts that serve to keep the engines in place on their solid bed An engine violently arrested in mid career may easily jerk off the nut of a holding down bolt and this accident looked very natural Passing along the tunnel he removed several shaft coupling bolts and nuts scattering other and ancient pieces of iron underfoot Cylinder bolts he cut off to the number of six from the after engine cylinder so that it might match its neighbour and stuffed the bilge and feed pumps with cotton waste Then he made up a neat bundle of the various odds and ends that he had gathered from the engines little things like nuts and valve spindles all carefully tallowed and retired with them under the floor of the engine room where he sighed being fat as he passed from manhole to manhole of the double bottom and in a fairly dry submarine compartment hid them Any engineer particularly in an unfriendly port has a right to keep his spare stores where he chooses and the foot of one of the cylinder shores blocked all entrance into the regular store room even if that had not been already closed with steel wedges In conclusion he disconnected the after engine laid piston and connecting rod carefully tallowed where it would be most inconvenient to the casual visitor took out three of the eight collars of the thrust block hid them where only he could find them again filled the boilers by hand wedged the sliding doors of the coal bunkers and rested from his labours The engine room was a cemetery and it did not need the contents of the ash lift through the skylight to make it any worse He invited the skipper to look at the completed work Saw ye ever such a forsaken wreck as that said he proudly It almost frights me to go under those shores Now what d you think they ll do to us Wait till we see said the skipper It ll be bad enough when it comes He was not wrong The pleasant days of towing ended all too soon though the Haliotis trailed behind her a heavily weighted jib stayed out into the shape of a pocket and mister Wardrop was no longer an artist of imagination but one of seven and twenty prisoners in a prison full of insects The man of war had towed them to the nearest port not to the headquarters of the colony and when mister Wardrop saw the dismal little harbour with its ragged line of Chinese junks its one crazy tug and the boat building shed that under the charge of a philosophical Malay represented a dockyard he sighed and shook his head I did well he said This is the habitation o wreckers an thieves We re at the uttermost ends of the earth Think you they ll ever know in England Doesn t look like it said the skipper They were marched ashore with what they stood up in under a generous escort and were judged according to the customs of the country which though excellent are a little out of date There were the pearls there were the poachers and there sat a small but hot Governor He consulted for a while and then things began to move with speed for he did not wish to keep a hungry crew at large on the beach and the man of war had gone up the coast With a wave of his hand a stroke of the pen was not necessary he consigned them to the black gang tana the back country and the hand of the Law removed them from his sight and the knowledge of men They were marched into the palms and the back country swallowed them up all the crew of the Haliotis Deep peace continued to brood over Europe Asia Africa America Australasia and Polynesia It was the firing that did it They should have kept their counsel but when a few thousand foreigners are bursting with joy over the fact that a ship under the British flag has been fired at on the high seas news travels quickly and when it came out that the pearl stealing crew had not been allowed access to their consul there was no consul within a few hundred miles of that lonely port even the friendliest of Powers has a right to ask questions The great heart of the British public was beating furiously on account of the performance of a notorious race horse and had not a throb to waste on distant accidents but somewhere deep in the hull of the ship of State there is machinery which more or less accurately takes charge of foreign affairs That machinery began to revolve and who so shocked and surprised as the Power that had captured the Haliotis It explained that colonial governors and far away men of war were difficult to control and promised that it would most certainly make an example both of the Governor and the vessel As for the crew reported to be pressed into military service in tropical climes it would produce them as soon as possible and it would apologise if necessary Now no apologies were needed When one nation apologises to another millions of amateurs who have no earthly concern with the difficulty hurl themselves into the strife and embarrass the trained specialist It was requested that the crew be found if they were still alive they had been eight months beyond knowledge and it was promised that all would be forgotten The little Governor of the little port was pleased with himself Seven and twenty white men made a very compact force to throw away on a war that had neither beginning nor end a jungle and stockade fight that flickered and smouldered through the wet hot years in the hills a hundred miles away and was the heritage of every wearied official He had he thought deserved well of his country and if only some one would buy the unhappy Haliotis moored in the harbour below his verandah his cup would be full He looked at the neatly silvered lamps that he had taken from her cabins and thought of much that might be turned to account But his countrymen in that moist climate had no spirit They would peep into the silent engine room and shake their heads Even the men of war would not tow her further up the coast where the Governor believed that she could be repaired She was a bad bargain but her cabin carpets were undeniably beautiful and his wife approved of her mirrors Three hours later cables were bursting round him like shells for though he knew it not he was being offered as a sacrifice by the nether to the upper millstone and his superiors had no regard for his feelings He had said the cables grossly exceeded his power and failed to report on events He would therefore at this he cast himself back in his hammock produce the crew of the Haliotis He would send for them and if that failed he would put his dignity on a pony and fetch them himself He had no conceivable right to make pearl poachers serve in any war He would be held responsible Next morning the cables wished to know whether he had found the crew of the Haliotis They were to be found freed and fed he was to feed them till such time as they could be sent to the nearest English port in a man of war If you abuse a man long enough in great words flashed over the sea beds things happen The Governor sent inland swiftly for his prisoners who were also soldiers and never was a militia regiment more anxious to reduce its strength No power short of death could make these mad men wear the uniform of their service They would not fight except with their fellows and it was for that reason the regiment had not gone to war but stayed in a stockade reasoning with the new troops The autumn campaign had been a fiasco but here were the Englishmen All the regiment marched back to guard them and the hairy enemy armed with blow pipes rejoiced in the forest Five of the crew had died but there lined up on the Governor s verandah two and twenty men marked about the legs with the scars of leech bites A few of them wore fringes that had once been trousers the others used loin cloths of gay patterns and they existed beautifully but simply in the Governor s verandah and when he came out they sang at him When you have lost seventy thousand pounds worth of pearls your pay your ship and all your clothes and have lived in bondage for five months beyond the faintest pretences of civilisation you know what true independence means for you become the happiest of created things natural man The Governor told the crew that they were evil and they asked for food When he saw how they ate and when he remembered that none of the pearl patrol boats were expected for two months he sighed But the crew of the Haliotis lay down in the verandah and said that they were pensioners of the Governor s bounty A grey bearded man fat and bald headed his one garment a green and yellow loin cloth saw the Haliotis in the harbour and bellowed for joy The men crowded to the verandah rail kicking aside the long cane chairs They pointed gesticulated and argued freely without shame The militia regiment sat down in the Governor s garden The Governor retired to his hammock it was as easy to be killed lying as standing and his women squeaked from the shuttered rooms She sold said the grey bearded man pointing to the Haliotis He was mister Wardrop No good said the Governor shaking his head No one come buy He s taken my lamps though said the skipper He wore one leg of a pair of trousers and his eye wandered along the verandah The Governor quailed There were cuddy camp stools and the skipper s writing table in plain sight They ve cleaned her out o course said mister Wardrop They would We ll go aboard and take an inventory See He waved his hands over the harbour We live there now Sorry The Governor smiled a smile of relief He s glad of that said one of the crew reflectively I shouldn t wonder They flocked down to the harbour front the militia regiment clattering behind and embarked themselves in what they found it happened to be the Governor s boat Then they disappeared over the bulwarks of the Haliotis and the Governor prayed that they might find occupation inside mister Wardrop s first bound took him to the engine room and when the others were patting the well remembered decks they heard him giving God thanks that things were as he had left them The wrecked engines stood over his head untouched no inexpert hand had meddled with his shores the steel wedges of the store room were rusted home and best of all the hundred and sixty tons of good Australian coal in the bunkers had not diminished I don t understand it said mister Wardrop Any Malay knows the use o copper They ought to have cut away the pipes And with Chinese junks coming here too It s a special interposition o Providence You think so said the skipper from above There s only been one thief here and he s cleaned her out of all my things anyhow Here the skipper spoke less than the truth for under the planking of his cabin only to be reached by a chisel lay a little money which never drew any interest his sheet anchor to windward It was all in clean sovereigns that pass current the world over and might have amounted to more than a hundred pounds He s left me alone Let s thank God repeated mister Wardrop He s taken everything else look The Haliotis except as to her engine room had been systematically and scientifically gutted from one end to the other and there was strong evidence that an unclean guard had camped in the skipper s cabin to regulate that plunder She lacked glass plate crockery cutlery mattresses cuddy carpets and chairs all boats and her copper ventilators These things had been removed with her sails and as much of the wire rigging as would not imperil the safety of the masts He must have sold those said the skipper The other things are in his house I suppose Every fitting that could be pried or screwed out was gone Port starboard and masthead lights teak gratings sliding sashes of the deckhouse the captain s chest of drawers with charts and chart table photographs brackets and looking glasses cabin doors rubber cuddy mats hatch irons half the funnel stays cork fenders carpenter s grindstone and tool chest holystones swabs squeegees all cabin and pantry lamps galley fittings en bloc flags and flag locker clocks chronometers the forward compass and the ship s bell and belfry were among the missing There were great scarred marks on the deck planking over which the cargo derricks had been hauled One must have fallen by the way for the bulwark rails were smashed and bent and the side plates bruised It s the Governor said the skipper He s been selling her on the instalment plan Let s go up with spanners and shovels and kill em all shouted the crew Let s drown him and keep the woman Then we ll be shot by that black and tan regiment our regiment What s the trouble ashore They ve camped our regiment on the beach We re cut off that s all Go and see what they want said mister Wardrop You ve the trousers In his simple way the Governor was a strategist He did not desire that the crew of the Haliotis should come ashore again either singly or in detachments and he proposed to turn their steamer into a convict hulk They would wait he explained this from the quay to the skipper in the barge and they would continue to wait till the man of war came along exactly where they were If one of them set foot ashore the entire regiment would open fire and he would not scruple to use the two cannon of the town Meantime food would be sent daily in a boat under an armed escort The skipper bare to the waist and rowing could only grind his teeth and the Governor improved the occasion and revenged himself for the bitter words in the cables by saying what he thought of the morals and manners of the crew The barge returned to the Haliotis in silence and the skipper climbed aboard white on the cheek bones and blue about the nostrils I knew it said mister Wardrop and they won t give us good food either We shall have bananas morning noon and night an a man can t work on fruit We know that Then the skipper cursed mister Wardrop for importing frivolous side issues into the conversation and the crew cursed one another and the Haliotis the voyage and all that they knew or could bring to mind They sat down in silence on the empty decks and their eyes burned in their heads The green harbour water chuckled at them overside They looked at the palm fringed hills inland at the white houses above the harbour road at the single tier of native craft by the quay at the stolid soldiery sitting round the two cannon and last of all at the blue bar of the horizon mister Wardrop was buried in thought and scratched imaginary lines with his untrimmed finger nails on the planking I make no promise he said at last for I can t say what may or may not have happened to them But here s the ship and here s us There was a little scornful laughter at this and mister Wardrop knitted his brows He recalled that in the days when he wore trousers he had been Chief Engineer of the Haliotis Harland Mackesy Noble Hay Naughton Fink O Hara Trumbull Here sir The instinct of obedience waked to answer the roll call of the engine room Below They rose and went Captain I ll trouble you for the rest of the men as I want them We ll get my stores out and clear away the shores we don t need and then we ll patch her up My men will remember that they re in the Haliotis under me He went into the engine room and the others stared They were used to the accidents of the sea but this was beyond their experience None who had seen the engine room believed that anything short of new engines from end to end could stir the Haliotis from her moorings The engine room stores were unearthed and mister Wardrop s face red with the filth of the bilges and the exertion of travelling on his stomach lit with joy The spare gear of the Haliotis had been unusually complete and two and twenty men armed with screw jacks differential blocks tackle vices and a forge or so can look Kismet between the eyes without winking The crew were ordered to replace the holding down and shaft bearing bolts and return the collars of the thrust block When they had finished mister Wardrop delivered a lecture on repairing compound engines without the aid of the shops and the men sat about on the cold machinery The cross head jammed in the guides leered at them drunkenly but offered no help They ran their fingers hopelessly into the cracks of the starboard supporting column and picked at the ends of the ropes round the shores while mister Wardrop s voice rose and fell echoing till the quick tropic night closed down over the engine room skylight Next morning the work of reconstruction began It has been explained that the foot of the connecting rod was forced against the foot of the starboard supporting column which it had cracked through and driven outward towards the ship s skin To all appearance the job was more than hopeless for rod and column seemed to have been welded into one But herein Providence smiled on them for one moment to hearten them through the weary weeks ahead The second engineer more reckless than resourceful struck at random with a cold chisel into the cast iron of the column and a greasy grey flake of metal flew from under the imprisoned foot of the connecting rod while the rod itself fell away slowly and brought up with a thunderous clang somewhere in the dark of the crank pit The guides plates above were still jammed fast in the guides but the first blow had been struck They spent the rest of the day grooming the donkey engine which stood immediately forward of the engine room hatch Its tarpaulin of course had been stolen and eight warm months had not improved the working parts Further the last dying hiccup of the Haliotis seemed or it might have been the Malay from the boat house to have lifted the thing bodily on its bolts and set it down inaccurately as regarded its steam connections If we only had one single cargo derrick mister Wardrop sighed We can take the cylinder cover off by hand if we sweat but to get the rod out o the piston s not possible unless we use steam Well there ll be steam the morn if there s nothing else She ll fizzle Next morning men from the shore saw the Haliotis through a cloud for it was as though the deck smoked Her crew were chasing steam through the shaken and leaky pipes to its work in the forward donkey engine and where oakum failed to plug a crack they stripped off their loin cloths for lapping and swore half boiled and mother naked The donkey engine worked at a price the price of constant attention and furious stoking worked long enough to allow a wire rope it was made up of a funnel and a foremast stay to be led into the engine room and made fast on the cylinder cover of the forward engine That rose easily enough and was hauled through the skylight and on to the deck many hands assisting the doubtful steam Then came the tug of war for it was necessary to get to the piston and the jammed piston rod They removed two of the piston junk ring studs screwed in two strong iron eye bolts by way of handles doubled the wire rope and set half a dozen men to smite with an extemporised battering ram at the end of the piston rod where it peered through the piston while the donkey engine hauled upwards on the piston itself After four hours of this furious work the piston rod suddenly slipped and the piston rose with a jerk knocking one or two men over into the engine room But when mister Wardrop declared that the piston had not split they cheered and thought nothing of their wounds and the donkey engine was hastily stopped its boiler was nothing to tamper with And day by day their supplies reached them by boat The skipper humbled himself once more before the Governor and as a concession had leave to get drinking water from the Malay boat builder on the quay It was not good drinking water but the Malay was anxious to supply anything in his power if he were paid for it Now when the jaws of the forward engine stood as it were stripped and empty they began to wedge up the shores of the cylinder itself That work alone filled the better part of three days warm and sticky days when the hands slipped and sweat ran into the eyes When the last wedge was hammered home there was no longer an ounce of weight on the supporting columns and mister Wardrop rummaged the ship for boiler plate three quarters of an inch thick where he could find it There was not much available but what there was was more than beaten gold to him In one desperate forenoon the entire crew naked and lean haled back more or less into place the starboard supporting column which as you remember was cracked clean through mister Wardrop found them asleep where they had finished the work and gave them a day s rest smiling upon them as a father while he drew chalk marks about the cracks They woke to new and more trying labour for over each one of those cracks a plate of three quarter inch boiler iron was to be worked hot the rivet holes being drilled by hand All that time they were fed on fruits chiefly bananas with some sago Those were the days when men swooned over the ratchet drill and the hand forge and where they fell they had leave to lie unless their bodies were in the way of their fellows feet And so patch upon patch and a patch over all the starboard supporting column was clouted but when they thought all was secure mister Wardrop decreed that the noble patchwork would never support working engines at the best it could only hold the guide bars approximately true he deadweight of the cylinders must be borne by vertical struts and therefore a gang would repair to the bows and take out with files the big bow anchor davits each of which was some three inches in diameter They threw hot coals at Wardrop and threatened to kill him those who did not weep they were ready to weep on the least provocation but he hit them with iron bars heated at the end and they limped forward and the davits came with them when they returned They slept sixteen hours on the strength of it and in three days two struts were in place bolted from the foot of the starboard supporting column to the under side of the cylinder There remained now the port or condenser column which though not so badly cracked as its fellow had also been strengthened in four places with boiler plate patches but needed struts They took away the main stanchions of the bridge for that work and crazy with toil did not see till all was in place that the rounded bars of iron must be flattened from top to bottom to allow the air pump levers to clear them It was Wardrop s oversight and he wept bitterly before the men as he gave the order to unbolt the struts and flatten them with hammer and the flame Now the broken engine was underpinned firmly and they took away the wooden shores from under the cylinders and gave them to the robbed bridge thanking God for even half a day s work on gentle kindly wood instead of the iron that had entered into their souls Eight months in the back country among the leeches at a temperature of eighty four degrees moist is very bad for the nerves They had kept the hardest work to the last as boys save Latin prose and worn though they were mister Wardrop did not dare to give them rest The piston rod and connecting rod were to be straightened and this was a job for a regular dockyard with every appliance They fell to it cheered by a little chalk showing of work done and time consumed which mister Wardrop wrote up on the engine room bulkhead Fifteen days had gone fifteen days of killing labour and there was hope before them It is curious that no man knows how the rods were straightened The crew of the Haliotis remember that week very dimly as a fever patient remembers the delirium of a long night There were fires everywhere they say the whole ship was one consuming furnace and the hammers were never still Now there could not have been more than one fire at the most for mister Wardrop distinctly recalls that no straightening was done except under his own eye They remember too that for many years voices gave orders which they obeyed with their bodies but their minds were abroad on all the seas It seems to them that they stood through days and nights slowly sliding a bar backwards and forwards through a white glow that was part of the ship They remember an intolerable noise in their burning heads from the walls of the stoke hole and they remember being savagely beaten by men whose eyes seemed asleep When their shift was over they would draw straight lines in the air anxiously and repeatedly and would question one another in their sleep crying Is she straight At last they do not remember whether this was by day or by night mister Wardrop began to dance clumsily and wept the while and they too danced and wept and went to sleep twitching all over and when they woke men said that the rods were straightened and no one did any work for two days but lay on the decks and ate fruit mister Wardrop would go below from time to time and pat the two rods where they lay and they heard him singing hymns Then his trouble of mind went from him and at the end of the third day s idleness he made a drawing in chalk upon the deck with letters of the alphabet at the angles He pointed out that though the piston rod was more or less straight the piston rod cross head the thing that had been jammed sideways in the guides had been badly strained and had cracked the lower end of the piston rod He was going to forge and shrink a wrought iron collar on the neck of the piston rod where it joined the cross head and from the collar he would bolt a Y shaped piece of iron whose lower arms should be bolted into the cross head If anything more were needed they could use up the last of the boiler plate So the forges were lit again and men burned their bodies but hardly felt the pain The finished connection was not beautiful but it seemed strong enough at least as strong as the rest of the machinery and with that job their labours came to an end All that remained was to connect up the engines and to get food and water The skipper and four men dealt with the Malay boat builder by night chiefly it was no time to haggle over the price of sago and dried fish The others stayed aboard and replaced piston piston rod cylinder cover cross head and bolts with the aid of the faithful donkey engine The cylinder cover was hardly steam proof and the eye of science might have seen in the connecting rod a flexure something like that of a Christmas tree candle which has melted and been straightened by hand over a stove but as mister Wardrop said She didn t hit anything As soon as the last bolt was in place men tumbled over one another in their anxiety to get to the hand starting gear the wheel and worm by which some engines can be moved when there is no steam aboard They nearly wrenched off the wheel but it was evident to the blindest eye that the engines stirred They did not revolve in their orbits with any enthusiasm as good machines should indeed they groaned not a little but they moved over and came to rest in a way which proved that they still recognised man s hand Then mister Wardrop sent his slaves into the darker bowels of the engine room and the stoke hole and followed them with a flare lamp The boilers were sound but would take no harm from a little scaling and cleaning mister Wardrop would not have any one over zealous for he feared what the next stroke of the tool might show The less we know about her now said he the better for us all I m thinkin Ye ll understand me when I say that this is in no sense regular engineerin As his raiment when he spoke was his grey beard and uncut hair they believed him They did not ask too much of what they met but polished and tallowed and scraped it to a false brilliancy A lick of paint would make me easier in my mind said mister Wardrop plaintively I know half the condenser tubes are started and the propeller shaftin s God knows how far out of the true and we ll need a new air pump an the main steam leaks like a sieve and there s worse each way I look but paint s like clothes to a man an ours is near all gone The skipper unearthed some stale ropy paint of the loathsome green that they used for the galleys of sailing ships and mister Wardrop spread it abroad lavishly to give the engines self respect His own was returning day by day for he wore his loin cloth continuously but the crew having worked under orders did not feel as he did The completed work satisfied mister Wardrop He would at the last have made shift to run to Singapore and gone home without vengeance taken to show his engines to his brethren in the craft but the others and the captain forbade him They had not yet recovered their self respect It would be safer to make what ye might call a trial trip but beggars mustn t be choosers an if the engines will go over to the hand gear the probability I m only saying it s a probability the chance is that they ll hold up when we put steam on her How long will you take to get steam said the skipper God knows Four hours a day half a week If I can raise sixty pound I ll not complain Be sure of her first we can t afford to go out half a mile and break down My soul and body man we re one continuous breakdown fore an aft We might fetch Singapore though We ll break down at Pygang Watai where we can do good was the answer in a voice that did not allow argument She s my boat and I ve had eight months to think in No man saw the Haliotis depart though many heard her She left at two in the morning having cut her moorings and it was none of her crew s pleasure that the engines should strike up a thundering half seas over chanty that echoed among the hills mister Wardrop wiped away a tear as he listened to the new song She s gibberin she s just gibberin he whimpered Yon s the voice of a maniac And if engines have any soul as their masters believe he was quite right There were outcries and clamours sobs and bursts of chattering laughter silences where the trained ear yearned for the clear note and torturing reduplications where there should have been one deep voice Down the screw shaft ran murmurs and warnings while a heart diseased flutter without told that the propeller needed re keying How does she make it said the skipper She moves but but she s breakin my heart The sooner we re at Pygang Watai the better She s mad and we re waking the town Is she at all near safe What do I care how safe she is She s mad Hear that now To be sure nothing s hittin anything and the bearin s are fairly cool but can ye not hear If she goes said the skipper I don t care a curse And she s my boat too She went trailing a fathom of weed behind her From a slow two knots an hour she crawled up to a triumphant four Anything beyond that made the struts quiver dangerously and filled the engine room with steam Morning showed her out of sight of land and there was a visible ripple under her bows but she complained bitterly in her bowels and as though the noise had called it there shot along across the purple sea a swift dark proa hawk like and curious which presently ranged alongside and wished to know if the Haliotis were helpless Ships even the steamers of the white men had been known to break down in those waters and the honest Malay and Javanese traders would sometimes aid them in their own peculiar way But this ship was not full of lady passengers and well dressed officers Men white naked and savage swarmed down her sides some with red hot iron bars and others with large hammers threw themselves upon those innocent inquiring strangers and before any man could say what had happened were in full possession of the proa while the lawful owners bobbed in the water overside Half an hour later the proa s cargo of sago and trepang as well as a doubtful minded compass was in the Haliotis The two huge triangular mat sails with their seventy foot yards and booms had followed the cargo and were being fitted to the stripped masts of the steamer They rose they swelled they filled and the empty steamer visibly laid over as the wind took them They gave her nearly three knots an hour and what better could men ask But if she had been forlorn before this new purchase made her horrible to see Imagine a respectable charwoman in the tights of a ballet dancer rolling drunk along the streets and you will come to some faint notion of the appearance of that nine hundred ton well decked once schooner rigged cargo boat as she staggered under her new help shouting and raving across the deep With steam and sail that marvellous voyage continued and the bright eyed crew looked over the rail desolate unkempt unshorn shamelessly clothed beyond the decencies At the end of the third week she sighted the island of Pygang Watai whose harbour is the turning point of a pearl sea patrol Here the gun boats stay for a week ere they retrace their line There is no village at Pygang Watai only a stream of water some palms and a harbour safe to rest in till the first violence of the southeast monsoon has blown itself out They opened up the low coral beach with its mound of whitewashed coal ready for supply the deserted huts for the sailors and the flagless flagstaff Next day there was no Haliotis only a little proa rocking in the warm rain at the mouth of the harbour whose crew watched with hungry eyes the smoke of a gunboat on the horizon Months afterwards there were a few lines in an English newspaper to the effect that some gunboat of some foreign Power had broken her back at the mouth of some far away harbour by running at full speed into a sunken wreck WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR PART I I have done one braver thing Than all the worthies did And yet a braver thence doth spring Which is to keep that hid The Undertaking Is it officially declared yet They ve gone as far as to admit extreme local scarcity and they ve started relief works in one or two districts the paper says That means it will be declared as soon as they can make sure of the men and the rolling stock Shouldn t wonder if it were as bad as the seventy eight Famine Can t be said Scott turning a little in the long cane chair We ve had fifteen anna crops in the north and Bombay and Bengal report more than they know what to do with They ll be able to check it before it gets out of hand It will only be local Martyn picked the Pioneer from the table read through the telegrams once more and put up his feet on the chair rests It was a hot dark breathless evening heavy with the smell of the newly watered Mall The flowers in the Club gardens were dead and black on their stalks the little lotus pond was a circle of caked mud and the tamarisk trees were white with the dust of weeks Most of the men were at the band stand in the public gardens from the Club verandah you could hear the native Police band hammering stale waltzes or on the polo ground or in the high walled fives court hotter than a Dutch oven Half a dozen grooms squatted at the heads of their ponies waited their masters return From time to time a man would ride at a foot pace into the Club compound and listlessly loaf over to the whitewashed barracks beside the main building These were supposed to be chambers Men lived in them meeting the same white faces night after night at dinner and drawing out their office work till the latest possible hour that they might escape that doleful company What are you going to do said Martyn with a yawn Let s have a swim before dinner Water s hot I was at the bath to day Play you game o billiards fifty up It s a hundred and five in the hall now Sit still and don t be so abominably energetic A grunting camel swung up to the porch his badged and belted rider fumbling a leather pouch Kubber kargaz ki yektraaa the man whined handing down the newspaper extra a slip printed on one side only and damp from the press It was pinned up on the green baize board between notices of ponies for sale and fox terriers missing Martyn rose lazily read it and whistled It s declared he cried One two three eight districts go under the operations of the Famine Code ek dum They ve put Jimmy Hawkins in charge Good business said Scott with the first sign of interest he had shown When in doubt hire a Punjabi I worked under Jimmy when I first came out and he belonged to the Punjab He has more bundobust than most men Jimmy s a Jubilee Knight now said Martyn He s a good chap even though he is a thrice born civilian and went to the Benighted Presidency What unholy names these Madras districts rejoice in all ungas or rungas or pillays or polliums A dog cart drove up in the dusk and a man entered mopping his head He was editor of the one daily paper at the capital of a Province of twenty five million natives and a few hundred white men as his staff was limited to himself and one assistant his office hours ran variously from ten to twenty a day Hi Raines you re supposed to know everything said Martyn stopping him How s this Madras scarcity going to turn out No one knows as yet There s a message as long as your arm coming in on the telephone I ve left my cub to fill it out Madras has owned she can t manage it alone and Jimmy seems to have a free hand in getting all the men he needs Arbuthnot s warned to hold himself in readiness Badger Arbuthnot The Peshawur chap Yes and the Pi wires that Ellis and Clay have been moved from the Northwest already and they ve taken half a dozen Bombay men too It s pukka famine by the looks of it They re nearer the scene of action than we are but if it comes to indenting on the Punjab this early there s more in this than meets the eye said Martyn Here to day and gone to morrow Didn t come to stay for ever said Scott dropping one of Marryat s novels and rising to his feet Martyn your sister s waiting for you A rough grey horse was backing and shifting at the edge of the verandah where the light of a kerosene lamp fell on a brown calico habit and a white face under a grey felt hat Right O said Martyn I m ready Better come and dine with us if you ve nothing to do Scott William is there any dinner in the house I ll go home and see was the rider s answer You can drive him over at eight remember Scott moved leisurely to his room and changed into the evening dress of the season and the country spotless white linen from head to foot with a broad silk cummerbund Dinner at the Martyns was a decided improvement on the goat mutton twiney tough fowl and tinned entrees of the Club But it was a great pity that Martyn could not afford to send his sister to the hills for the hot weather As an Acting District Superintendent of Police Martyn drew the magnificent pay of six hundred depreciated silver rupees a month and his little four roomed bungalow said just as much There were the usual blue and white striped jail made rugs on the uneven floor the usual glass studded Amritsar phulkaris draped on nails driven into the flaking whitewash of the walls the usual half dozen chairs that did not match picked up at sales of dead men s effects and the usual streaks of black grease where the leather punka thong ran through the wall It was as though everything had been unpacked the night before to be repacked next morning Not a door in the house was true on its hinges The little windows fifteen feet up were darkened with wasp nests and lizards hunted flies between the beams of the wood ceiled roof But all this was part of Scott s life Thus did people live who had such an income and in a land where each man s pay age and position are printed in a book that all may read it is hardly worth while to play at pretence in word or deed Scott counted eight years service in the Irrigation Department and drew eight hundred rupees a month on the understanding that if he served the State faithfully for another twenty two years he could retire on a pension of some four hundred rupees a month His working life which had been spent chiefly under canvas or in temporary shelters where a man could sleep eat and write letters was bound up with the opening and guarding of irrigation canals the handling of two or three thousand workmen of all castes and creeds and the payment of vast sums of coined silver He had finished that spring not without credit the last section of the great Mosuhl Canal and much against his will for he hated office work had been sent in to serve during the hot weather on the accounts and supply side of the Department with sole charge of the sweltering sub office at the capital of the Province Martyn knew this William his sister knew it and everybody knew it Scott knew too as well as the rest of the world that Miss Martyn had come out to India four years ago to keep house for her brother who as every one knew had borrowed the money to pay for her passage and that she ought as all the world said to have married at once In stead of this she had refused some half a dozen subalterns a Civilian twenty years her senior one Major and a man in the Indian Medical Department This too was common property She had stayed down three hot weathers as the saying is because her brother was in debt and could not afford the expense of her keep at even a cheap hill station Therefore her face was white as bone and in the centre of her forehead was a big silvery scar about the size of a shilling the mark of a Delhi sore which is the same as a Bagdad date This comes from drinking bad water and slowly eats into the flesh till it is ripe enough to be burned out None the less William had enjoyed herself hugely in her four years Twice she had been nearly drowned while fording a river once she had been run away with on a camel had witnessed a midnight attack of thieves on her brother s camp had seen justice administered with long sticks in the open under trees could speak Urdu and even rough Punjabi with a fluency that was envied by her seniors had entirely fallen out of the habit of writing to her aunts in England or cutting the pages of the English magazines had been through a very bad cholera year seeing sights unfit to be told and had wound up her experiences by six weeks of typhoid fever during which her head had been shaved and hoped to keep her twenty third birthday that September It is conceivable that the aunts would not have approved of a girl who never set foot on the ground if a horse were within hail who rode to dances with a shawl thrown over her skirt who wore her hair cropped and curling all over her head who answered indifferently to the name of William or Bill whose speech was heavy with the flowers of the vernacular who could act in amateur theatricals play on the banjo rule eight servants and two horses their accounts and their diseases and look men slowly and deliberately between the eyes even after they had proposed to her and been rejected I like men who do things she had confided to a man in the Educational Department who was teaching the sons of cloth merchants and dyers the beauty of Wordsworth s Excursion in annotated cram books and when he grew poetical William explained that she didn t understand poetry very much it made her head ache and another broken heart took refuge at the Club But it was all William s fault She delighted in hearing men talk of their own work and that is the most fatal way of bringing a man to your feet Scott had known her for some three years meeting her as a rule under canvass when his camp and her brother s joined for a day on the edge of the Indian Desert He had danced with her several times at the big Christmas gatherings when as many as five hundred white people came in to the station and had always a great respect for her housekeeping and her dinners She looked more like a boy than ever when the meal ended she sat rolling cigarettes her low forehead puckered beneath the dark curls as she twiddled the papers and stuck out her rounded chin when the tobacco stayed in place or with a gesture as true as a school boy s throwing a stone tossed the finished article across the room to Martyn who caught it with one hand and continued his talk with Scott It was all shop canals and the policing of canals the sins of villagers who stole more water than they had paid for and the grosser sin of native constables who connived at the thefts of the transplanting bodily of villages to newly irrigated ground and of the coming fight with the desert in the south when the Provincial funds should warrant the opening of the long surveyed Luni Protective Canal System And Scott spoke openly of his great desire to be put on one particular section of the work where he knew the land and the people and Martyn sighed for a billet in the Himalayan foot hills and said his mind of his superiors and William rolled cigarettes and said nothing but smiled gravely on her brother because he was happy At ten Scott s horse came to the door and the evening was ended The lights of the two low bungalows in which the daily paper was printed showed bright across the road It was too early to try to find sleep and Scott drifted over to the editor Raines stripped to the waist like a sailor at a gun lay half asleep in a long chair waiting for night telegrams He had a theory that if a man did not stay by his work all day and most of the night he laid himself open to fever so he ate and slept among his files Can you do it he said drowsily I didn t mean to bring you over About what I ve been dining at the Martyns The Madras famine of course Martyn s warned too They re taking men where they can find em I sent a note to you at the Club just now asking if you could do us a letter once a week from the south between two and three columns say Nothing sensational of course but just plain facts about who is doing what and so forth Our regular rates ten rupees a column Sorry but it s out of my line Scott answered staring absently at the map of India on the wall It s rough on Martyn very Wonder what he ll do with his sister Wonder what the deuce they ll do with me I ve no famine experience This is the first I ve heard of it Am I ordered Oh yes Here s the wire They ll put you on to relief works Raines said with a horde of Madrassis dying like flies one native apothecary and half a pint of cholera mixture among the ten thousand of you It comes of your being idle for the moment Every man who isn t doing two men s work seems to have been called upon Hawkins evidently believes in Punjabis It s going to be quite as bad as anything they have had in the last ten years It s all in the day s work worse luck I suppose I shall get my orders officially some time to morrow I m awfully glad I happened to drop in Better go and pack my kit now Who relieves me here do you know Raines turned over a sheaf of telegrams McEuan said he from Murree Scott chuckled He thought he was going to be cool all summer He ll be very sick about this Well no good talking Night Two hours later Scott with a clear conscience laid himself down to rest on a string cot in a bare room Two worn bullock trunks a leather water bottle a tin ice box and his pet saddle sewed up in sacking were piled at the door and the Club secretary s receipt for last month s bill was under his pillow His orders came next morning and with them an unofficial telegram from Sir James Hawkins who was not in the habit of forgetting good men when he had once met them bidding him report himself with all speed at some unpronounceable place fifteen hundred miles to the south for the famine was sore in the land and white men were needed A pink and fattish youth arrived in the red hot noonday whimpering a little at fate and famines which never allowed any one three months peace He was Scott s successor another cog in the machinery moved forward behind his fellow whose services as the official announcement ran were placed at the disposal of the Madras Government for famine duty until further orders Scott handed over the funds in his charge showed him the coolest corner in the office warned him against excess of zeal and as twilight fell departed from the Club in a hired carriage with his faithful body servant Faiz Ullah and a mound of disordered baggage atop to catch the southern mail at the loopholed and bastioned railway station The heat from the thick brick walls struck him across the face as if it had been a hot towel and he reflected that there were at least five nights and four days of this travel before him Faiz Ullah used to the chances of service plunged into the crowd on the stone platform while Scott a black cheroot between his teeth waited till his compartment should be set away A dozen native policemen with their rifles and bundles shouldered into the press of Punjabi farmers Sikh craftsmen and greasy locked Afreedee pedlars escorting with all pomp Martyn s uniform case water bottles ice box and bedding roll They saw Faiz Ullah s lifted hand and steered for it My Sahib and your Sahib said Faiz Ullah to Martyn s man will travel together Thou and I O brother will thus secure the servants places close by and because of our masters authority none will dare to disturb us When Faiz Ullah reported all things ready Scott settled down at full length coatless and bootless on the broad leather covered bunk The heat under the iron arched roof of the station might have been anything over a hundred degrees At the last moment Martyn entered dripping Don t swear said Scott lazily it s too late to change your carriage and we ll divide the ice What are you doing here said the police man I m lent to the Madras Government same as you By Jove it s a bender of a night Are you taking any of your men down A dozen I suppose I shall have to superintend relief distributions Didn t know you were under orders too I didn t till after I left you last night Raines had the news first My orders came this morning McEuan relieved me at four and I got off at once Shouldn t wonder if it wouldn t be a good thing this famine if we come through it alive Jimmy ought to put you and me to work together said Martyn and then after a pause My sister s here Good business said Scott heartily Going to get off at Umballa I suppose and go up to Simla Who ll she stay with there No o that s just the trouble of it She s going down with me Scott sat bolt upright under the oil lamps as the train jolted past Tarn Taran What You don t mean you couldn t afford Tain t that I d have scraped up the money somehow You might have come to me to begin with said Scott stiffly we aren t altogether strangers Well you needn t be stuffy about it I might but you don t know my sister I ve been explaining and exhorting and all the rest of it all day lost my temper since seven this morning and haven t got it back yet but she wouldn t hear of any compromise A woman s entitled to travel with her husband if she wants to and William says she s on the same footing You see we ve been together all our lives more or less since my people died It isn t as if she were an ordinary sister All the sisters I ve ever heard of would have stayed where they were well off She s as clever as a man confound Martyn went on She broke up the bungalow over my head while I was talking at her Settled the whole thing in three hours servants horses and all I didn t get my orders till nine Jimmy Hawkins won t be pleased said Scott A famine s no place for a woman missus Jim I mean Lady Jim s in camp with him At any rate she says she will look after my sister William wired down to her on her own responsibility asking if she could come and knocked the ground from under me by showing me her answer Scott laughed aloud If she can do that she can take care of herself and missus Jim won t let her run into any mischief There aren t many women sisters or wives who would walk into a famine with their eyes open It isn t as if she didn t know what these things mean She was through the Jalo cholera last year The train stopped at Amritsar and Scott went back to the ladies compartment immediately behind their carriage William with a cloth riding cap on her curls nodded affably Come in and have some tea she said Best thing in the world for heat apoplexy Do I look as if I were going to have heat apoplexy Never can tell said William wisely It s always best to be ready She had arranged her compartment with the knowledge of an old campaigner A felt covered water bottle hung in the draught of one of the shuttered windows a tea set of Russian china packed in a wadded basket stood on the seat and a travelling spirit lamp was clamped against the woodwork above it William served them generously in large cups hot tea which saves the veins of the neck from swelling inopportunely on a hot night It was characteristic of the girl that her plan of action once settled she asked for no comments on it Life among men who had a great deal of work to do and very little time to do it in had taught her the wisdom of effacing as well as of fending for herself She did not by word or deed suggest that she would be useful comforting or beautiful in their travels but continued about her business serenely put the cups back without clatter when tea was ended and made cigarettes for her guests This time last night said Scott we didn t expect er this kind of thing did we I ve learned to expect anything said William You know in our service we live at the end of the telegraph but of course this ought to be a good thing for us all departmentally if we live It knocks us out of the running in our own Province Scott replied with equal gravity I hoped to be put on the Luni Protective Works this cold weather but there s no saying how long the famine may keep us Hardly beyond October I should think said Martyn It will be ended one way or the other then And we ve nearly a week of this said William Sha n t we be dusty when it s over For a night and a day they knew their surroundings and for a night and a day skirting the edge of the great Indian Desert on a narrow gauge railway they remembered how in the days of their apprenticeship they had come by that road from Bombay Then the languages in which the names of the stations were written changed and they launched south into a foreign land where the very smells were new Many long and heavily laden grain trains were in front of them and they could feel the hand of Jimmy Hawkins from far off They waited in extemporised sidings while processions of empty trucks returned to the north and were coupled on to slow crawling trains and dropped at midnight Heaven knew where but it was furiously hot and they walked to and fro among sacks and dogs howled Then they came to an India more strange to them than to the untravelled Englishman the flat red India of palm tree palmyra palm and rice the India of the picture books of Little Harry and His Bearer all dead and dry in the baking heat They had left the incessant passenger traffic of the north and west far and far behind them Here the people crawled to the side of the train holding their little ones in their arms and a loaded truck would be left behind the men and women clustering round it like ants by spilled honey Once in the twilight they saw on a dusty plain a regiment of little brown men each bearing a body over his shoulder and when the train stopped to leave yet another truck they perceived that the burdens were not corpses but only foodless folk picked up beside dead oxen by a corps of Irregular troops Now they met more white men here one and there two whose tents stood close to the line and who came armed with written authorities and angry words to cut off a truck They were too busy to do more than nod at Scott and Martyn and stare curiously at William who could do nothing except make tea and watch how her men staved off the rush of wailing walking skeletons putting them down three at a time in heaps with their own hands uncoupling the marked trucks or taking receipts from the hollow eyed weary white men who spoke another argot than theirs They ran out of ice out of soda water and out of tea for they were six days and seven nights on the road and it seemed to them like seven times seven years At last in a dry hot dawn in a land of death lit by long red fires of railway sleepers where they were burning the dead they came to their destination and were met by Jim Hawkins the Head of the Famine unshaven unwashed but cheery and entirely in command of affairs Martyn he decreed then and there was to live on trains till further orders was to go back with empty trucks filling them with starving people as he found them and dropping them at a famine camp on the edge of the Eight Districts He would pick up supplies and return and his constables would guard the loaded grain cars also picking up people and would drop them at a camp a hundred miles south Scott Hawkins was very glad to see Scott again would that same hour take charge of a convoy of bullock carts and would go south feeding as he went to yet another famine camp where he would leave his starving there would be no lack of starving on the route and wait for orders by telegraph Generally Scott was in all small things to act as he thought best William bit her under lip There was no one in the wide world like her one brother but Martyn s orders gave him no discretion She came out on the platform masked with dust from head to foot a horse shoe wrinkle on her forehead put here by much thinking during the past week but as self possessed as ever missus Jim who should have been Lady Jim but that no one remembered the title took possession of her with a little gasp Oh I m so glad you re here she almost sobbed You oughtn t to of course but there there isn t another woman in the place and we must help each other you know and we ve all the wretched people and the little babies they are selling I ve seen some said William Isn t it ghastly I ve bought twenty they re in our camp but won t you have something to eat first We ve more than ten people can do here and I ve got a horse for you Oh I m so glad you ve come dear You re a Punjabi too you know Steady Lizzie said Hawkins over his shoulder We ll look after you Miss Martyn Sorry I can t ask you to breakfast Martyn You ll have to eat as you go Leave two of your men to help Scott These poor devils can t stand up to load carts Saunders this to the engine driver who was half asleep in the cab back down and get those empties away You ve line clear to Anundrapillay they ll give you orders north of that Scott load up your carts from that B P P truck and be off as soon as you can The Eurasian in the pink shirt is your interpreter and guide You ll find an apothecary of sorts tied to the yoke of the second wagon He s been trying to bolt you ll have to look after him Lizzie drive Miss Martyn to camp and tell them to send the red horse down here for me Scott with Faiz Ullah and two policemen was already busied with the carts backing them up to the truck and unbolting the sideboards quietly while the others pitched in the bags of millet and wheat Hawkins watched him for as long as it took to fill one cart That s a good man he said If all goes well I shall work him hard This was Jim Hawkins s notion of the highest compliment one human being could pay another An hour later Scott was under way the apothecary threatening him with the penalties of the law for that he a member of the Subordinate Medical Department had been coerced and bound against his will and all laws governing the liberty of the subject the pink shirted Eurasian begging leave to see his mother who happened to be dying some three miles away Only verree verree short leave of absence and will presently return sar the two constables armed with staves bringing up the rear and Faiz Ullah a Mohammedan s contempt for all Hindoos and foreigners in every line of his face explaining to the drivers that though Scott Sahib was a man to be feared on all fours he Faiz Ullah was Authority Itself The procession creaked past Hawkins s camp three stained tents under a clump of dead trees behind them the famine shed where a crowd of hopeless ones tossed their arms around the cooking kettles Wish to Heaven William had kept out of it said Scott to himself after a glance We ll have cholera sure as a gun when the Rains break But William seemed to have taken kindly to the operations of the Famine Code which when famine is declared supersede the workings of the ordinary law Scott saw her the centre of a mob of weeping women in a calico riding habit and a blue grey felt hat with a gold puggaree I want fifty rupees please I forgot to ask Jack before he went away Can you lend it me It s for condensed milk for the babies said she Scott took the money from his belt and handed it over without a word For goodness sake take care of yourself he said Oh I shall be all right We ought to get the milk in two days By the way the orders are I was to tell you that you re to take one of Sir Jim s horses There s a grey Cabuli here that I thought would be just your style so I ve said you d take him Was that right That s awfully good of you We can t either of us talk much about style I am afraid Scott was in a weather stained drill shooting kit very white at the seams and a little frayed at the wrists William regarded him thoughtfully from his pith helmet to his greased ankle boots You look very nice I think Are you sure you ve everything you ll need quinine chlorodyne and so on Think so said Scott patting three or four of his shooting pockets as he mounted and rode alongside his convoy Good bye he cried Good bye and good luck said William I m awfully obliged for the money She turned on a spurred heel and disappeared into the tent while the carts pushed on past the famine sheds past the roaring lines of the thick fat fires down to the baked Gehenna of the South PART II So let us melt and make no noise No tear floods nor sigh tempests move Twere profanation of our joys To tell the Laity our love A Valediction It was punishing work even though he travelled by night and camped by day but within the limits of his vision there was no man whom Scott could call master He was as free as Jimmy Hawkins freer in fact for the Government held the Head of the Famine tied neatly to a telegraph wire and if Jimmy had ever regarded telegrams seriously the death rate of that famine would have been much higher than it was At the end of a few days crawling Scott learned something of the size of the India which he served and it astonished him His carts as you know were loaded with wheat millet and barley good food grains needing only a little grinding But the people to whom he brought the life giving stuffs were rice eaters They could hull rice in their mortars but they knew nothing of the heavy stone querns of the North and less of the material that the white man convoyed so laboriously They clamoured for rice unhusked paddy such as they were accustomed to and when they found that there was none broke away weeping from the sides of the cart What was the use of these strange hard grains that choked their throats They would die And then and there very many of them kept their word Others took their allowance and bartered enough millet to feed a man through a week for a few handfuls of rotten rice saved by some less unfortunate A few put their share into the rice mortars pounded it and made a paste with foul water but they were very few Scott understood dimly that many people in the India of the South ate rice as a rule but he had spent his service in a grain Province had seldom seen rice in the blade or ear and least of all would have believed that in time of deadly need men could die at arm s length of plenty sooner than touch food they did not know In vain the interpreters interpreted in vain his two policemen showed in vigorous pantomime what should be done The starving crept away to their bark and weeds grubs leaves and clay and left the open sacks untouched But sometimes the women laid their phantoms of children at Scott s feet looking back as they staggered away Faiz Ullah opined it was the will of God that these foreigners should die and it remained only to give orders to burn the dead None the less there was no reason why the Sahib should lack his comforts and Faiz Ullah a campaigner of experience had picked up a few lean goats and had added them to the procession That they might give milk for the morning meal he was feeding them on the good grain that these imbeciles rejected Yes said Faiz Ullah if the Sahib thought fit a little milk might be given to some of the babies but as the Sahib well knew babies were cheap and for his own part Faiz Ullah held that there was no Government order as to babies Scott spoke forcefully to Faiz Ullah and the two policemen and bade them capture goats where they could find them This they most joyfully did for it was a recreation and many ownerless goats were driven in Once fed the poor brutes were willing enough to follow the carts and a few days good food food such as human beings died for lack of set them in milk again But I am no goatherd said Faiz Ullah It is against my izzat my honour When we cross the Bias River again we will talk of izzat Scott replied Till that day thou and the policemen shall be sweepers to the camp if I give the order Thus then it is done grunted Faiz Ullah if the Sahib will have it so and he showed how a goat should be milked while Scott stood over him Now we will feed them said Scott twice a day we will feed them and he bowed his back to the milking and took a horrible cramp When you have to keep connection unbroken between a restless mother of kids and a baby who is at the point of death you suffer in all your system But the babies were fed Each morning and evening Scott would solemnly lift them out one by one from their nest of gunny bags under the cart tilts There were always many who could do no more than breathe and the milk was dropped into their toothless mouths drop by drop with due pauses when they choked Each morning too the goats were fed and since they would straggle without a leader and since the natives were hirelings Scott was forced to give up riding and pace slowly at the head of his flocks accommodating his step to their weaknesses All this was sufficiently absurd and he felt the absurdity keenly but at least he was saving life and when the women saw that their children did not die they made shift to eat a little of the strange foods and crawled after the carts blessing the master of the goats Give the women something to live for said Scott to himself as he sneezed in the dust of a hundred little feet and they ll hang on somehow This beats William s condensed milk trick all to pieces I shall never live it down though He reached his destination very slowly found that a rice ship had come in from Burmah and that stores of paddy were available found also an overworked Englishman in charge of the shed and loading the carts set back to cover the ground he had already passed He left some of the children and half his goats at the famine shed For this he was not thanked by the Englishman who had already more stray babies than he knew what to do with Scott s back was suppled to stooping now and he went on with his wayside ministrations in addition to distributing the paddy More babies and more goats were added unto him but now some of the babies wore rags and beads round their wrists or necks That said the interpreter as though Scott did not know signifies that their mothers hope in eventual contingency to resume them offeecially The sooner the better said Scott but at the same time he marked with the pride of ownership how this or that little Ramasawmy was putting on flesh like a bantam As the paddy carts were emptied he headed for Hawkins s camp by the railway timing his arrival to fit in with the dinner hour for it was long since he had eaten at a cloth He had no desire to make any dramatic entry but an accident of the sunset ordered it that when he had taken off his helmet to get the evening breeze the low light should fall across his forehead and he could not see what was before him while one waiting at the tent door beheld with new eyes a young man beautiful as Paris a god in a halo of golden dust walking slowly at the head of his flocks while at his knee ran small naked Cupids But she laughed William in a slate coloured blouse laughed consumedly till Scott putting the best face he could upon the matter halted his armies and bade her admire the kindergarten It was an unseemly sight but the proprieties had been left ages ago with the tea party at Amritsar Station fifteen hundred miles to the north They are coming on nicely said William We ve only five and twenty here now The women are beginning to take them away again Are you in charge of the babies then Yes missus Jim and I We didn t think of goats though We ve been trying condensed milk and water Any losses More than I care to think of said William with a shudder And you Scott said nothing There had been many little burials along his route one cannot burn a dead baby many mothers who had wept when they did not find again the children they had trusted to the care of the Government Then Hawkins came out carrying a razor at which Scott looked hungrily for he had a beard that he did not love And when they sat down to dinner in the tent he told his tale in few words as it might have been an official report missus Jim snuffled from time to time and Jim bowed his head judicially but William s grey eyes were on the clean shaven face and it was to her that Scott seemed to appeal Good for the Pauper Province said William her chin on her hand as she leaned forward among the wine glasses Her cheeks had fallen in and the scar on her forehead was more prominent than ever but the well turned neck rose roundly as a column from the ruffle of the blouse which was the accepted evening dress in camp It was awfully absurd at times said Scott You see I didn t know much about milking or babies They ll chaff my head off if the tale goes up North Let em said William haughtily We ve all done coolie work since we came I know Jack has This was to Hawkins s address and the big man smiled blandly Your brother s a highly efficient officer William said he and I ve done him the honour of treating him as he deserves Remember I write the confidential reports Then you must say that William s worth her weight in gold said missus Jim I don t know what we should have done without her She has been everything to us She dropped her hand upon William s which was rough with much handling of reins and William patted it softly Jim beamed on the company Things were going well with his world Three of his more grossly incompetent men had died and their places had been filled by their betters Every day brought the Rains nearer They had put out the famine in five of the Eight Districts and after all the death rate had not been too heavy things considered He looked Scott over carefully as an ogre looks over a man and rejoiced in his thews and iron hard condition He s just the least bit in the world tucked up said Jim to himself but he can do two men s work yet Then he was aware that missus Jim was telegraphing to him and according to the domestic code the message ran A clear case Look at them He looked and listened All that William was saying was What can you expect of a country where they call a bhistee a water carrier a tunni cutch and all that Scott answered was I shall be glad to get back to the Club Save me a dance at the Christmas Ball won t you It s a far cry from here to the Lawrence Hall said Jim Better turn in early Scott It s paddy carts to morrow you ll begin loading at five Aren t you going to give mister Scott a single day s rest Wish I could Lizzie but I m afraid I can t As long as he can stand up we must use him Well I ve had one Europe evening at least By Jove I d nearly forgotten What do I do about those babies of mine Leave them here said William we are in charge of that and as many goats as you can spare I must learn how to milk now If you care to get up early enough to morrow I ll show you I have to milk you see Half of em have beads and things round their necks You must be careful not to take em off in case the mothers turn up You forget I ve had some experience here I hope to goodness you won t overdo Scott s voice was unguarded I ll take care of her said missus Jim telegraphing hundred word messages as she carried William off while Jim gave Scott his orders for the coming campaign It was very late nearly nine o clock Jim you re a brute said his wife that night and the Head of the Famine chuckled Not a bit of it dear I remember doing the first Jandiala Settlement for the sake of a girl in a crinoline and she was slender Lizzie I ve never done as good a piece of work since He ll work like a demon But you might have given him one day And let things come to a head now No dear it s their happiest time I don t believe either of the darlings know what s the matter with them Isn t it beautiful Isn t it lovely Getting up at three to learn to milk bless her heart Oh ye Gods why must we grow old and fat She s a darling She has done more work under me Under you The day after she came she was in charge and you were her subordinate You ve stayed there ever since she manages you almost as well as you manage me She doesn t and that s why I love her She s as direct as a man as her brother Her brother s weaker than she is He s always to me for orders but he s honest and a glutton for work I confess I m rather fond of William and if I had a daughter The talk ended Far away in the Derajat was a child s grave more than twenty years old and neither Jim nor his wife spoke of it any more All the same you re responsible Jim added a moment s silence Bless em said missus Jim sleepily Before the stars paled Scott who slept in an empty cart waked and went about his work in silence it seemed at that hour unkind to rouse Faiz Ullah and the interpreter His head being close to the ground he did not hear William till she stood over him in the dingy old riding habit her eyes still heavy with sleep a cup of tea and a piece of toast in her hands There was a baby on the ground squirming on a piece of blanket and a six year old child peered over Scott s shoulder Hai you little rip said Scott how the deuce do you expect to get your rations if you aren t quiet A cool white hand steadied the brat who forthwith choked as the milk gurgled into his mouth Mornin said the milker You ve no notion how these little fellows can wriggle Oh yes I have She whispered because the world was asleep Only I feed them with a spoon or a rag Yours are fatter than mine And you ve been doing this day after day The voice was almost lost Yes it was absurd Now you try he said giving place to the girl Look out A goat s not a cow The goat protested against the amateur and there was a scuffle in which Scott snatched up the baby Then it was all to do over again and William laughed softly and merrily She managed however to feed two babies and a third Don t the little beggars take it well said Scott I trained em They were very busy and interested when lo it was broad daylight and before they knew the camp was awake and they kneeled among the goats surprised by the day both flushed to the temples Yet all the round world rolling up out of the darkness might have heard and seen all that had passed between them Oh said William unsteadily snatching up the tea and toast I had this made for you It s stone cold now I thought you mightn t have anything ready so early Better not drink it It s it s stone cold That s awfully kind of you It s just right It s awfully good of you really I ll leave my kids and goats with you and missus Jim and of course any one in camp can show you about the milking Of course said William and she grew pinker and pinker and statelier and more stately as she strode back to her tent fanning herself with the saucer There were shrill lamentations through the camp when the elder children saw their nurse move off without them Faiz Ullah unbent so far as to jest with the policemen and Scott turned purple with shame because Hawkins already in the saddle roared A child escaped from the care of missus Jim and running like a rabbit clung to Scott s boot William pursuing with long easy strides I will not go I will not go shrieked the child twining his feet round Scott s ankle They will kill me here I do not know these people I say said Scott in broken Tamil I say she will do you no harm Go with her and be well fed Come said William panting with a wrathful glance at Scott who stood helpless and as it were hamstrung Go back said Scott quickly to William I ll send the little chap over in a minute The tone of authority had its effect but in a way Scott did not exactly intend The boy loosened his grasp and said with gravity I did not know the woman was thine I will go Then he cried to his companions a mob of three four and five year olds waiting on the success of his venture ere they stampeded Go back and eat It is our man s woman She will obey his orders Jim collapsed where he sat Faiz Ullah and the two policemen grinned and Scott s orders to the cartmen flew like hail That is the custom of the Sahibs when truth is told in their presence said Faiz Ullah The time comes that I must seek new service Young wives especially such as speak our language and have knowledge of the ways of the Police make great trouble for honest butlers in the matter of weekly accounts What William thought of it all she did not say but when her brother ten days later came to camp for orders and heard of Scott s performances he said laughing Well that settles it He ll be Bakri Scott to the end of his days Bakri in the Northern vernacular means a goat What a lark I d have given a month s pay to have seen him nursing famine babies I fed some with conjee rice water but that was all right It s perfectly disgusting said his sister with blazing eyes A man does something like like that and all you other men think of is to give him an absurd nickname and then you laugh and think it s funny Ah said missus Jim sympathetically Well you can t talk William You christened little Miss Demby the Button quail last cold weather you know you did India s the land of nicknames That s different William replied She was only a girl and she hadn t done anything except walk like a quail and she does But it isn t fair to make fun of a man Scott won t care said Martyn You can t get a rise out of old Scotty I ve been trying for eight years and you ve only known him for three How does he look He looks very well said William and went away with a flushed cheek Bakri Scott indeed Then she laughed to herself for she knew her country But it will he Bakri all the same and she repeated it under her breath several times slowly whispering it into favour When he returned to his duties on the railway Martyn spread the name far and wide among his associates so that Scott met it as he led his paddy carts to war The natives believed it to be some English title of honour and the cart drivers used it in all simplicity till Faiz Ullah who did not approve of foreign japes broke their heads There was very little time for milking now except at the big camps where Jim had extended Scott s idea and was feeding large flocks on the useless northern grains Sufficient paddy had come now into the Eight Districts to hold the people safe if it were only distributed quickly and for that purpose no one was better than the big Canal officer who never lost his temper never gave an unnecessary order and never questioned an order given Scott pressed on saving his cattle washing their galled necks daily so that no time should be lost on the road reported himself with his rice at the minor famine sheds unloaded and went back light by forced night march to the next distributing centre to find Hawkins s unvarying telegram Do it again And he did it again and again and yet again while Jim Hawkins fifty miles away marked off on a big map the tracks of his wheels gridironing the stricken lands Others did well Hawkins reported at the end they all did well but Scott was the most excellent for he kept good coined rupees by him settled for his own cart repairs on the spot and ran to meet all sorts of unconsidered extras trusting to be recouped later on Theoretically the Government should have paid for every shoe and linchpin for every hand employed in the loading but Government vouchers cash themselves slowly and intelligent and efficient clerks write at great length contesting unauthorised expenditures of eight annas The man who wants to make his work a success must draw on his own bank account of money or other things as he goes I told you he d work said Jimmy to his wife at the end of six weeks He s been in sole charge of a couple of thousand men up north on the Mosuhl Canal for a year but he gives less trouble than young Martyn with his ten constables and I m morally certain only Government doesn t recognise moral obligations he s spent about half his pay to grease his wheels Look at this Lizzie for one week s work Forty miles in two days with twelve carts two days halt building a famine shed for young Rogers Rogers ought to have built it himself the idiot Then forty miles back again loading six carts on the way and distributing all Sunday Then in the evening he pitches in a twenty page Demi Official to me saying the people where he is might be advantageously employed on relief work and suggesting that he put em to work on some broken down old reservoir he s discovered so as to have a good water supply when the Rains break Thinks he can cauk the dam in a fortnight Look at his marginal sketches aren t they clear and good I knew he was pukka but I didn t know he was as pukka as this I must show these to William said missus Jim The child s wearing herself out among the babies Not more than you are dear Well another two months ought to see us out of the wood I m sorry it s not in my power to recommend you for a V C William sat late in her tent that night reading through page after page of the square handwriting patting the sketches of proposed repairs to the reservoir and wrinkling her eyebrows over the columns of figures of estimated water supply And he finds time to do all this she cried to herself and well I also was present I ve saved one or two babies She dreamed for the twentieth time of the god in the golden dust and woke refreshed to feed loathsome black children scores of them wastrels picked up by the wayside their bones almost breaking their skin terrible and covered with sores Scott was not allowed to leave his cart work but his letter was duly forwarded to the Government and he had the consolation not rare in India of knowing that another man was reaping where he had sown That also was discipline profitable to the soul He s much too good to waste on canals said Jimmy Any one can oversee coolies You needn t be angry William he can but I need my pearl among bullock drivers and I ve transferred him to the Khanda district where he ll have it all to do over again He should be marching now He s not a coolie said William furiously He ought to be doing his regulation work He s the best man in his service and that s saying a good deal but if you must use razors to cut grindstones why I prefer the best cutlery Isn t it almost time we saw him again said missus Jim I m sure the poor boy hasn t had a respectable meal for a month He probably sits on a cart and eats sardines with his fingers All in good time dear Duty before decency wasn t it mister Chucks said that No it was Midshipman Easy William laughed I sometimes wonder how it will feel to dance or listen to a band again or sit under a roof I can t believe I ever wore a ball frock in my life One minute said missus Jim who was thinking If he goes to Khanda he passes within five miles of us Of course he ll ride in Oh no he won t said William How do you know dear It will take him off his work He won t have time He ll make it said missus Jim with a twinkle It depends on his own judgment There s absolutely no reason why he shouldn t if he thinks fit said Jim He won t see fit William replied without sorrow or emotion It wouldn t be him if he did One certainly gets to know people rather well in times like these said Jim drily but William s face was serene as ever and even as she prophesied Scott did not appear The Rains fell at last late but heavily and the dry gashed earth was red mud and servants killed snakes in the camp where every one was weather bound for a fortnight all except Hawkins who took horse and plashed about in the wet rejoicing Now the Government decreed that seed grain should be distributed to the people as well as advances of money for the purchase of new oxen and the white men were doubly worked for this new duty while William skipped from brick to brick laid down on the trampled mud and dosed her charges with warming medicines that made them rub their little round stomachs and the milch goats throve on the rank grass There was never a word from Scott in the Khanda district away to the southeast except the regular telegraphic report to Hawkins The rude country roads had disappeared his drivers were half mutinous one of Martyn s loaned policemen had died of cholera and Scott was taking thirty grains of quinine a day to fight the fever that comes with the rain but those were things Scott did not consider necessary to report He was as usual working from a base of supplies on a railway line to cover a circle of fifteen miles radius and since full loads were impossible he took quarter loads and toiled four times as hard by consequence for he did not choose to risk an epidemic which might have grown uncontrollable by assembling villagers in thousands at the relief sheds It was cheaper to take Government bullocks work them to death and leave them to the crows in the wayside sloughs That was the time when eight years of clean living and hard condition told though a man s head were ringing like a bell from the cinchona and the earth swayed under his feet when he stood and under his bed when he slept If Hawkins had seen fit to make him a bullock driver that he thought was entirely Hawkins s own affair There were men in the North who would know what he had done men of thirty years service in his own department who would say that it was not half bad and above immeasurably above all men of all grades there was William in the thick of the fight who would approve because she understood He had so trained his mind that it would hold fast to the mechanical routine of the day though his own voice sounded strange in his own ears and his hands when he wrote grew large as pillows or small as peas at the end of his wrists That steadfastness bore his body to the telegraph office at the railway station and dictated a telegram to Hawkins saying that the Khanda district was in his judgment now safe and he waited further orders The Madrassee telegraph clerk did not approve of a large gaunt man falling over him in a dead faint not so much because of the weight as because of the names and blows that Faiz Ullah dealt him when he found the body rolled under a bench Then Faiz Ullah took blankets quilts and coverlets where he found them and lay down under them at his master s side and bound his arms with a tent rope and filled him with a horrible stew of herbs and set the policeman to fight him when he wished to escape from the intolerable heat of his coverings and shut the door of the telegraph office to keep out the curious for two nights and one day and when a light engine came down the line and Hawkins kicked in the door Scott hailed him weakly but in a natural voice and Faiz Ullah stood back and took all the credit For two nights Heaven born he was pagal said Faiz Ullah Look at my nose and consider the eye of the policeman He beat us with his bound hands but we sat upon him Heaven born and though his words were tez we sweated him Heaven born never has been such a sweat He is weaker now than a child but the fever has gone out of him by the grace of God There remains only my nose and the eye of the constabeel Sahib shall I ask for my dismissal because my Sahib has beaten me And Faiz Ullah laid his long thin hand carefully on Scott s chest to be sure that the fever was all gone ere he went out to open tinned soups and discourage such as laughed at his swelled nose The district s all right Scott whispered It doesn t make any difference You got my wire I shall be fit in a week Can t understand how it happened I shall be fit in a few days You re coming into camp with us said Hawkins But look here but It s all over except the shouting We sha n t need you Punjabis any more On my honour we sha n t Martyn goes back in a few weeks Arbuthnot s returned already Ellis and Clay are putting the last touches to a new feeder line the Government s built as relief work Morten s dead he was a Bengal man though you wouldn t know him Pon my word you and Will Miss Martyn seem to have come through it as well as anybody Oh how is she by the way The voice went up and down as he spoke Going strong when I left her The Roman Catholic Missions are adopting the unclaimed babies to turn them into little priests the Basil Mission is taking some and the mothers are taking the rest You should hear the little beggars howl when they re sent away from William She s pulled down a bit but so are we all Now when do you suppose you ll be able to move I can t come into camp in this state I won t he replied pettishly Well you are rather a sight but from what I gathered there it seemed to me they d be glad to see you under any conditions I ll look over your work here if you like for a couple of days and you can pull yourself together while Faiz Ullah feeds you up Scott could walk dizzily by the time Hawkins s inspection was ended and he flushed all over when Jim said of his work that it was not half bad and volunteered further that he had considered Scott his right hand man through the famine and would feel it his duty to say as much officially So they came back by rail to the old camp but there were no crowds near it the long fires in the trenches were dead and black and the famine sheds were almost empty You see said Jim There isn t much more to do Better ride up and see the wife They ve pitched a tent for you Dinner s at seven I ve some work here Riding at a foot pace Faiz Ullah by his stirrup Scott came to William in the brown calico riding habit sitting at the dining tent door her hands in her lap white as ashes thin and worn with no lustre in her hair There did not seem to be any missus Jim on the horizon and all that William could say was My word how pulled down you look I ve had a touch of fever You don t look very well yourself Oh I m fit enough We ve stamped it out I suppose you know Scott nodded We shall all be returned in a few weeks Hawkins told me Before Christmas missus Jim says Sha n t you be glad to go back I can smell the wood smoke already William sniffed We shall be in time for all the Christmas doings I don t suppose even the Punjab Government would be base enough to transfer Jack till the new year It seems hundreds of years ago the Punjab and all that doesn t it Are you glad you came Now it s all over yes It has been ghastly here though You know we had to sit still and do nothing and Sir Jim was away so much Do nothing How did you get on with the milking I managed it somehow after you taught me Remember Then the talk stopped with an almost audible jar Still no missus Jim That reminds me I owe you fifty rupees for the condensed milk I thought perhaps you d be coming here when you were transferred to the Khanda district and I could pay you then but you didn t I passed within five miles of the camp but it was in the middle of a march you see and the carts were breaking down every few minutes and I couldn t get em over the ground till ten o clock that night I wanted to come awfully You knew I did didn t you I believe I did said William facing him with level eyes She was no longer white Did you understand Why you didn t ride in Of course I did Why Because you couldn t of course I knew that Did you care If you had come in but I knew you wouldn t but if you had I should have cared a great deal You know I should Thank God I didn t Oh but I wanted to I couldn t trust myself to ride in front of the carts because I kept edging em over here don t you know I knew you wouldn t said William contentedly Here s your fifty Scott bent forward and kissed the hand that held the greasy notes Its fellow patted him awkwardly but very tenderly on the head And you knew too didn t you said William in a new voice No on my honour I didn t I hadn t the the cheek to expect anything of the kind except I say were you out riding anywhere the day I passed by to Khanda William nodded and smiled after the manner of an angel surprised in a good deed Then it was just a speck I saw of your habit in the Palm grove on the Southern cart road I saw your helmet when you came up from the mullah by the temple just enough to be sure that you were all right D you care This time Scott did not kiss her hand for they were in the dusk of the dining tent and because William s knees were trembling under her she had to sit down in the nearest chair where she wept long and happily her head on her arms and when Scott imagined that it would be well to comfort her she needing nothing of the kind she ran to her own tent and Scott went out into the world and smiled upon it largely and idiotically But when Faiz Ullah brought him a drink he found it necessary to support one hand with the other or the good whisky and soda would have been spilled abroad There are fevers and fevers But it was worse much worse the strained eye shirking talk at dinner till the servants had withdrawn and worst of all when missus Jim who had been on the edge of weeping from the soup down kissed Scott and William and they drank one whole bottle of champagne hot because there was no ice and Scott and William sat outside the tent in the starlight till missus Jim drove them in for fear of more fever Apropos of these things and some others William said Being engaged is abominable because you see one has no official position We must be thankful we ve lots of things to do Things to do said Jim when that was reported to him They re neither of them any good any more I can t get five hours work a day out of Scott He s in the clouds half the time Oh but they re so beautiful to watch Jimmy It will break my heart when they go Can t you do anything for him I ve given the Government the impression at least I hope I have that he personally conducted the entire famine But all he wants is to get on to the Luni Canal Works and William s just as bad Have you ever heard em talking of barrage and aprons and waste water It s their style of spooning I suppose missus Jim smiled tenderly Ah that s in the intervals bless em And so Love ran about the camp unrebuked in broad daylight while men picked up the pieces and put them neatly away of the Famine in the Eight Districts Morning brought the penetrating chill of the Northern December the layers of wood smoke the dusty grey blue of the tamarisks the domes of ruined tombs and all the smell of the white Northern plains as the mail train ran on to the mile long Sutlej Bridge William wrapped in a poshteen a silk embroidered sheepskin jacket trimmed with rough astrakhan looked out with moist eyes and nostrils that dilated joyously The South of pagodas and palm trees the overpopulated Hindu South was done with Here was the land she knew and loved and before her lay the good life she understood among folk of her own caste and mind They were picking them up at almost every station now men and women coming in for the Christmas Week with racquets with bundles of polo sticks with dear and bruised cricket bats with fox terriers and saddles The greater part of them wore jackets like William s for the Northern cold is as little to be trifled with as the Northern heat And William was among them and of them her hands deep in her pockets her collar turned up over her ears stamping her feet on the platforms as she walked up and down to get warm visiting from carriage to carriage and everywhere being congratulated Scott was with the bachelors at the far end of the train where they chaffed him mercilessly about feeding babies and milking goats but from time to time he would stroll up to William s window and murmur Good enough isn t it and William would answer with sighs of pure delight Good enough indeed The large open names of the home towns were good to listen to Umballa Ludianah Phillour Jullundur they rang like the coming marriage bells in her ears and William felt deeply and truly sorry for all strangers and outsiders visitors tourists and those fresh caught for the service of the country It was a glorious return and when the bachelors gave the Christmas Ball William was unofficially you might say the chief and honoured guest among the Stewards who could make things very pleasant for their friends She and Scott danced nearly all the dances together and sat out the rest in the big dark gallery overlooking the superb teak floor where the uniforms blazed and the spurs clinked and the new frocks and four hundred dancers went round and round till the draped flags on the pillars flapped and bellied to the whirl of it About midnight half a dozen men who did not care for dancing came over from the Club to play Waits and that was a surprise the Stewards had arranged before any one knew what had happened the band stopped and hidden voices broke into Good King Wenceslaus and William in the gallery hummed and beat time with her foot Mark my footsteps well my page Tread thou in them boldly Thou shalt feel the winter s rage Freeze thy blood less coldly Oh I hope they are going to give us another Isn t it pretty coming out of the dark in that way Look look down There s missus Gregory wiping her eyes It s like Home rather said Scott I remember Hsh Listen dear And it began again When shepherds watched their flocks by night A h h said William drawing closer to Scott All seated on the ground The Angel of the Lord came down And glory shone around Fear not said he for mighty dread Had seized their troubled mind Glad tidings of great joy I bring To you and all mankind This time it was William that wiped her eyes seven A locomotive is next to a marine engine the most sensitive thing man ever made and No seven besides being sensitive was new The red paint was hardly dry on his spotless bumper bar his headlight shone like a fireman s helmet and his cab might have been a hard wood finish parlour They had run him into the round house after his trial he had said good bye to his best friend in the shops the overhead travelling crane the big world was just outside and the other locos were taking stock of him He looked at the semicircle of bold unwinking headlights heard the low purr and mutter of the steam mounting in the gauges scornful hisses of contempt as a slack valve lifted a little and would have given a month s oil for leave to crawl through his own driving wheels into the brick ash pit beneath him seven was an eight wheeled American loco slightly different from others of his type and as he stood he was worth ten thousand dollars on the Company s books But if you had bought him at his own valuation after half an hour s waiting in the darkish echoing round house you would have saved exactly nine thousand nine hundred and ninety nine dollars and ninety eight cents A heavy Mogul freight with a short cow catcher and a fire box that came down within three inches of the rail began the impolite game speaking to a Pittsburgh Consolidation who was visiting Where did this thing blow in from he asked with a dreamy puff of light steam it s all I can do to keep track of our makes was the answer without lookin after your back numbers Guess it s something Peter Cooper left over when he died seven quivered his steam was getting up but he held his tongue Even a hand car knows what sort of locomotive it was that Peter Cooper experimented upon in the far away Thirties It carried its coal and water in two apple barrels and was not much bigger than a bicycle Then up and spoke a small newish switching engine with a little step in front of his bumper timber and his wheels so close together that he looked like a broncho getting ready to buck Something s wrong with the road when a Pennsylvania gravel pusher tells us anything about our stock I think That kid s all right Eustis designed him and Eustis designed me Ain t that good enough seven could have carried the switching loco round the yard in his tender but he felt grateful for even this little word of consolation We don t use hand cars on the Pennsylvania said the Consolidation That er peanut stand is old enough and ugly enough to speak for himself He hasn t bin spoken to yet He s bin spoke at Hain t ye any manners on the Pennsylvania said the switching loco You ought to be in the yard Poney said the Mogul severely We re all long haulers here That s what you think the little fellow replied You ll know more fore the night s out I ve bin down to Track seventeen and the freight there oh Christmas I ve trouble enough in my own division said a lean light suburban loco with very shiny brake shoes My commuters wouldn t rest till they got a parlourcar They ve hitched it back of all and it hauls worsen a snow plough I ll snap her off someday sure and then they ll blame every one except their foolselves They ll be askin me to haul a vestibuled next They made you in New Jersey didn t they said Poney Thought so Commuters and truck wagons ain t any sweet haulin but I tell you they re a heap better n cuttin out refrigerator cars or oil tanks Why I ve hauled Haul You said the Mogul contemptuously It s all you can do to bunt a cold storage car up the yard Now I he paused a little to let the words sink in I handle the Flying Freight e leven cars worth just anything you please to mention On the stroke of eleven I pull out and I m timed for thirty five an hour Costly perishable fragile immediate that s me Suburban traffic s only but one degree better than switching Express freight s what pays Well I ain t given to blowing as a rule began the Pittsburgh Consolidation No You was sent in here because you grunted on the grade Poney interrupted Where I grunt you d lie down Poney but as I was saying I don t blow much Notwithstandin if you want to see freight that is freight moved lively you should see me warbling through the Alleghanies with thirty seven ore cars behind me and my brakemen fightin tramps so s they can t attend to my tooter I have to do all the holdin back then and though I say it I ve never had a load get away from me yet No sir Haulin s s one thing but judgment and discretion s another You want judgment in my business Ah But but are you not paralysed by a sense of your overwhelming responsibilities said a curious husky voice from a corner Who s that seven whispered to the Jersey commuter Compound experiment N G She s bin switchin in the B A yards for six months when she wasn t in the shops She s economical I call it mean in her coal but she takes it out in repairs Ahem I presume you found Boston somewhat isolated madam after your New York season I am never so well occupied as when I am alone The Compound seemed to be talking from half way up her smoke stack Sure said the irreverent Poney under his breath They don t hanker after her any in the yard But with my constitution and temperament my work lies in Boston I find your outrecuidance Outer which said the Mogul freight Simple cylinders are good enough for me Perhaps I should have said faroucherie hissed the Compound I don t hold with any make of papier mache wheel the Mogul insisted The Compound sighed pityingly and said no more Git em all shapes in this world don t ye said Poney that s Mass chusetts all over They half start an then they stick on a dead centre an blame it all on other folk s ways o treatin them Talkin o Boston Comanche told me last night he had a hot box just beyond the Newtons Friday That was why he says the Accommodation was held up Made out no end of a tale Comanche did If I d heard that in the shops with my boiler out for repairs I d know t was one o Comanche s lies the New Jersey commuter snapped Hot box Him What happened was they d put an extra car on and he just lay down on the grade and squealed They had to send one hundred twenty seven to help him through Made it out a hotbox did he Time before that he said he was ditched Looked me square in the headlight and told me that as cool as as a water tank in a cold wave Hot box You ask one hundred twenty seven about Comanche s hot box Why Comanche he was side tracked and one hundred twenty seven he was just about as mad as they make em on account o being called out at ten o clock at night took hold and snapped her into Boston in seventeen minutes Hot box Hot fraud that s what Comanche is Then seven put both drivers and his pilot into it as the saying is for he asked what sort of thing a hot box might be Paint my bell sky blue said Poney the switcher Make me a surface railroad loco with a hard wood skirtin board round my wheels Break me up and cast me into five cent sidewalk fakirs mechanical toys Here s an eight wheel coupled American don t know what a hot box is Never heard of an emergency stop either did ye Don t know what ye carry jack screws for You re too innocent to be left alone with your own tender Oh you you flatcar There was a roar of escaping steam before any one could answer and seven nearly blistered his paint off with pure mortification A hot box began the Compound picking and choosing her words as though they were coal a hotbox is the penalty exacted from inexperience by haste Ahem Hot box said the Jersey Suburban It s the price you pay for going on the tear It s years since I ve had one It s a disease that don t attack shorthaulers as a rule We never have hot boxes on the Pennsylvania said the Consolidation They get em in New York same as nervous prostration Ah go home on a ferry boat said the Mogul You think because you use worse grades than our road u d allow you re a kind of Alleghany angel Now I ll tell you what you Here s my folk Well I can t stop See you later perhaps He rolled forward majestically to the turn table and swung like a man of war in a tideway till he picked up his track But as for you you pea green swiveling coffee pot this to seven you go out and learn something before you associate with those who ve made more mileage in a week than you ll roll up in a year Costly perishable fragile immediate that s me S long Split my tubes if that s actin polite to a new member o the Brotherhood said Poney There wasn t any call to trample on ye like that But manners was left out when Moguls was made Keep up your fire kid an burn your own smoke Guess we ll all be wanted in a minute Men were talking rather excitedly in the roundhouse One man in a dingy jersey said that he hadn t any locomotives to waste on the yard Another man with a piece of crumpled paper in his hand said that the yard master said that he was to say that if the other man said anything he the other man was to shut his head Then the other man waved his arms and wanted to know if he was expected to keep locomotives in his hip pocket Then a man in a black Prince Albert without a collar came up dripping for it was a hot August night and said that what he said went and between the three of them the locomotives began to go too first the Compound then the Consolidation then seven Now deep down in his fire box seven had cherished a hope that as soon as his trial was done he would be led forth with songs and shoutings and attached to a green and chocolate vestibuled flyer under charge of a bold and noble engineer who would pat him on his back and weep over him and call him his Arab steed The boys in the shops where he was built used to read wonderful stories of railroad life and seven expected things to happen as he had heard But there did not seem to be many vestibuled fliers in the roaring rumbling electric lighted yards and his engineer only said Now what sort of a fool sort of an injector has Eustis loaded on to this rig this time And he put the lever over with an angry snap crying Am I supposed to switch with this thing hey The collarless man mopped his head and replied that in the present state of the yard and freight and a few other things the engineer would switch and keep on switching till the cows came home seven pushed out gingerly his heart in his headlight so nervous that the clang of his own bell almost made him jump the track Lanterns waved or danced up and down before and behind him and on every side six tracks deep sliding backward and forward with clashings of couplers and squeals of hand brakes were cars more cars than seven had dreamed of There were oil cars and hay cars and stock cars full of lowing beasts and ore cars and potato cars with stovepipe ends sticking out in the middle cold storage and refrigerator cars dripping ice water on the tracks ventilated fruit and milk cars flatcars with truck wagons full of market stuff flat cars loaded with reapers and binders all red and green and gilt under the sizzling electric lights flat cars piled high with strong scented hides pleasant hemlock plank or bundles of shingles flat cars creaking to the weight of thirty ton castings angle irons and rivet boxes for some new bridge and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of box cars loaded locked and chalked Men hot and angry crawled among and between and under the thousand wheels men took flying jumps through his cab when he halted for a moment men sat on his pilot as he went forward and on his tender as he returned and regiments of men ran along the tops of the box cars beside him screwing down brakes waving their arms and crying curious things He was pushed forward a foot at a time whirled backward his rear drivers clinking and clanking a quarter of a mile jerked into a switch yard switches are very stubby and unaccommodating bunted into a Red D or Merchant s Transport car and with no hint or knowledge of the weight behind him started up anew When his load was fairly on the move three or four cars would be cut off and seven would bound forward only to be held hiccupping on the brake Then he would wait a few minutes watching the whirled lanterns deafened with the clang of the bells giddy with the vision of the sliding cars his brake pump panting forty to the minute his front coupler lying sideways on his cow catcher like a tired dog s tongue in his mouth and the whole of him covered with half burnt coal dust Tisn t so easy switching with a straight backed tender said his little friend of the round house bustling by at a trot But you re comin on pretty fair Ever seen a flyin switch No Then watch me Poney was in charge of a dozen heavy flat cars Suddenly he shot away from them with a sharp Whutt A switch opened in the shadows ahead he turned up it like a rabbit as it snapped behind him and the long line of twelve foot high lumber jolted on into the arms of a full sized road loco who acknowledged receipt with a dry howl My man s reckoned the smartest in the yard at that trick he said returning Gives me cold shivers when another fool tries it though That s where my short wheel base comes in Like as not you d have your tender scraped off if you tried it seven had no ambitions that way and said so No Of course this ain t your regular business but say don t you think it s interestin Have you seen the yard master Well he s the greatest man on earth an don t you forget it When are we through Why kid it s always like this day an night Sundays an week days See that thirty car freight slidin in four no five tracks off She s all mixed freight sent here to be sorted out into straight trains That s why we re cuttin out the cars one by one He gave a vigorous push to a west bound car as he spoke and started back with a little snort of surprise for the car was an old friend an M T K box car Jack my drivers but it s Homeless Kate Why Kate ain t there no gettin you back to your friends There s forty chasers out for you from your road if there s one Who s holdin you now Wish I knew whimpered Homeless Kate I belong in Topeka but I ve bin to Cedar Rapids I ve bin to Winnipeg I ve bin to Newport News I ve bin all down the old Atlanta and West Point an I ve bin to Buffalo Maybe I ll fetch up at Haverstraw I ve only bin out ten months but I m homesick I m just achin homesick Try Chicago Katie said the switching loco and the battered old car lumbered down the track jolting I want to be in Kansas when the sunflowers bloom Yard s full o Homeless Kates an Wanderin Willies he explained to seven I knew an old Fitchburg flat car out seventeen months an one of ours was gone fifteen fore ever we got track of her Dunno quite how our men fix it Swap around I guess Anyway I ve done my duty She s on her way to Kansas via Chicago but I ll lay my next boilerful she ll be held there to wait consignee s convenience and sent back to us with wheat in the fall Just then the Pittsburgh Consolidation passed at the head of a dozen cars I m goin home he said proudly Can t get all them twelve on to the flat Break em in half Dutchy cried Poney But it was seven who was backed down to the last six cars and he nearly blew up with surprise when he found himself pushing them on to a huge ferry boat He had never seen deep water before and shivered as the flat drew away and left his bogies within six inches of the black shiny tide After this he was hurried to the freight house where he saw the yard master a smallish white faced man in shirt trousers and slippers looking down upon a sea of trucks a mob of bawling truckmen and squadrons of backing turning sweating spark striking horses That s shippers carts loadin on to the receivin trucks said the small engine reverently But he don t care He lets em cuss He s the Czar King Boss He says Please and then they kneel down an pray There s three or four strings o today s freight to be pulled before he can attend to them When he waves his hand that way things happen A string of loaded cars slid out down the track and a string of empties took their place Bales crates boxes jars carboys frails cases and packages flew into them from the freight house as though the cars had been magnets and they iron filings Ki yah shrieked little Poney Ain t it great A purple faced truckman shouldered his way to the yard master and shook his fist under his nose The yard master never looked up from his bundle of freight receipts He crooked his forefinger slightly and a tall young man in a red shirt lounging carelessly beside him hit the truckman under the left ear so that he dropped quivering and clucking on a hay bale Eleven seven ninety seven L Y S fourteen ought ought three nineteen thirteen one one four seventeen ought twenty one M B and the ten westbound All straight except the two last Cut em off at the junction An that s all right Pull that string The yard master with mild blue eyes looked out over the howling truckmen at the waters in the moonlight beyond and hummed All things bright and beautiful All creatures great and small All things wise and wonderful The Lawd Gawd He made all seven moved out the cars and delivered them to the regular road engine He had never felt quite so limp in his life before Curious ain t it said Poney puffing on the next track You an me if we got that man under our bumpers we d work him into red waste an not know what we d done but up there with the steam hummin in his boiler that awful quiet way I know said seven Makes me feel as if I d dropped my Fire an was getting cold He is the greatest man on earth They were at the far north end of the yard now under a switchtower looking down on the four track way of the main traffic The Boston Compound was to haul seven s string to some far away northern junction over an indifferent road bed and she mourned aloud for the ninety six pound rails of the B A You re young you re young she coughed You don t realise your responsibilities Yes he does said Poney sharply but he don t lie down under em Then with aside spurt of steam exactly like a tough spitting There ain t more than fifteen thousand dollars worth o freight behind her anyway and she goes on as if t were a hundred thousand same as the Mogul s Excuse me madam but you ve the track She s stuck on a dead centre again bein specially designed not to The Compound crawled across the tracks on a long slant groaning horribly at each switch and moving like a cow in a snow drift There was a little pause along the yard after her tail lights had disappeared switches locked crisply and every one seemed to be waiting Now I ll show you something worth said Poney When the Purple Emperor ain t on time it s about time to amend the Constitution The first stroke of twelve is Boom went the clock in the big yard tower and far away seven heard a full vibrating Yah Yah Yah A headlight twinkled on the horizon like a star grew an overpowering blaze and whooped up the humming track to the roaring music of a happy giant s song With a michnai ghignai shtingal Yah Yah Yah Ein zwei drei Mutter Yah Yah Yah She climb upon der shteeple Und she frighten all der people Singin michnai ghignai shtingal Yah Yah The last defiant yah yah was delivered a mile and a half beyond the passenger depot but seven had caught one glimpse of the superb six wheel coupled racing locomotive who hauled the pride and glory of the road the gilt edged Purple Emperor the millionaires south bound express laying the miles over his shoulder as a man peels a shaving from a soft board The rest was a blur of maroon enamel a bar of white light from the electrics in the cars and a flicker of nickel plated hand rail on the rear platform Ooh said seven Seventy five miles an hour these five miles Baths I ve heard barber s shop ticker and a library and the rest to match Yes sir seventy five an hour But he ll talk to you in the round house just as democratic as I would And I cuss my wheel base I d kick clean off the track at half his gait He s the Master of our Lodge Cleans up at our house I ll introdooce you some day He s worth knowin There ain t many can sing that song either seven was too full of emotions to answer He did not hear a raging of telephone bells in the switch tower nor the man as he leaned out and called to seven s engineer Got any steam Nough to run her a hundred mile out o this if I could said the engineer who belonged to the open road and hated switching Then get The Flying Freight s ditched forty mile out with fifty rod o track ploughed up No no one s hurt but both tracks are blocked Lucky the wreckin car an derrick are this end of the yard Crew ll be along in a minute Hurry You ve the track Well I could jest kick my little sawed off self said Poney as seven was backed with a bang on to a grim and grimy car like a caboose but full of tools a flatcar and a derrick behind it Some folks are one thing and some are another but you re in luck kid They push a wrecking car Now don t get rattled Your wheel base will keep you on the track and there ain t any curves worth mentionin Oh say Comanche told me there s one section o sawedged track that s liable to jounce ye a little Fifteen an a half out after the grade at Jackson s crossin You ll know it by a farmhouse an a windmill an five maples in the dooryard Windmill s west o the maples An there s an eighty foot iron bridge in the middle o that section with no guard rails See you later Luck Before he knew well what had happened seven was flying up the track into the dumb dark world Then fears of the night beset him He remembered all he had ever heard of landslides rain piled boulders blown trees and strayed cattle all that the Boston Compound had ever said of responsibility and a great deal more that came out of his own head With a very quavering voice he whistled for his first grade crossing an event in the life of a locomotive and his nerves were in no way restored by the sight of a frantic horse and a white faced man in a buggy less than a yard from his right shoulder Then he was sure he would jump the track felt his flanges mounting the rail at every curve knew that his first grade would make him lie down even as Comanche had done at the Newtons He whirled down the grade to Jackson s crossing saw the windmill west of the maples felt the badly laid rails spring under him and sweated big drops all over his boiler At each jarring bump he believed an axle had smashed and he took the eighty foot bridge without the guard rail like a hunted cat on the top of a fence Then a wet leaf stuck against the glass of his headlight and threw a flying shadow on the track so that he thought it was some little dancing animal that would feel soft if he ran over it and anything soft underfoot frightens a locomotive as it does an elephant But the men behind seemed quite calm The wrecking crew were climbing carelessly from the caboose to the tender even jesting with the engineer for he heard a shuffling of feet among the coal and the snatch of a song something like this Oh the Empire State must learn to wait And the Cannon ball go hang When the West bound s ditched and the tool car s hitched And it s way for the Breakdown Gang Tare ra Way for the Breakdown Gang Say Eustis knew what he was doin when he designed this rig She s a hummer New too Snff Phew She is new That ain t paint that s A burning pain shot through seven s right rear driver a crippling stinging pain This said seven as he flew is a hot box Now I know what it means I shall go to pieces I guess My first road run too Het a bit ain t she the fireman ventured to suggest to the engineer She ll hold for all we want of her We re most there Guess you chaps back had better climb into your car said the engineer his hand on the brake lever I ve seen men snapped off But the crew fled back with laughter They had no wish to be jerked on to the track The engineer half turned his wrist and seven found his drivers pinned firm Now it s come said seven as he yelled aloud and slid like a sleigh For the moment he fancied that he would jerk bodily from off his underpinning That must be the emergency stop that Poney guyed me about he gasped as soon as he could think Hot box emergency stop They both hurt but now I can talk back in the round house He was halted all hissing hot a few feet in the rear of what doctors would call a compound comminuted car His engineer was kneeling down among his drivers but he did not call seven his Arab steed nor cry over him as the engineers did in the newspapers He just bad worded seven and pulled yards of charred cotton waste from about the axles and hoped he might some day catch the idiot who had packed it Nobody else attended to him for Evans the Mogul s engineer a little cut about the head but very angry was exhibiting by lantern light the mangled corpse of a slim blue pig T were n t even a decent sized hog he said T were a shote Dangerousest beasts they are said one of the crew Get under the pilot an sort o twiddle ye off the track don t they Don t they roared Evans who was a red headed Welshman You talk as if I was ditched by a hog every fool day o the week I ain t friends with all the cussed half fed shotes in the State o New York No indeed Yes this is him an look what he s done It was not a bad night s work for one stray piglet The Flying Freight seemed to have flown in every direction for the Mogul had mounted the rails and run diagonally a few hundred feet from right to left taking with him such cars as cared to follow Some did not They broke their couplers and lay down while rear cars frolicked over them In that game they had ploughed up and removed and twisted a good deal of the left hand track The Mogul himself had waddled into a corn field and there he knelt fantastic wreaths of green twisted round his crankpins his pilot covered with solid clods of field on which corn nodded drunkenly his fire put out with dirt Evans had done that as soon as he recovered his senses and his broken headlight half full of half burnt moths His tender had thrown coal all over him and he looked like a disreputable buffalo who had tried to wallow in a general store For there lay scattered over the landscape from the burst cars type writers sewing machines bicycles in crates a consignment of silver plated imported harness French dresses and gloves a dozen finely moulded hard wood mantels a fifteen foot naphtha launch with a solid brass bedstead crumpled around her bows a case of telescopes and microscopes two coffins a case of very best candies some gilt edged dairy produce butter and eggs in an omelette a broken box of expensive toys and a few hundred other luxuries A camp of tramps hurried up from nowhere and generously volunteered to help the crew So the brakemen armed with coupler pins walked up and down on one side and the freight conductor and the fireman patrolled the other with their hands in their hip pockets A long bearded man came out of a house beyond the corn field and told Evans that if the accident had happened a little later in the year all his corn would have been burned and accused Evans of carelessness Then he ran away for Evans was at his heels shrieking T was his hog done it his hog done it Let me kill him Let me kill him Then the wrecking crew laughed and the farmer put his head out of a window and said that Evans was no gentleman But seven was very sober He had never seen a wreck before and it frightened him The crew still laughed but they worked at the same time and seven forgot horror in amazement at the way they handled the Mogul freight They dug round him with spades they put ties in front of his wheels and jack screws under him they embraced him with the derrick chain and tickled him with crowbars while seven was hitched on to wrecked cars and backed away till the knot broke or the cars rolled clear of the track By dawn thirty or forty men were at work replacing and ramming down the ties gauging the rails and spiking them By daylight all cars who could move had gone on in charge of another loco the track was freed for traffic and seven had hauled the old Mogul over a small pavement of ties inch by inch till his flanges bit the rail once more and he settled down with a clank But his spirit was broken and his nerve was gone T weren t even a hog he repeated dolefully t were a shote and you you of all of em had to help me on But how in the whole long road did it happen asked seven sizzling with curiosity Happen It didn t happen It just come I sailed right on top of him around that last curve thought he was a skunk Yes he was all as little as that He hadn t more n squealed once fore I felt my bogies lift he d rolled right under the pilot and I couldn t catch the track again to save me Swivelled clean off I was Then I felt him sling himself along all greasy under my left leadin driver and oh Boilers that mounted the rail I heard my flanges zippin along the ties an the next I knew I was playin Sally Sally Waters in the corn my tender shuckin coal through my cab an old man Evans lyin still an bleedin in front o me Shook There ain t a stay or a bolt or a rivet in me that ain t sprung to glory somewhere Umm said seven What d you reckon you weigh Without these lumps o dirt I m all of a hundred thousand pound And the shote Eighty Call him a hundred pound at the outside He s worth about four n a half dollars Ain t it awful Ain t it enough to give you nervous prostration Ain t it paralysin Why I come just around that curve and the Mogul told the tale again for he was very badly shaken Well it s all in the day s run I guess said seven soothingly an an a corn field s pretty soft fallin If it had bin a sixty foot bridge an I could ha slid off into deep water an blown up an killed both men same as others have done I wouldn t ha cared but to be ditched by a shote an you to help me out in a corn field an an old hayseed in his nightgown cussin me like as if I was a sick truck horse Oh it s awful Don t call me Mogul I m a sewin machine they ll guy my sand box off in the yard And seven his hot box cooled and his experience vastly enlarged hauled the Mogul freight slowly to the roundhouse Hello old man Bin out all night hain t ye said the irrepressible Poney who had just come off duty Well I must say you look it Costly perishable fragile immediate that s you Go to the shops take them vine leaves out o your hair an git em to play the hose on you Leave him alone Poney said seven severely as he was swung on the turn table or I ll Didn t know the old granger was any special friend o yours kid He wasn t over civil to you last time I saw him I know it but I ve seen a wreck since then and it has about scared the paint off me I m not going to guy anyone as long as I steam not when they re new to the business an anxious to learn And I m not goin to guy the old Mogul either though I did find him wreathed around with roastin ears T was a little bit of a shote not a hog just a shote Poney no bigger n a lump of anthracite I saw it that made all the mess Anybody can be ditched I guess Found that out already have you Well that s a good beginnin It was the Purple Emperor with his high tight plate glass cab and green velvet cushion waiting to be cleaned for his next day s fly Let me make you two general lemen acquainted said Poney This is our Purple Emperor kid whom you were admirin and I may say envyin last night This is a new brother worshipful sir with most of his mileage ahead of him but so far as a serving brother can I ll answer for him Happy to meet you said the Purple Emperor with a glance round the crowded round house I guess there are enough of us here to form a full meetin Ahem By virtue of the authority vested in me as Head of the Road I hereby declare and pronounce No seven a full and accepted Brother of the Amalgamated Brotherhood of Locomotives and as such entitled to all shop switch track tank and round house privileges throughout my jurisdiction in the Degree of Superior Flier it bein well known and credibly reported to me that our Brother has covered forty one miles in thirty nine minutes and a half on an errand of mercy to the afflicted At a convenient time I myself will communicate to you the Song and Signal of this Degree whereby you may be recognised in the darkest night Take your stall newly entered Brother among Locomotives Now in the darkest night even as the Purple Emperor said if you will stand on the bridge across the freightyard looking down upon the four track way at two thirty A M neither before nor after when the White Moth that takes the overflow from the Purple Emperor tears south with her seven vestibuled cream white cars you will hear as the yard clock makes the half hour a far away sound like the bass of a violoncello and then a hundred feet to each word With a michnai ghignai shtingal Yah Yah Yah Ein zwei drei Mutter Yah Yah Yah She climb upon der shteeple Und she frighten all der people Singin michnai ghignai shtingal Yah Yah That is seven covering his one hundred and fifty six miles in two hundred and twenty one minutes THE MALTESE CAT They had good reason to be proud and better reason to be afraid all twelve of them for though they had fought their way game by game up the teams entered for the polo tournament they were meeting the Archangels that afternoon in the final match and the Archangels men were playing with half a dozen ponies apiece As the game was divided into six quarters of eight minutes each that meant a fresh pony after every halt The Skidars team even supposing there were no accidents could only supply one pony for every other change and two to one is heavy odds Again as Shiraz the grey Syrian pointed out they were meeting the pink and pick of the polo ponies of Upper India ponies that had cost from a thousand rupees each while they themselves were a cheap lot gathered often from country carts by their masters who belonged to a poor but honest native infantry regiment Money means pace and weight said Shiraz rubbing his black silk nose dolefully along his neat fitting boot and by the maxims of the game as I know it Ah but we aren t playing the maxims said The Maltese Cat We re playing the game and we ve the great advantage of knowing the game Just think a stride Shiraz We ve pulled up from bottom to second place in two weeks against all those fellows on the ground here That s because we play with our heads as well as our feet It makes me feel undersized and unhappy all the same said Kittiwynk a mouse coloured mare with a red brow band and the cleanest pair of legs that ever an aged pony owned They ve twice our style these others Kittiwynk looked at the gathering and sighed The hard dusty polo ground was lined with thousands of soldiers black and white not counting hundreds and hundreds of carriages and drags and dogcarts and ladies with brilliant coloured parasols and officers in uniform and out of it and crowds of natives behind them and orderlies on camels who had halted to watch the game instead of carrying letters up and down the station and native horse dealers running about on thin eared Biluchi mares looking for a chance to sell a few first class polo ponies Then there were the ponies of thirty teams that had entered for the Upper India Free for All Cup nearly every pony of worth and dignity from Mhow to Peshawar from Allahabad to Multan prize ponies Arabs Syrian Barb country bred Deccanee Waziri and Kabul ponies of every colour and shape and temper that you could imagine Some of them were in mat roofed stables close to the polo ground but most were under saddle while their masters who had been defeated in the earlier games trotted in and out and told the world exactly how the game should be played It was a glorious sight and the come and go of the little quick hooves and the incessant salutations of ponies that had met before on other polo grounds or race courses were enough to drive a four footed thing wild But the Skidars team were careful not to know their neighbours though half the ponies on the ground were anxious to scrape acquaintance with the little fellows that had come from the North and so far had swept the board Let s see said a soft gold coloured Arab who had been playing very badly the day before to The Maltese Cat didn t we meet in Abdul Rahman s stable in Bombay four seasons ago I won the Paikpattan Cup next season you may remember Not me said The Maltese Cat politely I was at Malta then pulling a vegetable cart I don t race I play the game Oh said the Arab cocking his tail and swaggering off Keep yourselves to yourselves said The Maltese Cat to his companions We don t want to rub noses with all those goose rumped half breeds of Upper India When we ve won this Cup they ll give their shoes to know us We sha n t win the Cup said Shiraz How do you feel Stale as last night s feed when a muskrat has run over it said Polaris a rather heavy shouldered grey and the rest of the team agreed with him The sooner you forget that the better said The Maltese Cat cheerfully They ve finished tiffin in the big tent We shall be wanted now If your saddles are not comfy kick If your bits aren t easy rear and let the saises know whether your boots are tight Each pony had his sais his groom who lived and ate and slept with the animal and had betted a good deal more than he could afford on the result of the game There was no chance of anything going wrong but to make sure each sais was shampooing the legs of his pony to the last minute Behind the saises sat as many of the Skidars regiment as had leave to attend the match about half the native officers and a hundred or two dark black bearded men with the regimental pipers nervously fingering the big beribboned bagpipes The Skidars were what they call a Pioneer regiment and the bagpipes made the national music of half their men The native officers held bundles of polo sticks long cane handled mallets and as the grand stand filled after lunch they arranged themselves by ones and twos at different points round the ground so that if a stick were broken the player would not have far to ride for a new one An impatient British Cavalry Band struck up If you want to know the time ask a p leeceman and the two umpires in light dust coats danced out on two little excited ponies The four players of the Archangels team followed and the sight of their beautiful mounts made Shiraz groan again Wait till we know said The Maltese Cat Two of em are playing in blinkers and that means they can t see to get out of the way of their own side or they may shy at the umpires ponies They ve all got white web reins that are sure to stretch or slip And said Kittiwynk dancing to take the stiffness out of her they carry their whips in their hands instead of on their wrists Hah True enough No man can manage his stick and his reins and his whip that way said The Maltese Cat I ve fallen over every square yard of the Malta ground and I ought to know He quivered his little flea bitten withers just to show how satisfied he felt but his heart was not so light Ever since he had drifted into India on a troop ship taken with an old rifle as part payment for a racing debt The Maltese Cat had played and preached polo to the Skidars team on the Skidars stony pologround Now a polo pony is like a poet If he is born with a love for the game he can be made The Maltese Cat knew that bamboos grew solely in order that poloballs might be turned from their roots that grain was given to ponies to keep them in hard condition and that ponies were shod to prevent them slipping on a turn But besides all these things he knew every trick and device of the finest game in the world and for two seasons had been teaching the others all he knew or guessed Remember he said for the hundredth time as the riders came up you must play together and you must play with your heads Whatever happens follow the ball Who goes out first Kittiwynk Shiraz Polaris and a short high little bay fellow with tremendous hocks and no withers worth speaking of he was called Corks were being girthed up and the soldiers in the background stared with all their eyes I want you men to keep quiet said Lutyens the captain of the team and especially not to blow your pipes Not if we win Captain Sahib asked the piper If we win you can do what you please said Lutyens with a smile as he slipped the loop of his stick over his wrist and wheeled to canter to his place The Archangels ponies were a little bit above themselves on account of the many coloured crowd so close to the ground Their riders were excellent players but they were a team of crack players instead of a crack team and that made all the difference in the world They honestly meant to play together but it is very hard for four men each the best of the team he is picked from to remember that in polo no brilliancy in hitting or riding makes up for playing alone Their captain shouted his orders to them by name and it is a curious thing that if you call his name aloud in public after an Englishman you make him hot and fretty Lutyens said nothing to his men because it had all been said before He pulled up Shiraz for he was playing back to guard the goal Powell on Polaris was half back and Macnamara and Hughes on Corks and Kittiwynk were forwards The tough bamboo ball was set in the middle of the ground one hundred and fifty yards from the ends and Hughes crossed sticks heads up with the Captain of the Archangels who saw fit to play forward that is a place from which you cannot easily control your team The little click as the cane shafts met was heard all over the ground and then Hughes made some sort of quick wrist stroke that just dribbled the ball a few yards Kittiwynk knew that stroke of old and followed as a cat follows a mouse While the Captain of the Archangels was wrenching his pony round Hughes struck with all his strength and next instant Kittiwynk was away Corks following close behind her their little feet pattering like raindrops on glass Pull out to the left said Kittiwynk between her teeth it s coming your way Corks The back and half back of the Archangels were tearing down on her just as she was within reach of the ball Hughes leaned forward with a loose rein and cut it away to the left almost under Kittiwynk s foot and it hopped and skipped off to Corks who saw that if he was not quick it would run beyond the boundaries That long bouncing drive gave the Archangels time to wheel and send three men across the ground to head off Corks Kittiwynk stayed where she was for she knew the game Corks was on the ball half a fraction of a second before the others came up and Macnamara with a backhanded stroke sent it back across the ground to Hughes who saw the way clear to the Archangels goal and smacked the ball in before any one quite knew what had happened That s luck said Corks as they changed ends A goal in three minutes for three hits and no riding to speak of Don t know said Polaris We ve made em angry too soon Shouldn t wonder if they tried to rush us off our feet next time Keep the ball hanging then said Shiraz That wears out every pony that is not used to it Next time there was no easy galloping across the ground All the Archangels closed up as one man but there they stayed for Corks Kittiwynk and Polaris were somewhere on the top of the ball marking time among the rattling sticks while Shiraz circled about outside waiting for a chance We can do this all day said Polaris ramming his quarters into the side of another pony Where do you think you re shoving to I ll I ll be driven in an ekka if I know was the gasping reply and I d give a week s feed to get my blinkers off I can t see anything The dust is rather bad Whew That was one for my off hock Where s the ball Corks Under my tail At least the man s looking for it there This is beautiful They can t use their sticks and it s driving em wild Give old Blinkers a push and then he ll go over Here don t touch me I can t see I ll I ll back out I think said the pony in blinkers who knew that if you can t see all round your head you cannot prop yourself against the shock Corks was watching the ball where it lay in the dust close to his near fore leg with Macnamara s shortened stick tap tapping it from time to time Kittiwynk was edging her way out of the scrimmage whisking her stump of a tail with nervous excitement Ho They ve got it she snorted Let me out and she galloped like a rifle bullet just behind a tall lanky pony of the Archangels whose rider was swinging up his stick for a stroke Not to day thank you said Hughes as the blow slid off his raised stick and Kittiwynk laid her shoulder to the tall pony s quarters and shoved him aside just as Lutyens on Shiraz sent the ball where it had come from and the tall pony went skating and slipping away to the left Kittiwynk seeing that Polaris had joined Corks in the chase for the ball up the ground dropped into Polaris place and then time was called The Skidars ponies wasted no time in kicking or fuming They knew that each minute s rest meant so much gain and trotted off to the rails and their saises began to scrape and blanket and rub them at once Whew said Corks stiffening up to get all the tickle of the big vulcanite scraper If we were playing pony for pony we would bend those Archangels double in half an hour But they ll bring up fresh ones and fresh ones and fresh ones after that you see Who cares said Polaris We ve drawn first blood Is my hock swelling Looks puffy said Corks You must have had rather a wipe Don t let it stiffen You ll be wanted again in half an hour What s the game like said The Maltese Cat Ground s like your shoe except where they put too much water on it said Kittiwynk Then it s slippery Don t play in the centre There s a bog there I don t know how their next four are going to behave but we kept the ball hanging and made em lather for nothing Who goes out Two Arabs and a couple of country breds That s bad What a comfort it is to wash your mouth out Kitty was talking with a neck of a lather covered soda water bottle between her teeth and trying to look over her withers at the same time This gave her a very coquettish air What s bad said Grey Dawn giving to the girth and admiring his well set shoulders You Arabs can t gallop fast enough to keep yourselves warm that s what Kitty means said Polaris limping to show that his hock needed attention Are you playing back Grey Dawn Looks like it said Grey Dawn as Lutyens swung himself up Powell mounted The Rabbit a plain bay country bred much like Corks but with mulish ears Macnamara took Faiz Ullah a handy short backed little red Arab with a long tail and Hughes mounted Benami an old and sullen brown beast who stood over in front more than a polo pony should Benami looks like business said Shiraz How s your temper Ben The old campaigner hobbled off without answering and The Maltese Cat looked at the new Archangel ponies prancing about on the ground They were four beautiful blacks and they saddled big enough and strong enough to eat the Skidars team and gallop away with the meal inside them Blinkers again said The Maltese Cat Good enough They re chargers cavalry chargers said Kittiwynk indignantly They ll never see thirteen three again They ve all been fairly measured and they ve all got their certificates said The Maltese Cat or they wouldn t be here We must take things as they come along and keep your eyes on the ball The game began but this time the Skidars were penned to their own end of the ground and the watching ponies did not approve of that Faiz Ullah is shirking as usual said Polaris with a scornful grunt Faiz Ullah is eating whip said Corks They could hear the leather thonged polo quirt lacing the little fellow s well rounded barrel Then The Rabbit s shrill neigh came across the ground I can t do all the work he cried desperately Play the game don t talk The Maltese Cat whickered and all the ponies wriggled with excitement and the soldiers and the grooms gripped the railings and shouted A black pony with blinkers had singled out old Benami and was interfering with him in every possible way They could see Benami shaking his head up and down and flapping his under lip There ll be a fall in a minute said Polaris Benami is getting stuffy The game flickered up and down between goal post and goal post and the black ponies were getting more confident as they felt they had the legs of the others The ball was hit out of a little scrimmage and Benami and The Rabbit followed it Faiz Ullah only too glad to be quiet for an instant The blinkered black pony came up like a hawk with two of his own side behind him and Benami s eye glittered as he raced The question was which pony should make way for the other for each rider was perfectly willing to risk a fall in a good cause The black who had been driven nearly crazy by his blinkers trusted to his weight and his temper but Benami knew how to apply his weight and how to keep his temper They met and there was a cloud of dust The black was lying on his side all the breath knocked out of his body The Rabbit was a hundred yards up the ground with the ball and Benami was sitting down He had slid nearly ten yards on his tail but he had had his revenge and sat cracking his nostrils till the black pony rose That s what you get for interfering Do you want any more said Benami and he plunged into the game Nothing was done that quarter because Faiz Ullah would not gallop though Macnamara beat him whenever he could spare a second The fall of the black pony had impressed his companions tremendously and so the Archangels could not profit by Faiz Ullah s bad behaviour But as The Maltese Cat said when time was called and the four came back blowing and dripping Faiz Ullah ought to have been kicked all round Umballa If he did not behave better next time The Maltese Cat promised to pull out his Arab tail by the roots and eat it There was no time to talk for the third four were ordered out The third quarter of a game is generally the hottest for each side thinks that the others must be pumped and most of the winning play in a game is made about that time Lutyens took over The Maltese Cat with a pat and a hug for Lutyens valued him more than anything else in the world Powell had Shikast a little grey rat with no pedigree and no manners outside polo Macnamara mounted Bamboo the largest of the team and Hughes Who s Who alias The Animal He was supposed to have Australian blood in his veins but he looked like a clothes horse and you could whack his legs with an iron crow bar without hurting him They went out to meet the very flower of the Archangels team and when Who s Who saw their elegantly booted legs and their beautiful satin skins he grinned a grin through his light well worn bridle My word said Who s Who We must give em a little football These gentlemen need a rubbing down No biting said The Maltese Cat warningly for once or twice in his career Who s Who had been known to forget himself in that way Who said anything about biting I m not playing tiddly winks I m playing the game The Archangels came down like a wolf on the fold for they were tired of football and they wanted polo They got it more and more Just after the game began Lutyens hit a ball that was coming towards him rapidly and it rolled in the air as a ball sometimes will with the whirl of a frightened partridge Shikast heard but could not see it for the minute though he looked everywhere and up into the air as The Maltese Cat had taught him When he saw it ahead and overhead he went forward with Powell as fast as he could put foot to ground It was then that Powell a quiet and level headed man as a rule became inspired and played a stroke that sometimes comes off successfully after long practice He took his stick in both hands and standing up in his stirrups swiped at the ball in the air Munipore fashion There was one second of paralysed astonishment and then all four sides of the ground went up in a yell of applause and delight as the ball flew true you could see the amazed Archangels ducking in their saddles to dodge the line of flight and looking at it with open mouths and the regimental pipes of the Skidars squealed from the railings as long as the pipers had breath Shikast heard the stroke but he heard the head of the stick fly off at the same time Nine hundred and ninety nine ponies out of a thousand would have gone tearing on after the ball with a useless player pulling at their heads but Powell knew him and he knew Powell and the instant he felt Powell s right leg shift a trifle on the saddle flap he headed to the boundary where a native officer was frantically waving a new stick Before the shouts had ended Powell was armed again Once before in his life The Maltese Cat had heard that very same stroke played off his own back and had profited by the confusion it wrought This time he acted on experience and leaving Bamboo to guard the goal in case of accidents came through the others like a flash head and tail low Lutyens standing up to ease him swept on and on before the other side knew what was the matter and nearly pitched on his head between the Archangels goal post as Lutyens kicked the ball in after a straight scurry of a hundred and fifty yards If there was one thing more than another upon which The Maltese Cat prided himself it was on this quick streaking kind of run half across the ground He did not believe in taking balls round the field unless you were clearly overmatched After this they gave the Archangels five minuted football and an expensive fast pony hates football because it rumples his temper Who s Who showed himself even better than Polaris in this game He did not permit any wriggling away but bored joyfully into the scrimmage as if he had his nose in a feed box and was looking for something nice Little Shikast jumped on the ball the minute it got clear and every time an Archangel pony followed it he found Shikast standing over it asking what was the matter If we can live through this quarter said The Maltese Cat I sha n t care Don t take it out of yourselves Let them do the lathering So the ponies as their riders explained afterwards shut up The Archangels kept them tied fast in front of their goal but it cost the Archangels ponies all that was left of their tempers and ponies began to kick and men began to repeat compliments and they chopped at the legs of Who s Who and he set his teeth and stayed where he was and the dust stood up like a tree over the scrimmage until that hot quarter ended They found the ponies very excited and confident when they went to their saises and The Maltese Cat had to warn them that the worst of the game was coming Now we are all going in for the second time said he and they are trotting out fresh ponies You think you can gallop but you ll find you can t and then you ll be sorry But two goals to nothing is a halter long lead said Kittiwynk prancing How long does it take to get a goal The Maltese Cat answered For pity s sake don t run away with a notion that the game is half won just because we happen to be in luck now They ll ride you into the grand stand if they can you must not give em a chance Follow the ball Football as usual said Polaris My hock s half as big as a nose bag Don t let them have a look at the ball if you can help it Now leave me alone I must get all the rest I can before the last quarter He hung down his head and let all his muscles go slack Shikast Bamboo and Who s Who copying his example Better not watch the game he said We aren t playing and we shall only take it out of ourselves if we grow anxious Look at the ground and pretend it s fly time They did their best but it was hard advice to follow The hooves were drumming and the sticks were rattling all up and down the ground and yells of applause from the English troops told that the Archangels were pressing the Skidars hard The native soldiers behind the ponies groaned and grunted and said things in undertones and presently they heard a long drawn shout and a clatter of hurrahs One to the Archangels said Shikast without raising his head Time s nearly up Oh my sire and dam Faiz Ullah said The Maltese Cat if you don t play to the last nail in your shoes this time I ll kick you on the ground before all the other ponies I ll do my best when my time comes said the little Arab sturdily The saises looked at each other gravely as they rubbed their ponies legs This was the time when long purses began to tell and everybody knew it Kittiwynk and the others came back the sweat dripping over their hooves and their tails telling sad stories They re better than we are said Shiraz I knew how it would be Shut your big head said The Maltese Cat we ve one goal to the good yet Yes but it s two Arabs and two country breds to play now said Corks Faiz Ullah remember He spoke in a biting voice As Lutyens mounted Grey Dawn he looked at his men and they did not look pretty They were covered with dust and sweat in streaks Their yellow boots were almost black their wrists were red and lumpy and their eyes seemed two inches deep in their heads but the expression in the eyes was satisfactory Did you take anything at tiffin said Lutyens and the team shook their heads They were too dry to talk All right The Archangels did They are worse pumped than we are They ve got the better ponies said Powell I sha n t be sorry when this business is over That fifth quarter was a painful one in every way Faiz Ullah played like a little red demon and The Rabbit seemed to be everywhere at once and Benami rode straight at anything and everything that came in his way while the umpires on their ponies wheeled like gulls outside the shifting game But the Archangels had the better mounts they had kept their racers till late in the game and never allowed the Skidars to play football They hit the ball up and down the width of the ground till Benami and the rest were outpaced Then they went forward and time and again Lutyens and Grey Dawn were just and only just able to send the ball away with a long spitting backhander Grey Dawn forgot that he was an Arab and turned from grey to blue as he galloped Indeed he forgot too well for he did not keep his eyes on the ground as an Arab should but stuck out his nose and scuttled for the dear honour of the game They had watered the ground once or twice between the quarters and a careless waterman had emptied the last of his skinful all in one place near the Skidars goal It was close to the end of the play and for the tenth time Grey Dawn was bolting after the ball when his near hind foot slipped on the greasy mud and he rolled over and over pitching Lutyens just clear of the goal post and the triumphant Archangels made their goal Then time was called two goals all but Lutyens had to be helped up and Grey Dawn rose with his near hind leg strained somewhere What s the damage said Powell his arm around Lutyens Collar bone of course said Lutyens between his teeth It was the third time he had broken it in two years and it hurt him Powell and the others whistled Game s up said Hughes Hold on We ve five good minutes yet and it isn t my right hand We ll stick it out I say said the Captain of the Archangels trotting up are you hurt Lutyens We ll wait if you care to put in a substitute I wish I mean the fact is you fellows deserve this game if any team does Wish we could give you a man or some of our ponies or something You re awfully good but we ll play it to a finish I think The Captain of the Archangels stared for a little That s not half bad he said and went back to his own side while Lutyens borrowed a scarf from one of his native officers and made a sling of it Then an Archangel galloped up with a big bath sponge and advised Lutyens to put it under his armpit to ease his shoulder and between them they tied up his left arm scientifically and one of the native officers leaped forward with four long glasses that fizzed and bubbled The team looked at Lutyens piteously and he nodded It was the last quarter and nothing would matter after that They drank out the dark golden drink and wiped their moustaches and things looked more hopeful The Maltese Cat had put his nose into the front of Lutyens shirt and was trying to say how sorry he was He knows said Lutyens proudly The beggar knows I ve played him without a bridle before now for fun It s no fun now said Powell But we haven t a decent substitute No said Lutyens It s the last quarter and we ve got to make our goal and win I ll trust The Cat If you fall this time you ll suffer a little said Macnamara I ll trust The Cat said Lutyens You hear that said The Maltese Cat proudly to the others It s worth while playing polo for ten years to have that said of you Now then my sons come along We ll kick up a little bit just to show the Archangels this team haven t suffered And sure enough as they went on to the ground The Maltese Cat after satisfying himself that Lutyens was home in the saddle kicked out three or four times and Lutyens laughed The reins were caught up anyhow in the tips of his strapped left hand and he never pretended to rely on them He knew The Cat would answer to the least pressure of the leg and by way of showing off for his shoulder hurt him very much he bent the little fellow in a close figure of eight in and out between the goal posts There was a roar from the native officers and men who dearly loved a piece of dugabashi horse trick work as they called it and the pipes very quietly and scornfully droned out the first bars of a common bazaar tune called Freshly Fresh and Newly New just as a warning to the other regiments that the Skidars were fit All the natives laughed And now said The Maltese Cat as they took their place remember that this is the last quarter and follow the ball Don t need to be told said Who s Who Let me go on All those people on all four sides will begin to crowd in just as they did at Malta You ll hear people calling out and moving forward and being pushed back and that is going to make the Archangel ponies very unhappy But if a ball is struck to the boundary you go after it and let the people get out of your way I went over the pole of a four in hand once and picked a game out of the dust by it Back me up when I run and follow the ball There was a sort of an all round sound of sympathy and wonder as the last quarter opened and then there began exactly what The Maltese Cat had foreseen People crowded in close to the boundaries and the Archangels ponies kept looking sideways at the narrowing space If you know how a man feels to be cramped at tennis not because he wants to run out of the court but because he likes to know that he can at a pinch you will guess how ponies must feel when they are playing in a box of human beings I ll bend some of those men if I can get away said Who s Who as he rocketed behind the ball and Bamboo nodded without speaking They were playing the last ounce in them and The Maltese Cat had left the goal undefended to join them Lutyens gave him every order that he could to bring him back but this was the first time in his career that the little wise grey had ever played polo on his own responsibility and he was going to make the most of it What are you doing here said Hughes as The Cat crossed in front of him and rode off an Archangel The Cat s in charge mind the goal shouted Lutyens and bowing forward hit the ball full and followed on forcing the Archangels towards their own goal No football said The Maltese Cat Keep the ball by the boundaries and cramp em Play open order and drive em to the boundaries Across and across the ground in big diagonals flew the ball and whenever it came to a flying rush and a stroke close to the boundaries the Archangel ponies moved stiffly They did not care to go headlong at a wall of men and carriages though if the ground had been open they could have turned on a sixpence Wriggle her up the sides said The Cat Keep her close to the crowd They hate the carriages Shikast keep her up this side Shikast and Powell lay left and right behind the uneasy scuffle of an open scrimmage and every time the ball was hit away Shikast galloped on it at such an angle that Powell was forced to hit it towards the boundary and when the crowd had been driven away from that side Lutyens would send the ball over to the other and Shikast would slide desperately after it till his friends came down to help It was billiards and no football this time billiards in a corner pocket and the cues were not well chalked If they get us out in the middle of the ground they ll walk away from us Dribble her along the sides cried The Maltese Cat So they dribbled all along the boundary where a pony could not come on their right hand side and the Archangels were furious and the umpires had to neglect the game to shout at the people to get back and several blundering mounted policemen tried to restore order all close to the scrimmage and the nerves of the Archangels ponies stretched and broke like cob webs Five or six times an Archangel hit the ball up into the middle of the ground and each time the watchful Shikast gave Powell his chance to send it back and after each return when the dust had settled men could see that the Skidars had gained a few yards Every now and again there were shouts of Side Off side from the spectators but the teams were too busy to care and the umpires had all they could do to keep their maddened ponies clear of the scuffle At last Lutyens missed a short easy stroke and the Skidars had to fly back helter skelter to protect their own goal Shikast leading Powell stopped the ball with a backhander when it was not fifty yards from the goalposts and Shikast spun round with a wrench that nearly hoisted Powell out of his saddle Now s our last chance said The Cat wheeling like a cockchafer on a pin We ve got to ride it out Come along Lutyens felt the little chap take a deep breath and as it were crouch under his rider The ball was hopping towards the right hand boundary an Archangel riding for it with both spurs and a whip but neither spur nor whip would make his pony stretch himself as he neared the crowd The Maltese Cat glided under his very nose picking up his hind legs sharp for there was not a foot to spare between his quarters and the other pony s bit It was as neat an exhibition as fancy figure skating Lutyens hit with all the strength he had left but the stick slipped a little in his hand and the ball flew off to the left instead of keeping close to the boundary Who s Who was far across the ground thinking hard as he galloped He repeated stride for stride The Cat s manoeuvres with another Archangel pony nipping the ball away from under his bridle and clearing his opponent by half a fraction of an inch for Who s Who was clumsy behind Then he drove away towards the right as The Maltese Cat came up from the left and Bamboo held a middle course exactly between them The three were making a sort of Government broad arrow shaped attack and there was only the Archangels back to guard the goal but immediately behind them were three Archangels racing all they knew and mixed up with them was Powell sending Shikast along on what he felt was their last hope It takes a very good man to stand up to the rush of seven crazy ponies in the last quarters of a Cup game when men are riding with their necks for sale and the ponies are delirious The Archangels back missed his stroke and pulled aside just in time to let the rush go by Bamboo and Who s Who shortened stride to give The Cat room and Lutyens got the goal with a clean smooth smacking stroke that was heard all over the field But there was no stopping the ponies They poured through the goalposts in one mixed mob winners and losers together for the pace had been terrific The Maltese Cat knew by experience what would happen and to save Lutyens turned to the right with one last effort that strained a back sinew beyond hope of repair As he did so he heard the right hand goalpost crack as a pony cannoned into it crack splinter and fall like a mast It had been sawed three parts through in case of accidents but it upset the pony nevertheless and he blundered into another who blundered into the left hand post and then there was confusion and dust and wood Bamboo was lying on the ground seeing stars an Archangel pony rolled beside him breathless and angry Shikast had sat down dog fashion to avoid falling over the others and was sliding along on his little bobtail in a cloud of dust and Powell was sitting on the ground hammering with his stick and trying to cheer All the others were shouting at the top of what was left of their voices and the men who had been spilt were shouting too As soon as the people saw no one was hurt ten thousand native and English shouted and clapped and yelled and before any one could stop them the pipers of the Skidars broke on to the ground with all the native officers and men behind them and marched up and down playing a wild Northern tune called Zakhme Began and through the insolent blaring of the pipes and the high pitched native yells you could hear the Archangels band hammering For they are all jolly good fellows and then reproachfully to the losing team Ooh Kafoozalum Kafoozalum Kafoozalum Besides all these things and many more there was a Commander in chief and an Inspector General of Cavalry and the principal veterinary officer of all India standing on the top of a regimental coach yelling like school boys and brigadiers and colonels and commissioners and hundreds of pretty ladies joined the chorus But The Maltese Cat stood with his head down wondering how many legs were left to him and Lutyens watched the men and ponies pick themselves out of the wreck of the two goal posts and he patted The Maltese Cat very tenderly I say said the Captain of the Archangels spitting a pebble out of his mouth will you take three thousand for that pony as he stands No thank you I ve an idea he s saved my life said Lutyens getting off and lying down at full length Both teams were on the ground too waving their boots in the air and coughing and drawing deep breaths as the saises ran up to take away the ponies and an officious water carrier sprinkled the players with dirty water till they sat up My aunt said Powell rubbing his back and looking at the stumps of the goal posts That was a game They played it over again every stroke of it that night at the big dinner when the Free for All Cup was filled and passed down the table and emptied and filled again and everybody made most eloquent speeches About two in the morning when there might have been some singing a wise little plain little grey little head looked in through the open door Hurrah Bring him in said the Archangels and his sais who was very happy indeed patted The Maltese Cat on the flank and he limped in to the blaze of light and the glittering uniforms looking for Lutyens He was used to messes and men s bedrooms and places where ponies are not usually encouraged and in his youth had jumped on and off a mess table for a bet So he behaved himself very politely and ate bread dipped in salt and was petted all round the table moving gingerly and they drank his health because he had done more to win the Cup than any man or horse on the ground That was glory and honour enough for the rest of his days and The Maltese Cat did not complain much when the veterinary surgeon said that he would be no good for polo any more When Lutyens married his wife did not allow him to play so he was forced to be an umpire and his pony on these occasions was a flea bitten grey with a neat polo tail lame all round but desperately quick on his feet and as everybody knew Past Pluperfect Prestissimo Player of the Game BREAD UPON THE WATERS If you remember my improper friend Brugglesmith you will also bear in mind his friend McPhee Chief Engineer of the Breslau whose dingey Brugglesmith tried to steal His apologies for the performances of Brugglesmith may one day be told in their proper place the tale before us concerns McPhee He was never a racing engineer and took special pride in saying as much before the Liverpool men but he had a thirty two years knowledge of machinery and the humours of ships One side of his face had been wrecked through the bursting of a pressure gauge in the days when men knew less than they do now and his nose rose grandly out of the wreck like a club in a public riot There were cuts and lumps on his head and he would guide your forefinger through his short iron grey hair and tell you how he had come by his trade marks He owned all sorts of certificates of extra competency and at the bottom of his cabin chest of drawers where he kept the photograph of his wife were two or three Royal Humane Society medals for saving lives at sea Professionally it was different when crazy steerage passengers jumped overboard professionally McPhee does not approve of saving life at sea and he has often told me that a new Hell awaits stokers and trimmers who sign for a strong man s pay and fall sick the second day out He believes in throwing boots at fourth and fifth engineers when they wake him up at night with word that a bearing is redhot all because a lamp s glare is reflected red from the twirling metal He believes that there are only two poets in the world one being Robert Burns of course and the other Gerald Massey When he has time for novels he reads Wilkie Collins and Charles Reade chiefly the latter and knows whole pages of Very Hard Cash by heart In the saloon his table is next to the captain s and he drinks only water while his engines work He was good to me when we first met because I did not ask questions and believed in Charles Reade as a most shamefully neglected author Later he approved of my writings to the extent of one pamphlet of twenty four pages that I wrote for Holdock Steiner Chase owners of the line when they bought some ventilating patent and fitted it to the cabins of the Breslau Spandau and Koltzau The purser of the Breslau recommended me to Holdock s secretary for the job and Holdock who is a Wesleyan Methodist invited me to his house and gave me dinner with the governess when the others had finished and placed the plans and specifications in my hand and I wrote the pamphlet that same afternoon It was called Comfort in the Cabin and brought me seven pound ten cash down an important sum of money in those days and the governess who was teaching Master John Holdock his scales told me that missus Holdock had told her to keep an eye on me in case I went away with coats from the hat rack McPhee liked that pamphlet enormously for it was composed in the Bouverie Byzantine style with baroque and rococo embellishments and afterwards he introduced me to missus McPhee who succeeded Dinah in my heart for Dinah was half a world away and it is wholesome and antiseptic to love such a woman as Janet McPhee They lived in a little twelve pound house close to the shipping When McPhee was away missus McPhee read the Lloyds column in the papers and called on the wives of senior engineers of equal social standing Once or twice too missus Holdock visited missus McPhee in a brougham with celluloid fittings and I have reason to believe that after she had played owner s wife long enough they talked scandal The Holdocks lived in an old fashioned house with a big brick garden not a mile from the McPhees for they stayed by their money as their money stayed by them and in summer you met their brougham solemnly junketing by Theydon Bois or Loughton But I was missus McPhee s friend for she allowed me to convoy her westward sometimes to theatres where she sobbed or laughed or shivered with a simple heart and she introduced me to a new world of doctors wives captains wives and engineers wives whose whole talk and thought centred in and about ships and lines of ships you have never heard of There were sailing ships with stewards and mahogany and maple saloons trading to Australia taking cargoes of consumptives and hopeless drunkards for whom a sea voyage was recommended there were frowzy little West African boats full of rats and cockroaches where men died anywhere but in their bunks there were Brazilian boats whose cabins could be hired for merchandise that went out loaded nearly awash there were Zanzibar and Mauritius steamers and wonderful reconstructed boats that plied to the other tide of Borneo These were loved and known for they earned our bread and a little butter and we despised the big Atlantic boats and made fun of the P O and Orient liners and swore by our respective owners Wesleyan Baptist or Presbyterian as the case might be I had only just come back to England when missus McPhee invited me to dinner at three o clock in the afternoon and the notepaper was almost bridal in its scented creaminess When I reached the house I saw that there were new curtains in the window that must have cost forty five shillings a pair and as missus McPhee drew me into the little marble papered hall she looked at me keenly and cried Have ye not heard What d ye think o the hatrack Now that hat rack was oak thirty shillings at least McPhee came down stairs with a sober foot he steps as lightly as a cat for all his weight when he is at sea and shook hands in a new and awful manner a parody of old Holdock s style when he says good bye to his skippers I perceived at once that a legacy had come to him but I held my peace though missus McPhee begged me every thirty seconds to eat a great deal and say nothing It was rather a mad sort of meal because McPhee and his wife took hold of hands like little children they always do after voyages and nodded and winked and choked and gurgled and hardly ate a mouthful A female servant came in and waited though missus McPhee had told me time and again that she would thank no one to do her housework while she had her health But this was a servant with a cap and I saw missus McPhee swell and swell under her garance coloured gown There is no small free board to Janet McPhee nor is garance any subdued tint and with all this unexplained pride and glory in the air I felt like watching fireworks without knowing the festival When the maid had removed the cloth she brought a pineapple that would have cost half a guinea at that season only McPhee has his own way of getting such things and a Canton china bowl of dried lichis and a glass plate of preserved ginger and a small jar of sacred and Imperial chow chow that perfumed the room McPhee gets it from a Dutchman in Java and I think he doctors it with liqueurs But the crown of the feast was some Madeira of the kind you can only come by if you know the wine and the man A little maize wrapped fig of clotted Madeira cigars went with the wine and the rest was a pale blue smoky silence Janet in her splendour smiling on us two and patting McPhee s hand We ll drink said McPhee slowly rubbing his chin to the eternal damnation o Holdock Steiner Chase Of course I answered Amen though I had made seven pound ten shillings out of the firm McPhee s enemies were mine and I was drinking his Madeira Ye ve heard nothing said Janet Not a word not a whisper Not a word nor a whisper On my word I have not Tell him Mac said she and that is another proof of Janet s goodness and wifely love A smaller woman would have babbled first but Janet is five feet nine in her stockings We re rich said McPhee I shook hands all round We re damned rich he added I shook hands all round a second time I ll go to sea no more unless there s no sayin a private yacht maybe wi a small an handy auxiliary It s not enough for that said Janet We re fair rich well to do but no more A new gown for church and one for the theatre We ll have it made west How much is it I asked Twenty five thousand pounds I drew a long breath An I ve been earnin twenty five an twenty pound a month The last words came away with a roar as though the wide world was conspiring to beat him down All this time I m waiting I said I know nothing since last September Was it left you They laughed aloud together It was left said McPhee choking Ou ay it was left That s vara good Of course it was left Janet d ye note that It was left Now if you d put that in your pamphlet it would have been vara jocose It was left He slapped his thigh and roared till the wine quivered in the decanter The Scotch are a great people but they are apt to hang over a joke too long particularly when no one can see the point but themselves When I rewrite my pamphlet I ll put it in McPhee Only I must know something more first McPhee thought for the length of half a cigar while Janet caught my eye and led it round the room to one new thing after another the new vine pattern carpet the new chiming rustic clock between the models of the Colombo outrigger boats the new inlaid sideboard with a purple cut glass flower stand the fender of gilt and brass and last the new black and gold piano In October o last year the Board sacked me began McPhee In October o last year the Breslau came in for winter overhaul She d been runnin eight months two hunder an forty days an I was three days makin up my indents when she went to dry dock All told mark you it was this side o three hunder pound to be preceese two hunder an eighty six pound four shillings There s not another man could ha nursed the Breslau for eight months to that tune Never again never again They may send their boats to the bottom for aught I care There s no need said Janet softly We re done wi Holdock Steiner Chase It s irritatin Janet it s just irritatin I ha been justified from first to last as the world knows but but I canna forgie em Ay wisdom is justified o her children an any other man than me wad ha made the indent eight hunder Hay was our skipper ye ll have met him They shifted him to the Torgau an bade me wait for the Breslau under young Bannister Ye ll obsairve there d been a new election on the Board I heard the shares were sellin hither an yon an the major part of the Board was new to me The old Board would ne er ha done it They trusted me But the new Board were all for reorganisation Young Steiner Steiner s son the Jew was at the bottom of it an they did not think it worth their while to send me word The first I knew an I was Chief Engineer was the notice of the line s winter sailin s and the Breslau timed for sixteen days between port an port Sixteen days man She s a good boat but eighteen is her summer time mark you Sixteen was sheer flytin kitin nonsense an so I told young Bannister We ve got to make it he said Ye should not ha sent in a three hunder pound indent Do they look for their boats to be run on air I said The Board s daft E en tell em so he says I m a married man an my fourth s on the ways now she says A boy wi red hair Janet put in Her own hair is the splendid red gold that goes with a creamy complexion My word I was an angry man that day Forbye I was fond o the old Breslau I looked for a little consideration from the Board after twenty years service There was Board meetin on Wednesday an I slept overnight in the engine room takin figures to support my case Well I put it fair and square before them all Gentlemen I said I ve run the Breslau eight seasons an I believe there s no fault to find wi my wark But if ye haud to this I waggled the advertisement at em this that I ve never heard of it till I read it at breakfast I do assure you on my professional reputation she can never do it That is to say she can for a while but at a risk no thinkin man would run What the deil d ye suppose we pass your indents for says old Holdock Man we re spendin money like watter I ll leave it in the Board s hands I said if two hunder an eighty seven pound is anything beyond right and reason for eight months I might ha saved my breath for the Board was new since the last election an there they sat the damned deevidend huntin ship chandlers deaf as the adders o Scripture We must keep faith wi the public said young Steiner Keep faith wi the Breslau then I said She s served you well an your father before you She ll need her bottom restiffenin an new bed plates an turnin out the forward boilers an re turnin all three cylinders an refacin all guides to begin with It s a three months job Because one employee is afraid says young Steiner Maybe a piano in the Chief Engineer s cabin would be more to the point I crushed my cap in my hands an thanked God we d no bairns an a bit put by Understand gentlemen I said If the Breslau is made a sixteen day boat ye ll find another engineer Bannister makes no objection said Holdock I m speakin for myself I said Bannister has bairns An then I lost my temper Ye can run her into Hell an out again if ye pay pilotage I said but ye run without me That s insolence said young Steiner At your pleasure I said turnin to go Ye can consider yourself dismissed We must preserve discipline among our employees said old Holdock an he looked round to see that the Board was with him They knew nothin God forgie em an they nodded me out o the line after twenty years after twenty years I went out an sat down by the hall porter to get my wits again I m thinkin I swore at the Board Then auld McRimmon o McNaughten McRimmon came oot o his office that s on the same floor an looked at me proppin up one eyelid wi his forefinger Ye know they call him the Blind Deevil forbye he onythin but blind an no deevil in his dealin s wi me McRimmon o the Black Bird Line What s here Mister McPhee said he I was past prayin for by then A Chief Engineer sacked after twenty years service because he ll not risk the Breslau on the new timin an be damned to ye McRimmon I said The auld man sucked in his lips an whistled AH said he the new timin I see He doddered into the Board room I d just left an the Dandie dog that is just his blind man s leader stayed wi me That was providential In a minute he was back again Ye ve cast your bread on the watter McPhee an be damned to you he says Whaur s my dog My word is he on your knee There s more discernment in a dog than a Jew What garred ye curse your Board McPhee It s expensive They ll pay more for the Breslau I said Get off my knee ye smotherin beast Bearin s hot eh said McRimmon It s thirty year since a man daur curse me to my face Time was I d ha cast ye doon the stairway for that Forgie s all I said He was wearin to eighty as I knew I was wrong McRimmon but when a man s shown the door for doin his plain duty he s not always ceevil So I hear says McRimmon Ha ye ony objection to a tramp freighter It s only fifteen a month but they say the Blind Deevil feeds a man better than others She s my Kite Come ben Ye can thank Dandie here I m no used to thanks An noo says he what possessed ye to throw up your berth wi Holdock The new timin said I The Breslau will not stand it Hoot oot said he Ye might ha crammed her a little enough to show ye were drivin her an brought her in twa days behind What s easier than to say ye slowed for bearin s eh All my men do it and I believe em McRimmon says I what s her virginity to a lassie He puckered his dry face an twisted in his chair The warld an a says he My God the vara warld an a But what ha you or me to do wi virginity this late along This I said There s just one thing that each one of us in his trade or profession will not do for ony consideration whatever If I run to time I run to time barrio always the risks o the high seas Less than that under God I have not done More than that by God I will not do There s no trick o the trade I m not acquaint wi So I ve heard says McRimmon dry as a biscuit But yon matter o fair rennin s just my Shekinah ye ll understand I daurna tamper wi that Nursing weak engines is fair craftsmanship but what the Board ask is cheatin wi the risk o manslaughter addeetional Ye ll note I know my business There was some more talk an next week I went aboard the Kite twenty five hunder ton simple compound a Black Bird tramp The deeper she rode the better she d steam I ve snapped as much as eleven out of her but eight point three was her fair normal Good food forward an better aft all indents passed wi out marginal remarks the best coal new donkeys and good crews There was nothin the old man would not do except paint That was his deeficulty Ye could no more draw paint than his last teeth from him He d come down to dock an his boats a scandal all along the watter an he d whine an cry an say they looked all he could desire Every owner has his non plus ultra I ve obsairved Paint was McRimmon s But you could get round his engines without riskin your life an for all his blindness I ve seen him reject five flawed intermediates one after the other on a nod from me an his cattle fittin s were guaranteed for North Atlantic winter weather Ye ken what that means McRimmon an the Black Bird Line God bless him Oh I forgot to say she would lie down an fill her forward deck green an snore away into a twenty knot gale forty five to the minute three an a half knots an hour the engines runnin sweet an true as a bairn breathin in its sleep Bell was skipper an forbye there s no love lost between crews an owners we were fond o the auld Blind Deevil an his dog an I m thinkin he liked us He was worth the windy side o twa million sterlin an no friend to his own blood kin Money s an awfu thing overmuch for a lonely man I d taken her out twice there an back again when word came o the Breslau s breakdown just as I prophesied Calder was her engineer he s not fit to run a tug down the Solent and he fairly lifted the engines off the bed plates an they fell down in heaps by what I heard So she filled from the after stuffin box to the after bulkhead an lay star gazing with seventy nine squealin passengers in the saloon till the Camaralzaman o Ramsey Gold s Cartagena line gave her a tow to the tune o five thousand seven hunder an forty pound wi costs in the Admiralty Court She was helpless ye ll understand an in no case to meet ony weather Five thousand seven hunder an forty pounds with costs an exclusive o new engines They d ha done better to ha kept me on the old timin But even so the new Board were all for retrenchment Young Steiner the Jew was at the bottom of it They sacked men right an left that would not eat the dirt the Board gave em They cut down repairs they fed crews wi leavin s an scrapin s and reversin McRimmon s practice they hid their defeeciencies wi paint an cheap gildin Quem Deus vult perrdere prrius dementat ye remember In January we went to dry dock an in the next dock lay the Grotkau their big freighter that was the Dolabella o Piegan Piegan Walsh s line in eighty four a Clyde built iron boat a flat bottomed pigeon breasted under engined bull nosed bitch of a five thousand ton freighter that would neither steer nor steam nor stop when ye asked her Whiles she d attend to her helm whiles she d take charge whiles she d wait to scratch herself an whiles she d buttock into a dockhead But Holdock and Steiner had bought her cheap and painted her all over like the Hoor o Babylon an we called her the Hoor for short By the way McPhee kept to that name throughout the rest of his tale so you must read accordingly I went to see young Bannister he had to take what the Board gave him an he an Calder were shifted together from the Breslau to this abortion an talkin to him I went into the dock under her Her plates were pitted till the men that were paint paint paintin her laughed at it But the warst was at the last She d a great clumsy iron twelve foot Thresher propeller Aitcheson designed the Kites and just on the tail o the shaft behind the boss was a red weepin crack ye could ha put a penknife to Man it was an awful crack When d ye ship a new tail shaft I said to Bannister He knew what I meant Oh yon s a superfeecial flaw says he not lookin at me Superfeecial Gehenna I said Ye ll not take her oot wi a solution o continuity that like They ll putty it up this evening he said I m a married man an ye used to know the Board I e en said what was gied me in that hour Ye know how a drydock echoes I saw young Steiner standin listenin above me an man he used language provocative of a breach o the peace I was a spy and a disgraced employ an a corrupter o young Bannister s morals an he d prosecute me for libel He went away when I ran up the steps I d ha thrown him into the dock if I d caught him an there I met McRimmon wi Dandie pullin on the chain guidin the auld man among the railway lines McPhee said he ye re no paid to fight Holdock Steiner Chase Company Limited when ye meet What s wrong between you No more than a tail shaft rotten as a kail stump For ony sakes go an look McRimmon It s a comedietta I m feared o yon conversational Hebrew said he Whaur s the flaw an what like A seven inch crack just behind the boss There s no power on earth will fend it just jarrin off When That s beyon my knowledge I said So it is so it is said McRimmon We ve all oor leemitations Ye re certain it was a crack Man it s a crevasse I said for there were no words to describe the magnitude of it An young Bannister s sayin it s no more than a superfeecial flaw Weell I tak it oor business is to mind oor business If ye ve ony friends aboard her McPhee why not bid them to a bit dinner at Radley s I was thinkin o tea in the cuddy I said Engineers o tramp freighters cannot afford hotel prices Na na says the auld man whimperin Not the cuddy They ll laugh at my Kite for she s no plastered with paint like the Hoor Bid them to Radley s McPhee an send me the bill Thank Dandie here man I m no used to thanks Then he turned him round I was just thinkin the vara same thing Mister McPhee said he this is not senile dementia Preserve s I said clean jumped oot o mysel I was but thinkin you re fey McRimmon Dod the auld deevil laughed till he nigh sat down on Dandie Send me the bill says he I m long past champagne but tell me how it tastes the morn Bell and I bid young Bannister and Calder to dinner at Radley s They ll have no laughin an singin there but we took a private room like yacht owners fra Cowes McPhee grinned all over and lay back to think And then said I We were no drunk in ony preceese sense o the word but Radley s showed me the dead men There were six magnums o dry champagne an maybe a bottle o whisky Do you mean to tell me that you four got away with a magnum and a half a piece besides whisky I demanded McPhee looked down upon me from between his shoulders with toleration Man we were not settin down to drink he said They no more than made us wutty To be sure young Bannister laid his head on the table an greeted like a bairn an Calder was all for callin on Steiner at two in the morn an painting him galley green but they d been drinkin the afternoon Lord how they twa cursed the Board an the Grotkau an the tail shaft an the engines an a They didna talk o superfeecial flaws that night I mind young Bannister an Calder shakin hands on a bond to be revenged on the Board at ony reasonable cost this side o losing their certificates Now mark ye how false economy ruins business The Board fed them like swine I have good reason to know it an I ve obsairved wi my ain people that if ye touch his stomach ye wauken the deil in a Scot Men will tak a dredger across the Atlantic if they re well fed an fetch her somewhere on the broadside o the Americas but bad food s bad service the warld over The bill went to McRimmon an he said no more to me till the week end when I was at him for more paint for we d heard the Kite was chartered Liverpool side Bide whaur ye re put said the Blind Deevil Man do ye wash in champagne The Kite s no leavin here till I gie the order an how am I to waste paint onher wi the Lammergeyer docked for who knows how long an a She was our big freighter McIntyre was engineer an I knew she d come from overhaul not three months That morn I met McRimmon s head clerk ye ll not know him fair bitin his nails off wi mortification The auld man s gone gyte says he He s withdrawn the Lammergeyer Maybe he has reasons says I Reasons He s daft He ll no be daft till he begins to paint I said That s just what he s done and South American freights higher than we ll live to see them again He s laid her up to paint her to paint her to paint her says the little clerk dancin like a hen on a hot plate Five thousand ton o potential freight rottin in drydock man an he dolin the paint out in quarter pound tins for it cuts him to the heart mad though he is An the Grotkau the Grotkau of all conceivable bottoms soaking up every pound that should be ours at Liverpool I was staggered wi this folly considerin the dinner at Radley s in connection wi the same Ye may well stare McPhee says the head clerk There s engines an rollin stock an iron bridgesd ye know what freights are noo an pianos an millinery an fancy Brazil cargo o every species pourin into the Grotkau the Grotkau o the Jerusalem firm and the Lammergeyer s bein painted Losh I thought he d drop dead wi the fits I could say no more than Obey orders if ye break owners but on the Kite we believed McRimmon was mad an McIntyre of the Lammergeyer was for lockin him up by some patent legal process he d found in a book o maritime law An a that week South American freights rose an rose It was sinfu Syne Bell got orders to tak the Kite round to Liverpool in water ballast and McRimmon came to bid s good bye yammerin an whinin o er the acres o paint he d lavished on the Lammergeyer I look to you to retrieve it says he I look to you to reimburse me Fore God why are ye not cast off Are ye dawdlin in dock for a purpose What odds McRimmon says Bell We ll be a day behind the fair at Liverpool The Grotkau s got all the freight that might ha been ours an the Lammergeyer s McRimmon laughed an chuckled the pairfect eemage o senile dementia Ye ken his eyebrows wark up an down like a gorilla s Ye re under sealed orders said he tee heein an scratchin himself Yon s they to be opened seriatim Says Bell shufflin the envelopes when the auld man had gone ashore We re to creep round a the south coast standin in for orders his weather too There s no question o his lunacy now Well we buttocked the auld Kite along vara bad weather we made standin in all alongside for telegraphic orders which are the curse o skippers Syne we made over to Holyhead an Bell opened the last envelope for the last instructions I was wi him in the cuddy an he threw it over to me cryin Did ye ever know the like Mac I ll no say what McRimmon had written but he was far from mad There was a sou wester brewin when we made the mouth o the Mersey a bitter cold morn wi a grey green sea and a grey green sky Liverpool weather as they say an there we lay choppin an the crew swore Ye canna keep secrets aboard ship They thought McRimmon was mad too Syne we saw the Grotkau rollin oot on the top o flood deep an double deep wi her new painted funnel an her new painted boats an a She looked her name an moreover she coughed like it Calder tauld me at Radley s what ailed his engines but my own ear would ha told me twa mile awa by the beat o them Round we came plungin an squatterin in her wake an the wind cut wi good promise o more to come By six it blew hard but clear an before the middle watch it was a sou wester in airnest She ll edge into Ireland this gait says Bell I was with him on the bridge watchin the Grotkau s port light Ye canna see green so far as red or we d ha kept to leeward We d no passengers to consider an all eyes being on the Grotkau we fair walked into a liner rampin home to Liverpool Or to be preceese Bell no more than twisted the Kite oot from under her bows and there was a little damnin betwix the twa bridges Noo a passenger McPhee regarded me benignantly wad ha told the papers that as soon as he got to the Customs We stuck to the Grotkau s tail that night an the next twa days she slowed down to five knot by my reckonin and we lapped along the weary way to the Fastnet But you don t go by the Fastnet to get to any South American port do you I said We do not We prefer to go as direct as may be But we were followin the Grotkau an she d no walk into that gale for ony consideration Knowin what I did to her discredit I couldna blame young Bannister It was warkin up to a North Atlantic winter gale snow an sleet an a perishin wind Eh it was like the Deil walkin abroad o the surface o the deep whuppin off the top o the waves before he made up his mind They d bore up against it so far but the minute she was clear o the Skelligs she fair tucked up her skirts an ran for it by Dunmore Head Wow she rolled She ll be makin Smerwick says Bell She d ha tried for Ventry by noo if she meant that I said They ll roll the funnel oot o her this gait says Bell Why canna Bannister keep her head to sea It s the tail shaft Ony rollin s better than pitchin wi superfeecial cracks in the tail shaft Calder knows that much I said It s ill wark retreevin steamers this weather said Bell His beard and whiskers were frozen to his oilskin an the spray was white on the weather side of him Pairfect North Atlantic winter weather One by one the sea raxed away our three boats an the davits were crumpled like ram s horns Yon s bad said Bell at the last Ye canna pass a hawser wi oot a boat Bell was a vara judeecious man for an Aberdonian I m not one that fashes himself for eventualities outside the engine room so I e en slipped down betwixt waves to see how the Kite fared Man she s the best geared boat of her class that ever left Clyde Kinloch my second knew her as well as I did I found him dryin his socks on the main steam an combin his whiskers wi the comb Janet gied me last year for the warld an a as though we were in port I tried the feed speered into the stoke hole thumbed all bearin s spat on the thrust for luck gied em my blessin an took Kinloch s socks before I went up to the bridge again Then Bell handed me the wheel an went below to warm himself When he came up my gloves were frozen to the spokes an the ice clicked over my eyelids Pairfect North Atlantic winter weather as I was sayin The gale blew out by night but we lay in smotherin cross seas that made the auld Kite chatter from stem to stern I slowed to thirty four I mind no thirty seven There was a long swell the morn an the Grotkau was headin into it west awa She ll win to Rio yet tail shaft or no tail shaft says Bell Last night shook her I said She ll jar it off yet mark my word We were then maybe a hunder and fifty mile westsou west o Slyne Head by dead reckonin Next day we made a hunder an thirty ye ll note we were not racin boats an the day after a hunder an sixty one an that made us we ll say Eighteen an a bittock west an maybe Fifty one an a bittock north crossin all the North Atlantic liner lanes on the long slant always in sight o the Grotkau creepin up by night and fallin awa by day After the gale it was cold weather wi dark nights I was in the engine room on Friday night just before the middle watch when Bell whustled down the tube She s done it an up I came The Grotkau was just a fair distance south an one by one she ran up the three red lights in a vertical line the sign of a steamer not under control Yon s a tow for us said Bell lickin his chops She ll be worth more than the Breslau We ll go down to her McPhee Bide a while I said The seas fair throng wi ships here Reason why said Bell It s a fortune gaun beggin What d ye think man Gie her till daylight She knows we re here If Bannister needs help he ll loose a rocket Wha told ye Bannister s need We ll ha some rag an bone tramp snappin her up under oor nose said he an he put the wheel over We were goin slow Bannister wad like better to go home on a liner an eat in the saloon Mind ye what they said o Holdock Steiner s food that night at Radley s Keep her awa man keep her awa A tow s a tow but a derelict s big salvage E eh said Bell Yon s an inshot o yours Mac I love ye like a brother We ll bide whaur we are till daylight an he kept her awa Syne up went a rocket forward an twa on the bridge an a blue light aft Syne a tar barrel forward again She s sinkin said Bell It s all gaun an I ll get no more than a pair o night glasses for pickin up young Bannister the fool Fair an soft again I said She s signallin to the south of us Bannister knows as well as I that one rocket would bring the Breslau He ll no be wastin fireworks for nothin Hear her ca The Grotkau whustled an whustled for five minutes an then there were more fireworks a regular exhibeetion That s no for men in the regular trade says Bell Ye re right Mac That s for a cuddy full o passengers He blinked through the night glasses when it lay a bit thick to southward What d ye make of it I said Liner he says Yon s her rocket Ou ay they ve waukened the gold strapped skipper an noo they ve waukened the passengers They re turnin on the electrics cabin by cabin Yon s anither rocket They re comin up to help the perishin in deep watters Gie me the glass I said But Bell danced on the bridge clean dementit Mails mails mails said he Under contract wi the Government for the due conveyance o the mails an as such Mac yell note she may rescue life at sea but she canna tow she canna tow Yon s her night signal She ll be up in half an hour Gowk I said an we blazin here wi all oor lights Oh Bell ye re a fool He tumbled off the bridge forward an I tumbled aft an before ye could wink our lights were oot the engine room hatch was covered an we lay pitch dark watchin the lights o the liner come up that the Grotkau d been signallin to Twenty knot an hour she came every cabin lighted an her boats swung awa It was grandly done an in the inside of an hour She stopped like missus Holdock s machine down went the gangway down went the boats an in ten minutes we heard the passengers cheerin an awa she fled They ll tell o this all the days they live said Bell A rescue at sea by night as pretty as a play Young Bannister an Calder will be drinkin in the saloon an six months hence the Board o Trade ll gie the skipper a pair o binoculars It s vara philanthropic all round We ll lay by till day ye may think we waited for it wi sore eyes an there sat the Grotkau her nose a bit cocked just leerin at us She looked paifectly ridiculous She ll be fillin aft says Bell for why is she down by the stern The tail shaft s punched a hole in her an we ve no boats There s three hunder thousand pound sterlin at a conservative estimate droonin before our eyes What s to do An his bearin s got hot again in a minute he was an incontinent man Run her as near as ye daur I said Gie me a jacket an a lifeline an I ll swum for it There was a bit lump of a sea an it was cold in the wind vara cold but they d gone overside like passengers young Bannister an Calder an a leaving the gangway down on the lee side It would ha been a flyin in the face o manifest Providence to overlook the invitation We were within fifty yards o her while Kinloch was garmin me all over wi oil behind the galley an as we ran past I went outboard for the salvage o three hunder thousand pound Man it was perishin cold but I d done my job judgmatically an came scrapin all along her side slap on to the lower gratin o the gangway No one more astonished than me I assure ye Before I d caught my breath I d skinned both my knees on the gratin an was climbin up before she rolled again I made my line fast to the rail an squattered aft to young Bannister s cabin whaaur I dried me wi everything in his bunk an put on every conceivable sort o rig I found till the blood was circulatin Three pair drawers I mind I found to begin upon an I needed them all It was the coldest cold I remember in all my experience Syne I went aft to the engine room The Grotkau sat on her own tail as they say She was vara shortshafted an her gear was all aft There was four or five foot o water in the engine room slummockin to and fro black an greasy maybe there was six foot The stoke hold doors were screwed home an the stoke hold was tight enough but for a minute the mess in the engine room deceived me Only for a minute though an that was because I was not in a manner o speakin as calm as ordinar I looked again to mak sure T was just black wi bilge dead watter that must ha come in fortuitously ye ken McPhee I m only a passenger I said but you don t persuade me that six foot o water can come into an engine room fortuitously Who s tryin to persuade one way or the other McPhee retorted I m statin the facts o the case the simple natural facts Six or seven foot o dead watter in the engine room is a vara depressin sight if ye think there s like to be more comin but I did not consider that such was likely and so yell note I was not depressed That s all very well but I want to know about the water I said I ve told ye There was six feet or more there wi Calder s cap floatin on top Where did it come from Weel in the confusion o things after the propeller had dropped off an the engines were racin an a it s vara possible that Calder might ha lost it off his head an no troubled himself to pick it up again I remember seem that cap on him at Southampton I don t want to know about the cap I m asking where the water came from and what it was doing there and why you were so certain that it wasn t a leak McPhee For good reason for good an sufficient reason Give it to me then Weel it s a reason that does not properly concern myself only To be preceese I m of opinion that it was due the watter in part to an error o judgment in another man We can a mak mistakes Oh I beg your pardon I got me to the rail again an What s wrang said Bell hailin She ll do I said Send s o er a hawser an a man to steer I ll pull him in by the life line I could see heads bobbin back an forth an a whuff or two o strong words Then Bell said They ll not trust themselves one of em in this waiter except Kinloch an I ll no spare him The more salvage to me then I said I ll make shift solo Says one dock rat at this D ye think she s safe I ll guarantee ye nothing I said except maybe a hammerin for keepin me this long Then he sings out There s no more than one lifebelt an they canna find it or I d come Throw him over the Jezebel I said for I was oot o patience an they took haud o that volunteer before he knew what was in store and hove him over in the bight of my life line So I e en hauled him upon the sag of it hand over fist a vara welcome recruit when I d tilted the salt watter oot of him for by the way he could na swim Syne they bent a twa inch rope to the life line an a hawser to that an I led the rope o er the drum of a hand winch forward an we sweated the hawser inboard an made it fast to the Grotkau s bitts Bell brought the Kite so close I feared she d roll in an do the Grotkau s plates a mischief He hove anither life line to me an went astern an we had all the weary winch work to do again wi a second hawser For all that Bell was right we d along tow before us an though Providence had helped us that far there was no sense in leavin too much to its keepin When the second hawser was fast I was wet wi sweat an I cried Bell to tak up his slack an go home The other man was by way o helpin the work wi askin for drinks but I e en told him he must hand reef an steer beginnin with steerin for I was goin to turn in He steered oh ay he steered in a manner o speakin At the least he grippit the spokes an twiddled em an looked wise but I doubt if the Hoor ever felt it I turned in there an then to young Bannister s bunk an slept past expression I waukened ragin wi hunger a fair lump o sea runnin the Kite snorin awa four knots an hour an the Grotkau slappin her nose under an yawin an standin over at discretion She was a most disgracefu tow But the shameful thing of all was the food I raxed me a meal fra galley shelves an pantries an lazareetes an cubby holes that I would not ha gied to the mate of a Cardiff collier an ye ken we say a Cardiff mate will eat clinkers to save waste I m sayin it was simply vile The crew had written what they thought of it on the new paint o the fo c sle but I had not a decent soul wi me to complain on There was nothin for me to do save watch the hawsers an the Kite s tail squatterin down in white watter when she lifted to a sea so I got steam on the after donkey pump an pumped oot the engine room There s no sense in leavin waiter loose in a ship When she was dry I went doun the shaft tunnel an found she was leakin a little through the stuffin box but nothin to make wark The propeller had e en jarred off as I knew it must an Calder had been waitin for it to go wi his hand on the gear He told me as much when I met him ashore There was nothin started or strained It had just slipped awa to the bed o the Atlantic as easy as a man dyin wi due warning a most providential business for all concerned Syne I took stock o the Grotkau s upper works Her boats had been smashed on the davits an here an there was the rail missin an a ventilator or two had fetched awa an the bridge rails were bent by the seas but her hatches were tight and she d taken no sort of harm Dod I came to hate her like a human bein for I was eight weary days aboard starvin ay starvin within a cable s length o plenty All day I laid in the bunk reading the Woman Hater the grandest book Charlie Reade ever wrote an pickin a toothful here an there It was weary weary work Eight days man I was aboard the Grotkau an not one full meal did I make Sma blame her crew would not stay by her The other man Oh I warked him wi a vengeance to keep him warm It came on to blow when we fetched soundin s an that kept me standin by the hawsers lashed to the capstan breathin twixt green seas I near died o cauld an hunger for the Grotkau towed like a barge an Bell howkit her along through or over It was vara thick up Channel too We were standin in to make some sort o light an we near walked over twa three fishin boats an they cried us we were overclose to Falmouth Then we were near cut down by a drunken foreign fruiter that was blunderin between us an the shore and it got thicker an thicker that night an I could feel by the tow Bell did not know whaur he was Losh we knew in the morn for the wind blew the fog oot like a candle an the sun came clear and as surely as McRimmon gied me my cheque the shadow o the Eddystone lay across our tow rope We were that near ay we were that near Bell fetched the Kite round with the jerk that came close to tearin the bitts out o the Grotkau an I mind I thanked my Maker in young Bannister s cabin when we were inside Plymouth breakwater The first to come aboard was McRimmon wi Dandie Did I tell you our orders were to take anything we found into Plymouth The auld deil had just come down overnight puttin two an two together from what Calder had told him when the liner landed the Grotkau s men He had preceesely hit oor time I d hailed Bell for something to eat an he sent it o er in the same boat wi McRimmon when the auld man came to me He grinned an slapped his legs and worked his eyebrows the while I ate How do Holdock Steiner Chase feed their men said he Ye can see I said knockin the top off another beer bottle I did not sign to be starved McRimmon Nor to swum either said he for Bell had tauld him how I carried the line aboard Well I m thinkin you ll be no loser What freight could we ha put into the Lammergeyer would equal salvage on four hunder thousand pounds hull an cargo Eh McPhee This cuts the liver out o Holdock Steiner Chase Company Limited Eh McPhee An I m sufferin from senile dementia now Eh MCPhee An I m not daft am I till I begin to paint the Lammergeyer Eh McPhee Ye may weel lift your leg Dandie I ha the laugh o them all Ye found watter in the engine room To speak wi oot prejudice I said there was some watter They thought she was sinkin after the propeller went She filled wi extraordinary rapeedity Calder said it grieved him an Bannister to abandon her I thought o the dinner at Radley s an what like o food I d eaten for eight days It would grieve them sore I said But the crew would not hear o stayin and workin her back under canvas They re gaun up an down sayin they d ha starved first They d ha starved if they d stayed said I I tak it fra Calder s account there was a mutiny a most Ye know more than I McRimmon I said Speakin wi oot prejudice for we re all in the same boat who opened the bilgecock Oh that s it is it said the auld man an I could see he was surprised A bilge cock ye say I believe it was a bilge cock They were all shut when I came aboard but some one had flooded the engine room eight feet over all and shut it off with the worm an wheel gear from the second gratin afterwards Losh said McRimmon The ineequity o man s beyond belief But it s awfu discreditable to Holdock Steiner Chase if that came oot in court It s just my own curiosity I said Aweel Dandie s afflicted wi the same disease Dandie strive against curiosity for it brings a little dog into traps an suchlike Whaur was the Kite when yon painted liner took off the Grotkau s people Just there or thereabouts I said An which o you twa thought to cover your lights said he winkin Dandle I said to the dog we must both strive against curiosity It s an unremunerative business What s our chance o salvage Dandie He laughed till he choked Tak what I gie you McPhee an be content he said Lord how a man wastes time when he gets old Get aboard the Kite mon as soon as ye can I ve clean forgot there s a Baltic charter yammerin for you at London That ll be your last voyage I m thinkin excep by way o pleasure Steiner s men were comin aboard to take charge an tow her round an I passed young Steiner in a boat as I went to the Kite He looked down his nose but McRimmon pipes up Here s the man ye owe the Grotkau to at a price Steiner at a price Let me introduce mister McPhee to you Maybe ye ve met before but ye ve vara little luck in keepin your men ashore or afloat Young Steiner looked angry enough to eat him as he chuckled an whustled in his dry old throat Ye ve not got your award yet Steiner says Na na says the auld man in a screech ye could hear to the Hoe but I ve twa million sterlin an no bairns ye Judeeas Apella if ye mean to fight an I ll match ye p und for p und till the last p und s oot Ye ken me Steiner I m McRimmon o McNaughten McRimmon Dod he said betwix his teeth sittin back in the boat I ve waited fourteen year to break that Jewfirm an God be thankit I ll do it now The Kite was in the Baltic while the auld man was warkin his warks but I know the assessors valued the Grotkau all told at over three hunder and sixty thousand her manifest was a treat o richness an McRimmon got a third for salvin an abandoned ship Ye see there s vast deeference between towin a ship wi men on her an pickin up a derelict a vast deeference in pounds sterlin Moreover twa three o the Grotkau s crew were burnin to testify about food an there was a note o Calder to the Board in regard to the tail shaft that would ha been vara damagin if it had come into court They knew better than to fight Syne the Kite came back an McRimmon paid off me an Bell personally an the rest of the crew pro rata I believe it s ca ed My share oor share I should say was just twenty five thousand pound sterlin At this point Janet jumped up and kissed him Five and twenty thousand pound sterlin Noo I m fra the North and I m not the like to fling money awa rashly but I d gie six months pay one hunder an twenty pounds to know who flooded the engine room of the Grotkau I m fairly well acquaint wi McRimmon s eediosyncrasies and he d no hand in it It was not Calder for I ve asked him an he wanted to fight me It would be in the highest degree unprofessional o Calder not fightin but openin bilge cocks but for a while I thought it was him Ay I judged it might be him under temptation What s your theory I demanded Weel I m inclined to think it was one o those singular providences that remind us we re in the hands o Higher Powers It couldn t open and shut itself I did not mean that but some half starvin oiler or maybe trimmer must ha opened it awhile to mak sure o leavin the Grotkau It s a demoralisin thing to see an engine room flood up after any accident to the gear demoralisin and deceptive both Aweel the man got what he wanted for they went aboard the liner cryin that the Grotkau was sinkin But it s curious to think o the consequences In a human probability he s bein damned in heaps at the present moment aboard another tramp freighter an here am I wi five an twenty thousand pound invested resolute to go to sea no more providential s the preceese word except as a passenger ye ll understand Janet McPhee kept his word He and Janet went for a voyage as passengers in the first class saloon They paid seventy pounds for their berths and Janet found a very sick woman in the second class saloon so that for sixteen days she lived below and chatted with the stewardesses at the foot of the second saloon stairs while her patient slept McPhee was a passenger for exactly twenty four hours Then the engineers mess where the oilcloth tables are joyfully took him to its bosom and for the rest of the voyage that company was richer by the unpaid services of a highly certificated engineer AN ERROR IN THE FOURTH DIMENSION Before he was thirty he discovered that there was no one to play with him Though the wealth of three toilsome generations stood to his account though his tastes in the matter of books bindings rugs swords bronzes lacquer pictures plate statuary horses conservatories and agriculture were educated and catholic the public opinion of his country wanted to know why he did not go to office daily as his father had before him So he fled and they howled behind him that he was an unpatriotic Anglomaniac born to consume fruits one totally lacking in public spirit He wore an eyeglass he had built a wall round his country house with a high gate that shut instead of inviting America to sit on his flower beds he ordered his clothes from England and the press of his abiding city cursed him from his eye glass to his trousers for two consecutive days When he rose to light again it was where nothing less than the tents of an invading army in Piccadilly would make any difference to anybody If he had money and leisure England stood ready to give him all that money and leisure could buy That price paid she would ask no questions He took his cheque book and accumulated things warily at first for he remembered that in America things own the man To his delight he discovered that in England he could put his belongings under his feet for classes ranks and denominations of people rose as it were from the earth and silently and discreetly took charge of his possessions They had been born and bred for that sole purpose servants of the cheque book When that was at an end they would depart as mysteriously as they had come The impenetrability of this regulated life irritated him and he strove to learn something of the human side of these people He retired baffled to be trained by his menials In America the native demoralises the English servant In England the servant educates the master Wilton Sargent strove to learn all they taught as ardently as his father had striven to wreck before capture the railways of his native land and it must have been some touch of the old bandit railway blood that bade him buy for a song Holt Hangars whose forty acre lawn as every one knows sweeps down in velvet to the quadruple tracks of the Great Buchonian Railway Their trains flew by almost continuously with a bee like drone in the day and a flutter of strong wings at night The son of Merton Sargent had good right to be interested in them He owned controlling interests in several thousand miles of track not permanent way built on altogether different plans where locomotives eternally whistled for grade crossings and parlor cars of fabulous expense and unrestful design skated round curves that the Great Buchonian would have condemned as unsafe in a construction line From the edge of his lawn he could trace the chaired metals falling away rigid as a bowstring into the valley of the Prest studded with the long perspective of the block signals buttressed with stone and carried high above all possible risk on a forty foot embankment Left to himself he would have builded a private car and kept it at the nearest railway station Amberley Royal five miles away But those into whose hands he had committed himself for his English training had little knowledge of railways and less of private cars The one they knew was something that existed in the scheme of things for their convenience The other they held to be distinctly American and with the versatility of his race Wilton Sargent had set out to be just a little more English than the English He succeeded to admiration He learned not to redecorate Holt Hangars though he warmed it to leave his guests alone to refrain from superfluous introductions to abandon manners of which he had great store and to hold fast by manner which can after labour be acquired He learned to let other people hired for the purpose attend to the duties for which they were paid He learned this he got from a ditcher on the estate that every man with whom he came in contact had his decreed position in the fabric of the realm which position he would do well to consult Last mystery of all he learned to golf well and when an American knows the innermost meaning of Don t press slow back and keep your eye on the ball he is for practical purposes denationalised His other education proceeded on the pleasantest lines Was he interested in any conceivable thing in heaven above or the earth beneath or the waters under the earth Forthwith appeared at his table guided by those safe hands into which he had fallen the very men who had best said done written explored excavated built launched created or studied that one thing herders of books and prints in the British Museum specialists in scarabs cartouches and dynasties Egyptian rovers and raiders from the heart of unknown lands toxicologists orchid hunters monographers on flint implements carpets prehistoric man or early Renaissance music They came and they played with him They asked no questions they cared not so much as a pin who or what he was They demanded only that he should be able to talk and listen courteously Their work was done elsewhere and out of his sight There were also women Never said Wilton Sargent to himself has an American seen England as I m seeing it and he thought blushing beneath the bedclothes of the unregenerate and blatant days when he would steam to office down the Hudson in his twelve hundred ton ocean going steam yacht and arrive by gradations at Bleecker Street hanging on to a leather strap between an Irish washerwoman and a German anarchist If any of his guests had seen him then they would have said How distinctly American and Wilton did not care for that tone He had schooled himself to an English walk and so long as he did not raise it an English voice He did not gesticulate with his hands he sat down on most of his enthusiasms but he could not rid himself of The Shibboleth He would ask for the Worcestershire sauce even Howard his immaculate butler could not break him of this It was decreed that he should complete his education in a wild and wonderful manner and further that I should be in at that death Wilton had more than once asked me to Holt Hangars for the purpose of showing how well the new life fitted him and each time I had declared it creaseless His third invitation was more informal than the others and he hinted of some matter in which he was anxious for my sympathy or counsel or both There is room for an infinity of mistakes when a man begins to take liberties with his nationality and I went down expecting things A seven foot dog cart and a groom in the black Holt Hangars livery met me at Amberley Royal At Holt Hangars I was received by a person of elegance and true reserve and piloted to my luxurious chamber There were no other guests in the house and this set me thinking Wilton came into my room about half an hour before dinner and though his face was masked with a drop curtain of highly embroidered indifference I could see that he was not at ease In time for he was then almost as difficult to move as one of my own countrymen I extracted the tale simple in its extravagance extravagant in its simplicity It seemed that Hackman of the British Museum had been staying with him about ten days before boasting of scarabs Hackman has a way of carrying really priceless antiquities on his tie ring and in his trouser pockets Apparently he had intercepted something on its way to the Boulak Museum which he said was a genuine Amen Hotepa queen s scarab of the Fourth Dynasty Now Wilton had bought from Cassavetti whose reputation is not above suspicion a scarab of much the same scarabeousness and had left it in his London chambers Hackman at a venture but knowing Cassavetti pronounced it an imposition There was long discussion savant versus millionaire one saying ut I know it cannot be and the other But I can and will prove it Wilton found it necessary for his soul s satisfaction to go up to town then and there a forty mile run and bring back the scarab before dinner It was at this point that he began to cut corners with disastrous results Amberley Royal station being five miles away and putting in of horses a matter of time Wilton had told Howard the immaculate butler to signal the next train to stop and Howard who was more of a man of resource than his master gave him credit for had with the red flag of the ninth hole of the links which crossed the bottom of the lawn signalled vehemently to the first down train and it had stopped Here Wilton s account became confused He attempted it seems to get into that highly indignant express but a guard restrained him with more or less force hauled him in fact backyards from the window of a locked carriage Wilton must have struck the gravel with some vehemence for the consequences he admitted were a free fight on the line in which he lost his hat and was at last dragged into the guard s van and set down breathless He had pressed money upon the man and very foolishly had explained everything but his name This he clung to for he had a vision of tall head lines in the New York papers and well knew no son of Merton Sargent could expect mercy that side the water The guard to Wilton s amazement refused the money on the grounds that this was a matter for the Company to attend to Wilton insisted on his incognito and therefore found two policemen waiting for him at saint Botolph terminus When he expressed a wish to buy a new hat and telegraph to his friends both policemen with one voice warned him that whatever he said would be used as evidence against him and this had impressed Wilton tremendously They were so infernally polite he said If they had clubbed me I wouldn t have cared but it was Step this way sir and Up those stairs please sir till they jailed me jailed me like a common drunk and I had to stay in a filthy little cubby hole of a cell all night That comes of not giving your name and not wiring your lawyer I replied What did you get Forty shillings or a month said Wilton promptly next morning bright and early They were working us off three a minute A girl in a pink hat she was brought in at three in the morning got ten days I suppose I was lucky I must have knocked his senses out of the guard He told the old duck on the bench that I had told him I was a sergeant in the army and that I was gathering beetles on the track That comes of trying to explain to an Englishman And you Oh I said nothing I wanted to get out I paid my fine and bought a new hat and came up here before noon next morning There were a lot of people in the house and I told em I d been unavoidably detained and then they began to recollect engagements elsewhere Hackman must have seen the fight on the track and made a story of it I suppose they thought it was distinctly American confound em It s the only time in my life that I ve ever flagged a train and I wouldn t have done it but for that scarab T wouldn t hurt their old trains to be held up once in a while Well it s all over now I said choking a little And your name didn t get into the papers It is rather transatlantic when you come to think of it Over Wilton grunted savagely It s only just begun That trouble with the guard was just common ordinary assault merely a little criminal business The flagging of the train is civil infernally civil and means something quite different They re after me for that now Who The Great Buchonian There was a man in court watching the case on behalf of the Company I gave him my name in a quiet corner before I bought my hat and come to dinner now I ll show you the results afterwards The telling of his wrongs had worked Wilton Sargent into a very fine temper and I do not think that my conversation soothed him In the course of the dinner prompted by a devil of pure mischief I dwelt with loving insistence on certain smells and sounds of New York which go straight to the heart of the native in foreign parts and Wilton began to ask many questions about his associates aforetime men of the New York Yacht Club Storm King or the Restigouche owners of rivers ranches and shipping in their playtime lords of railways kerosene wheat and cattle in their offices When the green mint came I gave him a peculiarly oily and atrocious cigar of the brand they sell in the tessellated electric lighted with expensive pictures of the nude adorned bar of the Pandemonium and Wilton chewed the end for several minutes ere he lit it The butler left us alone and the chimney of the oak panelled diningroom began to smoke That s another said he poking the fire savagely and I knew what he meant One cannot put steam heat in houses where Queen Elizabeth slept The steady beat of a night mail whirling down the valley recalled me to business What about the Great Buchonian I said Come into my study That s all as yet It was a pile of Seidlitz powders coloured correspondence perhaps nine inches high and it looked very businesslike You can go through it said Wilton Now I could take a chair and a red flag and go into Hyde Park and say the most atrocious things about your Queen and preach anarchy and all that y know till I was hoarse and no one would take any notice The Police damn em would protect me if I got into trouble But for a little thing like flagging a dirty little sawed off train running through my own grounds too I get the whole British Constitution down on me as if I sold bombs I don t understand it No more does the Great Buchonian apparently I was turning over the letters Here s the traffic superintendent writing that it s utterly incomprehensible that any man should Good heavens Wilton you have done it I giggled as I read on What s funny now said my host It seems that you or Howard for you stopped the three forty Northern down I ought to know that They all had their knife into me from the engine driver up But it s the three forty the Induna surely you ve heard of the Great Buchonian s Induna How the deuce am I to know one train from another They come along about every two minutes Quite so But this happens to be the Induna the one train of the whole line She s timed for fifty seven miles an hour She was put on early in the Sixties and she has never been stopped I know Since William the Conqueror came over or King Charles hid in her smoke stack You re as bad as the rest of these Britishers If she s been run all that while it s time she was flagged once or twice The American was beginning to ooze out all over Wilton and his small boned hands were moving restlessly Suppose you flagged the Empire State Express or the Western Cyclone Suppose I did I know Otis Harvey or used to I d send him a wire and he d understand it was a ground hog case with me That s exactly what I told this British fossil company here Have you been answering their letters without legal advice then Of course I have Oh my Sainted Country Go ahead Wilton I wrote em that I d be very happy to see their president and explain to him in three words all about it but that wouldn t do Seems their president must be a god He was too busy and well you can read for yourself they wanted explanations The stationmaster at Amberley Royal and he grovels before me as a rule wanted an explanation and quick too The head sachem at saint Botolph s wanted three or four and the Lord High Mukkamuk that oils the locomotives wanted one every fine day I told em I ve told hem about fifty times I stopped their holy and sacred train because I wanted to board her Did they think I wanted to feel her pulse You didn t say that Feel her pulse Of course not No Board her What else could I say My dear Wilton what is the use of missus Sherborne and the Clays and all that lot working over you for four years to make an Englishman out of you if the very first time you re rattled you go back to the vernacular I m through with missus Sherborne and the rest of the crowd America s good enough for me What ought I to have said Please or thanks awf ly or how There was no chance now of mistaking the man s nationality Speech gesture and step so carefully drilled into him had gone away with the borrowed mask of indifference It was a lawful son of the Youngest People whose predecessors were the Red Indian His voice had risen to the high throaty crow of his breed when they labour under excitement His close set eyes showed by turns unnecessary fear annoyance beyond reason rapid and purposeless flights of thought the child s lust for immediate revenge and the child s pathetic bewilderment who knocks his head against the bad wicked table And on the other side I knew stood the Company as unable as Wilton to understand And I could buy their old road three times over he muttered playing with a paper knife and moving restlessly to and fro You didn t tell em that I hope There was no answer but as I went through the letters I felt that Wilton must have told them many surprising things The Great Buchonian had first asked for an explanation of the stoppage of their Induna and had found a certain levity in the explanation tendered It then advised mister W Sargent to refer his solicitor to their solicitor or whatever the legal phrase is And you didn t I said looking up No They were treating me exactly as if I had been a kid playing on the cable tracks There was not the least necessity for any solicitor Five minutes quiet talk would have settled everything I returned to the correspondence The Great Buchonian regretted that owing to pressure of business none of their directors could accept mister W Sargent s invitation to run down and discuss the difficulty The Great Buchonian was careful to point out that no animus underlay their action nor was money their object Their duty was to protect the interests of their line and these interests could not be protected if a precedent were established whereby any of the Queen s subjects could stop a train in mid career Again this was another branch of the correspondence not more than five heads of departments being concerned the Company admitted that there was some reasonable doubt as to the duties of express trains in all crises and the matter was open to settlement by process of law till an authoritative ruling was obtained from the House of Lords if necessary That broke me all up said Wilton who was reading over my shoulder I knew I d struck the British Constitution at last The House of Lords my Lord And anyway I m not one of the Queen s subjects Why I had a notion that you d got yourself naturalised Wilton blushed hotly as he explained that very many things must happen to the British Constitution ere he took out his papers How does it all strike you he said Isn t the Great Buchonian crazy I don t know You ve done something that no one ever thought of doing before and the Company don t know what to make of it I see they offer to send down their solicitor and another official of the Company to talk things over informally Then here s another letter suggesting that you put up a fourteen foot wall crowned with bottle glass at the bottom of the garden Talk of British insolence The man who recommends that he s another bloated functionary says that I shall derive great pleasure from watching the wall going up day by day Did you ever dream of such gall I ve offered em money enough to buy a new set of cars and pension the driver for three generations but that doesn t seem to be what they want They expect me to go to the House of Lords and get a ruling and build walls between times Are they all stark raving mad One ud think I made a profession of flagging trains How in Tophet was I to know their old Induna from a waytrain I took the first that came along and I ve been jailed and fined for that once already That was for slugging the guard He had no right to haul me out when I was half way through a window What are you going to do about it Their lawyer and the other official can t they trust their men unless they send em in pairs are coming hereto night I told em I was busy as a rule till after dinner but they might send along the entire directorate if it eased em any Now after dinner visiting for business or pleasure is the custom of the smaller American town and not that of England where the end of the day is sacred to the owner not the public Verily Wilton Sargent had hoisted the striped flag of rebellion Isn t it time that the humour of the situation began to strike you Wilton I asked Where s the humour of baiting an American citizen just because he happens to be a millionaire poor devil He was silent for a little time and then went on Of course Now I see He spun round and faced me excitedly It s as plain as mud These ducks are laying their pipes to skin me They say explicitly they don t want money That s all a blind So s their addressing me as W Sargent They know well enough who I am They know I m the old man s son Why didn t I think of that before One minute Wilton If you climbed to the top of the dome of saint Paul s and offered a reward to any Englishman who could tell you who or what Merton Sargent had been there wouldn t be twenty men in all London to claim it That s their insular provincialism then I don t care a cent The old man would have wrecked the Great Buchonian before breakfast for a pipe opener My God I ll do it in dead earnest I ll show em that they can t bulldoze a foreigner for flagging one of their little tinpot trains and I ve spent fifty thousand a year here at least for the last four years I was glad I was not his lawyer I re read the correspondence notably the letter which recommended him almost tenderly I fancied to build a fourteen foot brick wall at the end of his garden and half way through it a thought struck me which filled me with pure joy The footman ushered in two men frock coated grey trousered smooth shaven heavy of speech and gait It was nearly nine o clock but they looked as newly come from a bath I could not understand why the elder and taller of the pair glanced at me as though we had an understanding nor why he shook hands with an unEnglish warmth This simplifies the situation he said in an undertone and as I stared he whispered to his companion I fear I shall be of very little service at present Perhaps mister Folsom had better talk over the affair with mister Sargent That is what I am here for said Wilton The man of law smiled pleasantly and said that he saw no reason why the difficulty should not be arranged in two minutes quiet talk His air as he sat down opposite Wilton was soothing to the last degree and his companion drew me up stage The mystery was deepening but I followed meekly and heard Wilton say with an uneasy laugh I ve had insomnia over this affair mister Folsom Let s settle it one way or the other for heaven s sake Ah Has he suffered much from this lately said my man with a preliminary cough I really can t say I replied Then I suppose you have only lately taken charge here I came this evening I am not exactly in charge of anything I see Merely to observe the course of events in case He nodded Exactly Observation after all is my trade He coughed again slightly and came to business Now I am asking solely for information s sake do you find the delusions persistent Which delusions They are variable then That is distinctly curious because but do I understand that the type of the delusion varies For example mister Sargent believes that he can buy the Great Buchonian Did he write you that He made the offer to the Company on a half sheet of note paper Now has he by chance gone to the other extreme and believed that he is in danger of becoming a pauper The curious economy in the use of a half sheet of paper shows that some idea of that kind might have flashed through his mind and the two delusions can coexist but it is not common As you must know the delusion of vast wealth the folly of grandeurs I believe our friends the French call it is as a rule persistent to the exclusion of all others Then I heard Wilton s best English voice at the end of the study My dear sir I have explained twenty times already I wanted to get that scarab in time for dinner Suppose you had left an important legal document in the same way That touch of cunning is very significant my fellow practitioner since he insisted on it muttered I am very happy of course to meet you but if you had only sent your president down to dinner here I could have settled the thing in half a minute Why I could have bought the Buchonian from him while your clerks were sending me this Wilton dropped his hand heavily on the blue and white correspondence and the lawyer started But speaking frankly the lawyer replied it is if I may say so perfectly inconceivable even in the case of the most important legal documents that any one should stop the three forty express the Induna Our Induna my dear sir Absolutely my companion echoed then to me in a lower tone You notice again the persistent delusion of wealth I was called in when he wrote us that You can see it is utterly impossible for the Company to continue to run their trains through the property of a man who may at any moment fancy himself divinely commissioned to stop all traffic If he had only referred us to his lawyer but naturally that he would not do under the circumstances A pity a great pity He is so young By the way it is curious is it not to note the absolute conviction in the voice of those who are similarly afflicted heart rending I might say and the inability to follow a chain of connected thought I can t see what you want Wilton was saying to the lawyer It need not be more than fourteen feet high a really desirable structure and it would be possible to grow pear trees on the sunny side The lawyer was speaking in an unprofessional voice There are few things pleasanter than to watch so to say one s own vine and fig tree in full bearing Consider the profit and amusement you would derive from it If you could see your way to doing this we could arrange all the details with your lawyer and it is possible that the Company might bear some of the cost I have put the matter I trust in a nutshell If you my dear sir will interest yourself in building that wall and will kindly give us the name of your lawyers I dare assure you that you will hear no more from the Great Buchonian But why am I to disfigure my lawn with a new brick wall Grey flint is extremely picturesque Grey flint then if you put it that way Why the dickens must I go building towers of Babylon just because I have held up one of your trains once The expression he used in his third letter was that he wished to board her said my companion in my ear That was very curious a marine delusion impinging as it were upon a land one What a marvellous world he must move in and will before the curtain falls So young too so very young Well if you want the plain English of it I m damned if I go wall building to your orders You can fight it all along the line into the House of Lords and out again and get your rulings by the running foot if you like said Wilton hotly Great heavens man I only did it once We have at present no guarantee that you may not do it again and with our traffic we must in justice to our passengers demand some form of guarantee It must not serve as a precedent All this might have been saved if you had only referred us to your legal representative The lawyer looked appealingly around the room The dead lock was complete Wilton I asked may I try my hand now Anything you like said Wilton It seems I can t talk English I won t build any wall though He threw himself back in his chair Gentlemen I said deliberately for I perceived that the doctor s mind would turn slowly mister Sargent has very large interests in the chief railway systems of his own country His own country said the lawyer At that age said the doctor Certainly He inherited them from his father mister Sargent who was an American And proud of it said Wilton as though he had been a Western Senator let loose on the Continent for the first time My dear sir said the lawyer half rising why did you not acquaint the Company with this fact this vital fact early in our correspondence We should have understood We should have made allowances Allowances be damned Am I a Red Indian or a lunatic The two men looked guilty If mister Sargent s friend had told us as much in the beginning said the doctor very severely much might have been saved Alas I had made a life s enemy of that doctor I hadn t a chance I replied Now of course you can see that a man who owns several thousand miles of line as mister Sargent does would be apt to treat railways a shade more casually than other people Of course of course He is an American that accounts Still it was the Induna but I can quite understand that the customs of our cousins across the water differ in these particulars from ours And do you always stop trains in this way in the States mister Sargent I should if occasion ever arose but I ve never had to yet Are you going to make an international complication of the business You need give yourself no further concern whatever in the matter We see that there is no likelihood of this action of yours establishing a precedent which was the only thing we were afraid of Now that you understand that we cannot reconcile our system to any sudden stoppages we feel quite sure that I sha n t be staying long enough to flag another train Wilton said pensively You are returning then to our fellow kinsmen across the ah big pond you call it No sir The ocean the North Atlantic Ocean It s three thousand miles broad and three miles deep in places I wish it were ten thousand I am not so fond of sea travel myself but I think it is every Englishman s duty once in his life to study the great branch of our Anglo Saxon race across the ocean said the lawyer If ever you come over and care to flag any train on my system I ll I ll see you through said Wilton Thank you ah thank you You re very kind I m sure I should enjoy myself immensely We have overlooked the fact the doctor whispered to me that your friend proposed to buy the Great Buchonian He is worth anything from twenty to thirty million dollars four to five million pounds I answered knowing that it would be hopeless to explain Really That is enormous wealth But the Great Buchonian is not in the market Perhaps he does not want to buy it now It would be impossible under any circumstances said the doctor How characteristic murmured the lawyer reviewing matters in his mind I always understood from books that your countrymen were in a hurry And so you would have gone forty miles to town and back before dinner to get a scarab How intensely American But you talk exactly like an Englishman mister Sargent That is a fault that can be remedied There s only one question I d like to ask you You said it was inconceivable that any man should stop a train on your road And so it is absolutely inconceivable Any sane man that is That is what I meant of course I mean with excep Thank you The two men departed Wilton checked himself as he was about to fill a pipe took one of my cigars instead and was silent for fifteen minutes Then said he Have you got a list of the Southampton sailings on you Far away from the greystone wings the dark cedars the faultless gravel drives and the mint sauce lawns of Holt Hangars runs a river called the Hudson whose unkempt banks are covered with the palaces of those wealthy beyond the dreams of avarice Here where the hoot of the Haverstraw brick barge tug answers the howl of the locomotive on either shore you shall find with a complete installation of electric light nickel plated binnacles and a calliope attachment to her steam whistle the twelve hundred ton ocean going steam yacht Columbia lying at her private pier to take to his office at an average speed of seventeen knots an hour and the barges can look out for themselves Wilton Sargent American MY SUNDAY AT HOME If the Red Slayer think he slays Or if the slain think he is slain They know not well the subtle ways I keep and pass and turn again EMERSON It was the unreproducible slid r as he said this was his fy ist visit to England that told me he was a New Yorker from New York and when in the course of our long lazy journey westward from Waterloo he enlarged upon the beauties of his city I professing ignorance said no word He had amazed and delighted at the man s civility given the London porter a shilling for carrying his bag nearly fifty yards he had thoroughly investigated the first class lavatory compartment which the London and Southwestern sometimes supply without extra charge and now half awed half contemptuous but wholly interested he looked out upon the ordered English landscape wrapped in its Sunday peace while I watched the wonder grow upon his face Why were the cars so short and stilted Why had every other freight car a tarpaulin drawn over it What wages would an engineer get now Where was the swarming population of England he had read so much about What was the rank of all those men on tricycles along the roads When were we due at Plymouth I told him all I knew and very much that I did not He was going to Plymouth to assist in a consultation upon a fellow countryman who had retired to a place called The Hoe was that up town or down town to recover from nervous dyspepsia Yes he himself was a doctor by profession and how any one in England could retain any nervous disorder passed his comprehension Never had he dreamed of an atmosphere so soothing Even the deep rumble of London traffic was monastical by comparison with some cities he could name and the country why it was Paradise A continuance of it he confessed would drive him mad but for a few months it was the most sumptuous rest cure in his knowledge I ll come over every year after this he said in a burst of delight as we ran between two ten foot hedges of pink and white may It s seeing all the things I ve ever read about Of course it doesn t strike you that way I presume you belong here What a finished land it is It s arrived Must have been born this way Now where I used to live Hello I what s up The train stopped in a blaze of sunshine at Framlynghame Admiral which is made up entirely of the name board two platforms and an overhead bridge without even the usual siding I had never known the slowest of locals stop here before but on Sunday all things are possible to the London and Southwestern One could hear the drone of conversation along the carriages and scarcely less loud the drone of the bumblebees in the wallflowers up the bank My companion thrust his head through the window and sniffed luxuriously Where are we now said he In Wiltshire said I Ah A man ought to be able to write novels with his left hand in a country like this Well well And so this is about Tess s country ain t it I feel just as if I were in a book Say the conduc the guard has something on his mind What s he getting at The splendid badged and belted guard was striding up the platform at the regulation official pace and in the regulation official voice was saying at each door Has any gentleman here a bottle of medicine A gentleman has taken a bottle of poison laudanum by mistake Between each five paces he looked at an official telegram in his hand refreshed his memory and said his say The dreamy look on my companion s face he had gone far away with Tess passed with the speed of a snap shutter After the manner of his countrymen he had risen to the situation jerked his bag down from the overhead rail opened it and I heard the click of bottles Find out where the man is he said briefly I ve got something here that will fix him if he can swallow still Swiftly I fled up the line of carriages in the wake of the guard There was clamour in a rear compartment the voice of one bellowing to be let out and the feet of one who kicked With the tail of my eye I saw the New York doctor hastening thither bearing in his hand a blue and brimming glass from the lavatory compartment The guard I found scratching his head unofficially by the engine and murmuring Well I put a bottle of medicine off at Andover I m sure I did Better say it again any ow said the driver Orders is orders Say it again Once more the guard paced back I anxious to attract his attention trotting at his heels In a minute in a minute sir he said waving an arm capable of starting all the traffic on the London and Southwestern Railway at a wave Has any gentleman here got a bottle of medicine A gentleman has taken a bottle of poison laudanum by mistake Where s the man I gasped Woking Ere s my orders He showed me the telegram on which were the words to be said E must have left is bottle in the train an took another by mistake E s been wirin from Woking awful an now I come to think of it I m nearly sure I put a bottle of medicine off at Andover Then the man that took the poison isn t in the train Lord no sir No one didn t take poison that way E took it away with im in is ands E s wirin from Wokin My orders was to ask everybody in the train and I ave an we re four minutes late now Are you comin on sir No Right be ind There is nothing unless perhaps the English language more terrible than the workings of an English railway line An instant before it seemed as though we were going to spend all eternity at Framlynghame Admiral and now I was watching the tail of the train disappear round the curve of the cutting But I was not alone On the one bench of the down platform sat the largest navvy I have ever seen in my life softened and made affable for he smiled generously with liquor In his huge hands he nursed an empty tumbler marked L S W R marked also internally with streaks of blue grey sediment Before him a hand on his shoulder stood the doctor and as I came within ear shot this is what I heard him say Just you hold on to your patience for a minute or two longer and you ll be as right as ever you were in your life I ll stay with you till you re better Lord I m comfortable enough said the navvy Never felt better in my life Turning to me the doctor lowered his voice He might have died while that fool conduct guard was saying his piece I ve fixed him though The stuff s due in about five minutes but there s a heap to him I don t see how we can make him take exercise For the moment I felt as though seven pounds of crushed ice had been neatly applied in the form of a compress to my lower stomach How how did you manage it I gasped I asked him if he d have a drink He was knocking spots out of the car strength of his constitution I suppose He said he d go most anywhere for a drink so I lured onto the platform and loaded him up Cold blooded people you Britishers are That train s gone and no one seemed to care a cent We ve missed it I said He looked at me curiously We ll get another before sundown if that s your only trouble Say porter when s the next train down Seven forty five said the one porter and passed out through the wicket gate into the landscape It was then three twenty of a hot and sleepy afternoon The station was absolutely deserted The navvy had closed his eyes and now nodded That s bad said the doctor The man I mean not the train We must make him walk somehow walk up and down Swiftly as might be I explained the delicacy of the situation and the doctor from New York turned a full bronze green Then he swore comprehensively at the entire fabric of our glorious Constitution cursing the English language root branch and paradigm through its most obscure derivatives His coat and bag lay on the bench next to the sleeper Thither he edged cautiously and I saw treachery in his eye What devil of delay possessed him to slip on his spring overcoat I cannot tell They say a slight noise rouses a sleeper more surely than a heavy one and scarcely had the doctor settled himself in his sleeves than the giant waked and seized that silk faced collar in a hot right hand There was rage in his face rage and the realisation of new emotions I m I m not so comfortable as I were he said from the deeps of his interior You ll wait along o me you will He breathed heavily through shut lips Now if there was one thing more than another upon which the doctor had dwelt in his conversation with me it was upon the essential law abidingness not to say gentleness of his much misrepresented country And yet truly it may have been no more than a button that irked him I saw his hand travel backwards to his right hip clutch at something and come away empty He won t kill you I said He ll probably sue you in court if I know my own people Better give him some money from time to time If he keeps quiet till the stuff gets in its work the doctor answered I m all right If he doesn t my name is Emory Julian B Emory one hundred ninety three Steenth Street corner of Madison and I feel worse than I ve ever felt said the navvy with suddenness What did you give me the drink for The matter seemed to be so purely personal that I withdrew to a strategic position on the overhead bridge and abiding in the exact centre looked on from afar I could see the white road that ran across the shoulder of Salisbury Plain unshaded for mile after mile and a dot in the middle distance the back of the one porter returning to Framlynghame Admiral if such a place existed till seven forty five The bell of a church invisible clanked softly There was a rustle in the horse chestnuts to the left of the line and the sound of sheep cropping close The peace of Nirvana lay upon the land and brooding in it my elbow on the warm iron girder of the footbridge it is a forty shilling fine to cross by any other means I perceived as never before how the consequences of our acts run eternal through time and through space If we impinge never so slightly upon the life of a fellow mortal the touch of our personality like the ripple of a stone cast into a pond widens and widens in unending circles across the aeons till the far off Gods themselves cannot say where action ceases Also it was I who had silently set before the doctor the tumbler of the first class lavatory compartment now speeding Plymouthward Yet I was in spirit at least a million leagues removed from that unhappy man of another nationality who had chosen to thrust an inexpert finger into the workings of an alien life The machinery was dragging him up and down the sunlit platform The two men seemed to be learning polka mazurkas together and the burden of their song borne by one deep voice was What did you give me the drink for I saw the flash of silver in the doctor s hand The navvy took it and pocketed it with his left but never for an instant did his strong right leave the doctor s coat collar and as the crisis approached louder and louder rose his bull like roar What did you give me the drink for They drifted under the great twelve inch pinned timbers of the foot bridge towards the bench and I gathered the time was very near at hand The stuff was getting in its work Blue white and blue again rolled over the navvy s face in waves till all settled to one rich clay bank yellow and that fell which fell I thought of the blowing up of Hell Gate of the geysers in the Yellowstone Park of Jonah and his whale but the lively original as I watched it foreshortened from above exceeded all these things He staggered to the bench the heavy wooden seat cramped with iron cramps into the enduring stone and clung there with his left hand It quivered and shook as a breakwater pile quivers to the rush of landward racing seas nor was there lacking when he caught his breath the scream of a maddened beach dragged down by the tide His right hand was upon the doctor s collar so that the two shook to one paroxysm pendulums vibrating together while I apart shook with them It was colossal immense but of certain manifestations the English language stops short French only the caryatid French of Victor Hugo would have described it so I mourned while I laughed hastily shuffling and discarding inadequate adjectives The vehemence of the shock spent itself and the sufferer half fell half knelt across the bench He was calling now upon God and his wife huskily as the wounded bull calls upon the unscathed herd to stay Curiously enough he used no bad language that had gone from him with the rest The doctor exhibited gold It was taken and retained So too was the grip on the coat collar If I could stand boomed the giant despairingly I d smash you you an your drinks I m dyin dyin dyin That s what you think said the doctor You ll find it will do you a lot of good and making a virtue of a somewhat imperative necessity he added I ll stay by you If you d let go of me a minute I d give you something that would settle you You ve settled me now you damned anarchist Takin the bread out of the mouth of an English workin man But I ll keep old of you till I m well or dead I never did you no arm S pose I were a little full They pumped me out once at Guy s with a stummick pump I could see that but I can t see this ere an it s killin of me by slow degrees You ll be all right in half an hour What do you suppose I d want to kill you for said the doctor who came of a logical breed Ow do I know Tell em in court You ll get seven years for this you body snatcher That s what you are a bloomin bodysnatcher There s justice I tell you in England and my Union ll prosecute too We don t stand no tricks with people s insides ere They give a woman ten years for a sight less than this An you ll ave to pay undreds an undreds o pounds besides a pension to the missus You ll see you physickin furriner Where s your licence to do such You ll catch it I tell you Then I observed what I have frequently observed before that a man who is but reasonably afraid of an altercation with an alien has a most poignant dread of the operations of foreign law The doctor s voice was flute like in its exquisite politeness as he answered But I ve given you a very great deal of money fif three pounds I think An what s three pound for poisonin the likes o me They told me at Guy s I d fetch twenty cold on the slates Ouh It s comin again A second time he was cut down by the foot as it were and the straining bench rocked to and fro as I averted my eyes It was the very point of perfection in the heart of an English May day The unseen tides of the air had turned and all nature was setting its face with the shadows of the horse chestnuts towards the peace of the coming night But there were hours yet I knew long long hours of the eternal English twilight to the ending of the day I was well content to be alive to abandon myself to the drift of Time and Fate to absorb great peace through my skin and to love my country with the devotion that three thousand miles of intervening sea bring to fullest flower And what a garden of Eden it was this fatted clipped and washen land A man could camp in any open field with more sense of home and security than the stateliest buildings of foreign cities could afford And the joy was that it was all mine alienably groomed hedgerow spotless road decent greystone cottage serried spinney tasselled copse apple bellied hawthorn and well grown tree A light puff of wind it scattered flakes of may over the gleaming rails gave me a faint whiff as it might have been of fresh cocoanut and I knew that the golden gorse was in bloom somewhere out of sight Linneeus had thanked God on his bended knees when he first saw a field of it and by the way the navvy was on his knees too But he was by no means praying He was purely disgustful The doctor was compelled to bend over him his face towards the back of the seat and from what I had seen I supposed the navvy was now dead If that were the case it would be time for me to go but I knew that so long as a man trusts himself to the current of Circumstance reaching out for and rejecting nothing that comes his way no harm can overtake him It is the contriver the schemer who is caught by the Law and never the philosopher I knew that when the play was played Destiny herself would move me on from the corpse and I felt very sorry for the doctor In the far distance presumably upon the road that led to Framlynghame Admiral there appeared a vehicle and a horse the one ancient fly that almost every village can produce at need This thing was advancing unpaid by me towards the station would have to pass along the deep cut lane below the railway bridge and come out on the doctor s side I was in the centre of things so all sides were alike to me Here then was my machine from the machine When it arrived something would happen or something else For the rest I owned my deeply interested soul The doctor by the seat turned so far as his cramped position allowed his head over his left shoulder and laid his right hand upon his lips I threw back my hat and elevated my eyebrows in the form of a question The doctor shut his eyes and nodded his head slowly twice or thrice beckoning me to come I descended cautiously and it was as the signs had told The navvy was asleep empty to the lowest notch yet his hand clutched still the doctor s collar and at the lightest movement the doctor was really very cramped tightened mechanically as the hand of a sick woman tightens on that of the watcher He had dropped squatting almost upon his heels and falling lower had dragged the doctor over to the left The doctor thrust his right hand which was free into his pocket drew forth some keys and shook his head The navvy gurgled in his sleep Silently I dived into my pocket took out one sovereign and held it up between finger and thumb Again the doctor shook his head Money was not what was lacking to his peace His bag had fallen from the seat to the ground He looked towards it and opened his mouth O shape The catch was not a difficult one and when I had mastered it the doctor s right forefinger was sawing the air With an immense caution I extracted from the bag such a knife as they use for cutting collops off legs The doctor frowned and with his first and second fingers imitated the action of scissors Again I searched and found a most diabolical pair of cock nosed shears capable of vandyking the interiors of elephants The doctor then slowly lowered his left shoulder till the navvy s right wrist was supported by the bench pausing a moment as the spent volcano rumbled anew Lower and lower the doctor sank kneeling now by the navvy s side till his head was on a level with and just in front of the great hairy fist and there was no tension on the coat collar Then light dawned on me Beginning a little to the right of the spinal column I cut a huge demilune out of his new spring overcoat bringing it round as far under his left side which was the right side of the navvy as I dared Passing thence swiftly to the back of the seat and reaching between the splines I sawed through the silk faced front on the left hand side of the coat till the two cuts joined Cautiously as the box turtle of his native heath the doctor drew away sideways and to the right with the air of a frustrated burglar coming out from under a bed and stood up free one black diagonal shoulder projecting through the grey of his ruined overcoat I returned the scissors to the bag snapped the catch and held all out to him as the wheels of the fly rang hollow under the railway arch It came at a footpace past the wicket gate of the station and the doctor stopped it with a whisper It was going some five miles across country to bring home from church some one I could not catch the name because his own carriage horses were lame Its destination happened to be the one place in all the world that the doctor was most burningly anxious to visit and he promised the driver untold gold to drive to some ancient flame of his Helen Blazes she was called Aren t you coming too he said bundling his overcoat into his bag Now the fly had been so obviously sent to the doctor and to no one else that I had no concern with it Our roads I saw divided and there was further a need upon me to laugh I shall stay here I said It s a very pretty country My God he murmured as softly as he shut the door and I felt that it was a prayer Then he went out of my life and I shaped my course for the railway bridge It was necessary to pass by the bench once more but the wicket was between us The departure of the fly had waked the navvy He crawled on to the seat and with malignant eyes watched the driver flog down the road The man inside o that he called as poisoned me E s a body snatcher E s comin back again when I m cold Ere s my evidence He waved his share of the overcoat and I went my way because I was hungry Framlynghame Admiral village is a good two miles from the station and I waked the holy calm of the evening every step of that way with shouts and yells casting myself down in the flank of the good green hedge when I was too weak to stand There was an inn a blessed inn with a thatched roof and peonies in the garden and I ordered myself an upper chamber in which the Foresters held their courts for the laughter was not all out of me A bewildered woman brought me ham and eggs and I leaned out of the mullioned window and laughed between mouthfuls I sat long above the beer and the perfect smoke that followed till the lights changed in the quiet street and I began to think of the seven forty five down and all that world of the Arabian Nights I had quitted Descending I passed a giant in moleskins who filled the low ceiled tap room Many empty plates stood before him and beyond them a fringe of the Framlynghame Admiralty to whom he was unfolding a wondrous tale of anarchy of body snatching of bribery and the Valley of the Shadow from the which he was but newly risen And as he talked he ate and as he ate he drank for there was much room in him and anon he paid royally speaking of Justice and the Law before whom all Englishmen are equal and all foreigners and anarchists vermin and slime On my way to the station he passed me with great strides his head high among the low flying bats his feet firm on the packed road metal his fists clinched and his breath coming sharply There was a beautiful smell in the air the smell of white dust bruised nettles and smoke that brings tears to the throat of a man who sees his country but seldom a smell like the echoes of the lost talk of lovers the infinitely suggestive odour of an immemorial civilisation It was a perfect walk and lingering on every step I came to the station just as the one porter lighted the last of a truckload of lamps and set them back in the lamp room while he dealt tickets to four or five of the population who not contented with their own peace thought fit to travel It was no ticket that the navvy seemed to need He was sitting on a bench wrathfully grinding a tumbler into fragments with his heel I abode in obscurity at the end of the platform interested as ever thank Heaven in my surroundings There was a jar of wheels on the road The navvy rose as they approached strode through the wicket and laid a hand upon a horse s bridle that brought the beast up on his hireling hind legs It was the providential fly coming back and for a moment I wondered whether the doctor had been mad enough to revisit his practice Get away you re drunk said the driver I m not said the navvy I ve been waitin ere hours and hours Come out you beggar inside there Go on driver said a voice I did not know a crisp clear English voice All right said the navvy You wouldn t ear me when I was polite Now will you come There was a chasm in the side of the fly for he had wrenched the door bodily off its hinges and was feeling within purposefully A well booted leg rewarded him and there came out not with delight hopping on one foot a round and grey haired Englishman from whose armpits dropped hymn books but from his mouth an altogether different service of song Come on you bloomin body snatcher You thought I was dead did you roared the navvy And the respectable gentleman came accordingly inarticulate with rage Ere s a man murderin the Squire the driver shouted and fell from his box upon the navvy s neck To do them justice the people of Framlynghame Admiral so many as were on the platform rallied to the call in the best spirit of feudalism It was the one porter who beat the navvy on the nose with a ticket punch but it was the three third class tickets who attached themselves to his legs and freed the captive Send for a constable lock him up said that man adjusting his collar and unitedly they cast him into the lamp room and turned the key while the driver mourned over the wrecked fly Till then the navvy whose only desire was justice had kept his temper nobly Then he went Berserk before our amazed eyes The door of the lamp room was generously constructed and would not give an inch but the window he tore from its fastenings and hurled outwards The one porter counted the damage in a loud voice and the others arming themselves with agricultural implements from the station garden kept up a ceaseless winnowing before the window themselves backed close to the wall and bade the prisoner think of the gaol He answered little to the point so far as they could understand but seeing that his exit was impeded he took a lamp and hurled it through the wrecked sash It fell on the metals and went out With inconceivable velocity the others fifteen in all followed looking like rockets in the gloom and with the last he could have had no plan the Berserk rage left him as the doctor s deadly brewage waked up under the stimulus of violent exercise and a very full meal to one last cataclysmal exhibition and we heard the whistle of the seven forty five down They were all acutely interested in as much of the wreck as they could see for the station smelt to Heaven of oil and the engine skittered over broken glass like a terrier in a cucumber frame The guard had to hear of it and the Squire had his version of the brutal assault and heads were out all along the carriages as I found me a seat What is the row said a young man as I entered Man drunk Well the symptoms so far as my observation has gone more resemble those of Asiatic cholera than anything else I answered slowly and judicially that every word might carry weight in the appointed scheme of things Up till then you will observe I had taken no part in that war He was an Englishman but he collected his belongings as swiftly as had the American ages before and leaped upon the platform crying Can I be of any service I m a doctor From the lamp room I heard a wearied voice wailing Another bloomin doctor And the seven forty five carried me on a step nearer to Eternity by the road that is worn and seamed and channelled with the passions and weaknesses and warring interests of man who is immortal and master of his fate THE BRUSHWOOD BOY Girls and boys come out to play The moon is shining as bright as day 
5152-81825-0000	train-other-500	Leave your supper and leave your sleep And come with your playfellows out in the street Up the ladder and down the wall A CHILD of three sat up in his crib and screamed at the top of his voice
5152-81825-0001	train-other-500	his fists clinched and his eyes full of terror At first no one heard
none	none	 for his nursery was in the west wing and the nurse was talking to a gardener among the laurels 
5152-81825-0002	train-other-500	Then the housekeeper passed that way and hurried to soothe him He was her special pet and she disapproved of the nurse
none	none	 What was it then What was it then 
5152-81825-0003	train-other-500	There s nothing to frighten him Georgie dear It was it was a policeman He was on the

5152-81825-0005	train-other-500	He came here Where is your hand Harper The housekeeper waited till the sobs changed to the regular breathing of sleep before she stole out
none	none	 Jane what nonsense have you been telling Master Georgie about policemen I haven t told him anything You have He s been dreaming about them 
5152-81825-0006	train-other-500	We met Tisdall on Dowhead when we were in the donkey cart this morning P r aps that s what put it into his head
none	none	 Oh Now you aren t going to frighten the child into fits with your silly tales 
5152-81825-0007	train-other-500	and the master know nothing about it If ever I catch you again et cetera A child of six was telling himself stories as he lay in bed It was a new power
5152-81825-0008	train-other-500	and he kept it a secret A month before it had occurred to him to carry on a nursery tale left unfinished by his mother and he was delighted to find the tale
5152-81825-0009	train-other-500	as it came out of his own head just as surprising as though he were listening to it
none	none	 all new from the beginning 
5152-81825-0010	train-other-500	There was a prince in that tale and he killed dragons but only for one night Ever afterwards Georgie dubbed himself prince pasha giant killer and all the rest
5152-81825-0011	train-other-500	you see he could not tell any one for fear of being laughed at and his tales faded gradually into dreamland where adventures were so many that he could not recall the half of them
5152-81825-0012	train-other-500	They all began in the same way or as Georgie explained to the shadows of the night light there was the same starting off place a pile of brushwood stacked somewhere near a beach
5152-81825-0013	train-other-500	and round this pile Georgie found himself running races with little boys and girls These ended ships ran high up the dry land and opened into cardboard boxes
5152-81825-0014	train-other-500	or gilt and green iron railings that surrounded beautiful gardens turned all soft and could be walked through and overthrown so long as he remembered it was only a dream
none	none	 He could never hold that knowledge more than a few seconds ere things became real 
5152-81825-0015	train-other-500	and instead of pushing down houses full of grown up people a just revenge he sat miserably upon gigantic door steps trying to sing the multiplication table up to four times six
5152-81825-0016	train-other-500	The princess of his tales was a person of wonderful beauty she came from the old illustrated edition of Grimm now out of print
5152-81825-0017	train-other-500	and as she always applauded Georgie s valour among the dragons and buffaloes he gave her the two finest names he had ever heard in his life Annie and Louise
none	none	 pronounced Annieanlouise When the dreams swamped the stories she would change into one of the little girls round the brushwood pile still keeping her title and crown She saw Georgie drown once in a dream sea by the beach it was the day after he had been taken to bathe 
5152-81825-0018	train-other-500	in a real sea by his nurse and he said as he sank Poor Annieanlouise She ll be sorry for me now But Annieanlouise walking slowly on the beach called
5152-81825-0019	train-other-500	Ha ha said the duck laughing which to a waking mind might not seem to bear on the situation It consoled Georgie at once and must have been some kind of spell for it raised the bottom of the deep
5152-81825-0020	train-other-500	and he waded out with a twelve inch flower pot on each foot As he was strictly forbidden to meddle with flower pots in real life he felt triumphantly wicked
none	none	 The movements of the grown ups whom Georgie tolerated 
5152-81825-0021	train-other-500	but did not pretend to understand removed his world when he was seven years old to a place called Oxford on a visit Here were huge buildings surrounded by vast prairies
5152-81825-0022	train-other-500	with streets of infinite length and above all something called the buttery which Georgie was dying to see because he knew it must be greasy and therefore delightful
5152-81825-0023	train-other-500	He perceived how correct were his judgments when his nurse led him through a stone arch into the presence of an enormously fat man who asked him if he would like some bread and cheese Georgie was used to eat
none	none	 all round the clock so he took what buttery gave him 
5152-81825-0024	train-other-500	and would have taken some brown liquid called
none	none	 auditale but that his nurse led him away to an afternoon performance of a thing called 
5152-81825-0025	train-other-500	Pepper s Ghost This was intensely thrilling
none	none	 People s heads came off and flew all over the stage and skeletons danced bone by bone 
5152-81825-0026	train-other-500	while mister Pepper himself beyond question a man of the worst waved his arms and flapped a long gown and in a deep bass voice Georgie had never heard a man sing before told of his sorrows unspeakable
5152-81825-0027	train-other-500	Some grown up or other tried to explain that the illusion was made with mirrors and that there was no need to be frightened Georgie did not know what illusions were
none	none	 but he did know that a mirror was the looking glass with the ivory handle on his mother s dressing table Therefore the grown up 
5152-81825-0028	train-other-500	was just saying things after the distressing custom of grown ups and Georgie cast about for amusement between scenes Next to him sat a little girl dressed all in black
5152-81825-0029	train-other-500	her hair combed off her forehead exactly like the girl in the book called Alice in Wonderland
none	none	 which had been given him on his last birthday The little girl looked at Georgie and Georgie looked at her There seemed to be no need of any further introduction I ve got a cut on my thumb said he It was the first work of his first real knife a savage triangular hack and he esteemed it a most valuable possession I m tho thorry she lisped Let me look pleathe 
5152-81825-0030	train-other-500	There s a di ack lum plaster on
none	none	 but it s all raw under 
5152-81825-0031	train-other-500	Georgie answered complying Dothent it hurt her grey eyes were full of pity and interest
none	none	 Awf ly 
5152-81825-0032	train-other-500	Perhaps it will give me lockjaw It lookth very horrid
none	none	 I m tho thorry 
5152-81825-0033	train-other-500	She put a forefinger to his hand and held her head sidewise for a better view Here the nurse turned
none	none	 and shook him severely You mustn t talk to strange little girls Master Georgie 
5152-81825-0034	train-other-500	She isn t strange She s very nice I like her an I ve showed her my new cut The idea You change places with me She moved him over and shut out the little girl from his view
none	none	 while the grown up behind renewed the futile explanations 
5152-81825-0035	train-other-500	I am not afraid truly said the boy wriggling in despair but why don t you go to sleep in the afternoons same as Provost of Oriel
5152-81825-0036	train-other-500	Georgie had been introduced to a grown up of that name who slept in his presence without apology Georgie understood that he was the most important grown up in Oxford hence
5152-81825-0037	train-other-500	he strove to gild his rebuke with flatteries This grown up did not seem to like it but he collapsed
none	none	 and Georgie lay back in his seat silent and enraptured 
5152-81825-0038	train-other-500	mister Pepper was singing again and the deep ringing voice the red fire
none	none	 and the misty waving gown all seemed to be mixed up with the little girl 
5152-81825-0039	train-other-500	who had been so kind about his cut When the performance was ended
none	none	 she nodded to Georgie and Georgie nodded in return 
5152-81825-0040	train-other-500	He spoke no more than was necessary till bedtime but meditated on new colors and sounds and lights and music and things as far as he understood them the deep mouthed agony of mister Pepper
5152-81825-0041	train-other-500	mingling with the little girl s lisp That night he made a new tale from which he shamelessly removed the Rapunzel Rapunzel let down your hair princess gold crown Grimm edition and all
none	none	 and put a new Annieanlouise in her place So it was perfectly right and natural 
5152-81825-0042	train-other-500	that when he came to the brushwood pile he should find her waiting for him her hair combed off her forehead more like Alice in Wonderland than ever
none	none	 and the races and adventures began Ten years at an English public school do not encourage dreaming Georgie won his growth and chest measurement and a few other things which did not appear in the bills under a system of cricket foot ball and paper chases from four to five days a week which provided for three lawful cuts of a ground ash if any boy absented himself from these entertainments He became a rumple collared dusty hatted fag of the Lower Third and a light half back at Little Side foot ball was pushed and prodded through the slack backwaters of the Lower Fourth where the raffle of a school generally accumulates won his second fifteen cap at foot ball enjoyed the dignity of a study with two companions in it and began to look forward to office as a sub prefect At last he blossomed into full glory as head of the school ex officio captain of the games head of his house where he and his lieutenants preserved discipline and decency among seventy boys from twelve to seventeen general arbiter in the quarrels that spring up among the touchy Sixth and intimate friend and ally of the Head himself When he stepped forth in the black jersey white knickers and black stockings of the First Fifteen the new match ball under his arm and his old and frayed cap at the back of his head the small fry of the lower forms stood apart and worshipped and the new caps of the team talked to him ostentatiously that the world might see And so in summer when he came back to the pavilion after a slow but eminently safe game it mattered not whether he had made nothing or as once happened a hundred and three the school shouted just the same and women folk who had come to look at the match looked at Cottar Cottar major that s Cottar Above all he was responsible for that thing called the tone of the school and few realise with what passionate devotion a certain type of boy throws himself into this work Home was a faraway country full of ponies and fishing and shooting and men visitors who interfered with one s plans but school was the real world where things of vital importance happened and crises arose that must be dealt with promptly and quietly Not for nothing was it written Let the Consuls look to it that the Republic takes no harm and Georgie was glad to be back in authority when the holidays ended Behind him but not too near was the wise and temperate Head now suggesting the wisdom of the serpent now counselling the mildness of the dove leading him on to see more by half hints than by any direct word how boys and men are all of a piece and how he who can handle the one will assuredly in time control the other For the rest the school was not encouraged to dwell on its emotions but rather to keep in hard condition to avoid false quantities and to enter the army direct without the help of the expensive London crammer under whose roof young blood learns too much Cottar major went the way of hundreds before him The Head gave him six months final polish taught him what kind of answers best please a certain kind of examiners and handed him over to the properly constituted authorities who passed him into Sandhurst Here he had sense enough to see that he was in the Lower Third once more and behaved with respect toward his seniors till they in turn respected him and he was promoted to the rank of corporal and sat in authority over mixed peoples with all the vices of men and boys combined His reward was another string of athletic cups a good conduct sword and at last Her Majesty s commission as a subaltern in a first class line regiment He did not know that he bore with him from school and college a character worth much fine gold but was pleased to find his mess so kindly He had plenty of money of his own his training had set the public school mask upon his face and had taught him how many were the things no fellow can do By virtue of the same training he kept his pores open and his mouth shut The regular working of the Empire shifted his world to India where he tasted utter loneliness in subaltern s quarters one room and one bullock trunk and with his mess learned the new life from the beginning But there were horses in the land ponies at reasonable price there was polo for such as could afford it there were the disreputable remnants of a pack of hounds and Cottar worried his way along without too much despair It dawned on him that a regiment in India was nearer the chance of active service than he had conceived and that a man might as well study his profession A major of the new school backed this idea with enthusiasm and he and Cottar accumulated a library of military works and read and argued and disputed far into the nights But the adjutant said the old thing Get to know your men young un and they ll follow you anywhere That s all you want know your men Cottar thought he knew them fairly well at cricket and the regimental sports but he never realised the true inwardness of them till he was sent off with a detachment of twenty to sit down in a mud fort near a rushing river which was spanned by a bridge of boats When the floods came they went forth and hunted strayed pontoons along the banks Otherwise there was nothing to do and the men got drunk gambled and quarrelled They were a sickly crew for a junior subaltern is by custom saddled with the worst men Cottar endured their rioting as long as he could and then sent down country for a dozen pairs of boxing gloves I wouldn t blame you for fightin said he if you only knew how to use your hands but you don t Take these things and I ll show you The men appreciated his efforts Now instead of blaspheming and swearing at a comrade and threatening to shoot him they could take him apart and soothe themselves to exhaustion As one explained whom Cottar found with a shut eye and a diamond shaped mouth spitting blood through an embrasure We tried it with the gloves sir for twenty minutes and that done us no good sir Then we took off the gloves and tried it that way for another twenty minutes same as you showed us sir an that done us a world o good T wasn t fightin sir there was a bet on Cottar dared not laugh but he invited his men to other sports such as racing across country in shirt and trousers after a trail of torn paper and to single stick in the evenings till the native population who had a lust for sport in every form wished to know whether the white men understood wrestling They sent in an ambassador who took the soldiers by the neck and threw them about the dust and the entire command were all for this new game They spent money on learning new falls and holds which was better than buying other doubtful commodities and the peasantry grinned five deep round the tournaments That detachment who had gone up in bullock carts returned to headquarters at an average rate of thirty miles a day fair heel and toe no sick no prisoners and no court martials pending They scattered themselves among their friends singing the praises of their lieutenant and looking for causes of offense How did you do it young un the adjutant asked Oh I sweated the beef off em and then I sweated some muscle on to em It was rather a lark If that s your way of lookin at it we can give you all the larks you want Young Davies isn t feelin quite fit and he s next for detachment duty Care to go for him Sure he wouldn t mind I don t want to shove myself forward you know You needn t bother on Davies s account We ll give you the sweepin s of the corps and you can see what you can make of em All right said Cottar It s better fun than loafin about cantonments Rummy thing said the adjutant after Cottar had returned to his wilderness with twenty other devils worse than the first If Cottar only knew it half the women in the station would give their eyes confound em to have the young un in tow That accounts for missus Elery sayin I was workin my nice new boy too hard said a wing commander Oh yes and Why doesn t he come to the bandstand in the evenings and Can t I get him to make up a four at tennis with the Hammon girls the adjutant snorted Look at young Davies makin an ass of himself over mutton dressed as lamb old enough to be his mother No one can accuse young Cottar of runnin after women white or black the major replied thoughtfully But then that s the kind that generally goes the worst mucker in the end Not Cottar I ve only run across one of his muster before a fellow called Ingles in South Africa He was just the same hard trained athletic sports build of animal Always kept himself in the pink of condition Didn t do him much good though Shot at Wesselstroom the week before Majuba Wonder how the young un will lick his detachment into shape Cottar turned up six weeks later on foot with his pupils He never told his experiences but the men spoke enthusiastically and fragments of it leaked back to the colonel through sergeants batmen and the like There was great jealousy between the first and second detachments but the men united in adoring Cottar and their way of showing it was by sparing him all the trouble that men know how to make for an unloved officer He sought popularity as little as he had sought it at school and therefore it came to him He favoured no one not even when the company sloven pulled the company cricket match out of the fire with an unexpected forty three at the last moment There was very little getting round him for he seemed to know by instinct exactly when and where to head off a malingerer but he did not forget that the difference between a dazed and sulky junior of the upper school and a bewildered browbeaten lump of a private fresh from the depot was very small indeed The sergeants seeing these things told him secrets generally hid from young officers His words were quoted as barrack authority on bets in canteen and at tea and the veriest shrew of the corps bursting with charges against other women who had used the cooking ranges out of turn forbore to speak when Cottar as the regulations ordained asked of a morning if there were any complaints I m full o complaints said missus Corporal Morrison an I d kill O Halloran s fat sow of a wife any day but ye know how it is E puts is head just inside the door an looks down is blessed nose so bashful an e whispers Any complaints Ye can t complain after that I want to kiss him Some day I think I will Heigh ho she ll be a lucky woman that gets Young Innocence See im now girls Do ye blame me Cottar was cantering across to polo and he looked a very satisfactory figure of a man as he gave easily to the first excited bucks of his pony and slipped over a low mud wall to the practice ground There were more than missus Corporal Morrison who felt as she did But Cottar was busy for eleven hours of the day He did not care to have his tennis spoiled by petticoats in the court and after one long afternoon at a garden party he explained to his major that this sort of thing was futile priffle and the major laughed Theirs was not a married mess except for the colonel s wife and Cottar stood in awe of the good lady She said my regiment and the world knows what that means None the less when they wanted her to give away the prizes after a shooting match and she refused because one of the prize winners was married to a girl who had made a jest of her behind her broad back the mess ordered Cottar to tackle her in his best calling kit This he did simply and laboriously and she gave way altogether She only wanted to know the facts of the case he explained I just told her and she saw at once Ye es said the adjutant I expect that s what she did Comin to the Fusiliers dance to night Galahad No thanks I ve got a fight on with the major The virtuous apprentice sat up till midnight in the major s quarters with a stop watch and a pair of compasses shifting little painted lead blocks about a four inch map Then he turned in and slept the sleep of innocence which is full of healthy dreams One peculiarity of his dreams he noticed at the beginning of his second hot weather Two or three times a month they duplicated or ran in series He would find himself sliding into dreamland by the same road a road that ran along a beach near a pile of brushwood To the right lay the sea sometimes at full tide sometimes withdrawn to the very horizon but he knew it for the same sea By that road he would travel over a swell of rising ground covered with short withered grass into valleys of wonder and unreason Beyond the ridge which was crowned with some sort of street lamp anything was possible but up to the lamp it seemed to him that he knew the road as well as he knew the parade ground He learned to look forward to the place for once there he was sure of a good night s rest and Indian hot weather can be rather trying First shadowy under closing eyelids would come the outline of the brushwood pile next the white sand of the beach road almost overhanging the black changeful sea then the turn inland and uphill to the single light When he was unrestful for any reason he would tell himself how he was sure to get there sure to get there if he shut his eyes and surrendered to the drift of things But one night after a foolishly hard hour s polo the thermometer was ninety four deg in his quarters at ten o clock sleep stood away from him altogether though he did his best to find the well known road the point where true sleep began At last he saw the brushwood pile and hurried along to the ridge for behind him he felt was the wide awake sultry world He reached the lamp in safety tingling with drowsiness when a policeman a common country policeman sprang up before him and touched him on the shoulder ere he could dive into the dim valley below He was filled with terror the hopeless terror of dreams for the policeman said in the awful distinct voice of dream people I am Policeman Day coming back from the City of Sleep You come with me Georgie knew it was true that just beyond him in the valley lay the lights of the City of Sleep where he would have been sheltered and that this Policeman Thing had full power and authority to head him back to miserable wakefulness He found himself looking at the moonlight on the wall dripping with fright and he never overcame that horror though he met the Policeman several times that hot weather and his coming was the forerunner of a bad night But other dreams perfectly absurd ones filled him with an incommunicable delight All those that he remembered began by the brushwood pile For instance he found a small clockwork steamer he had noticed it many nights before lying by the sea road and stepped into it whereupon it moved with surpassing swiftness over an absolutely level sea This was glorious for he felt he was exploring great matters and it stopped by a lily carved in stone which most naturally floated on the water Seeing the lily was labelled Hong Kong Georgie said Of course This is precisely what I expected Hong Kong would be like How magnificent Thousands of miles farther on it halted at yet another stone lily labelled Java and this again delighted him hugely because he knew that now he was at the world s end But the little boat ran on and on till it lay in a deep fresh water lock the sides of which were carven marble green with moss Lilypads lay on the water and reeds arched above Some one moved among the reeds some one whom Georgie knew he had travelled to this world s end to reach Therefore everything was entirely well with him He was unspeakably happy and vaulted over the ship s side to find this person When his feet touched that still water it changed with the rustle of unrolling maps to nothing less than a sixth quarter of the globe beyond the most remote imagining of man a place where islands were coloured yellow and blue their lettering strung across their faces They gave on unknown seas and Georgie s urgent desire was to return swiftly across this floating atlas to known bearings He told himself repeatedly that it was no good to hurry but still he hurried desperately and the islands slipped and slid under his feet the straits yawned and widened till he found himself utterly lost in the world s fourth dimension with no hope of return Yet only a little distance away he could see the old world with the rivers and mountain chains marked according to the Sandhurst rules of mapmaking Then that person for whom he had come to the Lily Lock that was its name ran up across unexplored territories and showed him away They fled hand in hand till they reached a road that spanned ravines and ran along the edge of precipices and was tunnelled through mountains This goes to our brushwood pile said his companion and all his trouble was at an end He took a pony because he understood that this was the Thirty Mile Ride and he must ride swiftly and raced through the clattering tunnels and round the curves always downhill till he heard the sea to his left and saw it raging under a full moon against sandy cliffs It was heavy going but he recognised the nature of the country the dark purple downs inland and the bents that whistled in the wind The road was eaten away in places and the sea lashed at him black foamless tongues of smooth and glossy rollers but he was sure that there was less danger from the sea than from Them whoever They were inland to his right He knew too that he would be safe if he could reach the down with the lamp on it This came as he expected he saw the one light a mile ahead along the beach dismounted turned to the right walked quietly over to the brushwood pile found the little steamer had returned to the beach whence he had unmoored it and must have fallen asleep for he could remember no more I m gettin the hang of the geography of that place he said to himself as he shaved next morning I must have made some sort of circle Let s see The Thirty Mile Ride now how the deuce did I know it was called the Thirty Mile Ride joins the sea road beyond the first down where the lamp is And that atlas country lies at the back of the Thirty Mile Ride somewhere out to the right beyond the hills and tunnels Rummy things dreams Wonder what makes mine fit into each other so He continued on his solid way through the recurring duties of the seasons The regiment was shifted to another station and he enjoyed road marching for two months with a good deal of mixed shooting thrown in and when they reached their new cantonments he became a member of the local Tent Club and chased the mighty boar on horseback with a short stabbing spear There he met the mahseer of the Poonch beside whom the tarpon is as a herring and he who lands him can say that he is a fisherman This was as new and as fascinating as the big game shooting that fell to his portion when he had himself photographed for the mother s benefit sitting on the flank of his first tiger Then the adjutant was promoted and Cottar rejoiced with him for he admired the adjutant greatly and marvelled who might be big enough to fill his place so that he nearly collapsed when the mantle fell on his own shoulders and the colonel said a few sweet things that made him blush An adjutant s position does not differ materially from that of head of the school and Cottar stood in the same relation to the colonel as he had to his old Head in England Only tempers wear out in hot weather and things were said and done that tried him sorely and he made glorious blunders from which the regimental sergeant major pulled him with a loyal soul and a shut mouth Slovens and incompetents raged against him the weak minded strove to lure him from the ways of justice the small minded yea men whom Cottar believed would never do things no fellow can do imputed motives mean and circuitous to actions that he had not spent a thought upon and he tasted injustice and it made him very sick But his consolation came on parade when he looked down the full companies and reflected how few were in hospital or cells and wondered when the time would come to try the machine of his love and labour But they needed and expected the whole of a man s working day and maybe three or four hours of the night Curiously enough he never dreamed about the regiment as he was popularly supposed to The mind set free from the day s doings generally ceased working altogether or if it moved at all carried him along the old beach road to the downs the lamp post and once in a while to terrible Policeman Day The second time that he returned to the world s lost continent this was a dream that repeated itself again and again with variations on the same ground he knew that if he only sat still the person from the Lily Lock would help him and he was not disappointed Sometimes he was trapped in mines of vast depth hollowed out of the heart of the world where men in torment chanted echoing songs and he heard this person coming along through the galleries and everything was made safe and delightful They met again in low roofed Indian railway carriages that halted in a garden surrounded by gilt and green railings where a mob of stony white people all unfriendly sat at breakfast tables covered with roses and separated Georgie from his companion while underground voices sang deep voiced songs Georgie was filled with enormous despair till they two met again They foregathered in the middle of an endless hot tropic night and crept into a huge house that stood he knew somewhere north of the railway station where the people ate among the roses It was surrounded with gardens all moist and dripping and in one room reached through leagues of whitewashed passages a Sick Thing lay in bed Now the least noise Georgie knew would unchain some waiting horror and his companion knew it too but when their eyes met across the bed Georgie was disgusted to see that she was a child a little girl in strapped shoes with her black hair combed back from her forehead What disgraceful folly he thought Now she could do nothing whatever if Its head came off Then the Thing coughed and the ceiling shattered down in plaster on the mosquito netting and They rushed in from all quarters He dragged the child through the stifling garden voices chanting behind them and they rode the Thirty Mile Ride under whip and spur along the sandy beach by the booming sea till they came to the downs the lamp post and the brushwood pile which was safety Very often dreams would break up about them in this fashion and they would be separated to endure awful adventures alone But the most amusing times were when he and she had a clear understanding that it was all make believe and walked through mile wide roaring rivers without even taking off their shoes or set light to populous cities to see how they would burn and were rude as any children to the vague shadows met in their rambles Later in the night they were sure to suffer for this either at the hands of the Railway People eating among the roses or in the tropic uplands at the far end of the Thirty Mile Ride Together this did no much affright them but often Georgie would hear her shrill cry of Boy Boy half a world away and hurry to her rescue before They maltreated her He and she explored the dark purple downs as far inland from the brushwood pile as they dared but that was always a dangerous matter The interior was filled with Them and They went about singing in the hollows and Georgie and she felt safer on or near the seaboard So thoroughly had he come to know the place of his dreams that even waking he accepted it as a real country and made a rough sketch of it He kept his own counsel of course but the permanence of the land puzzled him His ordinary dreams were as formless and as fleeting as any healthy dreams could be but once at the brushwood pile he moved within known limits and could see where he was going There were months at a time when nothing notable crossed his sleep Then the dreams would come in a batch of five or six and next morning the map that he kept in his writing case would be written up to date for Georgie was a most methodical person There was indeed a danger his seniors said so of his developing into a regular Auntie Fuss of an adjutant and when an officer once takes to old maidism there is more hope for the virgin of seventy than for him But fate sent the change that was needed in the shape of a little winter campaign on the Border which after the manner of little campaigns flashed out into a very ugly war and Cottar s regiment was chosen among the first Now said a major this ll shake the cobwebs out of us all especially you Galahad and we can see what your hen with one chick attitude has done for the regiment Cottar nearly wept with joy as the campaign went forward They were fit physically fit beyond the other troops they were good children in camp wet or dry fed or unfed and they followed their officers with the quick suppleness and trained obedience of a first class foot ball fifteen They were cut off from their apology for a base and cheerfully cut their way back to it again they crowned and cleaned out hills full of the enemy with the precision of well broken dogs of chase and in the hour of retreat when hampered with the sick and wounded of the column they were persecuted down eleven miles of waterless valley they serving as rearguard covered themselves with a great glory in the eyes of fellow professionals Any regiment can advance but few know how to retreat with a sting in the tail Then they turned to made roads most often under fire and dismantled some inconvenient mud redoubts They were the last corps to be withdrawn when the rubbish of the campaign was all swept up and after a month in standing camp which tries morals severely they departed to their own place in column of fours singing E s goin to do without em Don t want em any more E s goin to do without em As e s often done before E s goin to be a martyr On a ighly novel plan An all the boys and girls will say Ow what a nice young man man man Ow what a nice young man There came out a Gazette in which Cottar found that he had been behaving with courage and coolness and discretion in all his capacities that he had assisted the wounded under fire and blown in a gate also under fire Net result his captaincy and a brevet majority coupled with the Distinguished Service Order As to his wounded he explained that they were both heavy men whom he could lift more easily than any one else Otherwise of course I should have sent out one of my men and of course about that gate business we were safe the minute we were well under the walls But this did not prevent his men from cheering him furiously whenever they saw him or the mess from giving him a dinner on the eve of his departure to England A year s leave was among the things he had snaffled out of the campaign I to use his own words The doctor who had taken quite as much as was good for him quoted poetry about a good blade carving the casques of men and so on and everybody told Cottar that he was an excellent person but when he rose to make his maiden speech they shouted so that he was understood to say It isn t any use tryin to speak with you chaps rottin me like this Let s have some pool

5152-81827-0005	train-other-500	and in discreet twilights after dinner demanded confidences Georgie would have been delighted to supply them but he had none and did not know it was his duty to manufacture them

5152-81827-0011	train-other-500	A few nights after they passed Gibraltar his dream returned to him She who waited by the brushwood pile was no longer a little girl but a woman with black hair that grew into a widow s peak

5152-81827-0015	train-other-500	and the city they had once burned for sport to the great swells of the downs under the lamp post Wherever they moved a strong singing followed them underground but this night there was no panic
5152-81827-0016	train-other-500	All the land was empty except for themselves and at the last they were sitting by the lamp post hand in hand she turned and kissed him He woke with a start

none	none	 and wept passionately on the dock head for pure joy of meeting her children who she had often said were so like their father Georgie headed for his own country wild with delight of his first long furlough after the lean seasons Nothing was changed in that orderly life from the coachman who met him at the station to the white peacock that stormed at the carriage from the stone wall above the shaven lawns The house took toll of him with due regard to precedence first the mother then the father then the housekeeper who wept and praised God then the butler and so on down to the under keeper who had been dogboy in Georgie s youth and called him Master Georgie and was reproved by the groom who had taught Georgie to ride Not a thing changed he sighed contentedly when the three of them sat down to dinner in the late sunlight while the rabbits crept out upon the lawn below the cedars and the big trout in the ponds by the home paddock rose for their evening meal Our changes are all over dear cooed the mother and now I am getting used to your size and your tan you re very brown Georgie I see you haven t changed in the least You re exactly like the pater The father beamed on this man after his own heart youngest major in the army and should have had the V C sir and the butler listened with his professional mask off when Master Georgie spoke of war as it is waged to day and his father cross questioned They went out on the terrace to smoke among the roses and the shadow of the old house lay long across the wonderful English foliage which is the only living green in the world Perfect By Jove it s perfect Georgie was looking at the round bosomed woods beyond the home paddock where the white pheasant boxes were ranged and the golden air was full of a hundred sacred scents and sounds Georgie felt his father s arm tighten in his It s not half bad but hodie mihi cras tibi isn t it I suppose you ll be turning up some fine day with a girl under your arm if you haven t one now eh You can make your mind easy sir I haven t one Not in all these years said the mother I hadn t time mummy They keep a man pretty busy these days in the service and most of our mess are unmarried too But you must have met hundreds in society at balls and so on I m like the Tenth mummy I don t dance Don t dance What have you been doing with yourself then backing other men s bills said the father Oh yes I ve done a little of that too but you see as things are now a man has all his work cut out for him to keep abreast of his profession and my days were always too full to let me lark about half the night Hmm suspiciously It s never too late to learn We ought to give some kind of housewarming for the people about now you ve come back Unless you want to go straight up to town dear No I don t want anything better than this Let s sit still and enjoy ourselves I suppose there will be something for me to ride if I look for it Seeing I ve been kept down to the old brown pair for the last six weeks because all the others were being got ready for Master Georgie I should say there might be the father chuckled They re reminding me in a hundred ways that I must take the second place now Brutes The pater doesn t mean it dear but every one has been trying to make your home coming a success and you do like it don t you Perfect Perfect There s no place like England when you ve done your work That s the proper way to look at it my son And so up and down the flagged walk till their shadows grew long in the moonlight and the mother went indoors and played such songs as a small boy once clamoured for and the squat silver candlesticks were brought in and Georgie climbed to the two rooms in the west wing that had been his nursery and his playroom in the beginning Then who should come to tuck him up for the night but the mother And she sat down on the bed and they talked for a long hour as mother and son should if there is to be any future for the Empire With a simple woman s deep guile she asked questions and suggested answers that should have waked some sign in the face on the pillow and there was neither quiver of eyelid nor quickening of breath neither evasion nor delay in reply So she blessed him and kissed him on the mouth which is not always a mother s property and said something to her husband later at which he laughed profane and incredulous laughs All the establishment waited on Georgie next morning from the tallest six year old with a mouth like a kid glove Master Georgie to the under keeper strolling carelessly along the horizon Georgie s pet rod in his hand and There s a four pounder risin below the lasher You don t ave em in Injia Mast Major Georgie It was all beautiful beyond telling even though the mother insisted on taking him out in the landau the leather had the hot Sunday smell of his youth and showing him off to her friends at all the houses for six miles round and the pater bore him up to town and a lunch at the club where he introduced him quite carelessly to not less than thirty ancient warriors whose sons were not the youngest majors in the army and had not the D S O After that it was Georgie s turn and remembering his friends he filled up the house with that kind of officer who live in cheap lodgings at Southsea or Montpelier Square Brompton good men all but not well off The mother perceived that they needed girls to play with and as there was no scarcity of girls the house hummed like a dovecote in spring They tore up the place for amateur theatricals they disappeared in the gardens when they ought to have been rehearsing they swept off every available horse and vehicle especially the governess cart and the fat pony they fell into the trout ponds they picnicked and they tennised and they sat on gates in the twilight two by two and Georgie found that he was not in the least necessary to their entertainment My word said he when he saw the last of their dear backs They told me they ve enjoyed emselves but they haven t done half the things they said they would I know they ve enjoyed themselves immensely said the mother You re a public benefactor dear Now we can be quiet again can t we Oh quite I ve a very dear friend of mine that I want you to know She couldn t come with the house so full because she s an invalid and she was away when you first came She s a missus Lacy Lacy I don t remember the name about here No they came after you went to India from Oxford Her husband died there and she lost some money I believe They bought The Firs on the Bassett Road She s a very sweet woman and we re very fond of them both She s a widow didn t you say She has a daughter Surely I said so dear Does she fall into trout ponds and gas and giggle and Oh Major Cottah and all that sort of thing No indeed She s a very quiet girl and very musical She always came over here with her music books composing you know and she generally works all day so you won t Talking about Miriam said the pater coming up The mother edged toward him within elbow reach There was no finesse about Georgie s father Oh Miriam s a dear girl Plays beautifully Rides beautifully too She s a regular pet of the household Used to call me The elbow went home and ignorant but obedient always the pater shut himself off What used she to call you sir All sorts of pet names I m very fond of Miriam Sounds Jewish Miriam Jew You ll be calling yourself a Jew next She s one of the Herefordshire Lacys When her aunt dies Again the elbow Oh you won t see anything of her Georgie She s busy with her music or her mother all day Besides you re going up to town tomorrow aren t you I thought you said something about an Institute meeting The mother spoke Go up to town now What nonsense Once more the pater was shut off I had some idea of it but I m not quite sure said the son of the house Why did the mother try to get him away because a musical girl and her invalid parent were expected He did not approve of unknown females calling his father pet names He would observe these pushing persons who had been only seven years in the county All of which the delighted mother read in his countenance herself keeping an air of sweet disinterestedness They ll be here this evening for dinner I m sending the carriage over for them and they won t stay more than a week Perhaps I shall go up to town I don t quite know yet Georgie moved away irresolutely There was a lecture at the United Services Institute on the supply of ammunition in the field and the one man whose theories most irritated Major Cottar would deliver it A heated discussion was sure to follow and perhaps he might find himself moved to speak He took his rod that afternoon and went down to thrash it out among the trout Good sport dear said the mother from the terrace Fraid it won t be mummy All those men from town and the girls particularly have put every trout off his feed for weeks There isn t one of em that cares for fishin really Fancy stampin and shoutin on the bank and tellin every fish for half a mile exactly what you re goin to do and then chuckin a brute of a fly at him By Jove it would scare me if I was a trout But things were not as bad as he had expected The black gnat was on the water and the water was strictly preserved A three quarter pounder at the second cast set him for the campaign and he worked down stream crouching behind the reed and meadowsweet creeping between a hornbeam hedge and a foot wide strip of bank where he could see the trout but where they could not distinguish him from the background lying almost on his stomach to switch the blue upright sidewise through the checkered shadows of a gravelly ripple under overarching trees But he had known every inch of the water since he was four feet high The aged and astute between sunk roots with the large and fat that lay in the frothy scum below some strong rush of water sucking as lazily as carp came to trouble in their turn at the hand that imitated so delicately the flicker and wimple of an egg dropping fly Consequently Georgie found himself five miles from home when he ought to have been dressing for dinner The housekeeper had taken good care that her boy should not go empty and before he changed to the white moth he sat down to excellent claret with sandwiches of potted egg and things that adoring women make and men never notice Then back to surprise the otter grubbing for fresh water mussels the rabbits on the edge of the beechwoods foraging in the clover and the policeman like white owl stooping to the little fieldmice till the moon was strong and he took his rod apart and went home through well remembered gaps in the hedges He fetched a compass round the house for though he might have broken every law of the establishment every hour the law of his boyhood was unbreakable after fishing you went in by the south garden back door cleaned up in the outer scullery and did not present yourself to your elders and your betters till you had washed and changed Half past ten by Jove Well we ll make the sport an excuse They wouldn t want to see me the first evening at any rate Gone to bed probably He skirted by the open French windows of the drawing room No they haven t They look very comfy in there He could see his father in his own particular chair the mother in hers and the back of a girl at the piano by the big potpourri jar The gardens looked half divine in the moonlight and he turned down through the roses to finish his pipe A prelude ended and there floated out a voice of the kind that in his childhood he used to call creamy a full true contralto and this is the song that he heard every syllable of it Over the edge of the purple down Where the single lamplight gleams Know ye the road to the Merciful Town That is hard by the Sea of Dreams Where the poor may lay their wrongs away And the sick may forget to weep But we pity us Oh pity us We wakeful ah pity us We must go back with Policeman Day Back from the City of Sleep Weary they turn from the scroll and crown Fetter and prayer and plough They that go up to the Merciful Town For her gates are closing now It is their right in the Baths of Night Body and soul to steep But we pity us ah pity us We wakeful oh pity us We must go back with Policeman Day Back from the City of Sleep Over the edge of the purple down Ere the tender dreams begin Look we may look at the Merciful Town But we may not enter in Outcasts all from her guarded wall Back to our watch we creep We pity us ah pity us We wakeful oh pity us We that go back with Policeman Day Back from the City of Sleep At the last echo he was aware that his mouth was dry and unknown pulses were beating in the roof of it The housekeeper who would have it that he must have fallen in and caught a chill was waiting to catch him on the stairs and since he neither saw nor answered her carried a wild tale abroad that brought his mother knocking at the door Anything happened dear Harper said she thought you weren t No it s nothing I m all right mummy Please don t bother He did not recognise his own voice but that was a small matter beside what he was considering Obviously most obviously the whole coincidence was crazy lunacy He proved it to the satisfaction of Major George Cottar who was going up to town to morrow to hear a lecture on the supply of ammunition in the field and having so proved it the soul and brain and heart and body of Georgie cried joyously That s the Lily Lock girl the Lost Continent girl the Thirty Mile Ride girl the Brushwood girl I know her He waked stiff and cramped in his chair to reconsider the situation by sunlight when it did not appear normal But a man must eat and he went to breakfast his heart between his teeth holding himself severely in hand Late as usual said the mother My boy Miss Lacy A tall girl in black raised her eyes to his and Georgie s life training deserted him just as soon as he realised that she did not know He stared coolly and critically There was the abundant black hair growing in a widow s peak turned back from the forehead with that peculiar ripple over the right ear there were the grey eyes set a little close together the short upper lip resolute chin and the known poise of the head There was also the small well cut mouth that had kissed him Georgie dear said the mother amazedly for Miriam was flushing under the stare I I beg your pardon he gulped I don t know whether the mother has told you but I m rather an idiot at times specially before I ve had my breakfast It s it s a family failing He turned to explore among the hot water dishes on the sideboard rejoicing that she did not know she did not know His conversation for the rest of the meal was mildly insane though the mother thought she had never seen her boy look half so handsome How could any girl least of all one of Miriam s discernment forbear to fall down and worship But deeply Miriam was displeased She had never been stared at in that fashion before and promptly retired into her shell when Georgie announced that he had changed his mind about going to town and would stay to play with Miss Lacy if she had nothing better to do Oh but don t let me throw you out I m at work I ve things to do all the morning What possessed Georgie to behave so oddly the mother sighed to herself Miriam s a bundle of feelings like her mother You compose don t you Must be a fine thing to be able to do that Pig oh pig thought Miriam I think I heard you singin when I came in last night after fishin All about a Sea of Dreams wasn t it Miriam shuddered to the core of the soul that afflicted her Awfully pretty song How d you think of such things You only composed the music dear didn t you The words too I m sure of it said Georgie with a sparkling eye No she did not know Yeth I wrote the words too Miriam spoke slowly for she knew she lisped when she was nervous Now how could you tell Georgie said the mother as delighted as though the youngest major in the army were ten years old showing off before company I was sure of it somehow Oh there are heaps of things about me mummy that you don t understand Looks as if it were goin to be a hot day for England Would you care for a ride this afternoon Miss Lacy We can start out after tea if you d like it Miriam could not in decency refuse but any woman might see she was not filled with delight That will be very nice if you take the Bassett Road It will save me sending Martin down to the village said the mother filling in gaps Like all good managers the mother had her one weakness a mania for little strategies that should economise horses and vehicles Her men folk complained that she turned them into common carriers and there was a legend in the family that she had once said to the pater on the morning of a meet If you should kill near Bassett dear and if it isn t too late would you mind just popping over and matching me this I knew that was coming You d never miss a chance mother If it s a fish or a trunk I won t Georgie laughed It s only a duck They can do it up very neatly at Mallett s said the mother simply You won t mind will you We ll have a scratch dinner at nine because it s so hot The long summer day dragged itself out for centuries but at last there was tea on the lawn and Miriam appeared She was in the saddle before he could offer to help with the clean spring of the child who mounted the pony for the Thirty Mile Ride The day held mercilessly though Georgie got down thrice to look for imaginary stones in Rufus s foot One cannot say even simple things in broad light and this that Georgie meditated was not simple So he spoke seldom and Miriam was divided between relief and scorn It annoyed her that the great hulking thing should know she had written the words of the song overnight for though a maiden may sing her most secret fancies aloud she does not care to have them trampled over by the male Philistine They rode into the little red brick street of Bassett and Georgie made untold fuss over the disposition of that duck It must go in just such a package and be fastened to the saddle in just such a manner though eight o clock had struck and they were miles from dinner We must be quick said Miriam bored and angry There s no great hurry but we can cut over Dowhead Down and let em out on the grass That will save us half an hour The horses capered on the short sweet smelling turf and the delaying shadows gathered in the valley as they cantered over the great dun down that overhangs Bassett and the Western coaching road Insensibly the pace quickened without thought of mole hills Rufus gentleman that he was waiting on Miriam s Dandy till they should have cleared the rise Then down the two mile slope they raced together the wind whistling in their ears to the steady throb of eight hoofs and the light click click of the shifting bits Oh that was glorious Miriam cried reining in Dandy and I are old friends but I don t think we ve ever gone better together No but you ve gone quicker once or twice Really When Georgie moistened his lips Don t you remember the Thirty Mile Ride with me when They were after us on the beach road with the sea to the left going toward the lamp post on the downs The girl gasped What what do you mean she said hysterically The Thirty Mile Ride and and all the rest of it You mean I didn t sing anything about the Thirty Mile Ride I know I didn t I have never told a living soul You told about Policeman Day and the lamp at the top of the downs and the City of Sleep It all joins on you know it s the same country and it was easy enough to see where you had been Good God It joins on of course it does but I have been you have been Oh let s walk please or I shall fall off Georgie ranged alongside and laid a hand that shook below her bridle hand pulling Dandy into a walk Miriam was sobbing as he had seen a man sob under the touch of the bullet It s all right it s all right he whispered feebly Only only it s true you know True Am I mad Not unless I m mad as well Do try to think a minute quietly How could any one conceivably know anything about the Thirty Mile Ride having anything to do with you unless he had been there But where But where Tell me There wherever it may be in our country I suppose Do you remember the first time you rode it the Thirty Mile Ride I mean You must It was all dreams all dreams Yes but tell please because I know Let me think I we were on no account to make any noise on no account to make any noise She was staring between Dandy s ears with eyes that did not see and a suffocating heart Because It was dying in the big house Georgie went on reining in again There was a garden with green and gilt railings all hot Do you remember I ought to I was sitting on the other side of the bed before It coughed and They came in You the deep voice was unnaturally full and strong and the girl s wide opened eyes burned in the dusk as she stared him through and through Then you re the Boy my Brushwood Boy and I ve known you all my life She fell forward on Dandy s neck Georgie forced himself out of the weakness that was overmastering his limbs and slid an arm round her waist The head dropped on his shoulder and he found himself with parched lips saying things that up till then he believed existed only in printed works of fiction Mercifully the horses were quiet She made no attempt to draw herself away when she recovered but lay still whispering Of course you re the Boy and I didn t know I didn t know I knew last night and when I saw you at breakfast Oh that was why I wondered at the time You would of course I couldn t speak before this Keep your head where it is dear It s all right now all right now isn t it But how was it I didn t know after all these years and years I remember oh what lots of things I remember Tell me some I ll look after the horses I remember waiting for you when the steamer came in Do you At the Lily Lock beyond Hong Kong and Java Do you call it that too You told me it was when I was lost in the continent That was you that showed me the way through the mountains When the islands slid It must have been because you re the only one I remember All the others were Them Awful brutes they were too I remember showing you the Thirty Mile Ride the first time You ride just as you used to then You are you That s odd I thought that of you this afternoon Isn t it wonderful What does it all mean Why should you and I of the millions of people in the world have this this thing between us What does it mean I m frightened This said Georgie The horses quickened their pace They thought they had heard an order Perhaps when we die we may find out more but it means this now There was no answer What could she say As the world went they had known each other rather less than eight and a half hours but the matter was one that did not concern the world There was a very long silence while the breath in their nostrils drew cold and sharp as it might have been a fume of ether That s the second Georgie whispered You remember don t you It s not furiously It s not On the downs the other night months ago You were just as you are now and we went over the country for miles and miles It was all empty too They had gone away Nobody frightened us I wonder why Boy Oh if you remember that you must remember the rest Confess I remember lots of things but I know I didn t I never have till just now You did dear I know I didn t because oh it s no use keeping anything back because I truthfully meant to And truthfully did No meant to but some one else came by There wasn t any one else There never has been There was there always is It was another woman out there on the sea I saw her It was the twenty sixth of May I ve got it written down somewhere Oh you ve kept a record of your dreams too That s odd about the other woman because I happened to be on the sea just then I was right How do I know what you ve done when you were awake and I thought it was only you You never were more wrong in your life What a little temper you ve got Listen to me a minute dear And Georgie though he knew it not committed black perjury It it isn t the kind of thing one says to any one because they d laugh but on my word and honour darling I ve never been kissed by a living soul outside my own people in all my life Don t laugh dear I wouldn t tell any one but you but it s the solemn truth I knew You are you Oh I knew you d come some day but I didn t know you were you in the least till you spoke Then give me another And you never cared or looked anywhere Why all the round world must have loved you from the very minute they saw you Boy They kept it to themselves if they did No I never cared And we shall be late for dinner horribly late Oh how can I look at you in the light before your mother and mine We ll play you re Miss Lacy till the proper time comes What s the shortest limit for people to get engaged S pose we have got to go through all the fuss of an engagement haven t we Oh I don t want to talk about that It s so commonplace I ve thought of something that you don t know I m sure of it What s my name Miri no it isn t by Jove Wait half a second and it ll come back to me You aren t you can t Why those old tales before I went to school I ve never thought of em from that day to this Are you the original only Annieanlouise It was what you always called me ever since the beginning Oh We ve turned into the avenue and we must be an hour late What does it matter The chain goes as far back as those days It must of course of course it must I ve got to ride round with this pestilent old bird confound him Ha ha said the duck laughing do you remember that Yes I do flower pots on my feet and all We ve been together all this while and I ve got to say good bye to you till dinner Sure I ll see you at dinner time Sure you won t sneak up to your room darling and leave me all the evening Good bye dear good bye Good bye Boy good bye Mind the arch Don t let Rufus bolt into his stables Good bye Yes I ll come down to dinner but what shall I do when I see you in the light End of
