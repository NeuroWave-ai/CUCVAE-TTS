very old if I shouldn t perhaps rather say a very young motive I can scarce remember the time when the situation on which this long drawn fiction mainly rests was not vividly present to me The idea reduced to its essence is that of a young person conscious of a great capacity for life but early stricken and doomed condemned to die under short respite while also enamoured of the world aware moreover of the condemnation and passionately desiring to put in before extinction as many of the finer vibrations as possible and so achieve however briefly and brokenly the sense of having lived Long had I turned it over standing off from it yet coming back to it convinced of what might be done with it yet seeing the theme as formidable The image so figured would be at best but half the matter the rest would be all the picture of the struggle involved the adventure brought about the gain recorded or the loss incurred the precious experience somehow compassed These things I had from the first felt would require much working out that indeed was the case with most things worth working at all yet there are subjects and subjects and this one seemed particularly to bristle It was formed I judged to make the wary adventurer walk round and round it it had in fact a charm that invited and mystified alike that attention not being somehow what one thought of as a frank subject after the fashion of some with its elements well in view and its whole character in its face It stood there with secrets and compartments with possible treacheries and traps it might have a great deal to give but would probably ask for equal services in return and would collect this debt to the last shilling It involved to begin with the placing in the strongest light a person infirm and ill a case sure to prove difficult and to require much handling though giving perhaps with other matters one of those chances for good taste possibly even for the play of the very best in the world that are not only always to be invoked and cultivated but that are absolutely to be jumped at from the moment they make a sign Yes then the case prescribed for its central figure a sick young woman at the whole course of whose disintegration and the whole ordeal of whose consciousness one would have quite honestly to assist The expression of her state and that of one s intimate relation to it might therefore well need to be discreet and ingenious a reflexion that fortunately grew and grew however in proportion as I focussed my image roundabout which as it persisted I repeat the interesting possibilities and the attaching wonderments not to say the insoluble mysteries thickened apace Why had one to look so straight in the face and so closely to cross question that idea of making one s protagonist sick as if to be menaced with death or danger hadn t been from time immemorial for heroine or hero the very shortest of all cuts to the interesting state Why should a figure be disqualified for a central position by the particular circumstance that might most quicken that might crown with a fine intensity its liability to many accidents its consciousness of all relations This circumstance true enough might disqualify it for many activities even though we should have imputed to it the unsurpassable activity of passionate of inspired resistance This last fact was the real issue for the way grew straight from the moment one recognised that the poet essentially CAN T be concerned with the act of dying Let him deal with the sickest of the sick it is still by the act of living that they appeal to him and appeal the more as the conditions plot against them and prescribe the battle The process of life gives way fighting and often may so shine out on the lost ground as in no other connexion One had had moreover as a various chronicler one s secondary physical weaklings and failures one s accessory invalids introduced with a complacency that made light of criticism To Ralph Touchett in The Portrait of a Lady for instance his deplorable state of health was not only no drawback I had clearly been right in counting it for any happy effect he should produce a positive good mark a direct aid to pleasantness and vividness The reason of this moreover could never in the world have been his fact of sex since men among the mortally afflicted suffer on the whole more overtly and more grossly than women and resist with a ruder an inferior strategy I had thus to take THAT anomaly for what it was worth and I give it here but as one of the ambiguities amid which my subject ended by making itself at home and seating itself quite in confidence With the clearness I have just noted accordingly the last thing in the world it proposed to itself was to be the record predominantly of a collapse I don t mean to say that my offered victim was not present to my imagination constantly as dragged by a greater force than any she herself could exert she had been given me from far back as contesting every inch of the road as catching at every object the grasp of which might make for delay as clutching these things to the last moment of her strength Such an attitude and such movements the passion they expressed and the success they in fact represented what were they in truth but the soul of drama which is the portrayal as we know of a catastrophe determined in spite of oppositions My young woman would HERSELF be the opposition to the catastrophe announced by the associated Fates powers conspiring to a sinister end and with their command of means finally achieving it yet in such straits really to STIFLE the sacred spark that obviously a creature so animated an adversary so subtle couldn t but be felt worthy under whatever weaknesses of the foreground and the limelight She would meanwhile wish moreover all along to live for particular things she would found her struggle on particular human interests which would inevitably determine in respect to her the attitude of other persons persons affected in such a manner as to make them part of the action If her impulse to wrest from her shrinking hour still as much of the fruit of life as possible if this longing can take effect only by the aid of others their participation appealed to entangled and coerced as they find themselves becomes their drama too that of their promoting her illusion under her importunity for reasons for interests and advantages from motives and points of view of their own Some of these promptings evidently would be of the highest order others doubtless mightn t but they would make up together for her contributively her sum of experience represent to her somehow in good faith or in bad what she should have KNOWN Somehow too at such a rate one would see the persons subject to them drawn in as by some pool of a Lorelei see them terrified and tempted and charmed bribed away it may even be from more prescribed and natural orbits inheriting from their connexion with her strange difficulties and still stranger opportunities confronted with rare questions and called upon for new discriminations Thus the scheme of her situation would in a comprehensive way see itself constituted the rest of the interest would be in the number and nature of the particulars Strong among these naturally the need that life should apart from her infirmity present itself to our young woman as quite dazzlingly liveable and that if the great pang for her is in what she must give up we shall appreciate it the more from the sight of all she has One would see her then as possessed of all things all but the single most precious assurance freedom and money and a mobile mind and personal charm the power to interest and attach attributes each one enhancing the value of a future From the moment his imagination began to deal with her at close quarters in fact nothing could more engage her designer than to work out the detail of her perfect rightness for her part nothing above all more solicit him than to recognise fifty reasons for her national and social status She should be the last fine flower blooming alone for the fullest attestation of her freedom of an old New York stem the happy congruities thus preserved for her being matters however that I may not now go into and this even though the fine association that shall yet elsewhere await me is of a sort at the best rather to defy than to encourage exact expression There goes with it for the heroine of The Wings of the Dove a strong and special implication of liberty liberty of action of choice of appreciation of contact proceeding from sources that provide better for large independence I think than any other conditions in the world and this would be in particular what we should feel ourselves deeply concerned with I had from far back mentally projected a certain sort of young American as more the heir of all the ages than any other young person whatever and precisely on those grounds I have just glanced at but to pass them by for the moment so that here was a chance to confer on some such figure a supremely touching value To be the heir of all the ages only to know yourself as that consciousness should deepen balked of your inheritance would be to play the part it struck me or at least to arrive at the type in the light on the whole the most becoming Otherwise truly what a perilous part to play OUT what a suspicion of swagger in positively attempting it So at least I could reason so I even think I HAD to to keep my subject to a decent compactness For already from an early stage it had begun richly to people itself the difficulty was to see whom the situation I had primarily projected might by this that or the other turn NOT draw in My business was to watch its turns as the fond parent watches a child perched for its first riding lesson in the saddle yet its interest I had all the while to recall was just in its making on such a scale for developments What one had discerned at all events from an early stage was that a young person so devoted and exposed a creature with her security hanging so by a hair couldn t but fall somehow into some abysmal trap this being dramatically speaking what such a situation most naturally implied and imposed Didn t the truth and a great part of the interest also reside in the appearance that she would constitute for others given her passionate yearning to live while she might a complication as great as any they might constitute for herself which is what I mean when I speak of such matters as natural They would be as natural these tragic pathetic ironic these indeed for the most part sinister liabilities to her living associates as they could be to herself as prime subject If her story was to consist as it could so little help doing of her being let in as we say for this that and the other irreducible anxiety how could she not have put a premium on the acquisition by any close sharer of her life of a consciousness similarly embarrassed I have named the Rhine maiden but our young friend s existence would create rather all round her very much that whirlpool movement of the waters produced by the sinking of a big vessel or the failure of a great business when we figure to ourselves the strong narrowing eddies the immense force of suction the general engulfment that for any neighbouring object makes immersion inevitable I need scarce say however that in spite of these communities of doom I saw the main dramatic complication much more prepared FOR my vessel of sensibility than by her the work of other hands though with her own imbrued too after all in the measure of their never not being in some direction generous and extravagant and thereby provoking The great point was at all events that if in a predicament she was to be accordingly it would be of the essence to create the predicament promptly and build it up solidly so that it should have for us as much as possible its ominous air of awaiting her That reflexion I found betimes not less inspiring than urgent one begins so in such a business by looking about for one s compositional key unable as one can only be to move till one has found it To start without it is to pretend to enter the train and still more to remain in one s seat without a ticket Well in the steady light and for the continued charm of these verifications I had secured my ticket over the tolerably long line laid down for The Wings of the Dove from the moment I had noted that there could be no full presentation of Milly Theale as ENGAGED with elements amid which she was to draw her breath in such pain should not the elements have been with all solicitude duly prefigured If one had seen that her stricken state was but half her case the correlative half being the state of others as affected by her they too should have a case bless them quite as much as she then I was free to choose as it were the half with which I should begin If as I had fondly noted the little world determined for her was to bristle I delighted in the term with meanings so by the same token could I but make my medal hang free its obverse and its reverse its face and its back would beautifully become optional for the spectator I somehow wanted them correspondingly embossed wanted them inscribed and figured with an equal salience yet it was none the less visibly my key as I have said that though my regenerate young New Yorker and what might depend on her should form my centre my circumference was every whit as treatable Therefore I must trust myself to know when to proceed from the one and when from the other Preparatively and as it were yearningly given the whole ground one began in the event with the outer ring approaching the centre thus by narrowing circumvallations There full blown accordingly from one hour to the other rose one s process for which there remained all the while so many amusing formulae The medal DID hang free I felt this perfectly I remember from the moment I had comfortably laid the ground provided in my first Book ground from which Milly is superficially so absent I scarce remember perhaps a case I like even with this public grossness to insist on it in which the curiosity of beginning far back as far back as possible and even of going to the same tune far behind that is behind the face of the subject was to assert itself with less scruple The free hand in this connexion was above all agreeable the hand the freedom of which I owed to the fact that the work had ignominiously failed in advance of all power to see itself serialised This failure had repeatedly waited for me upon shorter fictions but the considerable production we here discuss was as The Golden Bowl was to be two or three years later born not otherwise than a little bewilderedly into a world of periodicals and editors of roaring successes in fine amid which it was well nigh unnotedly to lose itself There is fortunately something bracing ever in the alpine chill that of some high icy arete shed by the cold editorial shoulder sour grapes may at moments fairly intoxicate and the story teller worth his salt rejoice to feel again how many accommodations he can practise Those addressed to conditions of publication have in a degree their interesting or at least their provoking side but their charm is qualified by the fact that the prescriptions here spring from a soil often wholly alien to the ground of the work itself They are almost always the fruit of another air altogether and conceived in a light liable to represent WITHIN the circle of the work itself little else than darkness Still when not too blighting they often operate as a tax on ingenuity that ingenuity of the expert craftsman which likes to be taxed very much to the same tune to which a well bred horse likes to be saddled The best and finest ingenuities nevertheless with all respect to that truth are apt to be not one s compromises but one s fullest conformities and I well remember in the case before us the pleasure of feeling my divisions my proportions and general rhythm rest all on permanent rather than in any degree on momentary proprieties It was enough for my alternations thus that they were good in themselves it was in fact so much for them that I really think any further account of the constitution of the book reduces itself to a just notation of the law they followed There was the fun to begin with of establishing one s successive centres of fixing them so exactly that the portions of the subject commanded by them as by happy points of view and accordingly treated from them would constitute so to speak sufficiently solid BLOCKS of wrought material squared to the sharp edge as to have weight and mass and carrying power to make for construction that is to conduce to effect and to provide for beauty Such a block obviously is the whole preliminary presentation of Kate Croy which from the first I recall absolutely declined to enact itself save in terms of amplitude Terms of amplitude terms of atmosphere those terms and those terms only in which images assert their fulness and roundness their power to revolve so that they have sides and backs parts in the shade as true as parts in the sun these were plainly to be my conditions right and left and I was so far from overrating the amount of expression the whole thing as I saw and felt it would require that to retrace the way at present is alas more than anything else but to mark the gaps and the lapses to miss one by one the intentions that with the best will in the world were not to fructify I have just said that the process of the general attempt is described from the moment the blocks are numbered and that would be a true enough picture of my plan Yet one s plan alas is one thing and one s result another so that I am perhaps nearer the point in saying that this last strikes me at present as most characterised by the happy features that WERE under my first and most blest illusion to have contributed to it I meet them all as I renew acquaintance I mourn for them all as I remount the stream the absent values the palpable voids the missing links the mocking shadows that reflect taken together the early bloom of one s good faith Such cases are of course far from abnormal so far from it that some acute mind ought surely to have worked out by this time the law of the degree in which the artist s energy fairly depends on his fallibility How much and how often and in what connexions and with what almost infinite variety must he be a dupe that of his prime object to be at all measurably a master that of his actual substitute for it or in other words at all appreciably to exist He places after an earnest survey the piers of his bridge he has at least sounded deep enough heaven knows for their brave position yet the bridge spans the stream after the fact in apparently complete independence of these properties the principal grace of the original design THEY were an illusion for their necessary hour but the span itself whether of a single arch or of many seems by the oddest chance in the world to be a reality since actually the rueful builder passing under it sees figures and hears sounds above he makes out with his heart in his throat that it bears and is positively being used The building up of Kate Croy s consciousness to the capacity for the load little by little to be laid on it was by way of example to have been a matter of as many hundred close packed bricks as there are actually poor dozens The image of her so compromised and compromising father was all effectively to have pervaded her life was in a certain particular way to have tampered with her spring by which I mean that the shame and the irritation and the depression the general poisonous influence of him were to have been SHOWN with a truth beyond the compass even of one s most emphasised word of honour for it to do these things But where do we find him at this time of day save in a beggarly scene or two which scarce arrives at the dignity of functional reference He but looks in poor beautiful dazzling damning apparition that he was to have been he sees his place so taken his company so little missed that cocking again that fine form of hat which has yielded him for so long his one effective cover he turns away with a whistle of indifference that nobly misrepresents the deepest disappointment of his life One s poor word of honour has HAD to pass muster for the show Every one in short was to have enjoyed so much better a chance that like stars of the theatre condescending to oblige they have had to take small parts to content themselves with minor identities in order to come on at all I haven t the heart now I confess to adduce the detail of so many lapsed importances the explanation of most of which after all I take to have been in the crudity of a truth beating full upon me through these reconsiderations the odd inveteracy with which picture at almost any turn is jealous of drama and drama though on the whole with a greater patience I think suspicious of picture Between them no doubt they do much for the theme yet each baffles insidiously the other s ideal and eats round the edges of its position each is too ready to say I can take the thing for done only when done in MY way The residuum of comfort for the witness of these broils is of course meanwhile in the convenient reflexion invented for him in the twilight of time and the infancy of art by the Angel not to say by the Demon of Compromise that nothing is so easy to do as not to be thankful for almost any stray help in its getting done It wasn t after this fashion by making good one s dream of Lionel Croy that my structure was to stand on its feet any more than it was by letting him go that I was to be left irretrievably lamenting The who and the what the how and the why the whence and the whither of Merton Densher these no less were quantities and attributes that should have danced about him with the antique grace of nymphs and fauns circling round a bland Hermes and crowning him with flowers One s main anxiety for each one s agents is that the air of each shall be GIVEN but what does the whole thing become after all as one goes but a series of sad places at which the hand of generosity has been cautioned and stayed The young man s situation personal professional social was to have been so decanted for us that we should get all the taste we were to have been penetrated with missus Lowder by the same token saturated with her presence her personality and felt all her weight in the scale We were to have revelled in missus Stringham my heroine s attendant friend her fairly choral Bostonian a subject for innumerable touches and in an extended and above all an ANIMATED reflexion of Milly Theale s experience of English society just as the strength and sense of the situation in Venice for our gathered friends was to have come to us in a deeper draught out of a larger cup and just as the pattern of Densher s final position and fullest consciousness there was to have been marked in fine stitches all silk and gold all pink and silver that have had to remain alas but entwined upon the reel It isn t no doubt however to recover after all our critical balance that the pattern didn t for each compartment get itself somehow wrought and that we mightn t thus piece by piece opportunity offering trace it over and study it The thing has doubtless as a whole the advantage that each piece is true to its pattern and that while it pretends to make no simple statement it yet never lets go its scheme of clearness Applications of this scheme are continuous and exemplary enough though I scarce leave myself room to glance at them The clearness is obtained in Book First or otherwise as I have said in the first piece each Book having its subordinate and contributive pattern through the associated consciousness of my two prime young persons for whom I early recognised that I should have to consent under stress to a practical FUSION of consciousness It is into the young woman s ken that Merton Densher is represented as swimming but her mind is not here rigorously the one reflector There are occasions when it plays this part just as there are others when his plays it and an intelligible plan consists naturally not a little in fixing such occasions and making them on one side and the other sufficient to themselves Do I sometimes in fact forfeit the advantage of that distinctness Do I ever abandon one centre for another after the former has been postulated From the moment we proceed by centres and I have never I confess embraced the logic of any superior process they must BE each as a basis selected and fixed after which it is that in the high interest of economy of treatment they determine and rule There is no economy of treatment without an adopted a related point of view and though I understand under certain degrees of pressure a represented community of vision between several parties to the action when it makes for concentration I understand no breaking up of the register no sacrifice of the recording consistency that doesn t rather scatter and weaken In this truth resides the secret of the discriminated occasion that aspect of the subject which we have our noted choice of treating either as picture or scenically but which is apt I think to show its fullest worth in the Scene Beautiful exceedingly for that matter those occasions or parts of an occasion when the boundary line between picture and scene bears a little the weight of the double pressure Such would be the case I can t but surmise for the long passage that forms here before us the opening of Book Fourth where all the offered life centres to intensity in the disclosure of Milly s single throbbing consciousness but where for a due rendering everything has to be brought to a head This passage the view of her introduction to missus Lowder s circle has its mate for illustration later on in the book and at a crisis for which the occasion submits to another rule My registers or reflectors as I so conveniently name them burnished indeed as they generally are by the intelligence the curiosity the passion the force of the moment whatever it be directing them work as we have seen in arranged alternation so that in the second connexion I here glance at it is Kate Croy who is for all she is worth turned on She is turned on largely at Venice where the appearances rich and obscure and portentous another word I rejoice in as they have by that time become and altogether exquisite as they remain are treated almost wholly through her vision of them and Densher s as to the lucid interplay of which conspiring and conflicting agents there would be a great deal to say It is in Kate s consciousness that at the stage in question the drama is brought to a head and the occasion on which in the splendid saloon of poor Milly s hired palace she takes the measure of her friend s festal evening squares itself to the same synthetic firmness as the compact constructional block inserted by the scene at Lancaster Gate Milly s situation ceases at a given moment to be renderable in terms closer than those supplied by Kate s intelligence or in a richer degree by Densher s or for one fond hour by poor missus Stringham s since to that sole brief futility is this last participant crowned by my original plan with the quaintest functions in fact reduced just as Kate s relation with Densher and Densher s with Kate have ceased previously and are then to cease again to be projected for us so far as Milly is concerned with them on any more responsible plate than that of the latter s admirable anxiety It is as if for these aspects the impersonal plate in other words the poor author s comparatively cold affirmation or thin guarantee had felt itself a figure of attestation at once too gross and too bloodless likely to affect us as an abuse of privilege when not as an abuse of knowledge Heaven forbid we say to ourselves during almost the whole Venetian climax heaven forbid we should know anything more of our ravaged sister than what Densher darkly pieces together or than what Kate Croy pays heroically it must be owned at the hour of her visit alone to Densher s lodging for her superior handling and her dire profanation of For we have time while this passage lasts to turn round critically we have time to recognise intentions and proprieties we have time to catch glimpses of an economy of composition as I put it interesting in itself all in spite of the author s scarce more than half dissimulated despair at the inveterate displacement of his general centre The Wings of the Dove happens to offer perhaps the most striking example I may cite though with public penance for it already performed of my regular failure to keep the appointed halves of my whole equal Here the makeshift middle for which the best I can say is that it s always rueful and never impudent reigns with even more than its customary contrition though passing itself off perhaps too with more than its usual craft Nowhere I seem to recall had the need of dissimulation been felt so as anguish nowhere had I condemned a luckless theme to complete its revolution burdened with the accumulation of its difficulties the difficulties that grow with a theme s development in quarters so cramped Of course as every novelist knows it is difficulty that inspires only for that perfection of charm it must have been difficulty inherent and congenital and not difficulty caught by the wrong frequentations The latter half that is the false and deformed half of The Wings would verily I think form a signal object lesson for a literary critic bent on improving his occasion to the profit of the budding artist This whole corner of the picture bristles with dodges such as he should feel himself all committed to recognise and denounce for disguising the reduced scale of the exhibition for foreshortening at any cost for imparting to patches the value of presences for dressing objects in an AIR as of the dimensions they can t possibly have Thus he would have his free hand for pointing out what a tangled web we weave when well when through our mislaying or otherwise trifling with our blest pair of compasses we have to produce the illusion of mass without the illusion of extent THERE is a job quite to the measure of most of our monitors and with the interest for them well enhanced by the preliminary cunning quest for the spot where deformity has begun I recognise meanwhile throughout the long earlier reach of the book not only no deformities but I think a positively close and felicitous application of method the preserved consistencies of which often illusive but never really lapsing it would be of a certain diversion and might be of some profit to follow The author s accepted task at the outset has been to suggest with force the nature of the tie formed between the two young persons first introduced to give the full impression of its peculiar worried and baffled yet clinging and confident ardour The picture constituted so far as may be is that of a pair of natures well nigh consumed by a sense of their intimate affinity and congruity the reciprocity of their desire and thus passionately impatient of barriers and delays yet with qualities of intelligence and character that they are meanwhile extraordinarily able to draw upon for the enrichment of their relation the extension of their prospect and the support of their game They are far from a common couple Merton Densher and Kate Croy as befits the remarkable fashion in which fortune was to waylay and opportunity was to distinguish them the whole strange truth of their response to which opening involves also in its order no vulgar art of exhibition but what they have most to tell us is that all unconsciously and with the best faith in the world all by mere force of the terms of their superior passion combined with their superior diplomacy they are laying a trap for the great innocence to come If I like as I have confessed the portentous look I was perhaps never to set so high a value on it as for all this prompt provision of forces unwittingly waiting to close round my eager heroine to the eventual deep chill of her eagerness as the result of her mere lifting of a latch Infinitely interesting to have built up the relation of the others to the point at which its aching restlessness its need to affirm itself otherwise than by an exasperated patience meets as with instinctive relief and recognition the possibilities shining out of Milly Theale Infinitely interesting to have prepared and organised correspondingly that young woman s precipitations and liabilities to have constructed for Drama essentially to take possession the whole bright house of her exposure These references however reflect too little of the detail of the treatment imposed such a detail as I for instance get hold of in the fact of Densher s interview with missus Lowder before he goes to America It forms in this preliminary picture the one patch not strictly seen over Kate Croy s shoulder though it s notable that immediately after at the first possible moment we surrender again to our major convenience as it happens to be at the time that of our drawing breath through the young woman s lungs Once more in other words before we know it Densher s direct vision of the scene at Lancaster Gate is replaced by her apprehension her contributive assimilation of his experience it melts back into that accumulation which we have been as it were saving up Does my apparent deviation here count accordingly as a muddle one of the muddles ever blooming so thick in any soil that fails to grow reasons and determinants No distinctly not for I had definitely opened the door as attention of perusal of the first two Books will show to the subjective community of my young pair Attention of perusal I thus confess by the way is what I at every point as well as here absolutely invoke and take for granted a truth I avail myself of this occasion to note once for all in the interest of that variety of ideal reigning I gather in the connexion The enjoyment of a work of art the acceptance of an irresistible illusion constituting to my sense our highest experience of luxury the luxury is not greatest by my consequent measure when the work asks for as little attention as possible It is greatest it is delightfully divinely great when we feel the surface like the thick ice of the skater s pond bear without cracking the strongest pressure we throw on it The sound of the crack one may recognise but never surely to call it a luxury That I had scarce availed myself of the privilege of seeing with Densher s eyes is another matter the point is that I had intelligently marked my possible my occasional need of it So at all events the constructional block of the first two Books compactly forms itself A new block all of the squarest and not a little of the smoothest begins with the Third by which I mean of course a new mass of interest governed from a new centre Here again I make prudent PROVISION to be sure to keep my centre strong It dwells mainly we at once see in the depths of Milly Theale s case where close beside it however we meet a supplementary reflector that of the lucid even though so quivering spirit of her dedicated friend The more or less associated consciousness of the two women deals thus unequally with the next presented face of the subject deals with it to the exclusion of the dealing of others and if for a highly particular moment I allot to missus Stringham the responsibility of the direct appeal to us it is again charming to relate on behalf of that play of the portentous which I cherish so as a value and am accordingly for ever setting in motion There is an hour of evening on the alpine height at which it becomes of the last importance that our young woman should testify eminently in this direction But as I was to find it long since of a blest wisdom that no expense should be incurred or met in any corner of picture of mine without some concrete image of the account kept of it that is of its being organically re economised so under that dispensation missus Stringham has to register the transaction Book Fifth is a new block mainly in its provision of a new set of occasions which readopt for their order the previous centre Milly s now almost full blown consciousness At my game with renewed zest of driving portents home I have by this time all the choice of those that are to brush that surface with a dark wing They are used to our profit on an elastic but a definite system by which I mean that having to sound here and there a little deep as a test for my basis of method I find it everywhere obstinately present It draws the occasion into tune and keeps it so to repeat my tiresome term my nearest approach to muddlement is to have sometimes but not too often to break my occasions small Some of them succeed in remaining ample and in really aspiring then to the higher the sustained lucidity The whole actual centre of the work resting on a misplaced pivot and lodged in Book Fifth pretends to a long reach or at any rate to the larger foreshortening though bringing home to me on re perusal what I find striking charming and curious the author s instinct everywhere for the INDIRECT presentation of his main image I note how again and again I go but a little way with the direct that is with the straight exhibition of Milly it resorts for relief this process whenever it can to some kinder some merciful indirection all as if to approach her circuitously deal with her at second hand as an unspotted princess is ever dealt with the pressure all round her kept easy for her the sounds the movements regulated the forms and ambiguities made charming All of which proceeds obviously from her painter s tenderness of imagination about her which reduces him to watching her as it were through the successive windows of other people s interest in her So if we talk of princesses do the balconies opposite the palace gates do the coigns of vantage and respect enjoyed for a fee rake from afar the mystic figure in the gilded coach as it comes forth into the great PLACE But my use of windows and balconies is doubtless at best an extravagance by itself and as to what there may be to note of this and other supersubtleties other arch refinements of tact and taste of design and instinct in The Wings of the Dove I become conscious of overstepping my space without having brought the full quantity to light The failure leaves me with a burden of residuary comment of which I yet boldly hope elsewhere to discharge myself VOLUME one Book First Chapter one She waited Kate Croy for her father to come in but he kept her unconscionably and there were moments at which she showed herself in the glass over the mantel a face positively pale with the irritation that had brought her to the point of going away without sight of him It was at this point however that she remained changing her place moving from the shabby sofa to the armchair upholstered in a glazed cloth that gave at once she had tried it the sense of the slippery and of the sticky She had looked at the sallow prints on the walls and at the lonely magazine a year old that combined with a small lamp in coloured glass and a knitted white centre piece wanting in freshness to enhance the effect of the purplish cloth on the principal table she had above all from time to time taken a brief stand on the small balcony to which the pair of long windows gave access The vulgar little street in this view offered scant relief from the vulgar little room its main office was to suggest to her that the narrow black house fronts adjusted to a standard that would have been low even for backs constituted quite the publicity implied by such privacies One felt them in the room exactly as one felt the room the hundred like it or worse in the street Each time she turned in again each time in her impatience she gave him up it was to sound to a deeper depth while she tasted the faint flat emanation of things the failure of fortune and of honour If she continued to wait it was really in a manner that she mightn t add the shame of fear of individual of personal collapse to all the other shames To feel the street to feel the room to feel the table cloth and the centre piece and the lamp gave her a small salutary sense at least of neither shirking nor lying This whole vision was the worst thing yet as including in particular the interview to which she had braced herself and for what had she come but for the worst She tried to be sad so as not to be angry but it made her angry that she couldn t be sad And yet where was misery misery too beaten for blame and chalk marked by fate like a lot at a common auction if not in these merciless signs of mere mean stale feelings Her father s life her sister s her own that of her two lost brothers the whole history of their house had the effect of some fine florid voluminous phrase say even a musical that dropped first into words and notes without sense and then hanging unfinished into no words nor any notes at all Why should a set of people have been put in motion on such a scale and with such an air of being equipped for a profitable journey only to break down without an accident to stretch themselves in the wayside dust without a reason The answer to these questions was not in Chirk Street but the questions themselves bristled there and the girl s repeated pause before the mirror and the chimney place might have represented her nearest approach to an escape from them Wasn t it in fact the partial escape from this worst in which she was steeped to be able to make herself out again as agreeable to see She stared into the tarnished glass too hard indeed to be staring at her beauty alone She readjusted the poise of her black closely feathered hat retouched beneath it the thick fall of her dusky hair kept her eyes aslant no less on her beautiful averted than on her beautiful presented oval She was dressed altogether in black which gave an even tone by contrast to her clear face and made her hair more harmoniously dark Outside on the balcony her eyes showed as blue within at the mirror they showed almost as black She was handsome but the degree of it was not sustained by items and aids a circumstance moreover playing its part at almost any time in the impression she produced The impression was one that remained but as regards the sources of it no sum in addition would have made up the total She had stature without height grace without motion presence without mass Slender and simple frequently soundless she was somehow always in the line of the eye she counted singularly for its pleasure More dressed often with fewer accessories than other women or less dressed should occasion require with more she probably couldn t have given the key to these felicities They were mysteries of which her friends were conscious those friends whose general explanation was to say that she was clever whether or no it were taken by the world as the cause or as the effect of her charm If she saw more things than her fine face in the dull glass of her father s lodgings she might have seen that after all she was not herself a fact in the collapse She didn t hold herself cheap she didn t make for misery Personally no she wasn t chalk marked for auction She hadn t given up yet and the broken sentence if she was the last word WOULD end with a sort of meaning There was a minute during which though her eyes were fixed she quite visibly lost herself in the thought of the way she might still pull things round had she only been a man It was the name above all she would take in hand the precious name she so liked and that in spite of the harm her wretched father had done it wasn t yet past praying for She loved it in fact the more tenderly for that bleeding wound But what could a penniless girl do with it but let it go When her father at last appeared she became as usual instantly aware of the futility of any effort to hold him to anything He had written her he was ill too ill to leave his room and that he must see her without delay and if this had been as was probable the sketch of a design he was indifferent even to the moderate finish required for deception He had clearly wanted for the perversities he called his reasons to see her just as she herself had sharpened for a talk but she now again felt in the inevitability of the freedom he used with her all the old ache her poor mother s very own that he couldn t touch you ever so lightly without setting up No relation with him could be so short or so superficial as not to be somehow to your hurt and this in the strangest way in the world not because he desired it to be feeling often as he surely must the profit for him of its not being but because there was never a mistake for you that he could leave unmade nor a conviction of his impossibility in you that he could approach you without strengthening He might have awaited her on the sofa in his sitting room or might have stayed in bed and received her in that situation She was glad to be spared the sight of such penetralia but it would have reminded her a little less that there was no truth in him This was the weariness of every fresh meeting he dealt out lies as he might the cards from the greasy old pack for the game of diplomacy to which you were to sit down with him The inconvenience as always happens in such cases was not that you minded what was false but that you missed what was true He might be ill and it might suit you to know it but no contact with him for this could ever be straight enough Just so he even might die but Kate fairly wondered on what evidence of his own she would some day have to believe it He had not at present come down from his room which she knew to be above the one they were in he had already been out of the house though he would either should she challenge him deny it or present it as a proof of his extremity She had however by this time quite ceased to challenge him not only face to face with him vain irritation dropped but he breathed upon the tragic consciousness in such a way that after a moment nothing of it was left The difficulty was not less that he breathed in the same way upon the comic she almost believed that with this latter she might still have found a foothold for clinging to him He had ceased to be amusing he was really too inhuman His perfect look which had floated him so long was practically perfect still but one had long since for every occasion taken it for granted Nothing could have better shown than the actual how right one had been He looked exactly as much as usual all pink and silver as to skin and hair all straightness and starch as to figure and dress the man in the world least connected with anything unpleasant He was so particularly the English gentleman and the fortunate settled normal person Seen at a foreign table d hote he suggested but one thing In what perfection England produces them He had kind safe eyes and a voice which for all its clean fulness told the quiet tale of its having never had once to raise itself Life had met him so halfway and had turned round so to walk with him placing a hand in his arm and fondly leaving him to choose the pace Those who knew him a little said How he does dress those who knew him better said How DOES he The one stray gleam of comedy just now in his daughter s eyes was the absurd feeling he momentarily made her have of being herself looked up by him in sordid lodgings For a minute after he came in it was as if the place were her own and he the visitor with susceptibilities He gave you absurd feelings he had indescribable arts that quite turned the tables this had been always how he came to see her mother so long as her mother would see him He came from places they had often not known about but he patronised Lexham Gardens Kate s only actual expression of impatience however was I m glad you re so much better I m not so much better my dear I m exceedingly unwell the proof of which is precisely that I ve been out to the chemist s that beastly fellow at the corner So mister Croy showed he could qualify the humble hand that assuaged him I m taking something he has made up for me It s just why I ve sent for you that you may see me as I really am Oh papa it s long since I ve ceased to see you otherwise than as you really are I think we ve all arrived by this time at the right word for that You re beautiful n en parlons plus You re as beautiful as ever you look lovely He judged meanwhile her own appearance as she knew she could always trust him to do recognising estimating sometimes disapproving what she wore showing her the interest he continued to take in her He might really take none at all yet she virtually knew herself the creature in the world to whom he was least indifferent She had often enough wondered what on earth at the pass he had reached could give him pleasure and had come back on these occasions to that It gave him pleasure that she was handsome that she was in her way a tangible value It was at least as marked nevertheless that he derived none from similar conditions so far as they WERE similar in his other child Poor Marian might be handsome but he certainly didn t care The hitch here of course was that with whatever beauty her sister widowed and almost in want with four bouncing children had no such measure She asked him the next thing how long he had been in his actual quarters though aware of how little it mattered how little any answer he might make would probably have in common with the truth She failed in fact to notice his answer truthful or not already occupied as she was with what she had on her own side to say to him This was really what had made her wait what superseded the small remainder of her resentment at his constant practical impertinence the result of all of which was that within a minute she had brought it out Yes even now I m willing to go with you I don t know what you may have wished to say to me and even if you hadn t written you would within a day or two have heard from me Things have happened and I ve only waited for seeing you till I should be quite sure I AM quite sure I ll go with you It produced an effect Go with me where Anywhere I ll stay with you Even here She had taken off her gloves and as if she had arrived with her plan she sat down Lionel Croy hung about in his disengaged way hovered there as if looking in consequence of her words for a pretext to back out easily on which she immediately saw she had discounted as it might be called what he had himself been preparing He wished her not to come to him still less to settle with him and had sent for her to give her up with some style and state a part of the beauty of which however was to have been his sacrifice to her own detachment There was no style no state unless she wished to forsake him His idea had accordingly been to surrender her to her wish with all nobleness it had by no means been to have positively to keep her off She cared however not a straw for his embarrassment feeling how little on her own part she was moved by charity She had seen him first and last in so many attitudes that she could now deprive him quite without compunction of the luxury of a new one Yet she felt the disconcerted gasp in his tone as he said Oh my child I can never consent to that What then are you going to do I m turning it over said Lionel Croy You may imagine if I m not thinking Haven t you thought then his daughter asked of what I speak of I mean of my being ready Standing before her with his hands behind him and his legs a little apart he swayed slightly to and fro inclined toward her as if rising on his toes It had an effect of conscientious deliberation No I haven t I couldn t I wouldn t It was so respectable a show that she felt afresh and with the memory of their old despair the despair at home how little his appearance ever by any chance told about him His plausibility had been the heaviest of her mother s crosses inevitably so much more present to the world than whatever it was that was horrid thank God they didn t really know that he had done He had positively been in his way by the force of his particular type a terrible husband not to live with his type reflecting so invidiously on the woman who had found him distasteful Had this thereby not kept directly present to Kate her self that it might on some sides prove no light thing for her to leave uncompanion d a parent with such a face and such a manner Yet if there was much she neither knew nor dreamed of it passed between them at this very moment that he was quite familiar with himself as the subject of such quandaries If he recognised his younger daughter s happy aspect as a tangible value he had from the first still more exactly appraised every point of his own The great wonder was not that in spite of everything these points had helped him the great wonder was that they hadn t helped him more However it was to its eternal recurrent tune helping him all the while her drop into patience with him showed how it was helping him at this moment She saw the next instant precisely the line he would take Do you really ask me to believe you ve been making up your mind to that She had to consider her own line I don t think I care papa what you believe I never for that matter think of you as believing anything hardly more she permitted herself to add than I ever think of you as yourself believed I don t know you father you see And it s your idea that you may make that up Oh dear no not at all That s no part of the question If I haven t understood you by this time I never shall and it doesn t matter It has seemed to me you may be lived with but not that you may be understood Of course I ve not the least idea how you get on I don t get on mister Croy almost gaily replied His daughter took the place in again and it might well have seemed odd that with so little to meet the eye there should be so much to show What showed was the ugliness so positive and palpable that it was somehow sustaining It was a medium a setting and to that extent after all a dreadful sign of life so that it fairly gave point to her answer Oh I beg your pardon You flourish Do you throw it up at me again he pleasantly put to her that I ve not made away with myself She treated the question as needing no reply she sat there for real things You know how all our anxieties under mamma s will have come out She had still less to leave than she feared We don t know how we lived It all makes up about two hundred a year for Marian and two for me but I give up a hundred to Marian Oh you weak thing her father sighed as from depths of enlightened experience For you and me together she went on the other hundred would do something And what would do the rest Can you yourself do nothing He gave her a look then slipping his hands into his pockets and turning away stood for a little at the window she had left open She said nothing more she had placed him there with that question and the silence lasted a minute broken by the call of an appealing costermonger which came in with the mild March air with the shabby sunshine fearfully unbecoming to the room and with the small homely hum of Chirk Street Presently he moved nearer but as if her question had quite dropped I don t see what has so suddenly wound you up I should have thought you might perhaps guess Let me at any rate tell you Aunt Maud has made me a proposal But she has also made me a condition She wants to keep me And what in the world else COULD she possibly want Oh I don t know many things I m not so precious a capture the girl a little dryly explained No one has ever wanted to keep me before Looking always what was proper her father looked now still more surprised than interested You ve not had proposals He spoke as if that were incredible of Lionel Croy s daughter as if indeed such an admission scarce consorted even in filial intimacy with her high spirit and general form Not from rich relations She s extremely kind to me but it s time she says that we should understand each other mister Croy fully assented Of course it is high time and I can quite imagine what she means by it Are you very sure Oh perfectly She means that she ll do for you handsomely if you ll break off all relations with me You speak of her condition Her condition s of course that Well then said Kate it s what has wound me up Here I am He showed with a gesture how thoroughly he had taken it in after which within a few seconds he had quite congruously turned the situation about Do you really suppose me in a position to justify your throwing yourself upon me She waited a little but when she spoke it was clear Yes Well then you re of feebler intelligence than I should have ventured to suppose you Why so You live You flourish You bloom Ah how you ve all always hated me he murmured with a pensive gaze again at the window No one could be less of a mere cherished memory she declared as if she had not heard him You re an actual person if there ever was one We agreed just now that you re beautiful You strike me you know as in your own way much more firm on your feet than I Don t put it to me therefore as monstrous that the fact that we re after all parent and child should at present in some manner count for us My idea has been that it should have some effect for each of us I don t at all as I told you just now she pursued make out your life but whatever it is I hereby offer to accept it And on my side I ll do everything I can for you I see said Lionel Croy Then with the sound of extreme relevance And what CAN you She only at this hesitated and he took up her silence You can describe yourself TO yourself as in a fine flight giving up your aunt for me but what good I should like to know would your fine flight do me As she still said nothing he developed a little We re not possessed of so much at this charming pass please to remember as that we can afford not to take hold of any perch held out to us I like the way you talk my dear about giving up One doesn t give up the use of a spoon because one s reduced to living on broth And your spoon that is your aunt please consider is partly mine as well She rose now as if in sight of the term of her effort in sight of the futility and the weariness of many things and moved back to the poor little glass with which she had communed before She retouched here again the poise of her hat and this brought to her father s lips another remark in which impatience however had already been replaced by a free flare of appreciation Oh you re all right Don t muddle yourself up with ME His daughter turned round to him The condition Aunt Maud makes is that I shall have absolutely nothing to do with you never see you nor speak nor write to you never go near you nor make you a sign nor hold any sort of communication with you What she requires is that you shall simply cease to exist for me He had always seemed it was one of the marks of what they called the unspeakable in him to walk a little more on his toes as if for jauntiness under the touch of offence Nothing however was more wonderful than what he sometimes would take for offence unless it might be what he sometimes wouldn t He walked at any rate on his toes now A very proper requirement of your Aunt Maud my dear I don t hesitate to say it Yet as this much as she had seen left her silent at first from what might have been a sense of sickness he had time to go on That s her condition then But what are her promises Just what does she engage to do You must work it you know You mean make her feel Kate asked after a moment how much I m attached to you Well what a cruel invidious treaty it is for you to sign I m a poor ruin of an old dad to make a stand about giving up I quite agree But I m not after all quite the old ruin not to get something FOR giving up Oh I think her idea said Kate almost gaily now is that I shall get a great deal He met her with his inimitable amenity But does she give you the items The girl went through the show More or less I think But many of them are things I dare say I may take for granted things women can do for each other and that you wouldn t understand There s nothing I understand so well always as the things I needn t But what I want to do you see he went on is to put it to your conscience that you ve an admirable opportunity and that it s moreover one for which after all damn you you ve really to thank ME I confess I don t see Kate observed what my conscience has to do with it Then my dear girl you ought simply to be ashamed of yourself Do you know what you re a proof of all you hard hollow people together He put the question with a charming air of sudden spiritual heat Of the deplorably superficial morality of the age The family sentiment in our vulgarised brutalised life has gone utterly to pot There was a day when a man like me by which I mean a parent like me would have been for a daughter like you quite a distinct value what s called in the business world I believe an asset He continued sociably to make it out I m not talking only of what you might with the right feeling do FOR me but of what you might it s what I call your opportunity do WITH me Unless indeed he the next moment imperturbably threw off they come a good deal to the same thing Your duty as well as your chance if you re capable of seeing it is to use me Show family feeling by seeing what I m good for If you had it as I have it you d see I m still good well for a lot of things There s in fact my dear mister Croy wound up a coach and four to be got out of me His lapse or rather his climax failed a little of effect indeed through an undue precipitation of memory Something his daughter had said came back to him You ve settled to give away half your little inheritance Her hesitation broke into laughter No I haven t settled anything But you mean practically to let Marian collar it They stood there face to face but she so denied herself to his challenge that he could only go on You ve a view of three hundred a year for her in addition to what her husband left her with Is THAT the remote progenitor of such wantonness audibly wondered your morality Kate found her answer without trouble Is it your idea that I should give you everything The everything clearly struck him to the point even of determining the tone of his reply Far from it How can you ask that when I refuse what you tell me you came to offer Make of my idea what you can I think I ve sufficiently expressed it and it s at any rate to take or to leave It s the only one I may nevertheless add it s the basket with all my eggs It s my conception in short of your duty The girl s tired smile watched the word as if it had taken on a small grotesque visibility You re wonderful on such subjects I think I should leave you in no doubt she pursued that if I were to sign my aunt s agreement I should carry it out in honour to the letter Rather my own love It s just your honour that I appeal to The only way to play the game IS to play it There s no limit to what your aunt can do for you Do you mean in the way of marrying me What else should I mean Marry properly And then Kate asked as he hung fire And then well I WILL talk with you I ll resume relations She looked about her and picked up her parasol Because you re not so afraid of any one else in the world as you are of HER My husband if I should marry would be at the worst less of a terror If that s what you mean there may be something in it But doesn t it depend a little also on what you mean by my getting a proper one However Kate added as she picked out the frill of her little umbrella I don t suppose your idea of him is QUITE that he should persuade you to live with us Dear no not a bit He spoke as not resenting either the fear or the hope she imputed met both imputations in fact with a sort of intellectual relief I place the case for you wholly in your aunt s hands I take her view with my eyes shut I accept in all confidence any man she selects If he s good enough for HER elephantine snob as she is he s good enough for me and quite in spite of the fact that she ll be sure to select one who can be trusted to be nasty to me My only interest is in your doing what she wants You shan t be so beastly poor my darling mister Croy declared if I can help it Well then good bye papa the girl said after a reflexion on this that had perceptibly ended for her in a renunciation of further debate Of course you understand that it may be for long Her companion had hereupon one of his finest inspirations Why not frankly for ever You must do me the justice to see that I don t do things that I ve never done them by halves that if I offer you to efface myself it s for the final fatal sponge I ask well saturated and well applied She turned her handsome quiet face upon him at such length that it might indeed have been for the last time I don t know what you re like No more do I my dear I ve spent my life in trying in vain to discover Like nothing more s the pity If there had been many of us and we could have found each other out there s no knowing what we mightn t have done But it doesn t matter now Good bye love He looked even not sure of what she would wish him to suppose on the subject of a kiss yet also not embarrassed by his uncertainty She forbore in fact for a moment longer to clear it up I wish there were some one here who might serve for any contingency as a witness that I HAVE put it to you that I m ready to come Would you like me her father asked to call the landlady You may not believe me she pursued but I came really hoping you might have found some way I m very sorry at all events to leave you unwell He turned away from her on this and as he had done before took refuge by the window in a stare at the street Let me put it unfortunately without a witness she added after a moment that there s only one word you really need speak When he took these words up it was still with his back to her If I don t strike you as having already spoken it our time has been singularly wasted I ll engage with you in respect to my aunt exactly to what she wants of me in respect to you She wants me to choose Very well I WILL choose I ll wash my hands of her for you to just that tune He at last brought himself round Do you know dear you make me sick I ve tried to be clear and it isn t fair But she passed this over she was too visibly sincere Father I don t quite see what s the matter with you he said and if you can t pull yourself together I ll upon my honour take you in hand Put you into a cab and deliver you again safe at Lancaster Gate She was really absent distant Father It was too much and he met it sharply Well Strange as it may be to you to hear me say it there s a good you can do me and a help you can render Isn t it then exactly what I ve been trying to make you feel Yes she answered patiently but so in the wrong way I m perfectly honest in what I say and I know what I m talking about It isn t that I ll pretend I could have believed a month ago in anything to call aid or support from you The case is changed that s what has happened my difficulty is a new one But even now it s not a question of anything I should ask you in a way to do It s simply a question of your not turning me away taking yourself out of my life It s simply a question of your saying Yes then since you will we ll stand together We won t worry in advance about how or where we ll have a faith and find a way That s all THAT would be the good you d do me I should HAVE you and it would be for my benefit Do you see If he didn t it wasn t for want of looking at her hard The matter with you is that you re in love and that your aunt knows and for reasons I m sure perfect hates and opposes it Well she may It s a matter in which I trust her with my eyes shut Go please Though he spoke not in anger rather in infinite sadness he fairly turned her out Before she took it up he had as the fullest expression of what he felt opened the door of the room He had fairly in his deep disapproval a generous compassion to spare I m sorry for her deluded woman if she builds on you Kate stood a moment in the draught She s not the person I pity most for deluded in many ways though she may be she s not the person who s most so I mean she explained if it s a question of what you call building on me He took it as if what she meant might be other than her description of it You re deceiving TWO persons then missus Lowder and somebody else She shook her head with detachment I ve no intention of that sort with respect to any one now to missus Lowder least of all If you fail me she seemed to make it out for herself that has the merit at least that it simplifies I shall go my way as I see my way Your way you mean then will be to marry some blackguard without a penny You demand a great deal of satisfaction she observed for the little you give It brought him up again before her as with a sense that she was not to be hustled and though he glared at her a little this had long been the practical limit to his general power of objection If you re base enough to incur your aunt s reprobation you re base enough for my argument What if you re not thinking of an utterly improper person do your speeches to me signify Who IS the beggarly sneak he went on as her response failed Her response when it came was cold but distinct He has every disposition to make the best of you He only wants in fact to be kind to you Then he MUST be an ass And how in the world can you consider it to improve him for me her father pursued that he s also destitute and impossible There are boobies and boobies even the right and the wrong and you appear to have carefully picked out one of the wrong Your aunt knows THEM by good fortune I perfectly trust as I tell you her judgement for them and you may take it from me once for all that I won t hear of any one of whom SHE won t Which led up to his last word If you should really defy us both Well papa Well my sweet child I think that reduced to insignificance as you may fondly believe me I should still not be quite without some way of making you regret it She had a pause a grave one but not as appeared that she might measure this danger If I shouldn t do it you know it wouldn t be because I m afraid of you Oh if you don t do it he retorted you may be as bold as you like Then you can do nothing at all for me He showed her this time unmistakeably it was before her there on the landing at the top of the tortuous stairs and in the midst of the strange smell that seemed to cling to them how vain her appeal remained I ve never pretended to do more than my duty I ve given you the best and the clearest advice And then came up the spring that moved him If it only displeases you you can go to Marian to be consoled What he couldn t forgive was her dividing with Marian her scant share of the provision their mother had been able to leave them She should have divided it with HIM Book First Chapter two She had gone to missus Lowder on her mother s death gone with an effort the strain and pain of which made her at present as she recalled them reflect on the long way she had travelled since then There had been nothing else to do not a penny in the other house nothing but unpaid bills that had gathered thick while its mistress lay mortally ill and the admonition that there was nothing she must attempt to raise money on since everything belonged to the estate How the estate would turn out at best presented itself as a mystery altogether gruesome it had proved in fact since then a residuum a trifle less scant than with her sister she had for some weeks feared but the girl had had at the beginning rather a wounded sense of its being watched on behalf of Marian and her children What on earth was it supposed that SHE wanted to do to it She wanted in truth only to give up to abandon her own interest which she doubtless would already have done hadn t the point been subject to Aunt Maud s sharp intervention Aunt Maud s intervention was all sharp now and the other point the great one was that it was to be in this light either all put up with or all declined Yet at the winter s end nevertheless she could scarce have said what stand she conceived she had taken It wouldn t be the first time she had seen herself obliged to accept with smothered irony other people s interpretation of her conduct She often ended by giving up to them it seemed really the way to live the version that met their convenience The tall rich heavy house at Lancaster Gate on the other side of the Park and the long South Kensington stretches had figured to her through childhood through girlhood as the remotest limit of her vague young world It was further off and more occasional than anything else in the comparatively compact circle in which she revolved and seemed by a rigour early marked to be reached through long straight discouraging vistas perfect telescopes of streets and which kept lengthening and straightening whereas almost everything else in life was either at the worst roundabout Cromwell Road or at the furthest in the nearer parts of Kensington Gardens missus Lowder was her only real aunt not the wife of an uncle and had been thereby both in ancient days and when the greater trouble came the person of all persons properly to make some sign in accord with which our young woman s feeling was founded on the impression quite cherished for years that the signs made across the interval just mentioned had never been really in the note of the situation The main office of this relative for the young Croys apart from giving them their fixed measure of social greatness had struck them as being to form them to a conception of what they were not to expect When Kate came to think matters over with wider knowledge she failed quite to see how Aunt Maud could have been different she had rather perceived by this time how many other things might have been yet she also made out that if they had all consciously lived under a liability to the chill breath of ultima Thule they couldn t either on the facts very well have done less What in the event appeared established was that if missus Lowder had disliked them she yet hadn t disliked them so much as they supposed It had at any rate been for the purpose of showing how she struggled with her aversion that she sometimes came to see them that she at regular periods invited them to her house and in short as it now looked kept them along on the terms that would best give her sister the perennial luxury of a grievance This sister poor missus Croy the girl knew had always judged her resentfully and had brought them up Marian the boys and herself to the idea of a particular attitude for signs of the practice of which they watched each other with awe The attitude was to make plain to Aunt Maud with the same regularity as her invitations that they sufficed thanks awfully to themselves But the ground of it Kate lived to discern was that this was only because SHE didn t suffice to them The little she offered was to be accepted under protest yet not really because it was excessive It wounded them there was the rub because it fell short The number of new things our young lady looked out on from the high south window that hung over the Park this number was so great though some of the things were only old ones altered and as the phrase was of other matters done up that life at present turned to her view from week to week more and more the face of a striking and distinguished stranger She had reached a great age for it quite seemed to her that at twenty five it was late to reconsider and her most general sense was a shade of regret that she hadn t known earlier The world was different whether for worse or for better from her rudimentary readings and it gave her the feeling of a wasted past If she had only known sooner she might have arranged herself more to meet it She made at all events discoveries every day some of which were about herself and others about other persons Two of these one under each head more particularly engaged in alternation her anxiety She saw as she had never seen before how material things spoke to her She saw and she blushed to see that if in contrast with some of its old aspects life now affected her as a dress successfully done up this was exactly by reason of the trimmings and lace was a matter of ribbons and silk and velvet She had a dire accessibility to pleasure from such sources She liked the charming quarters her aunt had assigned her liked them literally more than she had in all her other days liked anything and nothing could have been more uneasy than her suspicion of her relative s view of this truth Her relative was prodigious she had never done her relative justice These larger conditions all tasted of her from morning till night but she was a person in respect to whom the growth of acquaintance could only strange as it might seem keep your heart in your mouth The girl s second great discovery was that so far from having been for missus Lowder a subject of superficial consideration the blighted home in Lexham Gardens had haunted her nights and her days Kate had spent all winter hours of observation that were not less pointed for being spent alone recent events which her mourning explained assured her a measure of isolation and it was in the isolation above all that her neighbour s influence worked Sitting far downstairs Aunt Maud was yet a presence from which a sensitive niece could feel herself extremely under pressure She knew herself now the sensitive niece as having been marked from far back She knew more than she could have told you by the upstairs fire in a whole dark December afternoon She knew so much that her knowledge was what fairly kept her there making her at times circulate more endlessly between the small silk covered sofa that stood for her in the firelight and the great grey map of Middlesex spread beneath her lookout To go down to forsake her refuge was to meet some of her discoveries halfway to have to face them or fly before them whereas they were at such a height only like the rumble of a far off siege heard in the provisioned citadel She had almost liked in these weeks what had created her suspense and her stress the loss of her mother the submersion of her father the discomfort of her sister the confirmation of their shrunken prospects the certainty in especial of her having to recognise that should she behave as she called it decently that is still do something for others she would be herself wholly without supplies She held that she had a right to sadness and stillness she nursed them for their postponing power What they mainly postponed was the question of a surrender though she couldn t yet have said exactly of what a general surrender of everything that was at moments the way it presented itself to Aunt Maud s looming personality It was by her personality that Aunt Maud was prodigious and the great mass of it loomed because in the thick the foglike air of her arranged existence there were parts doubtless magnified and parts certainly vague They represented at all events alike the dim and the distinct a strong will and a high hand It was perfectly present to Kate that she might be devoured and she compared herself to a trembling kid kept apart a day or two till her turn should come but sure sooner or later to be introduced into the cage of the lioness The cage was Aunt Maud s own room her office her counting house her battlefield her especial scene in fine of action situated on the ground floor opening from the main hall and figuring rather to our young woman on exit and entrance as a guard house or a toll gate The lioness waited the kid had at least that consciousness was aware of the neighbourhood of a morsel she had reason to suppose tender She would have been meanwhile a wonderful lioness for a show an extraordinary figure in a cage or anywhere majestic magnificent high coloured all brilliant gloss perpetual satin twinkling bugles and flashing gems with a lustre of agate eyes a sheen of raven hair a polish of complexion that was like that of well kept china and that as if the skin were too tight told especially at curves and corners Her niece had a quiet name for her she kept it quiet thinking of her with a free fancy as somehow typically insular she talked to herself of Britannia of the Market Place Britannia unmistakeable but with a pen on her ear and felt she should not be happy till she might on some occasion add to the rest of the panoply a helmet a shield a trident and a ledger It wasn t in truth however that the forces with which as Kate felt she would have to deal were those most suggested by an image simple and broad she was learning after all each day to know her companion and what she had already most perceived was the mistake of trusting to easy analogies There was a whole side of Britannia the side of her florid philistinism her plumes and her train her fantastic furniture and heaving bosom the false gods of her taste and false notes of her talk the sole contemplation of which would be dangerously misleading She was a complex and subtle Britannia as passionate as she was practical with a reticule for her prejudices as deep as that other pocket the pocket full of coins stamped in her image that the world best knew her by She carried on in short behind her aggressive and defensive front operations determined by her wisdom It was in fact as a besieger we have hinted that our young lady in the provisioned citadel had for the present most to think of her and what made her formidable in this character was that she was unscrupulous and immoral So at all events in silent sessions and a youthful off hand way Kate conveniently pictured her what this sufficiently represented being that her weight was in the scale of certain dangers those dangers that by our showing made the younger woman linger and lurk above while the elder below both militant and diplomatic covered as much of the ground as possible Yet what were the dangers after all but just the dangers of life and of London missus Lowder WAS London WAS life the roar of the siege and the thick of the fray There were some things after all of which Britannia was afraid but Aunt Maud was afraid of nothing not even it would appear of arduous thought These impressions none the less Kate kept so much to herself that she scarce shared them with poor Marian the ostensible purpose of her frequent visits to whom yet continued to be to talk over everything One of her reasons for holding off from the last concession to Aunt Maud was that she might be the more free to commit herself to this so much nearer and so much less fortunate relative with whom Aunt Maud would have almost nothing direct to do The sharpest pinch of her state meanwhile was exactly that all intercourse with her sister had the effect of casting down her courage and tying her hands adding daily to her sense of the part not always either uplifting or sweetening that the bond of blood might play in one s life She was face to face with it now with the bond of blood the consciousness of it was what she seemed most clearly to have come into by the death of her mother much of that consciousness as her mother had absorbed and carried away Her haunting harassing father her menacing uncompromising aunt her portionless little nephews and nieces were figures that caused the chord of natural piety superabundantly to vibrate Her manner of putting it to herself but more especially in respect to Marian was that she saw what you might be brought to by the cultivation of consanguinity She had taken in the old days as she supposed the measure of this liability those being the days when as the second born she had thought no one in the world so pretty as Marian no one so charming so clever so assured in advance of happiness and success The view was different now but her attitude had been obliged for many reasons to show as the same The subject of this estimate was no longer pretty as the reason for thinking her clever was no longer plain yet bereaved disappointed demoralised querulous she was all the more sharply and insistently Kate s elder and Kate s own Kate s most constant feeling about her was that she would make her Kate do things and always in comfortless Chelsea at the door of the small house the small rent of which she couldn t help having on her mind she fatalistically asked herself before going in which thing it would probably be this time She noticed with profundity that disappointment made people selfish she marvelled at the serenity it was the poor woman s only one of what Marian took for granted her own state of abasement as the second born her life reduced to mere inexhaustible sisterhood She existed in that view wholly for the small house in Chelsea the moral of which moreover of course was that the more you gave yourself the less of you was left There were always people to snatch at you and it would never occur to THEM that they were eating you up They did that without tasting There was no such misfortune or at any rate no such discomfort she further reasoned as to be formed at once for being and for seeing You always saw in this case something else than what you were and you got in consequence none of the peace of your condition However as she never really let Marian see what she was Marian might well not have been aware that she herself saw Kate was accordingly to her own vision not a hypocrite of virtue for she gave herself up but she was a hypocrite of stupidity for she kept to herself everything that was not herself What she most kept was the particular sentiment with which she watched her sister instinctively neglect nothing that would make for her submission to their aunt a state of the spirit that perhaps marked most sharply how poor you might become when you minded so much the absence of wealth It was through Kate that Aunt Maud should be worked and nothing mattered less than what might become of Kate in the process Kate was to burn her ships in short so that Marian should profit and Marian s desire to profit was quite oblivious of a dignity that had after all its reasons if it had only understood them for keeping itself a little stiff Kate to be properly stiff for both of them would therefore have had to be selfish have had to prefer an ideal of behaviour than which nothing ever was more selfish to the possibility of stray crumbs for the four small creatures The tale of missus Lowder s disgust at her elder niece s marriage to mister Condrip had lost little of its point the incredibly fatuous behaviour of mister Condrip the parson of a dull suburban parish with a saintly profile which was always in evidence being so distinctly on record to keep criticism consistent He had presented his profile on system having goodness knew nothing else to present nothing at all to full face the world with no imagination of the propriety of living and minding his business Criticism had remained on Aunt Maud s part consistent enough she was not a person to regard such proceedings as less of a mistake for having acquired more of the privilege of pathos She hadn t been forgiving and the only approach she made to overlooking them was by overlooking with the surviving delinquent the solid little phalanx that now represented them Of the two sinister ceremonies that she lumped together the marriage and the interment she had been present at the former just as she had sent Marian before it a liberal cheque but this had not been for her more than the shadow of an admitted link with missus Condrip s course She disapproved of clamorous children for whom there was no prospect she disapproved of weeping widows who couldn t make their errors good and she had thus put within Marian s reach one of the few luxuries left when so much else had gone an easy pretext for a constant grievance Kate Croy remembered well what their mother in a different quarter had made of it and it was Marian s marked failure to pluck the fruit of resentment that committed them as sisters to an almost equal fellowship in abjection If the theory was that yes alas one of the pair had ceased to be noticed but that the other was noticed enough to make up for it who would fail to see that Kate couldn t separate herself without a cruel pride That lesson became sharp for our young lady the day after her interview with her father I can t imagine Marian on this occasion said to her how you can think of anything else in the world but the horrid way we re situated And pray how do you know Kate enquired in reply anything about my thoughts It seems to me I give you sufficient proof of how much I think of YOU I don t really my dear know what else you ve to do with Marian s retort on this was a stroke as to which she had supplied herself with several kinds of preparation but there was none the less something of an unexpected note in its promptitude She had foreseen her sister s general fear but here ominously was the special one Well your own business is of course your own business and you may say there s no one less in a position than I to preach to you But all the same if you wash your hands of me for ever in consequence I won t for this once keep back that I don t consider you ve a right as we all stand to throw yourself away It was after the children s dinner which was also their mother s but which their aunt mostly contrived to keep from ever becoming her own luncheon and the two young women were still in the presence of the crumpled table cloth the dispersed pinafores the scraped dishes the lingering odour of boiled food Kate had asked with ceremony if she might put up a window a little and missus Condrip had replied without it that she might do as she liked She often received such enquiries as if they reflected in a manner on the pure essence of her little ones The four had retired with much movement and noise under imperfect control of the small Irish governess whom their aunt had hunted up for them and whose brooding resolve not to prolong so uncrowned a martyrdom she already more than suspected Their mother had become for Kate who took it just for the effect of being their mother quite a different thing from the mild Marian of the past mister Condrip s widow expansively obscured that image She was little more than a ragged relic a plain prosaic result of him as if she had somehow been pulled through him as through an obstinate funnel only to be left crumpled and useless and with nothing in her but what he accounted for She had grown red and almost fat which were not happy signs of mourning less and less like any Croy particularly a Croy in trouble and sensibly like her husband s two unmarried sisters who came to see her in Kate s view much too often and stayed too long with the consequence of inroads upon the tea and bread and butter matters as to which Kate not unconcerned with the tradesmen s books had feelings About them moreover Marian WAS touchy and her nearer relative who observed and weighed things noted as an oddity that she would have taken any reflexion on them as a reflexion on herself If that was what marriage necessarily did to you Kate Croy would have questioned marriage It was at any rate a grave example of what a man and such a man might make of a woman She could see how the Condrip pair pressed their brother s widow on the subject of Aunt Maud who wasn t after all THEIR aunt made her over their interminable cups chatter and even swagger about Lancaster Gate made her more vulgar than it had seemed written that any Croy could possibly become on such a subject They laid it down they rubbed it in that Lancaster Gate was to be kept in sight and that she Kate was to keep it so that curiously or at all events sadly our young woman was sure of being in her own person more permitted to them as an object of comment than they would in turn ever be permitted to herself The beauty of which too was that Marian didn t love them But they were Condrips they had grown near the rose they were almost like Bertie and Maudie like Kitty and Guy They talked of the dead to her which Kate never did it being a relation in which Kate could but mutely listen She couldn t indeed too often say to herself that if that was what marriage did to you It may easily be guessed therefore that the ironic light of such reserves fell straight across the field of Marian s warning I don t quite see she answered where in particular it strikes you that my danger lies I m not conscious I assure you of the least disposition to throw myself anywhere I feel that for the present I ve been quite sufficiently thrown You don t feel Marian brought it all out that you d like to marry Merton Densher Kate took a moment to meet this enquiry Is it your idea that if I should feel so I would be bound to give you notice so that you might step in and head me off Is that your idea the girl asked Then as her sister also had a pause I don t know what makes you talk of mister Densher she observed I talk of him just because you don t That you never do in spite of what I know that s what makes me think of him Or rather perhaps it s what makes me think of YOU If you don t know by this time what I hope for you what I dream of my attachment being what it is it s no use my attempting to tell you But Marian had in fact warmed to her work and Kate was sure she had discussed mister Densher with the Miss Condrips If I name that person I suppose it s because I m so afraid of him If you want really to know he fills me with terror If you want really to know in fact I dislike him as much as I dread him And yet don t think it dangerous to abuse him to me Yes missus Condrip confessed I do think it dangerous but how can I speak of him otherwise I dare say I admit that I shouldn t speak of him at all Only I do want you for once as I said just now to know To know what my dear That I should regard it Marian promptly returned as far and away the worst thing that has happened to us yet Do you mean because he hasn t money Yes for one thing And because I don t believe in him Kate was civil but mechanical What do you mean by not believing in him Well being sure he ll never get it And you MUST have it You SHALL have it To give it to you Marian met her with a readiness that was practically pert To HAVE it first Not at any rate to go on not having it Then we should see We should indeed said Kate Croy It was talk of a kind she loathed but if Marian chose to be vulgar what was one to do It made her think of the Miss Condrips with renewed aversion I like the way you arrange things I like what you take for granted If it s so easy for us to marry men who want us to scatter gold I wonder we any of us do anything else I don t see so many of them about nor what interest I might ever have for them You live my dear she presently added in a world of vain thoughts Not so much as you Kate for I see what I see and you can t turn it off that way The elder sister paused long enough for the younger s face to show in spite of superiority an apprehension I m not talking of any man but Aunt Maud s man nor of any money even if you like but Aunt Maud s money I m not talking of anything but your doing what SHE wants You re wrong if you speak of anything that I want of you I want nothing but what she does That s good enough for me and Marian s tone struck her companion as of the lowest If I don t believe in Merton Densher I do at least in missus Lowder Your ideas are the more striking Kate returned that they re the same as papa s I had them from him you ll be interested to know and with all the brilliancy you may imagine yesterday Marian clearly was interested to know He has been to see you No I went to him Really Marian wondered For what purpose To tell him I m ready to go to him Marian stared To leave Aunt Maud For my father yes She had fairly flushed poor missus Condrip with horror You re ready So I told him I couldn t tell him less And pray could you tell him more Marian gasped in her distress What in the world is he TO us You bring out such a thing as that this way They faced each other the tears were in Marian s eyes Kate watched them there a moment and then said I had thought it well over over and over But you needn t feel injured I m not going He won t have me Her companion still panted it took time to subside Well I wouldn t have you wouldn t receive you at all I can assure you if he had made you any other answer I do feel injured at your having been willing If you were to go to papa my dear you d have to stop coming to me Marian put it thus indefinably as a picture of privation from which her companion might shrink Such were the threats she could complacently make could think herself masterful for making But if he won t take you she continued he shows at least his sharpness Marian had always her views of sharpness she was as her sister privately commented great on that resource But Kate had her refuge from irritation He won t take me she simply repeated But he believes like you in Aunt Maud He threatens me with his curse if I leave her So you WON T As the girl at first said nothing her companion caught at it You won t of course I see you won t But I don t see why conveniently I shouldn t insist to you once for all on the plain truth of the whole matter The truth my dear of your duty Do you ever think about THAT It s the greatest duty of all There you are again Kate laughed Papa s also immense on my duty Oh I don t pretend to be immense but I pretend to know more than you do of life more even perhaps than papa Marian seemed to see that personage at this moment nevertheless in the light of a kinder irony Poor old papa She sighed it with as many condonations as her sister s ear had more than once caught in her Dear old Aunt Maud These were things that made Kate turn for the time sharply away and she gathered herself now to go They were the note again of the abject it was hard to say which of the persons in question had most shown how little they liked her The younger woman proposed at any rate to let discussion rest and she believed that for herself she had done so during the ten minutes elapsing thanks to her wish not to break off short before she could gracefully withdraw It then appeared however that Marian had been discussing still and there was something that at the last Kate had to take up Whom do you mean by Aunt Maud s young man Whom should I mean but Lord Mark And where do you pick up such vulgar twaddle Kate demanded with her clear face How does such stuff in this hole get to you She had no sooner spoken than she asked herself what had become of the grace to which she had sacrificed Marian certainly did little to save it and nothing indeed was so inconsequent as her ground of complaint She desired her to work Lancaster Gate as she believed that scene of abundance could be worked but she now didn t see why advantage should be taken of the bloated connexion to put an affront on her own poor home She appeared in fact for the moment to take the position that Kate kept her in her hole and then heartlessly reflected on her being in it Yet she didn t explain how she had picked up the report on which her sister had challenged her so that it was thus left to her sister to see in it once more a sign of the creeping curiosity of the Miss Condrips They lived in a deeper hole than Marian but they kept their ear to the ground they spent their days in prowling whereas Marian in garments and shoes that seemed steadily to grow looser and larger never prowled There were times when Kate wondered if the Miss Condrips were offered her by fate as a warning for her own future to be taken as showing her what she herself might become at forty if she let things too recklessly go What was expected of her by others and by so many of them could all the same on occasion present itself as beyond a joke and this was just now the aspect it particularly wore She was not only to quarrel with Merton Densher for the pleasure of her five spectators with the Miss Condrips there were five she was to set forth in pursuit of Lord Mark on some preposterous theory of the premium attached to success missus Lowder s hand had hung out the premium and it figured at the end of the course as a bell that would ring break out into public clamour as soon as touched Kate reflected sharply enough on the weak points of this fond fiction with the result at last of a certain chill for her sister s confidence though missus Condrip still took refuge in the plea which was after all the great point that their aunt would be munificent when their aunt should be content The exact identity of her candidate was a detail what was of the essence was her conception of the kind of match it was open to her niece to make with her aid Marian always spoke of marriages as matches but that was again a detail missus Lowder s aid meanwhile awaited them if not to light the way to Lord Mark then to somebody better Marian would put up in fine with somebody better she only wouldn t put up with somebody so much worse Kate had once more to go through all this before a graceful issue was reached It was reached by her paying with the sacrifice of mister Densher for her reduction of Lord Mark to the absurd So they separated softly enough She was to be let off hearing about Lord Mark so long as she made it good that she wasn t underhand about any one else She had denied everything and every one she reflected as she went away and that was a relief but it also made rather a clean sweep of the future The prospect put on a bareness that already gave her something in common with the Miss Condrips Book Second Chapter one Merton Densher who passed the best hours of each night at the office of his newspaper had at times during the day to make up for it a sense or at least an appearance of leisure in accordance with which he was not infrequently to be met in different parts of the town at moments when men of business are hidden from the public eye More than once during the present winter s end he had deviated toward three o clock or toward four into Kensington Gardens where he might for a while on each occasion have been observed to demean himself as a person with nothing to do He made his way indeed for the most part with a certain directness over to the north side but once that ground was reached his behaviour was noticeably wanting in point He moved seemingly at random from alley to alley he stopped for no reason and remained idly agaze he sat down in a chair and then changed to a bench after which he walked about again only again to repeat both the vagueness and the vivacity Distinctly he was a man either with nothing at all to do or with ever so much to think about and it was not to be denied that the impression he might often thus easily make had the effect of causing the burden of proof in certain directions to rest on him It was a little the fault of his aspect his personal marks which made it almost impossible to name his profession He was a longish leanish fairish young Englishman not unamenable on certain sides to classification as for instance by being a gentleman by being rather specifically one of the educated one of the generally sound and generally civil yet though to that degree neither extraordinary nor abnormal he would have failed to play straight into an observer s hands He was young for the House of Commons he was loose for the Army He was refined as might have been said for the City and quite apart from the cut of his cloth sceptical it might have been felt for the Church On the other hand he was credulous for diplomacy or perhaps even for science while he was perhaps at the same time too much in his mere senses for poetry and yet too little in them for art You would have got fairly near him by making out in his eyes the potential recognition of ideas but you would have quite fallen away again on the question of the ideas themselves The difficulty with Densher was that he looked vague without looking weak idle without looking empty It was the accident possibly of his long legs which were apt to stretch themselves of his straight hair and his well shaped head never the latter neatly smooth and apt into the bargain at the time of quite other calls upon it to throw itself suddenly back and supported behind by his uplifted arms and interlocked hands place him for unconscionable periods in communion with the ceiling the tree tops the sky He was in short visibly absent minded irregularly clever liable to drop what was near and to take up what was far he was more a prompt critic than a prompt follower of custom He suggested above all however that wondrous state of youth in which the elements the metals more or less precious are so in fusion and fermentation that the question of the final stamp the pressure that fixes the value must wait for comparative coolness And it was a mark of his interesting mixture that if he was irritable it was by a law of considerable subtlety a law that in intercourse with him it might be of profit though not easy to master One of the effects of it was that he had for you surprises of tolerance as well as of temper He loitered on the best of the relenting days the several occasions we speak of along the part of the Gardens nearest to Lancaster Gate and when always in due time Kate Croy came out of her aunt s house crossed the road and arrived by the nearest entrance there was a general publicity in the proceeding which made it slightly anomalous If their meeting was to be bold and free it might have taken place within doors if it was to be shy or secret it might have taken place almost anywhere better than under missus Lowder s windows They failed indeed to remain attached to that spot they wandered and strolled taking in the course of more than one of these interviews a considerable walk or else picked out a couple of chairs under one of the great trees and sat as much apart apart from every one else as possible But Kate had each time at first the air of wishing to expose herself to pursuit and capture if those things were in question She made the point that she wasn t underhand any more than she was vulgar that the Gardens were charming in themselves and this use of them a matter of taste and that if her aunt chose to glare at her from the drawing room or to cause her to be tracked and overtaken she could at least make it convenient that this should be easily done The fact was that the relation between these young persons abounded in such oddities as were not inaptly symbolised by assignations that had a good deal more appearance than motive Of the strength of the tie that held them we shall sufficiently take the measure but it was meanwhile almost obvious that if the great possibility had come up for them it had done so to an exceptional degree under the protection of the famous law of contraries Any deep harmony that might eventually govern them would not be the result of their having much in common having anything in fact but their affection and would really find its explanation in some sense on the part of each of being poor where the other was rich It is nothing new indeed that generous young persons often admire most what nature hasn t given them from which it would appear after all that our friends were both generous Merton Densher had repeatedly said to himself and from far back that he should be a fool not to marry a woman whose value would be in her differences and Kate Croy though without having quite so philosophised had quickly recognised in the young man a precious unlikeness He represented what her life had never given her and certainly without some such aid as his never would give her all the high dim things she lumped together as of the mind It was on the side of the mind that Densher was rich for her and mysterious and strong and he had rendered her in especial the sovereign service of making that element real She had had all her days to take it terribly on trust no creature she had ever encountered having been able to testify for it directly Vague rumours of its existence had made their precarious way to her but nothing had on the whole struck her as more likely than that she should live and die without the chance to verify them The chance had come it was an extraordinary one on the day she first met Densher and it was to the girl s lasting honour that she knew on the spot what she was in presence of That occasion indeed for everything that straightway flowered in it would be worthy of high commemoration Densher s perception went out to meet the young woman s and quite kept pace with her own recognition Having so often concluded on the fact of his weakness as he called it for life his strength merely for thought life he logically opined was what he must somehow arrange to annex and possess This was so much a necessity that thought by itself only went on in the void it was from the immediate air of life that it must draw its breath So the young man ingenious but large critical but ardent too made out both his case and Kate Croy s They had originally met before her mother s death an occasion marked for her as the last pleasure permitted by the approach of that event after which the dark months had interposed a screen and for all Kate knew made the end one with the beginning The beginning to which she often went back had been a scene for our young woman of supreme brilliancy a party given at a gallery hired by a hostess who fished with big nets A Spanish dancer understood to be at that moment the delight of the town an American reciter the joy of a kindred people an Hungarian fiddler the wonder of the world at large in the name of these and other attractions the company in which Kate by a rare privilege found herself had been freely convoked She lived under her mother s roof as she considered obscurely and was acquainted with few persons who entertained on that scale but she had had dealings with two or three connected as appeared with such two or three through whom the stream of hospitality filtered or diffused could thus now and then spread to outlying receptacles A good natured lady in fine a friend of her mother and a relative of the lady of the gallery had offered to take her to the party in question and had there fortified her further with two or three of those introductions that at large parties lead to other things that had at any rate on this occasion culminated for her in conversation with a tall fair a slightly unbrushed and rather awkward but on the whole a not dreary young man The young man had affected her as detached as it was indeed what he called himself awfully at sea as much more distinct from what surrounded them than any one else appeared to be and even as probably quite disposed to be making his escape when pulled up to be placed in relation with her He gave her his word for it indeed this same evening that only their meeting had prevented his flight but that now he saw how sorry he should have been to miss it This point they had reached by midnight and though for the value of such remarks everything was in the tone by midnight the tone was there too She had had originally her full apprehension of his coerced certainly of his vague condition full apprehensions often being with her immediate then she had had her equal consciousness that within five minutes something between them had well she couldn t call it anything but COME It was nothing to look at or to handle but was somehow everything to feel and to know it was that something for each of them had happened They had found themselves regarding each other straight and for a longer time on end than was usual even at parties in galleries but that in itself after all would have been a small affair for two such handsome persons It wasn t in a word simply that their eyes had met other conscious organs faculties feelers had met as well and when Kate afterwards imaged to herself the sharp deep fact she saw it in the oddest way as a particular performance She had observed a ladder against a garden wall and had trusted herself so to climb it as to be able to see over into the probable garden on the other side On reaching the top she had found herself face to face with a gentleman engaged in a like calculation at the same moment and the two enquirers had remained confronted on their ladders The great point was that for the rest of that evening they had been perched they had not climbed down and indeed during the time that followed Kate at least had had the perched feeling it was as if she were there aloft without a retreat A simpler expression of all this is doubtless but that they had taken each other in with interest and without a happy hazard six months later the incident would have closed in that account of it The accident meanwhile had been as natural as anything in London ever is Kate had one afternoon found herself opposite mister Densher on the Underground Railway She had entered the train at Sloane Square to go to Queen s Road and the carriage in which she took her place was all but full Densher was already in it on the other bench and at the furthest angle she was sure of him before they had again started The day and the hour were darkness there were six other persons and she had been busy seating herself but her consciousness had gone to him as straight as if they had come together in some bright stretch of a desert They had on neither part a second s hesitation they looked across the choked compartment exactly as if she had known he would be there and he had expected her to come in so that though in the conditions they could only exchange the greeting of movements smiles abstentions it would have been quite in the key of these passages that they should have alighted for ease at the very next station Kate was in fact sure the very next station was the young man s true goal which made it clear he was going on only from the wish to speak to her He had to go on for this purpose to High Street Kensington as it was not till then that the exit of a passenger gave him his chance His chance put him however in quick possession of the seat facing her the alertness of his capture of which seemed to show her his impatience It helped them moreover with strangers on either side little to talk though this very restriction perhaps made such a mark for them as nothing else could have done If the fact that their opportunity had again come round for them could be so intensely expressed without a word they might very well feel on the spot that it had not come round for nothing The extraordinary part of the matter was that they were not in the least meeting where they had left off but ever so much further on and that these added links added still another between High Street and Notting Hill Gate and then worked between the latter station and Queen s Road an extension really inordinate At Notting Hill Gate Kate s right hand neighbour descended whereupon Densher popped straight into that seat only there was not much gained when a lady the next instant popped into Densher s He could say almost nothing Kate scarce knew at least what he said she was so occupied with a certainty that one of the persons opposite a youngish man with a single eye glass which he kept constantly in position had made her out from the first as visibly as strangely affected If such a person made her out what then did Densher do a question in truth sufficiently answered when on their reaching her station he instantly followed her out of the train That had been the real beginning the beginning of everything else the other time the time at the party had been but the beginning of THAT Never in life before had she so let herself go for always before so far as small adventures could have been in question for her there had been by the vulgar measure more to go upon He had walked with her to Lancaster Gate and then she had walked with him away from it for all the world she said to herself like the housemaid giggling to the baker This appearance she was afterwards to feel had been all in order for a relation that might precisely best be described in the terms of the baker and the housemaid She could say to herself that from that hour they had kept company that had come to represent technically speaking alike the range and the limit of their tie He had on the spot naturally asked leave to call upon her which as a young person who wasn t really young who didn t pretend to be a sheltered flower she as rationally gave That she was promptly clear about it was now her only possible basis she was just the contemporary London female highly modern inevitably battered honourably free She had of course taken her aunt straight into her confidence had gone through the form of asking her leave and she subsequently remembered that though on this occasion she had left the history of her new alliance as scant as the facts themselves missus Lowder had struck her at the time as surprisingly mild The occasion had been in every way full of the reminder that her hostess was deep it was definitely then that she had begun to ask herself what Aunt Maud was in vulgar parlance up to You may receive my dear whom you like that was what Aunt Maud who in general objected to people s doing as they liked had replied and it bore this unexpectedness a good deal of looking into There were many explanations and they were all amusing amusing that is in the line of the sombre and brooding amusement cultivated by Kate in her actual high retreat Merton Densher came the very next Sunday but missus Lowder was so consistently magnanimous as to make it possible to her niece to see him alone She saw him however on the Sunday following in order to invite him to dinner and when after dining he came again which he did three times she found means to treat his visit as preponderantly to herself Kate s conviction that she didn t like him made that remarkable it added to the evidence by this time voluminous that she was remarkable all round If she had been in the way of energy merely usual she would have kept her dislike direct whereas it was now as if she were seeking to know him in order to see best where to have him That was one of the reflexions made in our young woman s high retreat she smiled from her lookout in the silence that was only the fact of hearing irrelevant sounds as she caught the truth that you could easily accept people when you wanted them so to be delivered to you When Aunt Maud wished them dispatched it was not to be done by deputy it was clearly always a matter reserved for her own hand But what made the girl wonder most was the implication of so much diplomacy in respect to her own value What view might she take of her position in the light of this appearance that her companion feared so as yet to upset her It was as if Densher were accepted partly under the dread that if he hadn t been she would act in resentment Hadn t her aunt considered the danger that she would in that case have broken off have seceded The danger was exaggerated she would have done nothing so gross but that it would seem was the way missus Lowder saw her and believed her to be reckoned with What importance therefore did she really attach to her what strange interest could she take in their keeping on terms Her father and her sister had their answer to this even without knowing how the question struck her they saw the lady of Lancaster Gate as panting to make her fortune and the explanation of that appetite was that on the accident of a nearer view than she had before enjoyed she had been charmed been dazzled They approved they admired in her one of the belated fancies of rich capricious violent old women the more marked moreover because the result of no plot and they piled up the possible fruits for the person concerned Kate knew what to think of her own power thus to carry by storm she saw herself as handsome no doubt but as hard and felt herself as clever but as cold and as so much too imperfectly ambitious futhermore that it was a pity for a quiet life she couldn t decide to be either finely or stupidly indifferent Her intelligence sometimes kept her still too still but her want of it was restless so that she got the good it seemed to her of neither extreme She saw herself at present none the less in a situation and even her sad disillusioned mother dying but with Aunt Maud interviewing the nurse on the stairs had not failed to remind her that it was of the essence of situations to be under Providence worked The dear woman had died in the belief that she was actually working the one then recognised Kate took one of her walks with Densher just after her visit to mister Croy but most of it went as usual to their sitting in talk They had under the trees by the lake the air of old friends particular phases of apparent earnestness in which they might have been settling every question in their vast young world and periods of silence side by side perhaps even more when A long engagement would have been the final reading of the signs on the part of a passer struck with them as it was so easy to be They would have presented themselves thus as very old friends rather than as young persons who had met for the first time but a year before and had spent most of the interval without contact It was indeed for each already as if they were older friends and though the succession of their meetings might between them have been straightened out they only had a confused sense of a good many very much alike and a confused intention of a good many more as little different as possible The desire to keep them just as they were had perhaps to do with the fact that in spite of the presumed diagnosis of the stranger there had been for them as yet no formal no final understanding Densher had at the very first pressed the question but that it had been easy to reply was too soon so that a singular thing had afterwards happened They had accepted their acquaintance as too short for an engagement but they had treated it as long enough for almost anything else and marriage was somehow before them like a temple without an avenue They belonged to the temple and they met in the grounds they were in the stage at which grounds in general offered much scattered refreshment But Kate had meanwhile had so few confidants that she wondered at the source of her father s suspicions The diffusion of rumour was of course always remarkable in London and for Marian not less as Aunt Maud touched neither directly the mystery had worked No doubt she had been seen Of course she had been seen She had taken no trouble not to be seen and it was a thing she was clearly incapable of taking But she had been seen how and what WAS there to see She was in love she knew that but it was wholly her own business and she had the sense of having conducted herself of still so doing with almost violent conformity I ve an idea in fact I feel sure that Aunt Maud means to write to you and I think you had better know it So much as this she said to him as soon as they met but immediately adding to it So as to make up your mind how to take her I know pretty well what she ll say to you Then will you kindly tell me She thought a little I can t do that I should spoil it She ll do the best for her own idea Her idea you mean that I m a sort of a scoundrel or at the best not good enough for you They were side by side again in their penny chairs and Kate had another pause Not good enough for HER Oh I see And that s necessary He put it as a truth rather more than as a question but there had been plenty of truths between them that each had contradicted Kate however let this one sufficiently pass only saying the next moment She has behaved extraordinarily And so have we Densher declared I think you know we ve been awfully decent For ourselves for each other for people in general yes But not for HER For her said Kate we ve been monstrous She has been giving us rope So if she does send for you the girl repeated you must know where you are That I always know It s where YOU are that concerns me Well said Kate after an instant her idea of that is what you ll have from her He gave her a long look and whatever else people who wouldn t let her alone might have wished for her advancement his long looks were the thing in the world she could never have enough of What she felt was that whatever might happen she must keep them must make them most completely her possession and it was already strange enough that she reasoned or at all events began to act as if she might work them in with other and alien things privately cherish them and yet as regards the rigour of it pay no price She looked it well in the face she took it intensely home that they were lovers she rejoiced to herself and frankly to him in their wearing of the name but distinguished creature that in her way she was she took a view of this character that scarce squared with the conventional The character itself she insisted on as their right taking that so for granted that it didn t seem even bold but Densher though he agreed with her found himself moved to wonder at her simplifications her values Life might prove difficult was evidently going to but meanwhile they had each other and that was everything This was her reasoning but meanwhile for HIM each other was what they didn t have and it was just the point Repeatedly however it was a point that in the face of strange and special things he judged it rather awkwardly gross to urge It was impossible to keep missus Lowder out of their scheme She stood there too close to it and too solidly it had to open a gate at a given point do what they would to take her in And she came in always while they sat together rather helplessly watching her as in a coach and four she drove round their prospect as the principal lady at the circus drives round the ring and she stopped the coach in the middle to alight with majesty It was our young man s sense that she was magnificently vulgar but yet quite that this wasn t all It wasn t with her vulgarity that she felt his want of means though that might have helped her richly to embroider it nor was it with the same infirmity that she was strong original dangerous His want of means of means sufficient for any one but himself was really the great ugliness and was moreover at no time more ugly for him than when it rose there as it did seem to rise all shameless face to face with the elements in Kate s life colloquially and conveniently classed by both of them as funny He sometimes indeed for that matter asked himself if these elements were as funny as the innermost fact so often vivid to him of his own consciousness his private inability to believe he should ever be rich His conviction on this head was in truth quite positive and a thing by itself he failed after analysis to understand it though he had naturally more lights on it than any one else He knew how it subsisted in spite of an equal consciousness of his being neither mentally nor physically quite helpless neither a dunce nor a cripple he knew it to be absolute though secret and also strange to say about common undertakings not discouraging not prohibitive Only now was he having to think if it were prohibitive in respect to marriage only now for the first time had he to weigh his case in scales The scales as he sat with Kate often dangled in the line of his vision he saw them large and black while he talked or listened take in the bright air singular positions Sometimes the right was down and sometimes the left never a happy equipoise one or the other always kicking the beam Thus was kept before him the question of whether it were more ignoble to ask a woman to take her chance with you or to accept it from your conscience that her chance could be at the best but one of the degrees of privation whether too otherwise marrying for money mightn t after all be a smaller cause of shame than the mere dread of marrying without Through these variations of mood and view nevertheless the mark on his forehead stood clear he saw himself remain without whether he married or not It was a line on which his fancy could be admirably active the innumerable ways of making money were beautifully present to him he could have handled them for his newspaper as easily as he handled everything He was quite aware how he handled everything it was another mark on his forehead the pair of smudges from the thumb of fortune the brand on the passive fleece dated from the primal hour and kept each other company He wrote as for print with deplorable ease since there had been nothing to stop him even at the age of ten so there was as little at twenty it was part of his fate in the first place and part of the wretched public s in the second The innumerable ways of making money were no doubt at all events what his imagination often was busy with after he had tilted his chair and thrown back his head with his hands clasped behind it What would most have prolonged that attitude moreover was the reflexion that the ways were ways only for others Within the minute now however this might be he was aware of a nearer view than he had yet quite had of those circumstances on his companion s part that made least for simplicity of relation He saw above all how she saw them herself for she spoke of them at present with the last frankness telling him of her visit to her father and giving him in an account of her subsequent scene with her sister an instance of how she was perpetually reduced to patching up in one way or another that unfortunate woman s hopes The tune she exclaimed to which we re a failure as a family With which he had it all again from her and this time as it seemed to him more than all the dishonour her father had brought them his folly and cruelty and wickedness the wounded state of her mother abandoned despoiled and helpless yet for the management of such a home as remained to them dreadfully unreasonable too the extinction of her two young brothers one at nineteen the eldest of the house by typhoid fever contracted at a poisonous little place as they had afterwards found out that they had taken for a summer the other the flower of the flock a middy on the Britannia dreadfully drowned and not even by an accident at sea but by cramp unrescued while bathing too late in the autumn in a wretched little river during a holiday visit to the home of a shipmate Then Marian s unnatural marriage in itself a kind of spiritless turning of the other cheek to fortune her actual wretchedness and plaintiveness her greasy children her impossible claims her odious visitors these things completed the proof of the heaviness for them all of the hand of fate Kate confessedly described them with an excess of impatience it was much of her charm for Densher that she gave in general that turn to her descriptions partly as if to amuse him by free and humorous colour partly and that charm was the greatest as if to work off for her own relief her constant perception of the incongruity of things She had seen the general show too early and too sharply and was so intelligent that she knew it and allowed for that misfortune therefore when in talk with him she was violent and almost unfeminine it was quite as if they had settled for intercourse on the short cut of the fantastic and the happy language of exaggeration It had come to be definite between them at a primary stage that if they could have no other straight way the realm of thought at least was open to them They could think whatever they liked about whatever they would in other words they could say it Saying it for each other for each other alone only of course added to the taste The implication was thereby constant that what they said when not together had no taste for them at all and nothing could have served more to launch them at special hours on their small floating island than such an assumption that they were only making believe everywhere else Our young man it must be added was conscious enough that it was Kate who profited most by this particular play of the fact of intimacy It always struck him she had more life than he to react from and when she recounted the dark disasters of her house and glanced at the hard odd offset of her present exaltation since as exaltation it was apparently to be considered he felt his own grey domestic annals make little show It was naturally in all such reference the question of her father s character that engaged him most but her picture of her adventure in Chirk Street gave him a sense of how little as yet that character was clear to him What was it to speak plainly that mister Croy had originally done I don t know and I don t want to I only know that years and years ago when I was about fifteen something or other happened that made him impossible I mean impossible for the world at large first and then little by little for mother We of course didn t know it at the time Kate explained but we knew it later and it was oddly enough my sister who first made out that he had done something I can hear her now the way one cold black Sunday morning when on account of an extraordinary fog we hadn t gone to church she broke it to me by the school room fire I was reading a history book by the lamp when we didn t go to church we had to read history books and I suddenly heard her say out of the fog which was in the room and apropos of nothing Papa has done something wicked And the curious thing was that I believed it on the spot and have believed it ever since though she could tell me nothing more neither what was the wickedness nor how she knew nor what would happen to him nor anything else about it We had our sense always that all sorts of things HAD happened were all the while happening to him so that when Marian only said she was sure tremendously sure that she had made it out for herself but that that was enough I took her word for it it seemed somehow so natural We were not however to ask mother which made it more natural still and I said never a word But mother strangely enough spoke of it to me in time of her own accord this was very much later on He hadn t been with us for ever so long but we were used to that She must have had some fear some conviction that I had an idea some idea of her own that it was the best thing to do She came out as abruptly as Marian had done If you hear anything against your father anything I mean except that he s odious and vile remember it s perfectly false That was the way I knew it was true though I recall my saying to her then that I of course knew it wasn t She might have told me it was true and yet have trusted me to contradict fiercely enough any accusation of him that I should meet to contradict it much more fiercely and effectively I think than she would have done herself As it happens however the girl went on I ve never had occasion and I ve been conscious of it with a sort of surprise It has made the world seem at times more decent No one has so much as breathed to me That has been a part of the silence the silence that surrounds him the silence that for the world has washed him out He doesn t exist for people And yet I m as sure as ever In fact though I know no more than I did then I m more sure And that she wound up is what I sit here and tell you about my own father If you don t call it a proof of confidence I don t know what will satisfy you It satisfies me beautifully Densher returned but it doesn t my dear child very greatly enlighten me You don t you know really tell me anything It s so vague that what am I to think but that you may very well be mistaken What has he done if no one can name it He has done everything Oh everything Everything s nothing Well then said Kate he has done some particular thing It s known only thank God not to us But it has been the end of him YOU could doubtless find out with a little trouble You can ask about Densher for a moment said nothing but the next moment he made it up I wouldn t find out for the world and I d rather lose my tongue than put a question And yet it s a part of me said Kate A part of you My father s dishonour Then she sounded for him but more deeply than ever yet her note of proud still pessimism How can such a thing as that not be the great thing in one s life She had to take from him again on this one of his long looks and she took it to its deepest its headiest dregs I shall ask you for the great thing in your life he said to depend on ME a little more After which just debating Doesn t he belong to some club he asked She had a grave headshake He used to to many But he has dropped them They ve dropped HIM Of that I m sure It ought to do for you I offered him the girl immediately continued and it was for that I went to him to come and be with him make a home for him so far as is possible But he won t hear of it Densher took this in with marked but generous wonder You offered him impossible as you describe him to me to live with him and share his disadvantages The young man saw for the moment only the high beauty of it You ARE gallant Because it strikes you as being brave for him She wouldn t in the least have this It wasn t courage it was the opposite I did it to save myself to escape He had his air so constant at this stage as of her giving him finer things than any one to think about Escape from what From everything Do you by any chance mean from me No I spoke to him of you told him or what amounted to it that I would bring you if he would allow it with me But he won t allow it said Densher Won t hear of it on any terms He won t help me won t save me won t hold out a finger to me Kate went on He simply wriggles away in his inimitable manner and throws me back Back then after all thank goodness Densher concurred on me But she spoke again as with the sole vision of the whole scene she had evoked It s a pity because you d like him He s wonderful he s charming Her companion gave one of the laughs that showed again how inveterately he felt in her tone something that banished the talk of other women so far as he knew other women to the dull desert of the conventional and she had already continued He would make himself delightful to you Even while objecting to me Well he likes to please the girl explained personally I ve seen it make him wonderful He would appreciate you and be clever with you It s to ME he objects that is as to my liking you Heaven be praised then cried Densher that you like me enough for the objection But she met it after an instant with some inconsequence I don t I offered to give you up if necessary to go to him But it made no difference and that s what I mean she pursued by his declining me on any terms The point is you see that I don t escape Densher wondered But if you didn t wish to escape ME I wished to escape Aunt Maud But he insists that it s through her and through her only that I may help him just as Marian insists that it s through her and through her only that I can help HER That s what I mean she again explained by their turning me back The young man thought Your sister turns you back too Oh with a push But have you offered to live with your sister I would in a moment if she d have me That s all my virtue a narrow little family feeling I ve a small stupid piety I don t know what to call it Kate bravely stuck to that she made it out Sometimes alone I ve to smother my shrieks when I think of my poor mother She went through things they pulled her down I know what they were now I didn t then for I was a pig and my position compared with hers is an insolence of success That s what Marian keeps before me that s what papa himself as I say so inimitably does My position s a value a great value for them both she followed and followed Lucid and ironic she knew no merciful muddle It s THE value the only one they have Everything between our young couple moved today in spite of their pauses their margin to a quicker measure the quickness and anxiety playing lightning like in the sultriness Densher watched decidedly as he had never done before And the fact you speak of holds you Of course it holds me It s a perpetual sound in my ears It makes me ask myself if I ve any right to personal happiness any right to anything but to be as rich and overflowing as smart and shining as I can be made Densher had a pause Oh you might by good luck have the personal happiness too Her immediate answer to this was a silence like his own after which she gave him straight in the face but quite simply and quietly Darling It took him another moment then he was also quiet and simple Will you settle it by our being married to morrow as we can with perfect ease civilly Let us wait to arrange it Kate presently replied till after you ve seen her Do you call that adoring me Densher demanded They were talking for the time with the strangest mixture of deliberation and directness and nothing could have been more in the tone of it than the way she at last said You re afraid of her yourself He gave rather a glazed smile For young persons of a great distinction and a very high spirit we re a caution Yes she took it straight up we re hideously intelligent But there s fun in it too We must get our fun where we can I think she added and for that matter not without courage our relation s quite beautiful It s not a bit vulgar I cling to some saving romance in things It made him break into a laugh that had more freedom than his smile How you must be afraid you ll chuck me No no THAT would be vulgar But of course she admitted I do see my danger of doing something base Then what can be so base as sacrificing me I SHAN T sacrifice you Don t cry out till you re hurt I shall sacrifice nobody and nothing and that s just my situation that I want and that I shall try for everything That she wound up is how I see myself and how I see you quite as much acting for them For them and the young man extravagantly marked his coldness Thank you Don t you care for them Why should I What are they to me but a serious nuisance As soon as he had permitted himself this qualification of the unfortunate persons she so perversely cherished he repented of his roughness and partly because he expected a flash from her But it was one of her finest sides that she sometimes flashed with a mere mild glow I don t see why you don t make out a little more that if we avoid stupidity we may do ALL We may keep her He stared Make her pension us Well wait at least till we ve seen He thought Seen what can be got out of her Kate for a moment said nothing After all I never asked her never when our troubles were at the worst appealed to her nor went near her She fixed upon me herself settled on me with her wonderful gilded claws You speak Densher observed as if she were a vulture Call it an eagle with a gilded beak as well and with wings for great flights If she s a thing of the air in short say at once a great seamed silk balloon I never myself got into her car I was her choice It had really her sketch of the affair a high colour and a great style at all of which he gazed a minute as at a picture by a master What she must see in you Wonders And speaking it loud she stood straight up Everything There it is Yes there it was and as she remained before him he continued to face it So that what you mean is that I m to do my part in somehow squaring her See her see her Kate said with impatience And grovel to her Ah do what you like And she walked in her impatience away Book Second Chapter two His eyes had followed her at this time quite long enough before he overtook her to make out more than ever in the poise of her head the pride of her step he didn t know what best to call it a part at least of missus Lowder s reasons He consciously winced while he figured his presenting himself as a reason opposed to these though at the same moment with the source of Aunt Maud s inspiration thus before him he was prepared to conform by almost any abject attitude or profitable compromise to his companion s easy injunction He would do as SHE liked his own liking might come off as it would He would help her to the utmost of his power for all the rest of this day and the next her easy injunction tossed off that way as she turned her beautiful back was like the crack of a great whip in the blue air the high element in which missus Lowder hung He wouldn t grovel perhaps he wasn t quite ready for that but he would be patient ridiculous reasonable unreasonable and above all deeply diplomatic He would be clever with all his cleverness which he now shook hard as he sometimes shook his poor dear shabby old watch to start it up again It wasn t thank goodness as if there weren t plenty of that factor to use one of his great newspaper words and with what they could muster between them it would be little to the credit of their star however pale that defeat and surrender surrender so early so immediate should have to ensue It was not indeed that he thought of that disaster as at the worst a direct sacrifice of their possibilities he imaged it which was enough as some proved vanity some exposed fatuity in the idea of bringing missus Lowder round When shortly afterwards in this lady s vast drawing room the apartments at Lancaster Gate had struck him from the first as of prodigious extent he awaited her at her request conveyed in a reply paid telegram his theory was that of their still clinging to their idea though with a sense of the difficulty of it really enlarged to the scale of the place He had the place for a long time it seemed to him a quarter of an hour to himself and while Aunt Maud kept him and kept him while observation and reflexion crowded on him he asked himself what was to be expected of a person who could treat one like that The visit the hour were of her own proposing so that her delay no doubt was but part of a general plan of putting him to inconvenience As he walked to and fro however taking in the message of her massive florid furniture the immense expression of her signs and symbols he had as little doubt of the inconvenience he was prepared to suffer He found himself even facing the thought that he had nothing to fall back on and that that was as great an humiliation in a good cause as a proud man could desire It hadn t yet been so distinct to him that he made no show literally not the smallest so complete a show seemed made there all about him so almost abnormally affirmative so aggressively erect were the huge heavy objects that syllabled his hostess s story When all s said and done you know she s colossally vulgar he had once all but noted that of her to her niece only just keeping it back at the last keeping it to himself with all its danger about it It mattered because it bore so directly and he at all events quite felt it a thing that Kate herself would some day bring out to him It bore directly at present and really all the more that somehow strangely it didn t in the least characterise the poor woman as dull or stale She was vulgar with freshness almost with beauty since there was beauty to a degree in the play of so big and bold a temperament She was in fine quite the largest possible quantity to deal with and he was in the cage of the lioness without his whip the whip in a word of a supply of proper retorts He had no retort but that he loved the girl which in such a house as that was painfully cheap Kate had mentioned to him more than once that her aunt was Passionate speaking of it as a kind of offset and uttering it as with a capital P marking it as something that he might that he in fact ought to turn about in some way to their advantage He wondered at this hour to what advantage he could turn it but the case grew less simple the longer he waited Decidedly there was something he hadn t enough of His slow march to and fro seemed to give him the very measure as he paced and paced the distance it became the desert of his poverty at the sight of which expanse moreover he could pretend to himself as little as before that the desert looked redeemable Lancaster Gate looked rich that was all the effect which it was unthinkable that any state of his own should ever remotely resemble He read more vividly more critically as has been hinted the appearances about him and they did nothing so much as make him wonder at his aesthetic reaction He hadn t known and in spite of Kate s repeated reference to her own rebellions of taste that he should mind so much how an independent lady might decorate her house It was the language of the house itself that spoke to him writing out for him with surpassing breadth and freedom the associations and conceptions the ideals and possibilities of the mistress Never he felt sure had he seen so many things so unanimously ugly operatively ominously so cruel He was glad to have found this last name for the whole character cruel somehow played into the subject for an article an article that his impression put straight into his mind He would write about the heavy horrors that could still flourish that lifted their undiminished heads in an age so proud of its short way with false gods and it would be funny if what he should have got from missus Lowder were to prove after all but a small amount of copy Yet the great thing really the dark thing was that even while he thought of the quick column he might add up he felt it less easy to laugh at the heavy horrors than to quail before them He couldn t describe and dismiss them collectively call them either Mid Victorian or Early not being certain they were rangeable under one rubric It was only manifest they were splendid and were furthermore conclusively British They constituted an order and abounded in rare material precious woods metals stuffs stones He had never dreamed of anything so fringed and scalloped so buttoned and corded drawn everywhere so tight and curled everywhere so thick He had never dreamed of so much gilt and glass so much satin and plush so much rosewood and marble and malachite But it was above all the solid forms the wasted finish the misguided cost the general attestation of morality and money a good conscience and a big balance These things finally represented for him a portentous negation of his own world of thought of which for that matter in presence of them he became as for the first time hopelessly aware They revealed it to him by their merciless difference His interview with Aunt Maud none the less took by no means the turn he had expected Passionate though her nature no doubt missus Lowder on this occasion neither threatened nor appealed Her arms of aggression her weapons of defence were presumably close at hand but she left them untouched and unmentioned and was in fact so bland that he properly perceived only afterwards how adroit she had been He properly perceived something else as well which complicated his case he shouldn t have known what to call it if he hadn t called it her really imprudent good nature Her blandness in other words wasn t mere policy he wasn t dangerous enough for policy it was the result he could see of her fairly liking him a little From the moment she did that she herself became more interesting and who knew what might happen should he take to liking HER Well it was a risk he naturally must face She fought him at any rate but with one hand with a few loose grains of stray powder He recognised at the end of ten minutes and even without her explaining it that if she had made him wait it hadn t been to wound him they had by that time almost directly met on the fact of her intention She had wanted him to think for himself of what she proposed to say to him not having otherwise announced it wanted to let it come home to him on the spot as she had shrewdly believed it would Her first question on appearing had practically been as to whether he hadn t taken her hint and this enquiry assumed so many things that it immediately made discussion frank and large He knew with the question put that the hint was just what he HAD taken knew that she had made him quickly forgive her the display of her power knew that if he didn t take care he should understand her and the strength of her purpose to say nothing of that of her imagination nothing of the length of her purse only too well Yet he pulled himself up with the thought too that he wasn t going to be afraid of understanding her he was just going to understand and understand without detriment to the feeblest even of his passions The play of one s mind gave one away at the best dreadfully in action in the need for action where simplicity was all but when one couldn t prevent it the thing was to make it complete There would never be mistakes but for the original fun of mistakes What he must USE his fatal intelligence for was to resist missus Lowder meanwhile might use it for whatever she liked It was after she had begun her statement of her own idea about Kate that he began on his side to reflect that with her manner of offering it as really sufficient if he would take the trouble to embrace it she couldn t half hate him That was all positively she seemed to show herself for the time as attempting clearly if she did her intention justice she would have nothing more disagreeable to do If I hadn t been ready to go very much further you understand I wouldn t have gone so far I don t care what you repeat to her the more you repeat to her perhaps the better and at any rate there s nothing she doesn t already know I don t say it for her I say it for you when I want to reach my niece I know how to do it straight So Aunt Maud delivered herself as with homely benevolence in the simplest but the clearest terms virtually conveying that though a word to the wise was doubtless in spite of the adage NOT always enough a word to the good could never fail to be The sense our young man read into her words was that she liked him because he was good was really by her measure good enough good enough that is to give up her niece for her and go his way in peace But WAS he good enough by his own measure He fairly wondered while she more fully expressed herself if it might be his doom to prove so She s the finest possible creature of course you flatter yourself you know it But I know it quite as well as you possibly can by which I mean a good deal better yet and the tune to which I m ready to prove my faith compares favourably enough I think with anything you can do I don t say it because she s my niece that s nothing to me I might have had fifty nieces and I wouldn t have brought one of them to this place if I hadn t found her to my taste I don t say I wouldn t have done something else but I wouldn t have put up with her presence Kate s presence by good fortune I marked early Kate s presence unluckily for YOU is everything I could possibly wish Kate s presence is in short as fine as you know and I ve been keeping it for the comfort of my declining years I ve watched it long I ve been saving it up and letting it as you say of investments appreciate and you may judge whether now it has begun to pay so I m likely to consent to treat for it with any but a high bidder I can do the best with her and I ve my idea of the best Oh I quite conceive said Densher that your idea of the best isn t me It was an oddity of missus Lowder s that her face in speech was like a lighted window at night but that silence immediately drew the curtain The occasion for reply allowed by her silence was never easy to take yet she was still less easy to interrupt The great glaze of her surface at all events gave her visitor no present help I didn t ask you to come to hear what it isn t I asked you to come to hear what it IS Of course Densher laughed that s very great indeed His hostess went on as if his contribution to the subject were barely relevant I want to see her high high up high up and in the light Ah you naturally want to marry her to a duke and are eager to smooth away any hitch She gave him so on this the mere effect of the drawn blind that it quite forced him at first into the sense possibly just of his having shown for flippant perhaps even for low He had been looked at so in blighted moments of presumptuous youth by big cold public men but never so far as he could recall by any private lady More than anything yet it gave him the measure of his companion s subtlety and thereby of Kate s possible career Don t be TOO impossible he feared from his friend for a moment some such answer as that and then felt as she spoke otherwise as if she were letting him off easily I want her to marry a great man That was all but more and more it was enough and if it hadn t been her next words would have made it so And I think of her what I think There you are They sat for a little face to face upon it and he was conscious of something deeper still of something she wished him to understand if he only would To that extent she did appeal appealed to the intelligence she desired to show she believed him to possess He was meanwhile at all events not the man wholly to fail of comprehension Of course I m aware how little I can answer to any fond proud dream You ve a view a grand one into which I perfectly enter I thoroughly understand what I m not and I m much obliged to you for not reminding me of it in any rougher way She said nothing she kept that up it might even have been to let him go further if he was capable of it in the way of poorness of spirit It was one of those cases in which a man couldn t show if he showed at all save for poor unless indeed he preferred to show for asinine It was the plain truth he WAS on missus Lowder s basis the only one in question a very small quantity and he did know damnably what made quantities large He desired to be perfectly simple yet in the midst of that effort a deeper apprehension throbbed Aunt Maud clearly conveyed it though he couldn t later on have said how You don t really matter I believe so much as you think and I m not going to make you a martyr by banishing you Your performances with Kate in the Park are ridiculous so far as they re meant as consideration for me and I had much rather see you myself since you re in your way my dear young man delightful and arrange with you count with you as I easily as I perfectly should Do you suppose me so stupid as to quarrel with you if it s not really necessary It won t it would be too absurd BE necessary I can bite your head off any day any day I really open my mouth and I m dealing with you now see and successfully judge without opening it I do things handsomely all round I place you in the presence of the plan with which from the moment it s a case of taking you seriously you re incompatible Come then as near it as you like walk all round it don t be afraid you ll hurt it and live on with it before you He afterwards felt that if she hadn t absolutely phrased all this it was because she so soon made him out as going with her far enough He was so pleasantly affected by her asking no promise of him her not proposing he should pay for her indulgence by his word of honour not to interfere that he gave her a kind of general assurance of esteem Immediately afterwards then he was to speak of these things to Kate and what by that time came back to him first of all was the way he had said to her he mentioned it to the girl very much as one of a pair of lovers says in a rupture by mutual consent I hope immensely of course that you ll always regard me as a friend This had perhaps been going far he submitted it all to Kate but really there had been so much in it that it was to be looked at as they might say wholly in its own light Other things than those we have presented had come up before the close of his scene with Aunt Maud but this matter of her not treating him as a peril of the first order easily predominated There was moreover plenty to talk about on the occasion of his subsequent passage with our young woman it having been put to him abruptly the night before that he might give himself a lift and do his newspaper a service so flatteringly was the case expressed by going for fifteen or twenty weeks to America The idea of a series of letters from the United States from the strictly social point of view had for some time been nursed in the inner sanctuary at whose door he sat and the moment was now deemed happy for letting it loose The imprisoned thought had in a word on the opening of the door flown straight out into Densher s face or perched at least on his shoulder making him look up in surprise from his mere inky office table His account of the matter to Kate was that he couldn t refuse not being in a position as yet to refuse anything but that his being chosen for such an errand confounded his sense of proportion He was definite as to his scarce knowing how to measure the honour which struck him as equivocal he hadn t quite supposed himself the man for the class of job This confused consciousness he intimated he had promptly enough betrayed to his manager with the effect however of seeing the question surprisingly clear up What it came to was that the sort of twaddle that wasn t in his chords was unexpectedly just what they happened this time not to want They wanted his letters for queer reasons about as good as he could let them come he was to play his own little tune and not be afraid that was the whole point It would have been the whole that is had there not been a sharper one still in the circumstance that he was to start at once His mission as they called it at the office would probably be over by the end of June which was desirable but to bring that about he must now not lose a week his enquiries he understood were to cover the whole ground and there were reasons of state reasons operating at the seat of empire in Fleet Street why the nail should be struck on the head Densher made no secret to Kate of his having asked for a day to decide and his account of that matter was that he felt he owed it to her to speak to her first She assured him on this that nothing so much as that scruple had yet shown her how they were bound together she was clearly proud of his letting a thing of such importance depend on her but she was clearer still as to his instant duty She rejoiced in his prospect and urged him to his task she should miss him too dreadfully of course she should miss him but she made so little of it that she spoke with jubilation of what he would see and would do She made so much of this last quantity that he laughed at her innocence though also with scarce the heart to give her the real size of his drop in the daily bucket He was struck at the same time with her happy grasp of what had really occurred in Fleet Street all the more that it was his own final reading He was to pull the subject up that was just what they wanted and it would take more than all the United States together visit them each as he might to let HIM down It was just because he didn t nose about and babble because he wasn t the usual gossip monger that they had picked him out It was a branch of their correspondence with which they evidently wished a new tone associated such a tone as from now on it would have always to take from his example How you ought indeed when you understand so well to be a journalist s wife Densher exclaimed in admiration even while she struck him as fairly hurrying him off But she was almost impatient of the praise What do you expect one NOT to understand when one cares for you Ah then I ll put it otherwise and say How much you care for me Yes she assented it fairly redeems my stupidity I SHALL with a chance to show it she added have some imagination for you She spoke of the future this time as so little contingent that he felt a queerness of conscience in making her the report that he presently arrived at on what had passed for him with the real arbiter of their destiny The way for that had been blocked a little by his news from Fleet Street but in the crucible of their happy discussion this element soon melted into the other and in the mixture that ensued the parts were not to be distinguished The young man moreover before taking his leave was to see why Kate had spoken with a wisdom indifferent to that and was to come to the vision by a devious way that deepened the final cheer Their faces were turned to the illumined quarter as soon as he had answered her question on the score of their being to appearance able to play patience a prodigious game of patience with success It was for the possibility of the appearance that she had a few days before so earnestly pressed him to see her aunt and if after his hour with that lady it had not struck Densher that he had seen her to the happiest purpose the poor facts flushed with a better meaning as Kate one by one took them up If she consents to your coming why isn t that everything It IS everything everything SHE thinks it It s the probability I mean as missus Lowder measures probability that I may be prevented from becoming a complication for her by some arrangement ANY arrangement through which you shall see me often and easily She s sure of my want of money and that gives her time She believes in my having a certain amount of delicacy in my wishing to better my state before I put the pistol to your head in respect to sharing it The time this will take figures for her as the time that will help her if she doesn t spoil her chance by treating me badly She doesn t at all wish moreover Densher went on to treat me badly for I believe upon my honour odd as it may sound to you that she personally rather likes me and that if you weren t in question I might almost become her pet young man She doesn t disparage intellect and culture quite the contrary she wants them to adorn her board and be associated with her name and I m sure it has sometimes cost her a real pang that I should be so desirable at once and so impossible He paused a moment and his companion then saw how strange a smile was in his face a smile as strange even as the adjunct in her own of this informing vision I quite suspect her of believing that if the truth were known she likes me literally better than deep down you yourself do wherefore she does me the honour to think I may be safely left to kill my own cause There as I say comes in her margin I m not the sort of stuff of romance that wears that washes that survives use that resists familiarity Once in any degree admit that and your pride and prejudice will take care of the rest the pride fed full meanwhile by the system she means to practise with you and the prejudice excited by the comparisons she ll enable you to make from which I shall come off badly She likes me but she ll never like me so much as when she has succeeded a little better in making me look wretched For then YOU LL like me less Kate showed for this evocation a due interest but no alarm and it was a little as if to pay his tender cynicism back in kind that she after an instant replied I see I see what an immense affair she must think me One was aware but you deepen the impression I think you ll make no mistake said Densher in letting it go as deep as it will He had given her indeed she made no scruple of showing plenty to amuse herself with Her facing the music her making you boldly as welcome as you say that s an awfully big theory you know and worthy of all the other big things that in one s acquaintance with people give her a place so apart Oh she s grand the young man allowed she s on the scale altogether of the car of Juggernaut which was a kind of image that came to me yesterday while I waited for her at Lancaster Gate The things in your drawing room there were like the forms of the strange idols the mystic excrescences with which one may suppose the front of the car to bristle Yes aren t they the girl returned and they had over all that aspect of their wonderful lady one of those deep and free interchanges that made everything but confidence a false note for them There were complications there were questions but they were so much more together than they were anything else Kate uttered for a while no word of refutation of Aunt Maud s big diplomacy and they left it there as they would have left any other fine product for a monument to her powers But Densher related further he had had in other respects too the car of Juggernaut to face he omitted nothing from his account of his visit least of all the way Aunt Maud had frankly at last though indeed only under artful pressure fallen foul of his very type his want of the right marks his foreign accidents his queer antecedents She had told him he was but half a Briton which he granted Kate would have been dreadful if he hadn t so let himself in for it I was really curious you see he explained to find out from her what sort of queer creature what sort of social anomaly in the light of such conventions as hers such an education as mine makes one pass for Kate said nothing for a little but then Why should you care she asked Oh he laughed I like her so much and then for a man of my trade her views her spirit are essentially a thing to get hold of they belong to the great public mind that we meet at every turn and that we must keep setting up codes with Besides he added I want to please her personally Ah yes we must please her personally his companion echoed and the words may represent all their definite recognition at the time of Densher s politic gain They had in fact between this and his start for New York many matters to handle and the question he now touched upon came up for Kate above all She looked at him as if he had really told her aunt more of his immediate personal story than he had ever told herself This if it had been so was an accident and it perched him there with her for half an hour like a cicerone and his victim on a tower top before as much of the bird s eye view of his early years abroad his migratory parents his Swiss schools his German university as she had easy attention for A man he intimated a man of their world would have spotted him straight as to many of these points a man of their world so far as they had a world would have been through the English mill But it was none the less charming to make his confession to a woman women had in fact for such differences blessedly more imagination and blessedly more sympathy Kate showed at present as much of both as his case could require when she had had it from beginning to end she declared that she now made out more than ever yet what she loved him for She had herself as a child lived with some continuity in the world across the Channel coming home again still a child and had participated after that in her teens in her mother s brief but repeated retreats to Dresden to Florence to Biarritz weak and expensive attempts at economy from which there stuck to her though in general coldly expressed through the instinctive avoidance of cheap raptures the religion of foreign things When it was revealed to her how many more foreign things were in Merton Densher than he had hitherto taken the trouble to catalogue she almost faced him as if he were a map of the continent or a handsome present of a delightful new Murray He hadn t meant to swagger he had rather meant to plead though with missus Lowder he had meant also a little to explain His father had been in strange countries in twenty settlements of the English British chaplain resident or occasional and had had for years the unusual luck of never wanting a billet His career abroad had therefore been unbroken and as his stipend had never been great he had educated his children at the smallest cost in the schools nearest which was also a saving of railway fares Densher s mother it further appeared had practised on her side a distinguished industry to the success of which so far as success ever crowned it this period of exile had much contributed she copied patient lady famous pictures in great museums having begun with a happy natural gift and taking in betimes the scale of her opportunity Copyists abroad of course swarmed but missus Densher had had a sense and a hand of her own had arrived at a perfection that persuaded that even deceived and that made the placing of her work blissfully usual Her son who had lost her held her image sacred and the effect of his telling Kate all about her as well as about other matters until then mixed and dim was to render his history rich his sources full his outline anything but common He had come round he had come back he insisted abundantly to being a Briton his Cambridge years his happy connexion as it had proved with his father s college amply certified to that to say nothing of his subsequent plunge into London which filled up the measure But brave enough though his descent to English earth he had passed by the way through zones of air that had left their ruffle on his wings he had been exposed to initiations indelible Something had happened to him that could never be undone When Kate Croy said to him as much he besought her not to insist declaring that this indeed was what was gravely the matter with him that he had been but too probably spoiled for native for insular use On which not unnaturally she insisted the more assuring him without mitigation that if he was various and complicated complicated by wit and taste she wouldn t for the world have had him more helpless so that he was driven in the end to accuse her of putting the dreadful truth to him in the hollow guise of flattery She was making him out as all abnormal in order that she might eventually find him impossible and since she could make it out but with his aid she had to bribe him by feigned delight to help her If her last word for him in the connexion was that the way he saw himself was just a precious proof the more of his having tasted of the tree and being thereby prepared to assist her to eat this gives the happy tone of their whole talk the measure of the flight of time in the near presence of his settled departure Kate showed however that she was to be more literally taken when she spoke of the relief Aunt Maud would draw from the prospect of his absence Yet one can scarcely see why he replied when she fears me so little His friend weighed his objection Your idea is that she likes you so much that she ll even go so far as to regret losing you Well he saw it in their constant comprehensive way Since what she builds on is the gradual process of your alienation she may take the view that the process constantly requires me Mustn t I be there to keep it going It s in my exile that it may languish He went on with that fantasy but at this point Kate ceased to attend He saw after a little that she had been following some thought of her own and he had been feeling the growth of something determinant even through the extravagance of much of the pleasantry the warm transparent irony into which their livelier intimacy kept plunging like a confident swimmer Suddenly she said to him with extraordinary beauty I engage myself to you for ever The beauty was in everything and he could have separated nothing couldn t have thought of her face as distinct from the whole joy Yet her face had a new light And I pledge you I call God to witness every spark of my faith I give you every drop of my life That was all for the moment but it was enough and it was almost as quiet as if it were nothing They were in the open air in an alley of the Gardens the great space which seemed to arch just then higher and spread wider for them threw them back into deep concentration They moved by a common instinct to a spot within sight that struck them as fairly sequestered and there before their time together was spent they had extorted from concentration every advance it could make them They had exchanged vows and tokens sealed their rich compact solemnised so far as breathed words and murmured sounds and lighted eyes and clasped hands could do it their agreement to belong only and to belong tremendously to each other They were to leave the place accordingly an affianced couple but before they left it other things still had passed Densher had declared his horror of bringing to a premature end her happy relation with her aunt and they had worked round together to a high level of discretion Kate s free profession was that she wished not to deprive HIM of missus Lowder s countenance which in the long run she was convinced he would continue to enjoy and as by a blest turn Aunt Maud had demanded of him no promise that would tie his hands they should be able to propitiate their star in their own way and yet remain loyal One difficulty alone stood out which Densher named Of course it will never do we must remember that from the moment you allow her to found hopes of you for any one else in particular So long as her view is content to remain as general as at present appears I don t see that we deceive her At a given hour you see she must be undeceived the only thing therefore is to be ready for the hour and to face it Only after all in that case the young man observed one doesn t quite make out what we shall have got from her What she ll have got from US Kate put it with a smile What she ll have got from us the girl went on is her own affair it s for HER to measure I asked her for nothing she added I never put myself upon her She must take her risks and she surely understands them What we shall have got from her is what we ve already spoken of Kate further explained it s that we shall have gained time And so for that matter will she Densher gazed a little at all this clearness his gaze was not at the present hour into romantic obscurity Yes no doubt in our particular situation time s everything And then there s the joy of it She hesitated Of our secret Not so much perhaps of our secret in itself but of what s represented and as we must somehow feel secured to us and made deeper and closer by it And his fine face relaxed into happiness covered her with all his meaning Our being as we are It was as if for a moment she let the meaning sink into her So gone So gone So extremely gone However he smiled we shall go a good deal further Her answer to which was only the softness of her silence a silence that looked out for them both at the far reach of their prospect This was immense and they thus took final possession of it They were practically united and splendidly strong but there were other things things they were precisely strong enough to be able successfully to count with and safely to allow for in consequence of which they would for the present subject to some better reason keep their understanding to themselves It was not indeed however till after one more observation of Densher s that they felt the question completely straightened out The only thing of course is that she may any day absolutely put it to you Kate considered Ask me where on my honour we are She may naturally but I doubt if in fact she will While you re away she ll make the most of that drop of the tension She ll leave me alone But there ll be my letters The girl faced his letters Very very many Very very very many more than ever and you know what that is And then Densher added there ll be yours Oh I shan t leave mine on the hall table I shall post them myself He looked at her a moment Do you think then I had best address you elsewhere After which before she could quite answer he added with some emphasis I d rather not you know It s straighter She might again have just waited Of course it s straighter Don t be afraid I shan t be straight Address me she continued where you like I shall be proud enough of its being known you write to me He turned it over for the last clearness Even at the risk of its really bringing down the inquisition Well the last clearness now filled her I m not afraid of the inquisition If she asks if there s anything definite between us I know perfectly what I shall say That I AM of course gone for you That I love you as I shall never in my life love any one else and that she can make what she likes of that She said it out so splendidly that it was like a new profession of faith the fulness of a tide breaking through and the effect of that in turn was to make her companion meet her with such eyes that she had time again before he could otherwise speak Besides she s just as likely to ask YOU Not while I m away Then when you come back Well then said Densher we shall have had our particular joy But what I feel is he candidly added that by an idea of her own her superior policy she WON T ask me She ll let me off I shan t have to lie to her It will be left all to me asked Kate All to you he tenderly laughed But it was oddly the very next moment as if he had perhaps been a shade too candid His discrimination seemed to mark a possible a natural reality a reality not wholly disallowed by the account the girl had just given of her own intention There WAS a difference in the air even if none other than the supposedly usual difference in truth between man and woman and it was almost as if the sense of this provoked her She seemed to cast about an instant and then she went back a little resentfully to something she had suffered to pass a minute before She appeared to take up rather more seriously than she need the joke about her freedom to deceive Yet she did this too in a beautiful way Men are too stupid even you You didn t understand just now why if I post my letters myself it won t be for anything so vulgar as to hide them Oh you named it for the pleasure Yes but you didn t you don t understand what the pleasure may be There are refinements she more patiently dropped I mean of consciousness of sensation of appreciation she went on No she sadly insisted men DON T know They know in such matters almost nothing but what women show them This was one of the speeches frequent in her that liberally joyfully intensely adopted and in itself as might be embraced drew him again as close to her and held him as long as their conditions permitted Then that s exactly why we ve such an abysmal need of you Book Third Chapter one The two ladies who in advance of the Swiss season had been warned that their design was unconsidered that the passes wouldn t be clear nor the air mild nor the inns open the two ladies who characteristically had braved a good deal of possibly interested remonstrance were finding themselves as their adventure turned out wonderfully sustained It was the judgement of the head waiters and other functionaries on the Italian lakes that approved itself now as interested they themselves had been conscious of impatiences of bolder dreams at least the younger had so that one of the things they made out together making out as they did an endless variety was that in those operatic palaces of the Villa d Este of Cadenabbia of Pallanza and Stresa lone women however re enforced by a travelling library of instructive volumes were apt to be beguiled and undone Their flights of fancy moreover had been modest they had for instance risked nothing vital in hoping to make their way by the Brunig They were making it in fact happily enough as we meet them and were only wishing that for the wondrous beauty of the early high climbing spring it might have been longer and the places to pause and rest more numerous Such at least had been the intimated attitude of missus Stringham the elder of the companions who had her own view of the impatiences of the younger to which however she offered an opposition but of the most circuitous She moved the admirable missus Stringham in a fine cloud of observation and suspicion she was in the position as she believed of knowing much more about Milly Theale than Milly herself knew and yet of having to darken her knowledge as well as make it active The woman in the world least formed by nature as she was quite aware for duplicities and labyrinths she found herself dedicated to personal subtlety by a new set of circumstances above all by a new personal relation had now in fact to recognise that an education in the occult she could scarce say what to call it had begun for her the day she left New York with Mildred She had come on from Boston for that purpose had seen little of the girl or rather had seen her but briefly for missus Stringham when she saw anything at all saw much saw everything before accepting her proposal and had accordingly placed herself by her act in a boat that she more and more estimated as humanly speaking of the biggest though likewise no doubt in many ways by reason of its size of the safest In Boston the winter before the young lady in whom we are interested had on the spot deeply yet almost tacitly appealed to her dropped into her mind the shy conceit of some assistance some devotion to render missus Stringham s little life had often been visited by shy conceits secret dreams that had fluttered their hour between its narrow walls without for any great part so much as mustering courage to look out of its rather dim windows But this imagination the fancy of a possible link with the remarkable young thing from New York HAD mustered courage had perched on the instant at the clearest lookout it could find and might be said to have remained there till only a few months later it had caught in surprise and joy the unmistakeable flash of a signal Milly Theale had Boston friends such as they were and of recent making and it was understood that her visit to them a visit that was not to be meagre had been undertaken after a series of bereavements in the interest of the particular peace that New York couldn t give It was recognised liberally enough that there were many things perhaps even too many New York COULD give but this was felt to make no difference in the important truth that what you had most to do under the discipline of life or of death was really to feel your situation as grave Boston could help you to that as nothing else could and it had extended to Milly by every presumption some such measure of assistance missus Stringham was never to forget for the moment had not faded nor the infinitely fine vibration it set up in any degree ceased her own first sight of the striking apparition then unheralded and unexplained the slim constantly pale delicately haggard anomalously agreeably angular young person of not more than two and twenty summers in spite of her marks whose hair was somehow exceptionally red even for the real thing which it innocently confessed to being and whose clothes were remarkably black even for robes of mourning which was the meaning they expressed It was New York mourning it was New York hair it was a New York history confused as yet but multitudinous of the loss of parents brothers sisters almost every human appendage all on a scale and with a sweep that had required the greater stage it was a New York legend of affecting of romantic isolation and beyond everything it was by most accounts in respect to the mass of money so piled on the girl s back a set of New York possibilities She was alone she was stricken she was rich and in particular was strange a combination in itself of a nature to engage missus Stringham s attention But it was the strangeness that most determined our good lady s sympathy convinced as she had to be that it was greater than any one else any one but the sole Susan Stringham supposed Susan privately settled it that Boston was not in the least seeing her was only occupied with her seeing Boston and that any assumed affinity between the two characters was delusive and vain SHE was seeing her and she had quite the finest moment of her life in now obeying the instinct to conceal the vision She couldn t explain it no one would understand They would say clever Boston things missus Stringham was from Burlington Vermont which she boldly upheld as the real heart of New England Boston being too far south but they would only darken counsel There could be no better proof than this quick intellectual split of the impression made on our friend who shone herself she was well aware with but the reflected light of the admirable city She too had had her discipline but it had not made her striking it had been prosaically usual though doubtless a decent dose and had only made her usual to match it usual that is as Boston went She had lost first her husband and then her mother with whom on her husband s death she had lived again so that now childless she was but more sharply single than before Yet she sat rather coldly light having as she called it enough to live on so far that is as she lived by bread alone how little indeed she was regularly content with that diet appeared from the name she had made Susan Shepherd Stringham as a contributor to the best magazines She wrote short stories and she fondly believed she had her note the art of showing New England without showing it wholly in the kitchen She had not herself been brought up in the kitchen she knew others who had not and to speak for them had thus become with her a literary mission To BE in truth literary had ever been her dearest thought the thought that kept her bright little nippers perpetually in position There were masters models celebrities mainly foreign whom she finally accounted so and in whose light she ingeniously laboured there were others whom however chattered about she ranked with the inane for she bristled with discriminations but all categories failed her they ceased at least to signify as soon as she found herself in presence of the real thing the romantic life itself That was what she saw in Mildred what positively made her hand a while tremble too much for the pen She had had it seemed to her a revelation such as even New England refined and grammatical couldn t give and all made up as she was of small neat memories and ingenuities little industries and ambitions mixed with something moral personal that was still more intensely responsive she felt her new friend would have done her an ill turn if their friendship shouldn t develop and yet that nothing would be left of anything else if it should It was for the surrender of everything else that she was however quite prepared and while she went about her usual Boston business with her usual Boston probity she was really all the while holding herself She wore her handsome felt hat so Tyrolese yet somehow though feathered from the eagle s wing so truly domestic with the same straightness and security she attached her fur boa with the same honest precautions she preserved her balance on the ice slopes with the same practised skill she opened each evening her Transcript with the same interfusion of suspense and resignation she attended her almost daily concert with the same expenditure of patience and the same economy of passion she flitted in and out of the Public Library with the air of conscientiously returning or bravely carrying off in her pocket the key of knowledge itself and finally it was what she most did she watched the thin trickle of a fictive love interest through that somewhat serpentine channel in the magazines which she mainly managed to keep clear for it But the real thing all the while was elsewhere the real thing had gone back to New York leaving behind it the two unsolved questions quite distinct of why it WAS real and whether she should ever be so near it again For the figure to which these questions attached themselves she had found a convenient description she thought of it for herself always as that of a girl with a background The great reality was in the fact that very soon after but two or three meetings the girl with the background the girl with the crown of old gold and the mourning that was not as the mourning of Boston but at once more rebellious in its gloom and more frivolous in its frills had told her she had never seen any one like her They had met thus as opposed curiosities and that simple remark of Milly s if simple it was became the most important thing that had ever happened to her it deprived the love interest for the time of actuality and even of pertinence it moved her first in short in a high degree to gratitude and then to no small compassion Yet in respect to this relation at least it was what did prove the key of knowledge it lighted up as nothing else could do the poor young woman s history That the potential heiress of all the ages should never have seen any one like a mere typical subscriber after all to the Transcript was a truth that in especial as announced with modesty with humility with regret described a situation It laid upon the elder woman as to the void to be filled a weight of responsibility but in particular it led her to ask whom poor Mildred HAD then seen and what range of contacts it had taken to produce such queer surprises That was really the enquiry that had ended by clearing the air the key of knowledge was felt to click in the lock from the moment it flashed upon missus Stringham that her friend had been starved for culture Culture was what she herself represented for her and it was living up to that principle that would surely prove the great business She knew the clever lady what the principle itself represented and the limits of her own store and a certain alarm would have grown upon her if something else hadn t grown faster This was fortunately for her and we give it in her own words the sense of a harrowing pathos That primarily was what appealed to her what seemed to open the door of romance for her still wider than any than a still more reckless connexion with the picture papers For such was essentially the point it was rich romantic abysmal to have as was evident thousands and thousands a year to have youth and intelligence and if not beauty at least in equal measure a high dim charming ambiguous oddity which was even better and then on top of all to enjoy boundless freedom the freedom of the wind in the desert it was unspeakably touching to be so equipped and yet to have been reduced by fortune to little humble minded mistakes It brought our friend s imagination back again to New York where aberrations were so possible in the intellectual sphere and it in fact caused a visit she presently paid there to overflow with interest As Milly had beautifully invited her so she would hold out if she could against the strain of so much confidence in her mind and the remarkable thing was that even at the end of three weeks she HAD held out But by this time her mind had grown comparatively bold and free it was dealing with new quantities a different proportion altogether and that had made for refreshment she had accordingly gone home in convenient possession of her subject New York was vast New York was startling with strange histories with wild cosmopolite backward generations that accounted for anything and to have got nearer the luxuriant tribe of which the rare creature was the final flower the immense extravagant unregulated cluster with free living ancestors handsome dead cousins lurid uncles beautiful vanished aunts persons all busts and curls preserved though so exposed in the marble of famous French chisels all this to say nothing of the effect of closer growths of the stem was to have had one s small world space both crowded and enlarged Our couple had at all events effected an exchange the elder friend had been as consciously intellectual as possible and the younger abounding in personal revelation had been as unconsciously distinguished This was poetry it was also history missus Stringham thought to a finer tune even than Maeterlinck and Pater than Marbot and Gregorovius She appointed occasions for the reading of these authors with her hostess rather perhaps than actually achieved great spans but what they managed and what they missed speedily sank for her into the dim depths of the merely relative so quickly so strongly had she clutched her central clue All her scruples and hesitations all her anxious enthusiasms had reduced themselves to a single alarm the fear that she really might act on her companion clumsily and coarsely She was positively afraid of what she might do to her and to avoid that to avoid it with piety and passion to do rather nothing at all to leave her untouched because no touch one could apply however light however just however earnest and anxious would be half good enough would be anything but an ugly smutch upon perfection this now imposed itself as a consistent an inspiring thought Less than a month after the event that had so determined missus Stringham s attitude close upon the heels that is of her return from New York she was reached by a proposal that brought up for her the kind of question her delicacy might have to contend with Would she start for Europe with her young friend at the earliest possible date and should she be willing to do so without making conditions The enquiry was launched by wire explanations in sufficiency were promised extreme urgency was suggested and a general surrender invited It was to the honour of her sincerity that she made the surrender on the spot though it was not perhaps altogether to that of her logic She had wanted very consciously from the first to give something up for her new acquaintance but she had now no doubt that she was practically giving up all What settled this was the fulness of a particular impression the impression that had throughout more and more supported her and which she would have uttered so far as she might by saying that the charm of the creature was positively in the creature s greatness She would have been content so to leave it unless indeed she had said more familiarly that Mildred was the biggest impression of her life That was at all events the biggest account of her and none but a big clearly would do Her situation as such things were called was on the grand scale but it still was not that It was her nature once for all a nature that reminded missus Stringham of the term always used in the newspapers about the great new steamers the inordinate number of feet of water they drew so that if in your little boat you had chosen to hover and approach you had but yourself to thank when once motion was started for the way the draught pulled you Milly drew the feet of water and odd though it might seem that a lonely girl who was not robust and who hated sound and show should stir the stream like a leviathan her companion floated off with the sense of rocking violently at her side More than prepared however for that excitement missus Stringham mainly failed of ease in respect to her own consistency To attach herself for an indefinite time seemed a roundabout way of holding her hands off If she wished to be sure of neither touching nor smutching the straighter plan would doubtless have been not to keep her friend within reach This in fact she fully recognised and with it the degree to which she desired that the girl should lead her life a life certain to be so much finer than that of anybody else The difficulty however by good fortune cleared away as soon as she had further recognised as she was speedily able to do that she Susan Shepherd the name with which Milly for the most part amused herself was NOT anybody else She had renounced that character she had now no life to lead and she honestly believed that she was thus supremely equipped for leading Milly s own No other person whatever she was sure had to an equal degree this qualification and it was really to assert it that she fondly embarked Many things though not in many weeks had come and gone since then and one of the best of them doubtless had been the voyage itself by the happy southern course to the succession of Mediterranean ports with the dazzled wind up at Naples Two or three others had preceded this incidents indeed rather lively marks of their last fortnight at home and one of which had determined on missus Stringham s part a rush to New York forty eight breathless hours there previous to her final rally But the great sustained sea light had drunk up the rest of the picture so that for many days other questions and other possibilities sounded with as little effect as a trio of penny whistles might sound in a Wagner overture It was the Wagner overture that practically prevailed up through Italy where Milly had already been still further up and across the Alps which were also partly known to missus Stringham only perhaps taken to a time not wholly congruous hurried in fact on account of the girl s high restlessness She had been expected she had frankly promised to be restless that was partly why she was great or was a consequence at any rate if not a cause yet she had not perhaps altogether announced herself as straining so hard at the cord It was familiar it was beautiful to missus Stringham that she had arrears to make up the chances that had lapsed for her through the wanton ways of forefathers fond of Paris but not of its higher sides and fond almost of nothing else but the vagueness the openness the eagerness without point and the interest without pause all a part of the charm of her oddity as at first presented had become more striking in proportion as they triumphed over movement and change She had arts and idiosyncrasies of which no great account could have been given but which were a daily grace if you lived with them such as the art of being almost tragically impatient and yet making it as light as air of being inexplicably sad and yet making it as clear as noon of being unmistakeably gay and yet making it as soft as dusk missus Stringham by this time understood everything was more than ever confirmed in wonder and admiration in her view that it was life enough simply to feel her companion s feelings but there were special keys she had not yet added to her bunch impressions that of a sudden were apt to affect her as new This particular day on the great Swiss road had been for some reason full of them and they referred themselves provisionally to some deeper depth than she had touched though into two or three such depths it must be added she had peeped long enough to find herself suddenly draw back It was not Milly s unpacified state in short that now troubled her though certainly as Europe was the great American sedative the failure was to some extent to be noted it was the suspected presence of something behind the state which however could scarcely have taken its place there since their departure What a fresh motive of unrest could suddenly have sprung from was in short not to be divined It was but half an explanation to say that excitement for each of them had naturally dropped and that what they had left behind or tried to the great serious facts of life as missus Stringham liked to call them was once more coming into sight as objects loom through smoke when smoke begins to clear for these were general appearances from which the girl s own aspect her really larger vagueness seemed rather to disconnect itself The nearest approach to a personal anxiety indulged in as yet by the elder lady was on her taking occasion to wonder if what she had more than anything else got hold of mightn t be one of the finer one of the finest one of the rarest as she called it so that she might call it nothing worse cases of American intensity She had just had a moment of alarm asked herself if her young friend were merely going to treat her to some complicated drama of nerves At the end of a week however with their further progress her young friend had effectively answered the question and given her the impression indistinct indeed as yet of something that had a reality compared with which the nervous explanation would have been coarse missus Stringham found herself from that hour in other words in presence of an explanation that remained a muffled and intangible form but that assuredly should it take on sharpness would explain everything and more than everything would become instantly the light in which Milly was to be read Such a matter as this may at all events speak of the style in which our young woman could affect those who were near her may testify to the sort of interest she could inspire She worked and seemingly quite without design upon the sympathy the curiosity the fancy of her associates and we shall really ourselves scarce otherwise come closer to her than by feeling their impression and sharing if need be their confusion She reduced them missus Stringham would have said to a consenting bewilderment which was precisely for that good lady on a last analysis what was most in harmony with her greatness She exceeded escaped measure was surprising only because THEY were so far from great Thus it was that on this wondrous day by the Brunig the spell of watching her had grown more than ever irresistible a proof of what or of a part of what missus Stringham had with all the rest been reduced to She had almost the sense of tracking her young friend as if at a given moment to pounce She knew she shouldn t pounce she hadn t come out to pounce yet she felt her attention secretive all the same and her observation scientific She struck herself as hovering like a spy applying tests laying traps concealing signs This would last however only till she should fairly know what was the matter and to watch was after all meanwhile a way of clinging to the girl not less than an occupation a satisfaction in itself The pleasure of watching moreover if a reason were needed came from a sense of her beauty Her beauty hadn t at all originally seemed a part of the situation and missus Stringham had even in the first flush of friendship not named it grossly to any one having seen early that for stupid people and who she sometimes secretly asked herself wasn t stupid it would take a great deal of explaining She had learned not to mention it till it was mentioned first which occasionally happened but not too often and then she was there in force Then she both warmed to the perception that met her own perception and disputed it suspiciously as to special items while in general she had learned to refine even to the point of herself employing the word that most people employed She employed it to pretend she was also stupid and so have done with the matter spoke of her friend as plain as ugly even in a case of especially dense insistence but as in appearance so awfully full of things This was her own way of describing a face that thanks doubtless to rather too much forehead too much nose and too much mouth together with too little mere conventional colour and conventional line was expressive irregular exquisite both for speech and for silence When Milly smiled it was a public event when she didn t it was a chapter of history They had stopped on the Brunig for luncheon and there had come up for them under the charm of the place the question of a longer stay missus Stringham was now on the ground of thrilled recognitions small sharp echoes of a past which she kept in a well thumbed case but which on pressure of a spring and exposure to the air still showed itself ticking as hard as an honest old watch The embalmed Europe of her younger time had partly stood for three years of Switzerland a term of continuous school at Vevey with rewards of merit in the form of silver medals tied by blue ribbons and mild mountain passes attacked with alpenstocks It was the good girls who in the holidays were taken highest and our friend could now judge from what she supposed her familiarity with the minor peaks that she had been one of the best These reminiscences sacred to day because prepared in the hushed chambers of the past had been part of the general train laid for the pair of sisters daughters early fatherless by their brave Vermont mother who struck her at present as having apparently almost like Columbus worked out all unassisted a conception of the other side of the globe She had focussed Vevey by the light of nature and with extraordinary completeness at Burlington after which she had embarked sailed landed explored and above all made good her presence She had given her daughters the five years in Switzerland and Germany that were to leave them ever afterwards a standard of comparison for all cycles of Cathay and to stamp the younger in especial Susan was the younger with a character that as missus Stringham had often had occasion through life to say to herself made all the difference It made all the difference for missus Stringham over and over again and in the most remote connexions that thanks to her parent s lonely thrifty hardy faith she was a woman of the world There were plenty of women who were all sorts of things that she wasn t but who on the other hand were not that and who didn t know SHE was which she liked it relegated them still further and didn t know either how it enabled her to judge them She had never seen herself so much in this light as during the actual phase of her associated if slightly undirected pilgrimage and the consciousness gave perhaps to her plea for a pause more intensity than she knew The irrecoverable days had come back to her from far off they were part of the sense of the cool upper air and of everything else that hung like an indestructible scent to the torn garment of youth the taste of honey and the luxury of milk the sound of cattle bells and the rush of streams the fragrance of trodden balms and the dizziness of deep gorges Milly clearly felt these things too but they affected her companion at moments that was quite the way missus Stringham would have expressed it as the princess in a conventional tragedy might have affected the confidant if a personal emotion had ever been permitted to the latter That a princess could only be a princess was a truth with which essentially a confidant however responsive had to live missus Stringham was a woman of the world but Milly Theale was a princess the only one she had yet had to deal with and this in its way too made all the difference It was a perfectly definite doom for the wearer it was for every one else an office nobly filled It might have represented possibly with its involved loneliness and other mysteries the weight under which she fancied her companion s admirable head occasionally and ever so submissively bowed Milly had quite assented at luncheon to their staying over and had left her to look at rooms settle questions arrange about their keeping on their carriage and horses cares that had now moreover fallen to missus Stringham as a matter of course and that yet for some reason on this occasion particularly brought home to her all agreeably richly almost grandly what it was to live with the great Her young friend had in a sublime degree a sense closed to the general question of difficulty which she got rid of furthermore not in the least as one had seen many charming persons do by merely passing it on to others She kept it completely at a distance it never entered the circle the most plaintive confidant couldn t have dragged it in and to tread the path of a confidant was accordingly to live exempt Service was in other words so easy to render that the whole thing was like court life without the hardships It came back of course to the question of money and our observant lady had by this time repeatedly reflected that if one were talking of the difference it was just this this incomparably and nothing else that when all was said and done most made it A less vulgarly a less obviously purchasing or parading person she couldn t have imagined but it prevailed even as the truth of truths that the girl couldn t get away from her wealth She might leave her conscientious companion as freely alone with it as possible and never ask a question scarce even tolerate a reference but it was in the fine folds of the helplessly expensive little black frock that she drew over the grass as she now strolled vaguely off it was in the curious and splendid coils of hair done with no eye whatever to the mode du jour that peeped from under the corresponding indifference of her hat the merely personal tradition that suggested a sort of noble inelegance it lurked between the leaves of the uncut but antiquated Tauchnitz volume of which before going out she had mechanically possessed herself She couldn t dress it away nor walk it away nor read it away nor think it away she could neither smile it away in any dreamy absence nor blow it away in any softened sigh She couldn t have lost it if she had tried that was what it was to be really rich It had to be THE thing you were When at the end of an hour she hadn t returned to the house missus Stringham though the bright afternoon was yet young took with precautions the same direction went to join her in case of her caring for a walk But the purpose of joining her was in truth less distinct than that of a due regard for a possibly preferred detachment so that once more the good lady proceeded with a quietness that made her slightly underhand even in her own eyes She couldn t help that however and she didn t care sure as she was that what she really wanted wasn t to overstep but to stop in time It was to be able to stop in time that she went softly but she had on this occasion further to go than ever yet for she followed in vain and at last with some anxiety the footpath she believed Milly to have taken It wound up a hillside and into the higher Alpine meadows in which all these last days they had so often wanted as they passed above or below to stray and then it obscured itself in a wood but always going up up and with a small cluster of brown old high perched chalets evidently for its goal missus Stringham reached in due course the chalets and there received from a bewildered old woman a very fearful person to behold an indication that sufficiently guided her The young lady had been seen not long before passing further on over a crest and to a place where the way would drop again as our unappeased enquirer found it in fact a quarter of an hour later markedly and almost alarmingly to do It led somewhere yet apparently quite into space for the great side of the mountain appeared from where she pulled up to fall away altogether though probably but to some issue below and out of sight Her uncertainty moreover was brief for she next became aware of the presence on a fragment of rock twenty yards off of the Tauchnitz volume the girl had brought out and that therefore pointed to her shortly previous passage She had rid herself of the book which was an encumbrance and meant of course to pick it up on her return but as she hadn t yet picked it up what on earth had become of her missus Stringham I hasten to add was within a few moments to see but it was quite an accident that she hadn t before they were over betrayed by her deeper agitation the fact of her own nearness The whole place with the descent of the path and as a sequel to a sharp turn that was masked by rocks and shrubs appeared to fall precipitously and to become a view pure and simple a view of great extent and beauty but thrown forward and vertiginous Milly with the promise of it from just above had gone straight down to it not stopping till it was all before her and here on what struck her friend as the dizzy edge of it she was seated at her ease The path somehow took care of itself and its final business but the girl s seat was a slab of rock at the end of a short promontory or excrescence that merely pointed off to the right at gulfs of air and that was so placed by good fortune if not by the worst as to be at last completely visible For missus Stringham stifled a cry on taking in what she believed to be the danger of such a perch for a mere maiden her liability to slip to slide to leap to be precipitated by a single false movement by a turn of the head how could one tell into whatever was beneath A thousand thoughts for the minute roared in the poor lady s ears but without reaching as happened Milly s It was a commotion that left our observer intensely still and holding her breath What had first been offered her was the possibility of a latent intention however wild the idea in such a posture of some betrayed accordance of Milly s caprice with a horrible hidden obsession But since missus Stringham stood as motionless as if a sound a syllable must have produced the start that would be fatal so even the lapse of a few seconds had partly a reassuring effect It gave her time to receive the impression which when she some minutes later softly retraced her steps was to be the sharpest she carried away This was the impression that if the girl was deeply and recklessly meditating there she wasn t meditating a jump she was on the contrary as she sat much more in a state of uplifted and unlimited possession that had nothing to gain from violence She was looking down on the kingdoms of the earth and though indeed that of itself might well go to the brain it wouldn t be with a view of renouncing them Was she choosing among them or did she want them all This question before missus Stringham had decided what to do made others vain in accordance with which she saw or believed she did that if it might be dangerous to call out to sound in any way a surprise it would probably be safe enough to withdraw as she had come She watched a while longer she held her breath and she never knew afterwards what time had elapsed Not many minutes probably yet they hadn t seemed few and they had given her so much to think of not only while creeping home but while waiting afterwards at the inn that she was still busy with them when late in the afternoon Milly reappeared She had stopped at the point of the path where the Tauchnitz lay had taken it up and with the pencil attached to her watch guard had scrawled a word a bientot across the cover after which even under the girl s continued delay she had measured time without a return of alarm For she now saw that the great thing she had brought away was precisely a conviction that the future wasn t to exist for her princess in the form of any sharp or simple release from the human predicament It wouldn t be for her a question of a flying leap and thereby of a quick escape It would be a question of taking full in the face the whole assault of life to the general muster of which indeed her face might have been directly presented as she sat there on her rock missus Stringham was thus able to say to herself during still another wait of some length that if her young friend still continued absent it wouldn t be because whatever the opportunity she had cut short the thread She wouldn t have committed suicide she knew herself unmistakeably reserved for some more complicated passage this was the very vision in which she had with no little awe been discovered The image that thus remained with the elder lady kept the character of a revelation During the breathless minutes of her watch she had seen her companion afresh the latter s type aspect marks her history her state her beauty her mystery all unconsciously betrayed themselves to the Alpine air and all had been gathered in again to feed missus Stringham s flame They are things that will more distinctly appear for us and they are meanwhile briefly represented by the enthusiasm that was stronger on our friend s part than any doubt It was a consciousness she was scarce yet used to carrying but she had as beneath her feet a mine of something precious She seemed to herself to stand near the mouth not yet quite cleared The mine but needed working and would certainly yield a treasure She wasn t thinking either of Milly s gold Book Third Chapter two The girl said nothing when they met about the words scrawled on the Tauchnitz and missus Stringham then noticed that she hadn t the book with her She had left it lying and probably would never remember it at all Her comrade s decision was therefore quickly made not to speak of having followed her and within five minutes of her return wonderfully enough the preoccupation denoted by her forgetfulness further declared itself Should you think me quite abominable if I were to say that after all missus Stringham had already thought with the first sound of the question everything she was capable of thinking and had immediately made such a sign that Milly s words gave place to visible relief at her assent You don t care for our stop here you d rather go straight on We ll start then with the peep of tomorrow s dawn or as early as you like it s only rather late now to take the road again And she smiled to show how she meant it for a joke that an instant onward rush was what the girl would have wished I bullied you into stopping she added so it serves me right Milly made in general the most of her good friend s jokes but she humoured this one a little absently Oh yes you do bully me And it was thus arranged between them with no discussion at all that they would resume their journey in the morning The younger tourist s interest in the detail of the matter in spite of a declaration from the elder that she would consent to be dragged anywhere appeared almost immediately afterwards quite to lose itself she promised however to think till supper of where with the world all before them they might go supper having been ordered for such time as permitted of lighted candles It had been agreed between them that lighted candles at wayside inns in strange countries amid mountain scenery gave the evening meal a peculiar poetry such being the mild adventures the refinements of impression that they as they would have said went in for It was now as if before this repast Milly had designed to lie down but at the end of three minutes more she wasn t lying down she was saying instead abruptly with a transition that was like a jump of four thousand miles What was it that in New York on the ninth when you saw him alone Doctor Finch said to you It was not till later that missus Stringham fully knew why the question had startled her still more than its suddenness explained though the effect of it even at the moment was almost to frighten her into a false answer She had to think to remember the occasion the ninth in New York the time she had seen Doctor Finch alone and to recall the words he had then uttered and when everything had come back it was quite at first for a moment as if he had said something that immensely mattered He hadn t however in fact it was only as if he might perhaps after all have been going to It was on the sixth within ten days of their sailing that she had hurried from Boston under the alarm a small but a sufficient shock of hearing that Mildred had suddenly been taken ill had had from some obscure cause such an upset as threatened to stay their journey The bearing of the accident had happily soon presented itself as slight and there had been in the event but a few hours of anxiety the journey had been pronounced again not only possible but as representing change highly advisable and if the zealous guest had had five minutes by herself with the Doctor this was clearly no more at his instance than at her own Almost nothing had passed between them but an easy exchange of enthusiasms in respect to the remedial properties of Europe and due assurance as the facts came back to her she was now able to give Nothing whatever on my word of honour that you mayn t know or mightn t then have known I ve no secret with him about you What makes you suspect it I don t quite make out how you know I did see him alone No you never told me said Milly And I don t mean she went on during the twenty four hours while I was bad when your putting your heads together was natural enough I mean after I was better the last thing before you went home missus Stringham continued to wonder Who told you I saw him then HE didn t himself nor did you write me it afterwards We speak of it now for the first time That s exactly why Milly declared with something in her face and voice that the next moment betrayed for her companion that she had really known nothing had only conjectured and chancing her charge made a hit Yet why had her mind been busy with the question But if you re not as you now assure me in his confidence she smiled it s no matter I m not in his confidence he had nothing to confide But are you feeling unwell The elder woman was earnest for the truth though the possibility she named was not at all the one that seemed to fit witness the long climb Milly had just indulged in The girl showed her constant white face but this her friends had all learned to discount and it was often brightest when superficially not bravest She continued for a little mysteriously to smile I don t know haven t really the least idea But it might be well to find out missus Stringham at this flared into sympathy Are you in trouble in pain Not the least little bit But I sometimes wonder Yes she pressed wonder what Well if I shall have much of it missus Stringham stared Much of what Not of pain Of everything Of everything I have Anxiously again tenderly our friend cast about You have everything so that when you say much of it I only mean the girl broke in shall I have it for long That is if I HAVE got it She had at present the effect a little of confounding or at least of perplexing her comrade who was touched who was always touched by something helpless in her grace and abrupt in her turns and yet actually half made out in her a sort of mocking light If you ve got an ailment If I ve got everything Milly laughed Ah THAT like almost nobody else Then for how long missus Stringham s eyes entreated her she had gone close to her half enclosed her with urgent arms Do you want to see some one And then as the girl only met it with a slow headshake though looking perhaps a shade more conscious We ll go straight to the best near doctor This too however produced but a gaze of qualified assent and a silence sweet and vague that left everything open Our friend decidedly lost herself Tell me for God s sake if you re in distress I don t think I ve really EVERYTHING Milly said as if to explain and as if also to put it pleasantly But what on earth can I do for you The girl debated then seemed on the point of being able to say but suddenly changed and expressed herself otherwise Dear dear thing I m only too happy It brought them closer but it rather confirmed missus Stringham s doubt Then what s the matter That s the matter that I can scarcely bear it But what is it you think you haven t got Milly waited another moment then she found it and found for it a dim show of joy The power to resist the bliss of what I HAVE missus Stringham took it in her sense of being put off with it the possible probable irony of it and her tenderness renewed itself in the positive grimness of a long murmur Whom will you see for it was as if they looked down from their height at a continent of doctors Where will you first go Milly had for the third time her air of consideration but she came back with it to her plea of some minutes before I ll tell you at supper good bye till then And she left the room with a lightness that testified for her companion to something that again particularly pleased her in the renewed promise of motion The odd passage just concluded missus Stringham mused as she once more sat alone with a hooked needle and a ball of silk the fine work with which she was always provided this mystifying mood had simply been precipitated no doubt by their prolonged halt with which the girl hadn t really been in sympathy One had only to admit that her complaint was in fact but the excess of the joy of life and everything DID then fit She couldn t stop for the joy but she could go on for it and with the pulse of her going on she floated again was restored to her great spaces There was no evasion of any truth so at least Susan Shepherd hoped in one s sitting there while the twilight deepened and feeling still more finely that the position of this young lady was magnificent The evening at that height had naturally turned to cold and the travellers had bespoken a fire with their meal the great Alpine road asserted its brave presence through the small panes of the low clean windows with incidents at the inn door the yellow diligence the great waggons the hurrying hooded private conveyances reminders for our fanciful friend of old stories old pictures historic flights escapes pursuits things that had happened things indeed that by a sort of strange congruity helped her to read the meanings of the greatest interest into the relation in which she was now so deeply involved It was natural that this record of the magnificence of her companion s position should strike her as after all the best meaning she could extract for she herself was seated in the magnificence as in a court carriage she came back to that and such a method of progression such a view from crimson cushions would evidently have a great deal more to give By the time the candles were lighted for supper and the short white curtains drawn Milly had reappeared and the little scenic room had then all its romance That charm moreover was far from broken by the words in which she without further loss of time satisfied her patient mate I want to go straight to London It was unexpected corresponding with no view positively taken at their departure when England had appeared on the contrary rather relegated and postponed seen for the moment as who should say at the end of an avenue of preparations and introductions London in short might have been supposed to be the crown and to be achieved like a siege by gradual approaches Milly s actual fine stride was therefore the more exciting as any simplification almost always was to missus Stringham who besides was afterwards to recall as a piece of that very exposition dear to the dramatist the terms in which between their smoky candles the girl had put her preference and in which still other things had come up come while the clank of waggon chains in the sharp air reached their ears with the stamp of hoofs the rattle of buckets and the foreign questions foreign answers that were all alike a part of the cheery converse of the road The girl brought it out in truth as she might have brought a huge confession something she admitted herself shy about and that would seem to show her as frivolous it had rolled over her that what she wanted of Europe was people so far as they were to be had and that if her friend really wished to know the vision of this same equivocal quantity was what had haunted her during their previous days in museums and churches and what was again spoiling for her the pure taste of scenery She was all for scenery yes but she wanted it human and personal and all she could say was that there would be in London wouldn t there more of that kind than anywhere else She came back to her idea that if it wasn t for long if nothing should happen to be so for HER why the particular thing she spoke of would probably have most to give her in the time would probably be less than anything else a waste of her remainder She produced this last consideration indeed with such gaiety that missus Stringham was not again disconcerted by it was in fact quite ready if talk of early dying was in order to match it from her own future Good then they would eat and drink because of what might happen to morrow and they would direct their course from that moment with a view to such eating and drinking They ate and drank that night in truth as in the spirit of this decision whereby the air before they separated felt itself the clearer It had cleared perhaps to a view only too extensive extensive that is in proportion to the signs of life presented The idea of people was not so entertained on Milly s part as to connect itself with particular persons and the fact remained for each of the ladies that they would completely unknown disembark at Dover amid the completely unknowing They had no relation already formed this plea missus Stringham put forward to see what it would produce It produced nothing at first but the observation on the girl s side that what she had in mind was no thought of society nor of scraping acquaintance nothing was further from her than to desire the opportunities represented for the compatriot in general by a trunkful of letters It wasn t a question in short of the people the compatriot was after it was the human the English picture itself as they might see it in their own way the concrete world inferred so fondly from what one had read and dreamed missus Stringham did every justice to this concrete world but when later on an occasion chanced to present itself she made a point of not omitting to remark that it might be a comfort to know in advance one or two of the human particles of its concretion This still however failed in vulgar parlance to fetch Milly so that she had presently to go all the way Haven t I understood from you for that matter that you gave mister Densher something of a promise There was a moment on this when Milly s look had to be taken as representing one of two things either that she was completely vague about the promise or that mister Densher s name itself started no train But she really couldn t be so vague about the promise the partner of these hours quickly saw without attaching it to something it had to be a promise to somebody in particular to be so repudiated In the event accordingly she acknowledged mister Merton Densher the so unusually bright young Englishman who had made his appearance in New York on some special literary business wasn t it shortly before their departure and who had been three or four times in her house during the brief period between her visit to Boston and her companion s subsequent stay with her but she required much reminding before it came back to her that she had mentioned to this companion just afterwards the confidence expressed by the personage in question in her never doing so dire a thing as to come to London without as the phrase was looking a fellow up She had left him the enjoyment of his confidence the form of which might have appeared a trifle free this she now reasserted she had done nothing either to impair or to enhance it but she had also left missus Stringham in the connexion and at the time rather sorry to have missed mister Densher She had thought of him again after that the elder woman she had likewise gone so far as to notice that Milly appeared not to have done so which the girl might easily have betrayed and interested as she was in everything that concerned her she had made out for herself for herself only and rather idly that but for interruptions the young Englishman might have become a better acquaintance His being an acquaintance at all was one of the signs that in the first days had helped to place Milly as a young person with the world before her for sympathy and wonder Isolated unmothered unguarded but with her other strong marks her big house her big fortune her big freedom she had lately begun to receive for all her few years as an older woman might have done as was done precisely by princesses who had public considerations to observe and who came of age very early If it was thus distinct to missus Stringham then that mister Densher had gone off somewhere else in connexion with his errand before her visit to New York it had been also not undiscoverable that he had come back for a day or two later on that is after her own second excursion that he had in fine reappeared on a single occasion on his way to the West his way from Washington as she believed though he was out of sight at the time of her joining her friend for their departure It hadn t occurred to her before to exaggerate it had not occurred to her that she could but she seemed to become aware to night that there had been just enough in this relation to meet to provoke the free conception of a little more She presently put it that at any rate promise or no promise Milly would at a pinch be able in London to act on his permission to make him a sign to which Milly replied with readiness that her ability though evident would be none the less quite wasted inasmuch as the gentleman would to a certainty be still in America He had a great deal to do there which he would scarce have begun and in fact she might very well not have thought of London at all if she hadn t been sure he wasn t yet near coming back It was perceptible to her companion that the moment our young woman had so far committed herself she had a sense of having overstepped which was not quite patched up by her saying the next minute possibly with a certain failure of presence of mind that the last thing she desired was the air of running after him missus Stringham wondered privately what question there could be of any such appearance the danger of which thus suddenly came up but she said for the time nothing of it she only said other things one of which was for instance that if mister Densher was away he was away and this the end of it also that of course they must be discreet at any price But what was the measure of discretion and how was one to be sure So it was that as they sat there she produced her own case SHE had a possible tie with London which she desired as little to disown as she might wish to risk presuming on it She treated her companion in short for their evening s end to the story of Maud Manningham the odd but interesting English girl who had formed her special affinity in the old days at the Vevey school whom she had written to after their separation with a regularity that had at first faltered and then altogether failed yet that had been for the time quite a fine case of crude constancy so that it had in fact flickered up again of itself on the occasion of the marriage of each They had then once more fondly scrupulously written missus Lowder first and even another letter or two had afterwards passed This however had been the end though with no rupture only a gentle drop Maud Manningham had made she believed a great marriage while she herself had made a small on top of which moreover distance difference diminished community and impossible reunion had done the rest of the work It was but after all these years that reunion had begun to show as possible if the other party to it that is should be still in existence That was exactly what it now appeared to our friend interesting to ascertain as with one aid and another she believed she might It was an experiment she would at all events now make if Milly didn t object Milly in general objected to nothing and though she asked a question or two she raised no present plea Her questions or at least her own answers to them kindled on missus Stringham s part a backward train she hadn t known till to night how much she remembered or how fine it might be to see what had become of large high coloured Maud florid alien exotic which had been just the spell even to the perceptions of youth There was the danger she frankly touched it that such a temperament mightn t have matured with the years all in the sense of fineness it was the sort of danger that in renewing relations after long breaks one had always to look in the face To gather in strayed threads was to take a risk for which however she was prepared if Milly was The possible fun she confessed was by itself rather tempting and she fairly sounded with this wound up a little as she was the note of fun as the harmless final right of fifty years of mere New England virtue Among the things she was afterwards to recall was the indescribable look dropped on her at that by her companion she was still seated there between the candles and before the finished supper while Milly moved about and the look was long to figure for her as an inscrutable comment on HER notion of freedom Challenged at any rate as for the last wise word Milly showed perhaps musingly charmingly that though her attention had been mainly soundless her friend s story produced as a resource unsuspected a card from up the sleeve half surprised half beguiled her Since the matter such as it was depended on that she brought out before she went to bed an easy a light Risk everything This quality in it seemed possibly a little to deny weight to Maud Lowder s evoked presence as Susan Stringham still sitting up became in excited reflexion a trifle more conscious Something determinant when the girl had left her took place in her nameless but as soon as she had given way coercive It was as if she knew again in this fulness of time that she had been after Maud s marriage just sensibly outlived or as people nowadays said shunted missus Lowder had left her behind and on the occasion subsequently of the corresponding date in her own life not the second the sad one with its dignity of sadness but the first with the meagreness of its supposed felicity she had been in the same spirit almost patronisingly pitied If that suspicion even when it had ceased to matter had never quite died out for her there was doubtless some oddity in its now offering itself as a link rather than as another break in the chain and indeed there might well have been for her a mood in which the notion of the development of patronage in her quondam schoolmate would have settled her question in another sense It was actually settled if the case be worth our analysis by the happy consummation the poetic justice the generous revenge of her having at last something to show Maud on their parting company had appeared to have so much and would now for wasn t it also in general quite the rich law of English life have with accretions promotions expansions ever so much more Very good such things might be she rose to the sense of being ready for them Whatever missus Lowder might have to show and one hoped one did the presumptions all justice she would have nothing like Milly Theale who constituted the trophy producible by poor Susan Poor Susan lingered late till the candles were low and as soon as the table was cleared she opened her neat portfolio She hadn t lost the old clue there were connexions she remembered addresses she could try so the thing was to begin She wrote on the spot Book Fourth Chapter one It had all gone so fast after this that Milly uttered but the truth nearest to hand in saying to the gentleman on her right who was by the same token the gentleman on her hostess s left that she scarce even then knew where she was the words marking her first full sense of a situation really romantic They were already dining she and her friend at Lancaster Gate and surrounded as it seemed to her with every English accessory though her consciousness of missus Lowder s existence and still more of her remarkable identity had been of so recent and so sudden a birth Susie as she was apt to call her companion for a lighter change had only had to wave a neat little wand for the fairy tale to begin at once in consequence of which Susie now glittered for with missus Stringham s new sense of success it came to that in the character of a fairy godmother Milly had almost insisted on dressing her for the present occasion as one and it was no fault of the girl s if the good lady hadn t now appeared in a peaked hat a short petticoat and diamond shoe buckles brandishing the magic crutch The good lady bore herself in truth not less contentedly than if these insignia had marked her work and Milly s observation to Lord Mark had doubtless just been the result of such a light exchange of looks with her as even the great length of the table couldn t baffle There were twenty persons between them but this sustained passage was the sharpest sequel yet to that other comparison of views during the pause on the Swiss pass It almost appeared to Milly that their fortune had been unduly precipitated as if properly they were in the position of having ventured on a small joke and found the answer out of proportion grave She couldn t at this moment for instance have said whether with her quickened perceptions she were more enlivened or oppressed and the case might in fact have been serious hadn t she by good fortune from the moment the picture loomed quickly made up her mind that what finally most concerned her was neither to seek nor to shirk wasn t even to wonder too much but was to let things come as they would since there was little enough doubt of how they would go Lord Mark had been brought to her before dinner not by missus Lowder but by the handsome girl that lady s niece who was now at the other end and on the same side as Susie he had taken her in and she meant presently to ask him about Miss Croy the handsome girl actually offered to her sight though now in a splendid way but for the second time The first time had been the occasion only three days before of her calling at their hotel with her aunt and then making for our other two heroines a great impression of beauty and eminence This impression had remained so with Milly that at present and although her attention was aware at the same time of everything else her eyes were mainly engaged with Kate Croy when not engaged with Susie That wonderful creature s eyes moreover readily met them she ranked now as a wonderful creature and it seemed part of the swift prosperity of the American visitors that so little in the original reckoning she should yet appear conscious charmingly frankly conscious of possibilities of friendship for them Milly had easily and as a guest gracefully generalised English girls had a special strong beauty which particularly showed in evening dress above all when as was strikingly the case with this one the dress itself was what it should be That observation she had all ready for Lord Mark when they should after a little get round to it She seemed even now to see that there might be a good deal they would get round to the indication being that taken up once for all with her other neighbour their hostess would leave them much to themselves missus Lowder s other neighbour was the Bishop of Murrum a real bishop such as Milly had never seen with a complicated costume a voice like an old fashioned wind instrument and a face all the portrait of a prelate while the gentleman on our young lady s left a gentleman thick necked large and literal who looked straight before him and as if he were not to be diverted by vain words from that pursuit clearly counted as an offset to the possession of Lord Mark As Milly made out these things with a shade of exhilaration at the way she already fell in she saw how she was justified of her plea for people and her love of life It wasn t then as the prospect seemed to show so difficult to get into the current or to stand at any rate on the bank It was easy to get near if they WERE near and yet the elements were different enough from any of her old elements and positively rich and strange She asked herself if her right hand neighbour would understand what she meant by such a description of them should she throw it off but another of the things to which precisely her sense was awakened was that no decidedly he wouldn t It was nevertheless by this time open to her that his line would be to be clever and indeed evidently no little of the interest was going to be in the fresh reference and fresh effect both of people s cleverness and of their simplicity She thrilled she consciously flushed and all to turn pale again with the certitude it had never been so present that she should find herself completely involved the very air of the place the pitch of the occasion had for her both so sharp a ring and so deep an undertone The smallest things the faces the hands the jewels of the women the sound of words especially of names across the table the shape of the forks the arrangement of the flowers the attitude of the servants the walls of the room were all touches in a picture and denotements in a play and they marked for her moreover her alertness of vision She had never she might well believe been in such a state of vibration her sensibility was almost too sharp for her comfort there were for example more indications than she could reduce to order in the manner of the friendly niece who struck her as distinguished and interesting as in fact surprisingly genial This young woman s type had visibly other possibilities yet here of its own free movement it had already sketched a relation Were they Miss Croy and she to take up the tale where their two elders had left it off so many years before were they to find they liked each other and to try for themselves whether a scheme of constancy on more modern lines could be worked She had doubted as they came to England of Maud Manningham had believed her a broken reed and a vague resource had seen their dependence on her as a state of mind that would have been shamefully silly so far as it WAS dependence had they wished to do anything so inane as get into society To have made their pilgrimage all for the sake of such society as missus Lowder might have in reserve for them that didn t bear thinking of at all and she herself had quite chosen her course for curiosity about other matters She would have described this curiosity as a desire to see the places she had read about and THAT description of her motive she was prepared to give her neighbour even though as a consequence of it he should find how little she had read It was almost at present as if her poor prevision had been rebuked by the majesty she could scarcely call it less of the event or at all events by the commanding character of the two figures she could scarcely call THAT less either mainly presented missus Lowder and her niece however dissimilar had at least in common that each was a great reality That was true primarily of the aunt so true that Milly wondered how her own companion had arrived in other years at so odd an alliance yet she none the less felt missus Lowder as a person of whom the mind might in two or three days roughly make the circuit She would sit there massive at least while one attempted it whereas Miss Croy the handsome girl would indulge in incalculable movements that might interfere with one s tour She was the amusing resisting ominous fact none the less and each other person and thing was just such a fact and it served them right no doubt the pair of them for having rushed into their adventure Lord Mark s intelligence meanwhile however had met her own quite sufficiently to enable him to tell her how little he could clear up her situation He explained for that matter or at least he hinted that there was no such thing to day in London as saying where any one was Every one was everywhere nobody was anywhere He should be put to it yes frankly to give a name of any sort or kind to their hostess s set WAS it a set at all or wasn t it and were there not really no such things as sets in the place any more was there anything but the groping and pawing that of the vague billows of some great greasy sea in mid Channel of masses of bewildered people trying to get they didn t know what or where He threw out the question which seemed large Milly felt that at the end of five minutes he had thrown out a great many though he followed none more than a step or two perhaps he would prove suggestive but he helped her as yet to no discriminations he spoke as if he had given them up from too much knowledge He was thus at the opposite extreme from herself but as a consequence of it also wandering and lost and he was furthermore for all his temporary incoherence to which she guessed there would be some key as packed a concretion as either missus Lowder or Kate The only light in which he placed the former of these ladies was that of an extraordinary woman a most extraordinary woman and the more extraordinary the more one knows her while of the latter he said nothing for the moment but that she was tremendously yes quite tremendously good looking It was some time she thought before his talk showed his cleverness and yet each minute she believed in that mystery more quite apart from what her hostess had told her on first naming him Perhaps he was one of the cases she had heard of at home those characteristic cases of people in England who concealed their play of mind so much more than they advertised it Even mister Densher a little did that And what made Lord Mark at any rate so real either when this was a trick he had apparently so mastered His type somehow as by a life a need an intention of its own took all care for vividness off his hands that was enough It was difficult to guess his age whether he were a young man who looked old or an old man who looked young it seemed to prove nothing as against other things that he was bald and as might have been said slightly stale or more delicately perhaps dry there was such a fine little fidget of preoccupied life in him and his eyes at moments though it was an appearance they could suddenly lose were as candid and clear as those of a pleasant boy Very neat very light and so fair that there was little other indication of his moustache than his constantly feeling it which was again boyish he would have affected her as the most intellectual person present if he had not affected her as the most frivolous The latter quality was rather in his look than in anything else though he constantly wore his double eye glass which was much more Bostonian and thoughtful The idea of his frivolity had no doubt to do with his personal designation which represented as yet for our young woman a little confusedly a connexion with an historic patriciate a class that in turn also confusedly represented an affinity with a social element she had never heard otherwise described than as fashion The supreme social element in New York had never known itself but as reduced to that category and though Milly was aware that as applied to a territorial and political aristocracy the label was probably too simple she had for the time none other at hand She presently it is true enriched her idea with the perception that her interlocutor was indifferent yet this indifferent as aristocracies notoriously were saw her but little further inasmuch as she felt that in the first place he would much rather get on with her than not and in the second was only thinking of too many matters of his own If he kept her in view on the one hand and kept so much else on the other the way he crumbed up his bread was a proof why did he hover before her as a potentially insolent noble She couldn t have answered the question and it was precisely one of those that swarmed They were complicated she might fairly have said by his visibly knowing having known from afar off that she was a stranger and an American and by his none the less making no more of it than if she and her like were the chief of his diet He took her kindly enough but imperturbably irreclaimably for granted and it wouldn t in the least help that she herself knew him as quickly for having been in her country and threshed it out There would be nothing for her to explain or attenuate or brag about she could neither escape nor prevail by her strangeness he would have for that matter on such a subject more to tell her than to learn from her She might learn from HIM why she was so different from the handsome girl which she didn t know being merely able to feel it or at any rate might learn from him why the handsome girl was so different from her On these lines however they would move later the lines immediately laid down were in spite of his vagueness for his own convenience definite enough She was already he observed to her thinking what she should say on her other side which was what Americans were always doing She needn t in conscience say anything at all but Americans never knew that nor ever poor creatures yes SHE had interposed the poor creatures what not to do The burdens they took on the things positively they made an affair of This easy and after all friendly jibe at her race was really for her on her new friend s part the note of personal recognition so far as she required it and she gave him a prompt and conscious example of morbid anxiety by insisting that her desire to be herself lovely all round was justly founded on the lovely way missus Lowder had met her He was directly interested in that and it was not till afterwards she fully knew how much more information about their friend he had taken than given Here again for instance was a characteristic note she had on the spot with her first plunge into the obscure depths of a society constituted from far back encountered the interesting phenomenon of complicated of possibly sinister motive However Maud Manningham her name even in her presence somehow still fed the fancy HAD all the same been lovely and one was going to meet her now quite as far on as one had one s self been met She had been with them at their hotel they were a pair before even they had supposed she could have got their letter Of course indeed they had written in advance but they had followed that up very fast She had thus engaged them to dine but two days later and on the morrow again without waiting for a return visit without waiting for anything she had called with her niece It was as if she really cared for them and it was magnificent fidelity fidelity to missus Stringham her own companion and missus Lowder s former schoolmate the lady with the charming face and the rather high dress down there at the end Lord Mark took in through his nippers these balanced attributes of Susie But isn t missus Stringham s fidelity then equally magnificent Well it s a beautiful sentiment but it isn t as if she had anything to GIVE Hasn t she got you Lord Mark asked without excessive delay Me to give missus Lowder Milly had clearly not yet seen herself in the light of such an offering Oh I m rather a poor present and I don t feel as if even at that I had as yet quite been given You ve been shown and if our friend has jumped at you it comes to the same thing He made his jokes Lord Mark without amusement for himself yet it wasn t that he was grim To be seen you must recognise IS for you to be jumped at and if it s a question of being shown here you are again Only it has now been taken out of your friend s hands it s missus Lowder already who s getting the benefit Look round the table and you ll make out I think that you re being from top to bottom jumped at Well then said Milly I seem also to feel that I like it better than being made fun of It was one of the things she afterwards saw Milly was for ever seeing things afterwards that her companion had here had some way of his own quite unlike any one s else of assuring her of his consideration She wondered how he had done it for he had neither apologised nor protested She said to herself at any rate that he had led her on and what was most odd was the question by which he had done so Does she know much about you No she just likes us Even for this his travelled lordship seasoned and saturated had no laugh I mean YOU particularly Has that lady with the charming face which IS charming told her Milly cast about Told her what Everything This with the way he dropped it again considerably moved her made her feel for a moment that as a matter of course she was a subject for disclosures But she quickly found her answer Oh as for that you must ask HER Your clever companion missus Lowder He replied to this that their hostess was a person with whom there were certain liberties one never took but that he was none the less fairly upheld inasmuch as she was for the most part kind to him and as should he be very good for a while she would probably herself tell him And I shall have at any rate in the meantime the interest of seeing what she does with you That will teach me more or less you see how much she knows Milly followed this it was lucid but it suggested something apart How much does she know about YOU Nothing said Lord Mark serenely But that doesn t matter for what she does with me And then as to anticipate Milly s question about the nature of such doing This for instance turning me straight on for YOU The girl thought And you mean she wouldn t if she did know He met it as if it were really a point No I believe to do her justice she still would So you can be easy Milly had the next instant then acted on the permission Because you re even at the worst the best thing she has With this he was at last amused I was till you came You re the best now It was strange his words should have given her the sense of his knowing but it was positive that they did so and to the extent of making her believe them though still with wonder That really from this first of their meetings was what was most to abide with her she accepted almost helplessly she surrendered so to the inevitable in it being the sort of thing as he might have said that he at least thoroughly believed he had in going about seen enough of for all practical purposes Her submission was naturally moreover not to be impaired by her learning later on that he had paid at short intervals though at a time apparently just previous to her own emergence from the obscurity of extreme youth three separate visits to New York where his nameable friends and his contrasted contacts had been numerous His impression his recollection of the whole mixed quantity was still visibly rich It had helped him to place her and she was more and more sharply conscious of having as with the door sharply slammed upon her and the guard s hand raised in signal to the train been popped into the compartment in which she was to travel for him It was a use of her that many a girl would have been doubtless quick to resent and the kind of mind that thus in our young lady made all for mere seeing and taking is precisely one of the charms of our subject Milly had practically just learned from him had made out as it were from her rumbling compartment that he gave her the highest place among their friend s actual properties She was a success that was what it came to he presently assured her and this was what it was to be a success it always happened before one could know it One s ignorance was in fact often the greatest part of it You haven t had time yet he said this is nothing But you ll see You ll see everything You CAN you know everything you dream of He made her more and more wonder she almost felt as if he were showing her visions while he spoke and strangely enough though it was visions that had drawn her on she hadn t had them in connexion that is in such preliminary and necessary connexion with such a face as Lord Mark s such eyes and such a voice such a tone and such a manner He had for an instant the effect of making her ask herself if she were after all going to be afraid so distinct was it for fifty seconds that a fear passed over her There they were again yes certainly Susie s overture to missus Lowder had been their joke but they had pressed in that gaiety an electric bell that continued to sound Positively while she sat there she had the loud rattle in her ears and she wondered during these moments why the others didn t hear it They didn t stare they didn t smile and the fear in her that I speak of was but her own desire to stop it That dropped however as if the alarm itself had ceased she seemed to have seen in a quick though tempered glare that there were two courses for her one to leave London again the first thing in the morning the other to do nothing at all Well she would do nothing at all she was already doing it more than that she had already done it and her chance was gone She gave herself up she had the strangest sense on the spot of so deciding for she had turned a corner before she went on again with Lord Mark Inexpressive but intensely significant he met as no one else could have done the very question she had suddenly put to missus Stringham on the Brunig Should she have it whatever she did have that question had been for long Ah so possibly not her neighbour appeared to reply therefore don t you see I M the way It was vivid that he might be in spite of his absence of flourish the way being doubtless just IN that absence The handsome girl whom she didn t lose sight of and who she felt kept her also in view missus Lowder s striking niece would perhaps be the way as well for in her too was the absence of flourish though she had little else so far as one could tell in common with Lord Mark Yet how indeed COULD one tell what did one understand and of what was one for that matter provisionally conscious but of their being somehow together in what they represented Kate Croy fine but friendly looked over at her as really with a guess at Lord Mark s effect on her If she could guess this effect what then did she know about it and in what degree had she felt it herself Did that represent as between them anything particular and should she have to count with them as duplicating as intensifying by a mutual intelligence the relation into which she was sinking Nothing was so odd as that she should have to recognise so quickly in each of these glimpses of an instant the various signs of a relation and this anomaly itself had she had more time to give to it might well might almost terribly have suggested to her that her doom was to live fast It was queerly a question of the short run and the consciousness proportionately crowded These were immense excursions for the spirit of a young person at missus Lowder s mere dinner party but what was so significant and so admonitory as the fact of their being possible What could they have been but just a part already of the crowded consciousness And it was just a part likewise that while plates were changed and dishes presented and periods in the banquet marked while appearances insisted and phenomena multiplied and words reached her from here and there like plashes of a slow thick tide while missus Lowder grew somehow more stout and more instituted and Susie at her distance and in comparison more thinly improvised and more different different that is from every one and every thing it was just a part that while this process went forward our young lady alighted came back taking up her destiny again as if she had been able by a wave or two of her wings to place herself briefly in sight of an alternative to it Whatever it was it had showed in this brief interval as better than the alternative and it now presented itself altogether in the image and in the place in which she had left it The image was that of her being as Lord Mark had declared a success This depended more or less of course on his idea of the thing into which at present however she wouldn t go But renewing soon she had asked him what he meant then that missus Lowder would do with her and he had replied that this might safely be left She ll get back he pleasantly said her money He could say it too which was singular without affecting her either as vulgar or as nasty and he had soon explained himself by adding Nobody here you know does anything for nothing Ah if you mean that we shall reward her as hard as ever we can nothing is more certain But she s an idealist Milly continued and idealists in the long run I think DON T feel that they lose Lord Mark seemed within the limits of his enthusiasm to find this charming Ah she strikes you as an idealist She idealises US my friend and me absolutely She sees us in a light said Milly That s all I ve got to hold on by So don t deprive me of it I wouldn t think of such a thing for the world But do you suppose he continued as if it were suddenly important for him do you suppose she sees ME in a light She neglected his question for a little partly because her attention attached itself more and more to the handsome girl partly because placed so near their hostess she wished not to show as discussing her too freely missus Lowder it was true steering in the other quarter a course in which she called at subjects as if they were islets in an archipelago continued to allow them their ease and Kate Croy at the same time steadily revealed herself as interesting Milly in fact found of a sudden her ease found it all as she bethought herself that what missus Lowder was really arranging for was a report on her quality and as perhaps might be said her value from Lord Mark She wished him the wonderful lady to have no pretext for not knowing what he thought of Miss Theale Why his judgement so mattered remained to be seen but it was this divination that in any case now determined Milly s rejoinder No She knows you She has probably reason to And you all here know each other I see that so far as you know anything You know what you re used to and it s your being used to it that and that only that makes you But there are things you don t know He took it in as if it might fairly to do him justice be a point Things that I don t with all the pains I take and the way I ve run about the world to leave nothing unlearned Milly thought and it was perhaps the very truth of his claim its not being negligible that sharpened her impatience and thereby her wit You re blase but you re not enlightened You re familiar with everything but conscious really of nothing What I mean is that you ve no imagination Lord Mark at this threw back his head ranging with his eyes the opposite side of the room and showing himself at last so much more flagrantly diverted that it fairly attracted their hostess s notice missus Lowder however only smiled on Milly for a sign that something racy was what she had expected and resumed with a splash of her screw her cruise among the islands Oh I ve heard that the young man replied before There it is then You ve heard everything before You ve heard ME of course before in my country often enough Oh never too often he protested I m sure I hope I shall still hear you again and again But what good then has it done you the girl went on as if now frankly to amuse him Oh you ll see when you know me But most assuredly I shall never know you Then that will be exactly he laughed the good If it established thus that they couldn t or wouldn t mix why did Milly none the less feel through it a perverse quickening of the relation to which she had been in spite of herself appointed What queerer consequence of their not mixing than their talking for it was what they had arrived at almost intimately She wished to get away from him or indeed much rather away from herself so far as she was present to him She saw already wonderful creature after all herself too that there would be a good deal more of him to come for her and that the special sign of their intercourse would be to keep herself out of the question Everything else might come in only never that and with such an arrangement they would perhaps even go far This in fact might quite have begun on the spot with her returning again to the topic of the handsome girl If she was to keep herself out she could naturally best do so by putting in somebody else She accordingly put in Kate Croy being ready to that extent as she was not at all afraid for her to sacrifice her if necessary Lord Mark himself for that matter had made it easy by saying a little while before that no one among them did anything for nothing What then she was aware of being abrupt does Miss Croy if she s so interested do it for What has she to gain by HER lovely welcome Look at her NOW Milly broke out with characteristic freedom of praise though pulling herself up also with a compunctious Oh as the direction thus given to their eyes happened to coincide with a turn of Kate s face to them All she had meant to do was to insist that this face was fine but what she had in fact done was to renew again her effect of showing herself to its possessor as conjoined with Lord Mark for some interested view of it He had however promptly met her question To gain Why your acquaintance Well what s my acquaintance to HER She can care for me she must feel that only by being sorry for me and that s why she s lovely to be already willing to take the trouble to be It s the height of the disinterested There were more things in this than one that Lord Mark might have taken up but in a minute he had made his choice Ah then I m nowhere for I m afraid I M not sorry for you in the least What do you make then he asked of your success Why just the great reason of all It s just because our friend there sees it that she pities me She understands Milly said she s better than any of you She s beautiful He appeared struck with this at last with the point the girl made of it to which she came back even after a diversion created by a dish presented between them Beautiful in character I see IS she so You must tell me about her Milly wondered But haven t you known her longer than I Haven t you seen her for yourself No I ve failed with her It s no use I don t make her out And I assure you I really should like to His assurance had in fact for his companion a positive suggestion of sincerity he affected her as now saying something he did feel and she was the more struck with it as she was still conscious of the failure even of curiosity he had just shown in respect to herself She had meant something though indeed for herself almost only in speaking of their friend s natural pity it had doubtless been a note of questionable taste but it had quavered out in spite of her and he hadn t so much as cared to enquire Why natural Not that it wasn t really much better for her that he shouldn t explanations would in truth have taken her much too far Only she now perceived that in comparison her word about this other person really drew him and there were things in that probably many things as to which she would learn more and which glimmered there already as part and parcel of that larger real with which in her new situation she was to be beguiled It was in fact at the very moment this element not absent from what Lord Mark was further saying So you re wrong you see as to our knowing all about each other There are cases where we break down I at any rate give HER up up that is to you You must do her for me tell me I mean when you know more You ll notice he pleasantly wound up that I ve confidence in you Why shouldn t you have Milly asked observing in this as she thought a fine though for such a man a surprisingly artless fatuity It was as if there might have been a question of her falsifying for the sake of her own show that is of the failure of her honesty to be proof against her desire to keep well with him herself She didn t none the less otherwise protest against his remark there was something else she was occupied in seeing It was the handsome girl alone one of his own species and his own society who had made him feel uncertain of his certainties about a mere little American a cheap exotic imported almost wholesale and whose habitat with its conditions of climate growth and cultivation its immense profusion but its few varieties and thin development he was perfectly satisfied The marvel was too that Milly understood his satisfaction feeling she expressed the truth in presently saying Of course I make out that she must be difficult just as I see that I myself must be easy And that was what for all the rest of this occasion remained with her as the most interesting thing that COULD remain She was more and more content herself to be easy she would have been resigned even had it been brought straighter home to her to passing for a cheap exotic Provisionally at any rate that protected her wish to keep herself with Lord Mark in abeyance They HAD all affected her as inevitably knowing each other and if the handsome girl s place among them was something even their initiation couldn t deal with why then she would indeed be a quantity Book Fourth Chapter two That sense of quantities separate or mixed was really no doubt what most prevailed at first for our slightly gasping American pair it found utterance for them in their frequent remark to each other that they had no one but themselves to thank It dropped from Milly more than once that if she had ever known it was so easy though her exclamation mostly ended without completing her idea This however was a trifle to missus Stringham who cared little whether she meant that in this case she would have come sooner She couldn t have come sooner and she perhaps on the contrary meant for it would have been like her that she wouldn t have come at all why it was so easy being at any rate a matter as to which her companion had begun quickly to pick up views Susie kept some of these lights for the present to herself since freely communicated they might have been a little disturbing with which moreover the quantities that we speak of as surrounding the two ladies were in many cases quantities of things and of other things to talk about Their immediate lesson accordingly was that they just had been caught up by the incalculable strength of a wave that was actually holding them aloft and that would naturally dash them wherever it liked They meanwhile we hasten to add made the best of their precarious position and if Milly had had no other help for it she would have found not a little in the sight of Susan Shepherd s state The girl had had nothing to say to her for three days about the success announced by Lord Mark which they saw besides otherwise established she was too taken up too touched by Susie s own exaltation Susie glowed in the light of her justified faith everything had happened that she had been acute enough to think least probable she had appealed to a possible delicacy in Maud Manningham a delicacy mind you but BARELY possible and her appeal had been met in a way that was an honour to human nature This proved sensibility of the lady of Lancaster Gate performed verily for both our friends during these first days the office of a fine floating gold dust something that threw over the prospect a harmonising blur The forms the colours behind it were strong and deep we have seen how they already stood out for Milly but nothing comparatively had had so much of the dignity of truth as the fact of Maud s fidelity to a sentiment That was what Susie was proud of much more than of her great place in the world which she was moreover conscious of not as yet wholly measuring That was what was more vivid even than her being in senses more worldly and in fact almost in the degree of a revelation English and distinct and positive with almost no inward but with the finest outward resonance Susan Shepherd s word for her again and again was that she was large yet it was not exactly a case as to the soul of echoing chambers she might have been likened rather to a capacious receptacle originally perhaps loose but now drawn as tightly as possible over its accumulated contents a packed mass for her American admirer of curious detail When the latter good lady at home had handsomely figured her friends as not small which was the way she mostly figured them there was a certain implication that they were spacious because they were empty missus Lowder by a different law was spacious because she was full because she had something in common even in repose with a projectile of great size loaded and ready for use That indeed to Susie s romantic mind announced itself as half the charm of their renewal a charm as of sitting in springtime during a long peace on the daisied grassy bank of some great slumbering fortress True to her psychological instincts certainly missus Stringham had noted that the sentiment she rejoiced in on her old schoolmate s part was all a matter of action and movement was not save for the interweaving of a more frequent plump dearest than she would herself perhaps have used a matter of much other embroidery She brooded with interest on this further mark of race feeling in her own spirit a different economy The joy for her was to know why she acted the reason was half the business whereas with missus Lowder there might have been no reason why was the trivial seasoning substance the vanilla or the nutmeg omittable from the nutritive pudding without spoiling it missus Lowder s desire was clearly sharp that their young companions should also prosper together and missus Stringham s account of it all to Milly during the first days was that when at Lancaster Gate she was not occupied in telling as it were about her she was occupied in hearing much of the history of her hostess s brilliant niece They had plenty on these lines the two elder women to give and to take and it was even not quite clear to the pilgrim from Boston that what she should mainly have arranged for in London was not a series of thrills for herself She had a bad conscience indeed almost a sense of immorality in having to recognise that she was as she said carried away She laughed to Milly when she also said that she didn t know where it would end and the principle of her uneasiness was that missus Lowder s life bristled for her with elements that she was really having to look at for the first time They represented she believed the world the world that as a consequence of the cold shoulder turned to it by the Pilgrim Fathers had never yet boldly crossed to Boston it would surely have sunk the stoutest Cunarder and she couldn t pretend that she faced the prospect simply because Milly had had a caprice She was in the act herself of having one directed precisely to their present spectacle She could but seek strength in the thought that she had never had one or had never yielded to one which came to the same thing before The sustaining sense of it all moreover as literary material that quite dropped from her She must wait at any rate she should see it struck her so far as she had got as vast obscure lurid She reflected in the watches of the night that she was probably just going to love it for itself that is for itself and Milly The odd thing was that she could think of Milly s loving it without dread or with dread at least not on the score of conscience only on the score of peace It was a mercy at all events for the hour that their two spirits jumped together While for this first week that followed their dinner she drank deep at Lancaster Gate her companion was no less happily appeared to be indeed on the whole quite as romantically provided for The handsome English girl from the heavy English house had been as a figure in a picture stepping by magic out of its frame it was a case in truth for which missus Stringham presently found the perfect image She had lost none of her grasp but quite the contrary of that other conceit in virtue of which Milly was the wandering princess so what could be more in harmony now than to see the princess waited upon at the city gate by the worthiest maiden the chosen daughter of the burgesses It was the real again evidently the amusement of the meeting for the princess too princesses living for the most part in such an appeased way on the plane of mere elegant representation That was why they pounced at city gates on deputed flower strewing damsels that was why after effigies processions and other stately games frank human company was pleasant to them Kate Croy really presented herself to Milly the latter abounded for missus Stringham in accounts of it as the wondrous London girl in person by what she had conceived from far back of the London girl conceived from the tales of travellers and the anecdotes of New York from old porings over Punch and a liberal acquaintance with the fiction of the day The only thing was that she was nicer since the creature in question had rather been to our young woman an image of dread She had thought of her at her best as handsome just as Kate was with turns of head and tones of voice felicities of stature and attitude things put on and for that matter put off all the marks of the product of a packed society who should be at the same time the heroine of a strong story She placed this striking young person from the first in a story saw her by a necessity of the imagination for a heroine felt it the only character in which she wouldn t be wasted and this in spite of the heroine s pleasant abruptness her forbearance from gush her umbrellas and jackets and shoes as these things sketched themselves to Milly and something rather of a breezy boy in the carriage of her arms and the occasional freedom of her slang When Milly had settled that the extent of her good will itself made her shy she had found for the moment quite a sufficient key and they were by that time thoroughly afloat together This might well have been the happiest hour they were to know attacking in friendly independence their great London the London of shops and streets and suburbs oddly interesting to Milly as well as of museums monuments sights oddly unfamiliar to Kate while their elders pursued a separate course these two rejoicing not less in their intimacy and each thinking the other s young woman a great acquisition for her own Milly expressed to Susan Shepherd more than once that Kate had some secret some smothered trouble besides all the rest of her history and that if she had so good naturedly helped missus Lowder to meet them this was exactly to create a diversion to give herself something else to think about But on the case thus postulated our young American had as yet had no light she only felt that when the light should come it would greatly deepen the colour and she liked to think she was prepared for anything What she already knew moreover was full to her vision of English of eccentric of Thackerayan character Kate Croy having gradually become not a little explicit on the subject of her situation her past her present her general predicament her small success up to the present hour in contenting at the same time her father her sister her aunt and herself It was Milly s subtle guess imparted to her Susie that the girl had somebody else as well as yet unnamed to content it being manifest that such a creature couldn t help having a creature not perhaps if one would exactly formed to inspire passions since that always implied a certain silliness but essentially seen by the admiring eye of friendship under the clear shadow of some probably eminent male interest The clear shadow from whatever source projected hung at any rate over Milly s companion the whole week and Kate Croy s handsome face smiled out of it under bland skylights in the presence alike of old masters passive in their glory and of thoroughly new ones the newest who bristled restlessly with pins and brandished snipping shears It was meanwhile a pretty part of the intercourse of these young ladies that each thought the other more remarkable than herself that each thought herself or assured the other she did a comparatively dusty object and the other a favourite of nature and of fortune and covered thereby with the freshness of the morning Kate was amused amazed at the way her friend insisted on taking her and Milly wondered if Kate were sincere in finding her the most extraordinary quite apart from her being the most charming person she had come across They had talked in long drives and quantities of history had not been wanting in the light of which missus Lowder s niece might superficially seem to have had the best of the argument Her visitor s American references with their bewildering immensities their confounding moneyed New York their excitements of high pressure their opportunities of wild freedom their record of used up relatives parents clever eager fair slim brothers these the most loved all engaged as well as successive superseded guardians in a high extravagance of speculation and dissipation that had left this exquisite being her black dress her white face and her vivid hair as the mere last broken link such a picture quite threw into the shade the brief biography however sketchily amplified of a mere middle class nobody in Bayswater And though that indeed might be but a Bayswater way of putting it in addition to which Milly was in the stage of interest in Bayswater ways this critic so far prevailed that like missus Stringham herself she fairly got her companion to accept from her that she was quite the nearest approach to a practical princess Bayswater could hope ever to know It was a fact it became one at the end of three days that Milly actually began to borrow from the handsome girl a sort of view of her state the handsome girl s impression of it was clearly so sincere This impression was a tribute a tribute positively to power power the source of which was the last thing Kate treated as a mystery There were passages under all their skylights the succession of their shops being large in which the latter s easy yet the least bit dry manner sufficiently gave out that if SHE had had so deep a pocket It was not moreover by any means with not having the imagination of expenditure that she appeared to charge her friend but with not having the imagination of terror of thrift the imagination or in any degree the habit of a conscious dependence on others Such moments when all Wigmore Street for instance seemed to rustle about and the pale girl herself to be facing the different rustlers usually so undiscriminated as individual Britons too Britons personal parties to a relation and perhaps even intrinsically remarkable such moments in especial determined for Kate a perception of the high happiness of her companion s liberty Milly s range was thus immense she had to ask nobody for anything to refer nothing to any one her freedom her fortune and her fancy were her law an obsequious world surrounded her she could sniff up at every step its fumes And Kate these days was altogether in the phase of forgiving her so much bliss in the phase moreover of believing that should they continue to go on together she would abide in that generosity She had at such a point as this no suspicion of a rift within the lute by which we mean not only none of anything s coming between them but none of any definite flaw in so much clearness of quality Yet all the same if Milly at missus Lowder s banquet had described herself to Lord Mark as kindly used by the young woman on the other side because of some faintly felt special propriety in it so there really did match with this privately on the young woman s part a feeling not analysed but divided a latent impression that Mildred Theale was not after all a person to change places to change even chances with Kate verily would perhaps not quite have known what she meant by this discrimination and she came near naming it only when she said to herself that rich as Milly was one probably wouldn t which was singular ever hate her for it The handsome girl had with herself these felicities and crudities it wasn t obscure to her that without some very particular reason to help it might have proved a test of one s philosophy not to be irritated by a mistress of millions or whatever they were who as a girl so easily might have been like herself only vague and cruelly female She was by no means sure of liking Aunt Maud as much as SHE deserved and Aunt Maud s command of funds was obviously inferior to Milly s There was thus clearly as pleading for the latter some influence that would later on become distinct and meanwhile decidedly it was enough that she was as charming as she was queer and as queer as she was charming all of which was a rare amusement as well for that matter as further sufficient that there were objects of value she had already pressed on Kate s acceptance A week of her society in these conditions conditions that Milly chose to sum up as ministering immensely for a blind vague pilgrim to aid and comfort announced itself from an early hour as likely to become a week of presents acknowledgements mementoes pledges of gratitude and admiration that were all on one side Kate as promptly embraced the propriety of making it clear that she must forswear shops till she should receive some guarantee that the contents of each one she entered as a humble companion shouldn t be placed at her feet yet that was in truth not before she had found herself in possession under whatever protests of several precious ornaments and other minor conveniences Great was the absurdity too that there should have come a day by the end of the week when it appeared that all Milly would have asked in definite return as might be said was to be told a little about Lord Mark and to be promised the privilege of a visit to missus Condrip Far other amusements had been offered her but her eagerness was shamelessly human and she seemed really to count more on the revelation of the anxious lady at Chelsea than on the best nights of the opera Kate admired and showed it such an absence of fear to the fear of being bored in such a connexion she would have been so obviously entitled Milly s answer to this was the plea of her curiosities which left her friend wondering as to their odd direction Some among them no doubt were rather more intelligible and Kate had heard without wonder that she was blank about Lord Mark This young lady s account of him at the same time professed itself frankly imperfect for what they best knew him by at Lancaster Gate was a thing difficult to explain One knew people in general by something they had to show something that either for them or against could be touched or named or proved and she could think of no other case of a value taken as so great and yet flourishing untested His value was his future which had somehow got itself as accepted by Aunt Maud as if it had been his good cook or his steamlaunch She Kate didn t mean she thought him a humbug he might do great things but they were as yet so to speak all he had done On the other hand it was of course something of an achievement and not open to every one to have got one s self taken so seriously by Aunt Maud The best thing about him doubtless on the whole was that Aunt Maud believed in him She was often fantastic but she knew a humbug and no Lord Mark wasn t that He had been a short time in the House on the Tory side but had lost his seat on the first opportunity and this was all he had to point to However he pointed to nothing which was very possibly just a sign of his real cleverness one of those that the really clever had in common with the really void Even Aunt Maud frequently admitted that there was a good deal for her view of him to bring up the rear And he wasn t meanwhile himself indifferent indifferent to himself for he was working Lancaster Gate for all it was worth just as it was no doubt working him and just as the working and the worked were in London as one might explain the parties to every relation Kate did explain for her listening friend every one who had anything to give it was true they were the fewest made the sharpest possible bargain for it got at least its value in return The strangest thing furthermore was that this might be in cases a happy understanding The worker in one connexion was the worked in another it was as broad as it was long with the wheels of the system as might be seen wonderfully oiled People could quite like each other in the midst of it as Aunt Maud by every appearance quite liked Lord Mark and as Lord Mark it was to be hoped liked missus Lowder since if he didn t he was a greater brute than one could believe She Kate hadn t yet it was true made out what he was doing for her besides which the dear woman needed him even at the most he could do much less than she imagined so far as all of which went moreover there were plenty of things on every side she hadn t yet made out She believed on the whole in any one Aunt Maud took up and she gave it to Milly as worth thinking of that whatever wonderful people this young lady might meet in the land she would meet no more extraordinary woman There were greater celebrities by the million and of course greater swells but a bigger PERSON by Kate s view and a larger natural handful every way would really be far to seek When Milly enquired with interest if Kate s belief in HER was primarily on the lines of what missus Lowder took up her interlocutress could handsomely say yes since by the same principle she believed in herself Whom but Aunt Maud s niece pre eminently had Aunt Maud taken up and who was thus more in the current with her of working and of being worked You may ask Kate said what in the world I have to give and that indeed is just what I m trying to learn There must be something for her to think she can get it out of me She WILL get it trust her and then I shall see what it is which I beg you to believe I should never have found out for myself She declined to treat any question of Milly s own paying power as discussable that Milly would pay a hundred per cent and even to the end doubtless through the nose was just the beautiful basis on which they found themselves These were fine facilities pleasantries ironies all these luxuries of gossip and philosophies of London and of life and they became quickly between the pair the common form of talk Milly professing herself delighted to know that something was to be done with her If the most remarkable woman in England was to do it so much the better and if the most remarkable woman in England had them both in hand together why what could be jollier for each When she reflected indeed a little on the oddity of her wanting two at once Kate had the natural reply that it was exactly what showed her sincerity She invariably gave way to feeling and feeling had distinctly popped up in her on the advent of her girlhood s friend The way the cat would jump was always in presence of anything that moved her interesting to see visibly enough moreover it hadn t for a long time jumped anything like so far This in fact as we already know remained the marvel for Milly Theale who on sight of missus Lowder had found fifty links in respect to Susie absent from the chain of association She knew so herself what she thought of Susie that she would have expected the lady of Lancaster Gate to think something quite different the failure of which endlessly mystified her But her mystification was the cause for her of another fine impression inasmuch as when she went so far as to observe to Kate that Susan Shepherd and especially Susan Shepherd emerging so uninvited from an irrelevant past ought by all the proprieties simply to have bored Aunt Maud her confidant agreed to this without a protest and abounded in the sense of her wonder Susan Shepherd at least bored the niece that was plain this young woman saw nothing in her nothing to account for anything not even for Milly s own indulgence which little fact became in turn to the latter s mind a fact of significance It was a light on the handsome girl representing more than merely showed that poor Susie was simply as nought to her This was in a manner too a general admonition to poor Susie s companion who seemed to see marked by it the direction in which she had best most look out It just faintly rankled in her that a person who was good enough and to spare for Milly Theale shouldn t be good enough for another girl though oddly enough she could easily have forgiven missus Lowder herself the impatience missus Lowder didn t feel it and Kate Croy felt it with ease yet in the end be it added she grasped the reason and the reason enriched her mind Wasn t it sufficiently the reason that the handsome girl was with twenty other splendid qualities the least bit brutal too and didn t she suggest as no one yet had ever done for her new friend that there might be a wild beauty in that and even a strange grace Kate wasn t brutally brutal which Milly had hitherto benightedly supposed the only way she wasn t even aggressively so but rather indifferently defensively and as might be said by the habit of anticipation She simplified in advance was beforehand with her doubts and knew with singular quickness what she wasn t as they said in New York going to like In that way at least people were clearly quicker in England than at home and Milly could quite see after a little how such instincts might become usual in a world in which dangers abounded There were clearly more dangers roundabout Lancaster Gate than one suspected in New York or could dream of in Boston At all events with more sense of them there were more precautions and it was a remarkable world altogether in which there could be precautions on whatever ground against Susie Book Fourth Chapter three She certainly made up with Susie directly however for any allowance she might have had privately to extend to tepid appreciation since the late and long talks of these two embraced not only everything offered and suggested by the hours they spent apart but a good deal more besides She might be as detached as the occasion required at four o clock in the afternoon but she used no such freedom to any one about anything as she habitually used about everything to Susan Shepherd at midnight All the same it should with much less delay than this have been mentioned she hadn t yet hadn t that is at the end of six days produced any news for her comrade to compare with an announcement made her by the latter as a result of a drive with missus Lowder for a change in the remarkable Battersea Park The elder friends had sociably revolved there while the younger ones followed bolder fancies in the admirable equipage appointed to Milly at the hotel a heavier more emblazoned more amusing chariot than she had ever with stables notoriously mismanaged known at home whereby in the course of the circuit more than once repeated it had come out as missus Stringham said that the couple at Lancaster Gate were of all people acquainted with Mildred s other English friend the gentleman the one connected with the English newspaper Susie hung fire a little over his name who had been with her in New York so shortly previous to present adventures He had been named of course in Battersea Park else he couldn t have been identified and Susie had naturally before she could produce her own share in the matter as a kind of confession to make it plain that her allusion was to mister Merton Densher This was because Milly had at first a little air of not knowing whom she meant and the girl really kept as well a certain control of herself while she remarked that the case was surprising the chance one in a thousand They knew him both Maud and Miss Croy knew him she gathered too rather well though indeed it wasn t on any show of intimacy that he had happened to be mentioned It hadn t been Susie made the point she herself who brought him in he had in fact not been brought in at all but only referred to as a young journalist known to missus Lowder and who had lately gone to their wonderful country missus Lowder always said your wonderful country on behalf of his journal But missus Stringham had taken it up with the tips of her fingers indeed and that was the confession she had without meaning any harm recognised mister Densher as an acquaintance of Milly s though she had also pulled herself up before getting in too far missus Lowder had been struck clearly it wasn t too much to say then she also it had rather seemed had pulled herself up and there had been a little moment during which each might have been keeping something from the other Only said Milly s informant I luckily remembered in time that I had nothing whatever to keep which was much simpler and nicer I don t know what Maud has but there it is She was interested distinctly in your knowing him in his having met you over there with so little loss of time But I ventured to tell her it hadn t been so long as to make you as yet great friends I don t know if I was right Whatever time this explanation might have taken there had been moments enough in the matter now before the elder woman s conscience had done itself justice to enable Milly to reply that although the fact in question doubtless had its importance she imagined they wouldn t find the importance overwhelming It WAS odd that their one Englishman should so instantly fit it wasn t however miraculous they surely all had often seen how extraordinarily small as every one said was the world Undoubtedly also Susie had done just the plain thing in not letting his name pass Why in the world should there be a mystery and what an immense one they would appear to have made if he should come back and find they had concealed their knowledge of him I don t know Susie dear the girl observed what you think I have to conceal It doesn t matter at a given moment missus Stringham returned what you know or don t know as to what I think for you always find out the very next minute and when you do find out dearest you never REALLY care Only she presently asked have you heard of him from Miss Croy Heard of mister Densher Never a word We haven t mentioned him Why should we That YOU haven t I understand but that your friend hasn t Susie opined may mean something May mean what Well missus Stringham presently brought out I tell you all when I tell you that Maud asks me to suggest to you that it may perhaps be better for the present not to speak of him not to speak of him to her niece that is unless she herself speaks to you first But Maud thinks she won t Milly was ready to engage for anything but in respect to the facts as they so far possessed them it all sounded a little complicated Is it because there s anything between them No I gather not but Maud s state of mind is precautionary She s afraid of something Or perhaps it would be more correct to say she s afraid of everything She s afraid you mean Milly asked of their a liking each other Susie had an intense thought and then an effusion My dear child we move in a labyrinth Of course we do That s just the fun of it said Milly with a strange gaiety Then she added Don t tell me that in this for instance there are not abysses I want abysses Her friend looked at her it was not unfrequently the case a little harder than the surface of the occasion seemed to require and another person present at such times might have wondered to what inner thought of her own the good lady was trying to fit the speech It was too much her disposition no doubt to treat her young companion s words as symptoms of an imputed malady It was none the less however her highest law to be light when the girl was light She knew how to be quaint with the new quaintness the great Boston gift it had been happily her note in the magazines and Maud Lowder to whom it was new indeed and who had never heard anything remotely like it quite cherished her as a social resource by reason of it It shouldn t therefore fail her now with it in fact one might face most things Ah then let us hope we shall sound the depths I m prepared for the worst of sorrow and sin But she would like her niece we re not ignorant of that are we to marry Lord Mark Hasn t she told you so Hasn t missus Lowder told me No hasn t Kate It isn t you know that she doesn t know it Milly had under her comrade s eyes a minute of mute detachment She had lived with Kate Croy for several days in a state of intimacy as deep as it had been sudden and they had clearly in talk in many directions proceeded to various extremities Yet it now came over her as in a clear cold wave that there was a possible account of their relations in which the quantity her new friend had told her might have figured as small as smallest beside the quantity she hadn t She couldn t say at any rate whether or no Kate had made the point that her aunt designed her for Lord Mark it had only sufficiently come out which had been moreover eminently guessable that she was involved in her aunt s designs Somehow for Milly brush it over nervously as she might and with whatever simplifying hand this abrupt extrusion of mister Densher altered all proportions had an effect on all values It was fantastic of her to let it make a difference that she couldn t in the least have defined and she was at least even during these instants rather proud of being able to hide on the spot the difference it did make Yet all the same the effect for her was almost violently of that gentleman s having been there having been where she had stood till now in her simplicity before her It would have taken but another free moment to make her see abysses since abysses were what she wanted in the mere circumstance of his own silence in New York about his English friends There had really been in New York little time for anything but had she liked Milly could have made it out for herself that he had avoided the subject of Miss Croy and that Miss Croy was yet a subject it could never be natural to avoid It was to be added at the same time that even if his silence had been a labyrinth which was absurd in view of all the other things too he couldn t possibly have spoken of this was exactly what must suit her since it fell under the head of the plea she had just uttered to Susie These things however came and went and it set itself up between the companions for the occasion in the oddest way both that their happening all to know mister Densher except indeed that Susie didn t but probably would was a fact attached in a world of rushing about to one of the common orders of chance and yet further that it was amusing oh awfully amusing to be able fondly to hope that there was something IN its having been left to crop up with such suddenness There seemed somehow a possibility that the ground or as it were the air might in a manner have undergone some pleasing preparation though the question of this possibility would probably after all have taken some threshing out The truth moreover and there they were already our pair talking about it the truth hadn t in fact quite cropped out This obviously in view of missus Lowder s request to her old friend It was accordingly on missus Lowder s recommendation that nothing should be said to Kate it was on all this might cover in Aunt Maud that the idea of an interesting complication could best hope to perch and when in fact after the colloquy we have reported Milly saw Kate again without mentioning any name her silence succeeded in passing muster with her as the beginning of a new sort of fun The sort was all the newer by its containing measurably a small element of anxiety when she had gone in for fun before it had been with her hands a little more free Yet it WAS none the less rather exciting to be conscious of a still sharper reason for interest in the handsome girl as Kate continued even now pre eminently to remain for her and a reason this was the great point of which the young woman herself could have no suspicion Twice over thus for two or three hours together Milly found herself seeing Kate quite fixing her in the light of the knowledge that it was a face on which mister Densher s eyes had more or less familiarly rested and which by the same token had looked rather MORE beautifully than less into his own She pulled herself up indeed with the thought that it had inevitably looked as beautifully as one would into thousands of faces in which one might one s self never trace it but just the odd result of the thought was to intensify for the girl that side of her friend which she had doubtless already been more prepared than she quite knew to think of as the other the not wholly calculable It was fantastic and Milly was aware of this but the other side was what had of a sudden been turned straight toward her by the show of mister Densher s propinquity She hadn t the excuse of knowing it for Kate s own since nothing whatever as yet proved it particularly to be such Never mind it was with this other side now fully presented that Kate came and went kissed her for greeting and for parting talked as usual of everything but as it had so abruptly become for Milly THE thing Our young woman it is true would doubtless not have tasted so sharply a difference in this pair of occasions hadn t she been tasting so peculiarly her own possible betrayals What happened was that afterwards on separation she wondered if the matter hadn t mainly been that she herself was so other so taken up with the unspoken the strangest thing of all being still subsequently that when she asked herself how Kate could have failed to feel it she became conscious of being here on the edge of a great darkness She should never know how Kate truly felt about anything such a one as Milly Theale should give her to feel Kate would never and not from ill will nor from duplicity but from a sort of failure of common terms reduce it to such a one s comprehension or put it within her convenience It was as such a one therefore that for three or four days more Milly watched Kate as just such another and it was presently as such a one that she threw herself into their promised visit at last achieved to Chelsea the quarter of the famous Carlyle the field of exercise of his ghost his votaries and the residence of poor Marian so often referred to and actually a somewhat incongruous spirit there With our young woman s first view of poor Marian everything gave way but the sense of how in England apparently the social situation of sisters could be opposed how common ground for a place in the world could quite fail them a state of things sagely perceived to be involved in an hierarchical an aristocratic order Just whereabouts in the order missus Lowder had established her niece was a question not wholly void as yet no doubt of ambiguity though Milly was withal sure Lord Mark could exactly have fixed the point if he would fixing it at the same time for Aunt Maud herself but it was clear missus Condrip was as might have been said in quite another geography She wouldn t have been to be found on the same social map and it was as if her visitors had turned over page after page together before the final relief of their benevolent Here The interval was bridged of course but the bridge verily was needed and the impression left Milly to wonder if in the general connexion it were of bridges or of intervals that the spirit not locally disciplined would find itself most conscious It was as if at home by contrast there were neither neither the difference itself from position to position nor on either side and particularly on one the awfully good manner the conscious sinking of a consciousness that made up for it The conscious sinking at all events and the awfully good manner the difference the bridge the interval the skipped leaves of the social atlas these it was to be confessed had a little for our young lady in default of stouter stuff to work themselves into the light literary legend a mixed wandering echo of Trollope of Thackeray perhaps mostly of Dickens under favour of which her pilgrimage had so much appealed She could relate to Susie later on late the same evening that the legend before she had done with it had run clear that the adored author of The Newcomes in fine had been on the whole the note the picture lacking thus more than she had hoped or rather perhaps showing less than she had feared a certain possibility of Pickwickian outline She explained how she meant by this that missus Condrip hadn t altogether proved another missus Nickleby nor even for she might have proved almost anything from the way poor worried Kate had spoken a widowed and aggravated missus Micawber missus Stringham in the midnight conference intimated rather yearningly that however the event might have turned the side of English life such experiences opened to Milly were just those she herself seemed booked as they were all roundabout her now always saying to miss she had begun to have a little for her fellow observer these moments of fanciful reaction reaction in which she was once more all Susan Shepherd against the high sphere of colder conventions into which her overwhelming connexion with Maud Manningham had rapt her Milly never lost sight for long of the Susan Shepherd side of her and was always there to meet it when it came up and vaguely tenderly impatiently to pat it abounding in the assurance that they would still provide for it They had however to night another matter in hand which proved to be presently on the girl s part in respect to her hour of Chelsea the revelation that missus Condrip taking a few minutes when Kate was away with one of the children in bed upstairs for some small complaint had suddenly without its being in the least led up to broken ground on the subject of mister Densher mentioned him with impatience as a person in love with her sister She wished me if I cared for Kate to know Milly said for it would be quite too dreadful and one might do something Susie wondered Prevent anything coming of it That s easily said Do what Milly had a dim smile I think that what she would like is that I should come a good deal to see HER about it And doesn t she suppose you ve anything else to do The girl had by this time clearly made it out Nothing but to admire and make much of her sister whom she doesn t however herself in the least understand and give up one s time and everything else to it It struck the elder friend that she spoke with an almost unprecedented approach to sharpness as if missus Condrip had been rather indescribably disconcerting Never yet so much as just of late had missus Stringham seen her companion exalted and by the very play of something within into a vague golden air that left irritation below That was the great thing with Milly it was her characteristic poetry or at least it was Susan Shepherd s But she made a point the former continued of my keeping what she says from Kate I m not to mention that she has spoken And why missus Stringham presently asked is mister Densher so dreadful Milly had she thought a delay to answer something that suggested a fuller talk with missus Condrip than she inclined perhaps to report It isn t so much he himself Then the girl spoke a little as for the romance of it one could never tell with her where romance would come in It s the state of his fortunes And is that very bad He has no private means and no prospect of any He has no income and no ability according to missus Condrip to make one He s as poor she calls it as poverty and she says she knows what that is Again missus Stringham considered and it presently produced something But isn t he brilliantly clever Milly had also then an instant that was not quite fruitless I haven t the least idea To which for the time Susie only replied Oh though by the end of a minute she had followed it with a slightly musing I see and that in turn with It s quite what Maud Lowder thinks That he ll never do anything No quite the contrary that he s exceptionally able Oh yes I know Milly had again in reference to what her friend had already told her of this her little tone of a moment before But missus Condrip s own great point is that Aunt Maud herself won t hear of any such person mister Densher she holds that s the way at any rate it was explained to me won t ever be either a public man or a rich man If he were public she d be willing as I understand to help him if he were rich without being anything else she d do her best to swallow him As it is she taboos him In short said missus Stringham as with a private purpose she told you the sister all about it But missus Lowder likes him she added missus Condrip didn t tell me that Well she does all the same my dear extremely Then there it is On which with a drop and one of those sudden slightly sighing surrenders to a vague reflux and a general fatigue that had recently more than once marked themselves for her companion Milly turned away Yet the matter wasn t left so that night between them albeit neither perhaps could afterwards have said which had first come back to it Milly s own nearest approach at least for a little to doing so was to remark that they appeared all every one they saw to think tremendously of money This prompted in Susie a laugh not untender the innocent meaning of which was that it came as a subject for indifference money did easier to some people than to others she made the point in fairness however that you couldn t have told by any too crude transparency of air what place it held for Maud Manningham She did her worldliness with grand proper silences if it mightn t better be put perhaps that she did her detachment with grand occasional pushes However Susie put it in truth she was really in justice to herself thinking of the difference as favourites of fortune between her old friend and her new Aunt Maud sat somehow in the midst of her money founded on it and surrounded by it even if with a masterful high manner about it her manner of looking hard and bright as if it weren t there Milly about hers had no manner at all which was possibly from a point of view a fault she was at any rate far away on the edge of it and you hadn t as might be said in order to get at her nature to traverse by whatever avenue any piece of her property It was clear on the other hand that missus Lowder was keeping her wealth as for purposes imaginations ambitions that would figure as large as honourably unselfish on the day they should take effect She would impose her will but her will would be only that a person or two shouldn t lose a benefit by not submitting if they could be made to submit To Milly as so much younger such far views couldn t be imputed there was nobody she was supposable as interested for It was too soon since she wasn t interested for herself Even the richest woman at her age lacked motive and Milly s motive doubtless had plenty of time to arrive She was meanwhile beautiful simple sublime without it whether missing it and vaguely reaching out for it or not and with it for that matter in the event would really be these things just as much Only then she might very well have like Aunt Maud a manner Such were the connexions at all events in which the colloquy of our two ladies freshly flickered up in which it came round that the elder asked the younger if she had herself in the afternoon named mister Densher as an acquaintance Oh no I said nothing of having seen him I remembered the girl explained missus Lowder s wish But that her friend observed after a moment was for silence to Kate Yes but missus Condrip would immediately have told Kate Why so since she must dislike to talk about him missus Condrip must Milly thought What she would like most is that her sister should be brought to think ill of him and if anything she can tell her will help that But the girl dropped suddenly here as if her companion would see Her companion s interest however was all for what she herself saw You mean she ll immediately speak missus Stringham gathered that this was what Milly meant but it left still a question How will it be against him that you know him Oh how can I say It won t be so much one s knowing him as one s having kept it out of sight Ah said missus Stringham as for comfort YOU haven t kept it out of sight Isn t it much rather Miss Croy herself who has It isn t my acquaintance with him Milly smiled that she has dissimulated She has dissimulated only her own Well then the responsibility s hers Ah but said the girl not perhaps with marked consequence she has a right to do as she likes Then so my dear have you smiled Susan Shepherd Milly looked at her as if she were almost venerably simple but also as if this were what one loved her for We re not quarrelling about it Kate and I YET I only meant missus Stringham explained that I don t see what missus Condrip would gain By her being able to tell Kate Milly thought I only meant that I don t see what I myself should gain But it will have to come out that he knows you both some time Milly scarce assented Do you mean when he comes back He ll find you both here and he can hardly be looked to I take it to cut either of you for the sake of the other This placed the question at last on a basis more distinctly cheerful I might get at him somehow beforehand the girl suggested I might give him what they call here the tip that he s not to know me when we meet Or better still I mightn t be here at all Do you want to run away from him It was oddly enough an idea Milly seemed half to accept I don t know WHAT I want to run away from It dispelled on the spot something to the elder woman s ear in the sad sweet sound of it any ghost of any need of explaining The sense was constant for her that their relation might have been afloat like some island of the south in a great warm sea that represented for every conceivable chance a margin an outer sphere of general emotion and the effect of the occurrence of anything in particular was to make the sea submerge the island the margin flood the text The great wave now for a moment swept over I ll go anywhere else in the world you like But Milly came up through it Dear old Susie how I do work you Oh this is nothing yet No indeed to what it will be You re not and it s vain to pretend said dear old Susie who had been taking her in as sound and strong as I insist on having you Insist insist the more the better But the day I LOOK as sound and strong as that you know Milly went on on that day I shall be just sound and strong enough to take leave of you sweetly for ever That s where one is she continued thus agreeably to embroider when even one s MOST beaux moments aren t such as to qualify so far as appearance goes for anything gayer than a handsome cemetery Since I ve lived all these years as if I were dead I shall die no doubt as if I were alive which will happen to be as you want me So you see she wound up you ll never really know where I am Except indeed when I m gone and then you ll only know where I m not I d die FOR you said Susan Shepherd after a moment Thanks awfully Then stay here for me But we can t be in London for August nor for many of all these next weeks Then we ll go back Susie blenched Back to America No abroad to Switzerland Italy anywhere I mean by your staying here for me Milly pursued your staying with me wherever I may be even though we may neither of us know at the time where it is No she insisted I DON T know where I am and you never will and it doesn t matter and I dare say it s quite true she broke off that everything will have to come out Her friend would have felt of her that she joked about it now hadn t her scale from grave to gay been a thing of such unnameable shades that her contrasts were never sharp She made up for failures of gravity by failures of mirth if she hadn t that is been at times as earnest as might have been liked so she was certain not to be at other times as easy as she would like herself I must face the music It isn t at any rate its coming out she added it s that missus Condrip would put the fact before her to his injury Her companion wondered But how to HIS Why if he pretends to love her And does he only pretend I mean if trusted by her in strange countries he forgets her so far as to make up to other people The amendment however brought Susie in as with gaiety for a comfortable end Did he make up the false creature to YOU No but the question isn t of that It s of what Kate might be made to believe That given the fact of his having evidently more or less followed up his acquaintance with you to say nothing of your obvious weird charm he must have been all ready if you had a little bit led him on Milly neither accepted nor qualified this she only said after a moment and as with a conscious excess of the pensive No I don t think she d quite wish to suggest that I made up to HIM for that I should have had to do so would only bring out his constancy All I mean is she added and now at last as with a supreme impatience that her being able to make him out a little a person who could give cause for jealousy would evidently help her since she s afraid of him to do him in her sister s mind a useful ill turn Susan Shepherd perceived in this explanation such signs of an appetite for motive as would have sat gracefully even on one of her own New England heroines It was seeing round several corners but that was what New England heroines did and it was moreover interesting for the moment to make out how many her young friend had actually undertaken to see round Finally too weren t they braving the deeps They got their amusement where they could Isn t it only she asked rather probable she d see that Kate s knowing him as what s the pretty old word volage Well She hadn t filled out her idea but neither it seemed could Milly Well might but do what that often does by all OUR blessed little laws and arrangements at least excite Kate s own sentiment instead of depressing it The idea was bright yet the girl but beautifully stared Kate s own sentiment Oh she didn t speak of that I don t think she added as if she had been unconsciously giving a wrong impression I don t think missus Condrip imagines SHE S in love It made missus Stringham stare in turn Then what s her fear Well only the fact of mister Densher s possibly himself keeping it up the fear of some final result from THAT Oh said Susie intellectually a little disconcerted she looks far ahead At this however Milly threw off another of her sudden vague sports No it s only we who do Well don t let us be more interested for them than they are for themselves Certainly not the girl promptly assented A certain interest nevertheless remained she appeared to wish to be clear It wasn t of anything on Kate s own part she spoke You mean she thinks her sister distinctly doesn t care for him It was still as if for an instant Milly had to be sure of what she meant but there it presently was If she did care missus Condrip would have told me What Susan Shepherd seemed hereupon for a little to wonder was why then they had been talking so But did you ask her Ah no Oh said Susan Shepherd Milly however easily explained that she wouldn t have asked her for the world Book Fifth Chapter one Lord Mark looked at her to day in particular as if to wring from her a confession that she had originally done him injustice and he was entitled to whatever there might be in it of advantage or merit that his intention really in a manner took effect he cared about something after all sufficiently to make her feel absurdly as if she WERE confessing all the while it was quite the case that neither justice nor injustice was what had been in question between them He had presented himself at the hotel had found her and had found Susan Shepherd at home had been civil to Susan it was just that shade and Susan s fancy had fondly caught it and then had come again and missed them and then had come and found them once more besides letting them easily see that if it hadn t by this time been the end of everything which they could feel in the exhausted air that of the season at its last gasp the places they might have liked to go to were such as they would have had only to mention Their feeling was or at any rate their modest general plea that there was no place they would have liked to go to there was only the sense of finding they liked wherever they were the place to which they had been brought Such was highly the case as to their current consciousness which could be indeed in an equally eminent degree but a matter of course impressions this afternoon having by a happy turn of their wheel been gathered for them into a splendid cluster an offering like an armful of the rarest flowers They were in presence of the offering they had been led up to it and if it had been still their habit to look at each other across distances for increase of unanimity his hand would have been silently named between them as the hand applied to the wheel He had administered the touch that under light analysis made the difference the difference of their not having lost as Susie on the spot and at the hour phrased it again and again both for herself and for such others as the question might concern so beautiful and interesting an experience the difference also in fact of missus Lowder s not having lost it either though it was superficially with missus Lowder they had come and though it was further with that lady that our young woman was directly engaged during the half hour or so of her most agreeably inward response to the scene The great historic house had for Milly beyond terrace and garden as the centre of an almost extravagantly grand Watteau composition a tone as of old gold kept down by the quality of the air summer full flushed but attuned to the general perfect taste Much by her measure for the previous hour appeared in connexion with this revelation of it to have happened to her a quantity expressed in introductions of charming new people in walks through halls of armour of pictures of cabinets of tapestry of tea tables in an assault of reminders that this largeness of style was the sign of APPOINTED felicity The largeness of style was the great containing vessel while everything else the pleasant personal affluence the easy murmurous welcome the honoured age of illustrious host and hostess all at once so distinguished and so plain so public and so shy became but this or that element of the infusion The elements melted together and seasoned the draught the essence of which might have struck the girl as distilled into the small cup of iced coffee she had vaguely accepted from somebody while a fuller flood somehow kept bearing her up all the freshness of response of her young life the freshness of the first and only prime What had perhaps brought on just now a kind of climax was the fact of her appearing to make out through Aunt Maud what was really the matter It couldn t be less than a climax for a poor shaky maiden to find it put to her of a sudden that she herself was the matter for that was positively what on missus Lowder s part it came to Everything was great of course in great pictures and it was doubtless precisely a part of the brilliant life since the brilliant life as one had faintly figured it just WAS humanly led that all impressions within its area partook of its brilliancy still letting that pass it fairly stamped an hour as with the official seal for one to be able to take in so comfortably one s companion s broad blandness You must stay among us you must stay anything else is impossible and ridiculous you don t know yet no doubt you can t but you will soon enough you can stay in ANY position It had been as the murmurous consecration to follow the murmurous welcome and even if it were but part of Aunt Maud s own spiritual ebriety for the dear woman one could see was spiritually keeping the day it served to Milly then and afterwards as a high water mark of the imagination It was to be the end of the short parenthesis which had begun but the other day at Lancaster Gate with Lord Mark s informing her that she was a success the key thus again struck and though no distinct no numbered revelations had crowded in there had as we have seen been plenty of incident for the space and the time There had been thrice as much and all gratuitous and genial if in portions not exactly hitherto THE revelation as three unprepared weeks could have been expected to produce missus Lowder had improvised a rush for them but out of elements as Milly was now a little more freely aware somewhat roughly combined Therefore if at this very instant she had her reasons for thinking of the parenthesis as about to close reasons completely personal she had on behalf of her companion a divination almost as deep The parenthesis would close with this admirable picture but the admirable picture still would show Aunt Maud as not absolutely sure either if she herself were destined to remain in it What she was doing Milly might even not have escaped seeming to see was to talk herself into a sublimer serenity while she ostensibly talked Milly It was fine the girl fully felt the way she did talk HER little as at bottom our young woman needed it or found other persuasions at fault It was in particular during the minutes of her grateful absorption of iced coffee qualified by a sharp doubt of her wisdom that she most had in view Lord Mark s relation to her being there or at least to the question of her being amused at it It wouldn t have taken much by the end of five minutes quite to make her feel that this relation was charming It might once more simply have been that everything anything was charming when one was so justly and completely charmed but frankly she hadn t supposed anything so serenely sociable could settle itself between them as the friendly understanding that was at present somehow in the air They were many of them together near the marquee that had been erected on a stretch of sward as a temple of refreshment and that happened to have the property which was all to the good of making Milly think of a durbar her iced coffee had been a consequence of this connexion through which further the bright company scattered about fell thoroughly into place Certain of its members might have represented the contingent of native princes familiar but scarce the less grandly gregarious term and Lord Mark would have done for one of these even though for choice he but presented himself as a supervisory friend of the family The Lancaster Gate family he clearly intended in which he included its American recruits and included above all Kate Croy a young person blessedly easy to take care of She knew people and people knew her and she was the handsomest thing there this last a declaration made by Milly in a sort of soft midsummer madness a straight skylark flight of charity to Aunt Maud Kate had for her new friend s eyes the extraordinary and attaching property of appearing at a given moment to show as a beautiful stranger to cut her connexions and lose her identity letting the imagination for the time make what it would of them make her merely a person striking from afar more and more pleasing as one watched but who was above all a subject for curiosity Nothing could have given her as a party to a relation a greater freshness than this sense which sprang up at its own hours of one s being as curious about her as if one hadn t known her It had sprung up we have gathered as soon as Milly had seen her after hearing from missus Stringham of her knowledge of Merton Densher she had LOOKED then other and as Milly knew the real critical mind would call it more objective and our young woman had foreseen it of her on the spot that she would often look so again It was exactly what she was doing this afternoon and Milly who had amusements of thought that were like the secrecies of a little girl playing with dolls when conventionally too big could almost settle to the game of what one would suppose her how one would place her if one didn t know her She became thus intermittently a figure conditioned only by the great facts of aspect a figure to be waited for named and fitted This was doubtless but a way of feeling that it was of her essence to be peculiarly what the occasion whatever it might be demanded when its demand was highest There were probably ways enough on these lines for such a consciousness another of them would be for instance to say that she was made for great social uses Milly wasn t wholly sure she herself knew what great social uses might be unless as a good example to exert just that sort of glamour in just that sort of frame were one of them she would have fallen back on knowing sufficiently that they existed at all events for her friend It imputed a primness all round to be reduced but to saying by way of a translation of one s amusement that she was always so RIGHT since that too often was what the insupportables themselves were yet it was in overflow to Aunt Maud what she had to content herself withal save for the lame enhancement of saying she was lovely It served despite everything the purpose strengthened the bond that for the time held the two ladies together distilled in short its drop of rose colour for missus Lowder s own view That was really the view Milly had for most of the rest of the occasion to give herself to immediately taking in but it didn t prevent the continued play of those swift cross lights odd beguilements of the mind at which we have already glanced missus Lowder herself found it enough simply to reply in respect to Kate that she was indeed a luxury to take about the world she expressed no more surprise than that at her rightness to day Didn t it by this time sufficiently shine out that it was precisely AS the very luxury she was proving that she had from far back been appraised and waited for Crude elation however might be kept at bay and the circumstance none the less made clear that they were all swimming together in the blue It came back to Lord Mark again as he seemed slowly to pass and repass and conveniently to linger before them he was personally the note of the blue like a suspended skein of silk within reach of the broiderer s hand Aunt Maud s free moving shuttle took a length of him at rhythmic intervals and one of the accessory truths that flickered across to Milly was that he ever so consentingly knew he was being worked in This was almost like an understanding with her at missus Lowder s expense which she would have none of she wouldn t for the world have had him make any such point as that he wouldn t have launched them at Matcham or whatever it was he HAD done only for Aunt Maud s beaux yeux What he had done it would have been guessable was something he had for some time been desired in vain to do and what they were all now profiting by was a change comparatively sudden the cessation of hope delayed What had caused the cessation easily showed itself as none of Milly s business and she was luckily for that matter in no real danger of hearing from him directly that her individual weight had been felt in the scale Why then indeed was it an effect of his diffused but subdued participation that he might absolutely have been saying to her Yes let the dear woman take her own tone Since she s here she may stay he might have been adding for whatever she can make of it But you and I are different Milly knew SHE was different in truth his own difference was his own affair but also she knew that after all even at their distinctest Lord Mark s tips in this line would be tacit He practically placed her it came round again to that under no obligation whatever It was a matter of equal ease moreover her letting missus Lowder take a tone She might have taken twenty they would have spoiled nothing You must stay on with us you CAN you know in any position you like any any ANY my dear child and her emphasis went deep You must make your home with us and it s really open to you to make the most beautiful one in the world You mustn t be under a mistake under any of any sort and you must let us all think for you a little take care of you and watch over you Above all you must help me with Kate and you must stay a little FOR her nothing for a long time has happened to me so good as that you and she should have become friends It s beautiful it s great it s everything What makes it perfect is that it should have come about through our dear delightful Susie restored to me after so many years by such a miracle No that s more charming to me than even your hitting it off with Kate God has been good to one positively for I couldn t at my age have made a new friend undertaken I mean out of whole cloth the real thing It s like changing one s bankers after fifty one doesn t do that That s why Susie has been kept for me as you seem to keep people in your wonderful country in lavender and pink paper coming back at last as straight as out of a fairy tale and with you as an attendant fairy Milly hereupon replied appreciatively that such a description of herself made her feel as if pink paper were her dress and lavender its trimming but Aunt Maud wasn t to be deterred by a weak joke from keeping it up The young person under her protection could feel besides that she kept it up in perfect sincerity She was somehow at this hour a very happy woman and a part of her happiness might precisely have been that her affections and her views were moving as never before in concert Unquestionably she loved Susie but she also loved Kate and loved Lord Mark loved their funny old host and hostess loved every one within range down to the very servant who came to receive Milly s empty ice plate down for that matter to Milly herself who was while she talked really conscious of the enveloping flap of a protective mantle a shelter with the weight of an Eastern carpet An Eastern carpet for wishing purposes of one s own was a thing to be on rather than under still however if the girl should fail of breath it wouldn t be she could feel by missus Lowder s fault One of the last things she was afterwards to recall of this was Aunt Maud s going on to say that she and Kate must stand together because together they could do anything It was for Kate of course she was essentially planning but the plan enlarged and uplifted now somehow required Milly s prosperity too for its full operation just as Milly s prosperity at the same time involved Kate s It was nebulous yet it was slightly confused but it was comprehensive and genial and it made our young woman understand things Kate had said of her aunt s possibilities as well as characterisations that had fallen from Susan Shepherd One of the most frequent on the lips of the latter had been that dear Maud was a grand natural force Book Fifth Chapter two A prime reason we must add why sundry impressions were not to be fully present to the girl till later on was that they yielded at this stage with an effect of sharp supersession to a detached quarter of an hour her only one with Lord Mark Have you seen the picture in the house the beautiful one that s so like you he was asking that as he stood before her having come up at last with his smooth intimation that any wire he had pulled and yet wanted not to remind her of wasn t quite a reason for his having no joy at all I ve been through rooms and I ve seen pictures But if I m like anything so beautiful as most of them seemed to me It needed in short for Milly some evidence which he only wanted to supply She was the image of the wonderful Bronzino which she must have a look at on every ground He had thus called her off and led her away the more easily that the house within was above all what had already drawn round her its mystic circle Their progress meanwhile was not of the straightest it was an advance without haste through innumerable natural pauses and soft concussions determined for the most part by the appearance before them of ladies and gentlemen singly in couples in clusters who brought them to a stand with an inveterate I say Mark What they said she never quite made out it was their all so domestically knowing him and his knowing them that mainly struck her while her impression for the rest was but of fellow strollers more vaguely afloat than themselves supernumeraries mostly a little battered whether as jaunty males or as ostensibly elegant women They might have been moving a good deal by a momentum that had begun far back but they were still brave and personable still warranted for continuance as long again and they gave her in especial collectively a sense of pleasant voices pleasanter than those of actors of friendly empty words and kind lingering eyes that took somehow pardonable liberties The lingering eyes looked her over the lingering eyes were what went in almost confessed simplicity with the pointless I say Mark and what was really most flagrant of all was that as a pleasant matter of course if she didn t mind he seemed to suggest their letting people poor dear things have the benefit of her The odd part was that he made her herself believe for amusement in the benefit measured by him in mere manner for wonderful of a truth was as a means of expression his slightness of emphasis that her present good nature conferred It was as she could easily see a mild common carnival of good nature a mass of London people together of sorts and sorts but who mainly knew each other and who in their way did no doubt confess to curiosity It had gone round that she was there questions about her would be passing the easiest thing was to run the gauntlet with HIM just as the easiest thing was in fact to trust him generally Couldn t she know for herself passively how little harm they meant her to that extent that it made no difference whether or not he introduced them The strangest thing of all for Milly was perhaps the uplifted assurance and indifference with which she could simply give back the particular bland stare that appeared in such cases to mark civilisation at its highest It was so little her fault this oddity of what had gone round about her that to accept it without question might be as good a way as another of feeling life It was inevitable to supply the probable description that of the awfully rich young American who was so queer to behold but nice by all accounts to know and she had really but one instant of speculation as to fables or fantasies perchance originally launched She asked herself once only if Susie could inconceivably have been blatant about her for the question on the spot was really blown away for ever She knew in fact on the spot and with sharpness just why she had elected Susan Shepherd she had had from the first hour the conviction of her being precisely the person in the world least possibly a trumpeter So it wasn t their fault it wasn t their fault and anything might happen that would and everything now again melted together and kind eyes were always kind eyes if it were never to be worse than that She got with her companion into the house they brushed beneficently past all their accidents The Bronzino was it appeared deep within and the long afternoon light lingered for them on patches of old colour and waylaid them as they went in nooks and opening vistas It was all the while for Milly as if Lord Mark had really had something other than this spoken pretext in view as if there were something he wanted to say to her and were only consciously yet not awkwardly just delicately hanging fire At the same time it was as if the thing had practically been said by the moment they came in sight of the picture since what it appeared to amount to was Do let a fellow who isn t a fool take care of you a little The thing somehow with the aid of the Bronzino was done it hadn t seemed to matter to her before if he were a fool or no but now just where they were she liked his not being and it was all moreover none the worse for coming back to something of the same sound as missus Lowder s so recent reminder She too wished to take care of her and wasn t it a peu pres what all the people with the kind eyes were wishing Once more things melted together the beauty and the history and the facility and the splendid midsummer glow it was a sort of magnificent maximum the pink dawn of an apotheosis coming so curiously soon What in fact befell was that as she afterwards made out it was Lord Mark who said nothing in particular it was she herself who said all She couldn t help that it came and the reason it came was that she found herself for the first moment looking at the mysterious portrait through tears Perhaps it was her tears that made it just then so strange and fair as wonderful as he had said the face of a young woman all splendidly drawn down to the hands and splendidly dressed a face almost livid in hue yet handsome in sadness and crowned with a mass of hair rolled back and high that must before fading with time have had a family resemblance to her own The lady in question at all events with her slightly Michael angelesque squareness her eyes of other days her full lips her long neck her recorded jewels her brocaded and wasted reds was a very great personage only unaccompanied by a joy And she was dead dead dead Milly recognised her exactly in words that had nothing to do with her I shall never be better than this He smiled for her at the portrait Than she You d scarce need to be better for surely that s well enough But you ARE one feels as it happens better because splendid as she is one doubts if she was good He hadn t understood She was before the picture but she had turned to him and she didn t care if for the minute he noticed her tears It was probably as good a moment as she should ever have with him It was perhaps as good a moment as she should have with any one or have in any connexion whatever I mean that everything this afternoon has been too beautiful and that perhaps everything together will never be so right again I m very glad therefore you ve been a part of it Though he still didn t understand her he was as nice as if he had he didn t ask for insistence and that was just a part of his looking after her He simply protected her now from herself and there was a world of practice in it Oh we must talk about these things Ah they had already done that she knew as much as she ever would and she was shaking her head at her pale sister the next moment with a world on her side of slowness I wish I could see the resemblance Of course her complexion s green she laughed but mine s several shades greener It s down to the very hands said Lord Mark Her hands are large Milly went on but mine are larger Mine are huge Oh you go her all round one better which is just what I said But you re a pair You must surely catch it he added as if it were important to his character as a serious man not to appear to have invented his plea I don t know one never knows one s self It s a funny fancy and I don t imagine it would have occurred I see it HAS occurred he had already taken her up She had her back as she faced the picture to one of the doors of the room which was open and on her turning as he spoke she saw that they were in the presence of three other persons also as appeared interested enquirers Kate Croy was one of these Lord Mark had just become aware of her and she all arrested had immediately seen and made the best of it that she was far from being first in the field She had brought a lady and a gentleman to whom she wished to show what Lord Mark was showing Milly and he took her straightway as a re enforcement Kate herself had spoken however before he had had time to tell her so YOU had noticed too she smiled at him without looking at Milly Then I m not original which one always hopes one has been But the likeness is so great And now she looked at Milly for whom again it was all round indeed kind kind eyes Yes there you are my dear if you want to know And you re superb She took now but a glance at the picture though it was enough to make her question to her friends not too straight Isn t she superb I brought Miss Theale Lord Mark explained to the latter quite off my own bat I wanted Lady Aldershaw Kate continued to Milly to see for herself Les grands esprits se rencontrent laughed her attendant gentleman a high but slightly stooping shambling and wavering person who represented urbanity by the liberal aid of certain prominent front teeth and whom Milly vaguely took for some sort of great man Lady Aldershaw meanwhile looked at Milly quite as if Milly had been the Bronzino and the Bronzino only Milly Superb superb Of course I had noticed you It IS wonderful she went on with her back to the picture but with some other eagerness which Milly felt gathering felt directing her motions now It was enough they were introduced and she was saying I wonder if you could give us the pleasure of coming She wasn t fresh for she wasn t young even though she denied at every pore that she was old but she was vivid and much bejewelled for the midsummer daylight and she was all in the palest pinks and blues She didn t think at this pass that she could come anywhere Milly didn t and she already knew that somehow Lord Mark was saving her from the question He had interposed taking the words out of the lady s mouth and not caring at all if the lady minded That was clearly the right way to treat her at least for him as she had only dropped smiling and then turned away with him She had been dealt with it would have done an enemy good The gentleman still stood a little helpless addressing himself to the intention of urbanity as if it were a large loud whistle he had been sighing sympathy in his way while the lady made her overture and Milly had in this light soon arrived at their identity They were Lord and Lady Aldershaw and the wife was the clever one A minute or two later the situation had changed and she knew it afterwards to have been by the subtle operation of Kate She was herself saying that she was afraid she must go now if Susie could be found but she was sitting down on the nearest seat to say it The prospect through opened doors stretched before her into other rooms down the vista of which Lord Mark was strolling with Lady Aldershaw who close to him and much intent seemed to show from behind as peculiarly expert Lord Aldershaw for his part had been left in the middle of the room while Kate with her back to him was standing before her with much sweetness of manner The sweetness was all for HER she had the sense of the poor gentleman s having somehow been handled as Lord Mark had handled his wife He dangled there he shambled a little then he bethought himself of the Bronzino before which with his eye glass he hovered It drew from him an odd vague sound not wholly distinct from a grunt and a Humph most remarkable which lighted Kate s face with amusement The next moment he had creaked away over polished floors after the others and Milly was feeling as if SHE had been rude But Lord Aldershaw was in every way a detail and Kate was saying to her that she hoped she wasn t ill Thus it was that aloft there in the great gilded historic chamber and the presence of the pale personage on the wall whose eyes all the while seemed engaged with her own she found herself suddenly sunk in something quite intimate and humble and to which these grandeurs were strange enough witnesses It had come up in the form in which she had had to accept it all suddenly and nothing about it at the same time was more marked than that she had in a manner plunged into it to escape from something else Something else from her first vision of her friend s appearance three minutes before had been present to her even through the call made by the others on her attention something that was perversely THERE she was more and more uncomfortably finding at least for the first moments and by some spring of its own with every renewal of their meeting Is it the way she looks to HIM she asked herself the perversity being how she kept in remembrance that Kate was known to him It wasn t a fault in Kate nor in him assuredly and she had a horror being generous and tender of treating either of them as if it had been To Densher himself she couldn t make it up he was too far away but her secondary impulse was to make it up to Kate She did so now with a strange soft energy the impulse immediately acting Will you render me to morrow a great service Any service dear child in the world But it s a secret one nobody must know I must be wicked and false about it Then I m your woman Kate smiled for that s the kind of thing I love DO let us do something bad You re impossibly without sin you know Milly s eyes on this remained a little with their companion s Ah I shan t perhaps come up to your idea It s only to deceive Susan Shepherd Oh said Kate as if this were indeed mild But thoroughly as thoroughly as I can And for cheating Kate asked my powers will contribute Well I ll do my best for you In accordance with which it was presently settled between them that Milly should have the aid and comfort of her presence for a visit to Sir Luke Strett Kate had needed a minute for enlightenment and it was quite grand for her comrade that this name should have said nothing to her To Milly herself it had for some days been secretly saying much The personage in question was as she explained the greatest of medical lights if she had got hold as she believed and she had used to this end the wisdom of the serpent of the right the special man She had written to him three days before and he had named her an hour eleven twenty only it had come to her on the eve that she couldn t go alone Her maid on the other hand wasn t good enough and Susie was too good Kate had listened above all with high indulgence And I m betwixt and between happy thought Too good for what Milly thought Why to be worried if it s nothing And to be still more worried I mean before she need be if it isn t Kate fixed her with deep eyes What in the world is the matter with you It had inevitably a sound of impatience as if it had been a challenge really to produce something so that Milly felt her for the moment only as a much older person standing above her a little doubting the imagined ailments suspecting the easy complaints of ignorant youth It somewhat checked her further that the matter with her was what exactly as yet she wanted knowledge about and she immediately declared for conciliation that if she were merely fanciful Kate would see her put to shame Kate vividly uttered in return the hope that since she could come out and be so charming could so universally dazzle and interest she wasn t all the while in distress or in anxiety didn t believe herself to be in any degree seriously menaced Well I want to make out to make out was all that this consistently produced To which Kate made clear answer Ah then let us by all means I thought Milly said you d like to help me But I must ask you please for the promise of absolute silence And how if you ARE ill can your friends remain in ignorance Well if I am it must of course finally come out But I can go for a long time Milly spoke with her eyes again on her painted sister s almost as if under their suggestion She still sat there before Kate yet not without a light in her face That will be one of my advantages I think I could die without its being noticed You re an extraordinary young woman her friend visibly held by her declared at last What a remarkable time to talk of such things Well we won t talk precisely Milly got herself together again I only wanted to make sure of you Here in the midst of But Kate could only sigh for wonder almost visibly too for pity It made a moment during which her companion waited on her word partly as if from a yearning shy but deep to have her case put to her just as Kate was struck by it partly as if the hint of pity were already giving a sense to her whimsical shot with Lord Mark at missus Lowder s first dinner Exactly this the handsome girl s compassionate manner her friendly descent from her own strength was what she had then foretold She took Kate up as if positively for the deeper taste of it Here in the midst of what Of everything There s nothing you can t have There s nothing you can t do So missus Lowder tells me It just kept Kate s eyes fixed as possibly for more of that then however without waiting she went on We all adore you You re wonderful you dear things Milly laughed No it s YOU And Kate seemed struck with the real interest of it In three weeks Milly kept it up Never were people on such terms All the more reason she added that I shouldn t needlessly torment you But me what becomes of ME said Kate Well you Milly thought if there s anything to bear you ll bear it But I WON T bear it said Kate Croy Oh yes you will all the same You ll pity me awfully but you ll help me very much And I absolutely trust you So there we are There they were then since Kate had so to take it but there Milly felt she herself in particular was for it was just the point at which she had wished to arrive She had wanted to prove to herself that she didn t horribly blame her friend for any reserve and what better proof could there be than this quite special confidence If she desired to show Kate that she really believed Kate liked her how could she show it more than by asking her help Book Fifth Chapter three What it really came to on the morrow this first time the time Kate went with her was that the great man had a little to excuse himself had by a rare accident for he kept his consulting hours in general rigorously free but ten minutes to give her ten mere minutes which he yet placed at her service in a manner that she admired still more than she could meet it so crystal clean the great empty cup of attention that he set between them on the table He was presently to jump into his carriage but he promptly made the point that he must see her again see her within a day or two and he named for her at once another hour easing her off beautifully too even then in respect to her possibly failing of justice to her errand The minutes affected her in fact as ebbing more swiftly than her little army of items could muster and they would probably have gone without her doing much more than secure another hearing hadn t it been for her sense at the last that she had gained above all an impression The impression all the sharp growth of the final few moments was neither more nor less than that she might make of a sudden in quite another world another straight friend and a friend who would moreover be wonderfully the most appointed the most thoroughly adjusted of the whole collection inasmuch as he would somehow wear the character scientifically ponderably proveably not just loosely and sociably Literally furthermore it wouldn t really depend on herself Sir Luke Strett s friendship in the least perhaps what made her most stammer and pant was its thus queerly coming over her that she might find she had interested him even beyond her intention find she was in fact launched in some current that would lose itself in the sea of science At the same time that she struggled however she also surrendered there was a moment at which she almost dropped the form of stating of explaining and threw herself without violence only with a supreme pointless quaver that had turned the next instant to an intensity of interrogative stillness upon his general good will His large settled face though firm was not as she had thought at first hard he looked in the oddest manner to her fancy half like a general and half like a bishop and she was soon sure that within some such handsome range what it would show her would be what was good what was best for her She had established in other words in this time saving way a relation with it and the relation was the special trophy that for the hour she bore off It was like an absolute possession a new resource altogether something done up in the softest silk and tucked away under the arm of memory She hadn t had it when she went in and she had it when she came out she had it there under her cloak but dissimulated invisibly carried when smiling smiling she again faced Kate Croy That young lady had of course awaited her in another room where as the great man was to absent himself no one else was in attendance and she rose for her with such a face of sympathy as might have graced the vestibule of a dentist Is it out she seemed to ask as if it had been a question of a tooth and Milly indeed kept her in no suspense at all He s a dear I m to come again But what does he say Milly was almost gay That I m not to worry about anything in the world and that if I ll be a good girl and do exactly what he tells me he ll take care of me for ever and ever Kate wondered as if things scarce fitted But does he allow then that you re ill I don t know what he allows and I don t care I SHALL know and whatever it is it will be enough He knows all about me and I like it I don t hate it a bit Still however Kate stared But could he in so few minutes ask you enough He asked me scarcely anything he doesn t need to do anything so stupid Milly said He can tell He knows she repeated and when I go back for he ll have thought me over a little it will be all right Kate after a moment made the best of this Then when are we to come It just pulled her friend up for even while they talked at least it was one of the reasons she stood there suddenly irrelevantly in the light of her OTHER identity the identity she would have for mister Densher This was always from one instant to another an incalculable light which though it might go off faster than it came on necessarily disturbed It sprang with a perversity all its own from the fact that with the lapse of hours and days the chances themselves that made for his being named continued so oddly to fail There were twenty there were fifty but none of them turned up This in particular was of course not a juncture at which the least of them would naturally be present but it would make none the less Milly saw another day practically all stamped with avoidance She saw in a quick glimmer and with it all Kate s unconsciousness and then she shook off the obsession But it had lasted long enough to qualify her response No she had shown Kate how she trusted her and that for loyalty would somehow do Oh dear thing now that the ice is broken I shan t trouble YOU again You ll come alone Without a scruple Only I shall ask you please for your absolute discretion still Outside at a distance from the door on the wide pavement of the great contiguous square they had to wait again while their carriage which Milly had kept completed a further turn of exercise engaged in by the coachman for reasons of his own The footman was there and had indicated that he was making the circuit so Kate went on while they stood But don t you ask a good deal darling in proportion to what you give This pulled Milly up still shorter so short in fact that she yielded as soon as she had taken it in But she continued to smile I see Then you CAN tell I don t want to tell said Kate I ll be as silent as the tomb if I can only have the truth from you All I want is that you shouldn t keep from me how you find out that you really are Well then I won t ever But you see for yourself Milly went on how I really am I m satisfied I m happy Kate looked at her long I believe you like it The way things turn out for you Milly met her look now without a thought of anything but the spoken She had ceased to be mister Densher s image she stood for nothing but herself and she was none the less fine Still still what had passed was a fair bargain and it would do Of course I like it I feel I can t otherwise describe it as if I had been on my knees to the priest I ve confessed and I ve been absolved It has been lifted off Kate s eyes never quitted her He must have liked YOU Oh doctors Milly said But I hope she added he didn t like me too much Then as if to escape a little from her friend s deeper sounding or as impatient for the carriage not yet in sight her eyes turning away took in the great stale square As its staleness however was but that of London fairly fatigued the late hot London with its dance all danced and its story all told the air seemed a thing of blurred pictures and mixed echoes and an impression met the sense an impression that broke the next moment through the girl s tightened lips Oh it s a beautiful big world and every one yes every one It presently brought her back to Kate and she hoped she didn t actually look as much as if she were crying as she must have looked to Lord Mark among the portraits at Matcham Kate at all events understood Every one wants to be so nice So nice said the grateful Milly Oh Kate laughed we ll pull you through And won t you now bring missus Stringham But Milly after an instant was again clear about that Not till I ve seen him once more She was to have found this preference two days later abundantly justified and yet when in prompt accordance with what had passed between them she reappeared before her distinguished friend that character having for him in the interval built itself up still higher the first thing he asked her was whether she had been accompanied She told him on this straightway everything completely free at present from her first embarrassment disposed even as she felt she might become to undue volubility and conscious moreover of no alarm from his thus perhaps wishing she had not come alone It was exactly as if in the forty eight hours that had passed her acquaintance with him had somehow increased and his own knowledge in particular received mysterious additions They had been together before scarce ten minutes but the relation the one the ten minutes had so beautifully created was there to take straight up and this not on his own part from mere professional heartiness mere bedside manner which she would have disliked much rather from a quiet pleasant air in him of having positively asked about her asked here and asked there and found out Of course he couldn t in the least have asked or have wanted to there was no source of information to his hand and he had really needed none he had found out simply by his genius and found out she meant literally everything Now she knew not only that she didn t dislike this the state of being found out about but that on the contrary it was truly what she had come for and that for the time at least it would give her something firm to stand on She struck herself as aware aware as she had never been of really not having had from the beginning anything firm It would be strange for the firmness to come after all from her learning in these agreeable conditions that she was in some way doomed but above all it would prove how little she had hitherto had to hold her up If she was now to be held up by the mere process since that was perhaps on the cards of being let down this would only testify in turn to her queer little history THAT sense of loosely rattling had been no process at all and it was ridiculously true that her thus sitting there to see her life put into the scales represented her first approach to the taste of orderly living Such was Milly s romantic version that her life especially by the fact of this second interview WAS put into the scales and just the best part of the relation established might have been for that matter that the great grave charming man knew had known at once that it was romantic and in that measure allowed for it Her only doubt her only fear was whether he perhaps wouldn t even take advantage of her being a little romantic to treat her as romantic altogether This doubtless was her danger with him but she should see and dangers in general meanwhile dropped and dropped The very place at the end of a few minutes the commodious handsome room far back in the fine old house soundless from position somewhat sallow with years of celebrity somewhat sombre even at midsummer the very place put on for her a look of custom and use squared itself solidly round her as with promises and certainties She had come forth to see the world and this then was to be the world s light the rich dusk of a London back these the world s walls those the world s curtains and carpet She should be intimate with the great bronze clock and mantel ornaments conspicuously presented in gratitude and long ago she should be as one of the circle of eminent contemporaries photographed engraved signatured and in particular framed and glazed who made up the rest of the decoration and made up as well so much of the human comfort and while she thought of all the clean truths unfringed unfingered that the listening stillness strained into pauses and waits would again and again for years have kept distinct she also wondered what SHE would eventually decide upon to present in gratitude She would give something better at least than the brawny Victorian bronzes This was precisely an instance of what she felt he knew of her before he had done with her that she was secretly romancing at that rate in the midst of so much else that was more urgent all over the place So much for her secrets with him none of which really required to be phrased It would have been thoroughly a secret for her from any one else that without a dear lady she had picked up just before coming over she wouldn t have a decently near connexion of any sort for such an appeal as she was making to put forward no one in the least as it were to produce for respectability But HIS seeing it she didn t mind a scrap and not a scrap either his knowing how she had left the dear lady in the dark She had come alone putting her friend off with a fraud giving a pretext of shops of a whim of she didn t know what the amusement of being for once in the streets by herself The streets by herself were new to her she had always had in them a companion or a maid and he was never to believe moreover that she couldn t take full in the face anything he might have to say He was softly amused at her account of her courage though he yet showed it somehow without soothing her too grossly Still he did want to know whom she had Hadn t there been a lady with her on Wednesday Yes a different one Not the one who s travelling with me I ve told HER Distinctly he was amused and it added to his air the greatest charm of all of giving her lots of time You ve told her what Well said Milly that I visit you in secret And how many persons will she tell Oh she s devoted Not one Well if she s devoted doesn t that make another friend for you It didn t take much computation but she nevertheless had to think a moment conscious as she was that he distinctly WOULD want to fill out his notion of her even a little as it were to warm the air for her That however and better early than late he must accept as of no use and she herself felt for an instant quite a competent certainty on the subject of any such warming The air for Milly Theale was from the very nature of the case destined never to rid itself of a considerable chill This she could tell him with authority if she could tell him nothing else and she seemed to see now in short that it would importantly simplify Yes it makes another but they all together wouldn t make well I don t know what to call it but the difference I mean when one IS really alone I ve never seen anything like the kindness She pulled up a minute while he waited waited again as if with his reasons for letting her for almost making her talk What she herself wanted was not for the third time to cry as it were in public She HAD never seen anything like the kindness and she wished to do it justice but she knew what she was about and justice was not wronged by her being able presently to stick to her point Only one s situation is what it is It s ME it concerns The rest is delightful and useless Nobody can really help That s why I m by myself to day I WANT to be in spite of Miss Croy who came with me last If you can help so much the better and also of course if one can a little one s self Except for that you and me doing our best I like you to see me just as I am Yes I like it and I don t exaggerate Shouldn t one at the start show the worst so that anything after that may be better It wouldn t make any real difference it WON T make any anything that may happen won t to any one Therefore I feel myself this way with you just as I am and if you do in the least care to know it quite positively bears me up She put it as to his caring to know because his manner seemed to give her all her chance and the impression was there for her to take It was strange and deep for her this impression and she did accordingly take it straight home It showed him showed him in spite of himself as allowing somewhere far within things comparatively remote things in fact quite as she would have said outside delicately to weigh with him showed him as interested on her behalf in other questions beside the question of what was the matter with her She accepted such an interest as regular in the highest type of scientific mind his own BEING the highest magnificently because otherwise obviously it wouldn t be there but she could at the same time take it as a direct source of light upon herself even though that might present her a little as pretending to equal him Wanting to know more about a patient than how a patient was constructed or deranged couldn t be even on the part of the greatest of doctors anything but some form or other of the desire to let the patient down easily When that was the case the reason in turn could only be too manifestly pity and when pity held up its telltale face like a head on a pike in a French revolution bobbing before a window what was the inference but that the patient was bad He might say what he would now she would always have seen the head at the window and in fact from this moment she only wanted him to say what he would He might say it too with the greater ease to himself as there wasn t one of her divinations that AS her own he would in any way put himself out for Finally if he was making her talk she WAS talking and what it could at any rate come to for him was that she wasn t afraid If he wanted to do the dearest thing in the world for her he would show her he believed she wasn t which undertaking of hers not to have misled him was what she counted at the moment as her presumptuous little hint to him that she was as good as himself It put forward the bold idea that he could really BE misled and there actually passed between them for some seconds a sign a sign of the eyes only that they knew together where they were This made in their brown old temple of truth its momentary flicker then what followed it was that he had her all the same in his pocket and the whole thing wound up for that consummation with his kind dim smile Such kindness was wonderful with such dimness but brightness that even of sharp steel was of course for the other side of the business and it would all come in for her to one tune or another Do you mean he asked that you ve no relations at all not a parent not a sister not even a cousin nor an aunt She shook her head as with the easy habit of an interviewed heroine or a freak of nature at a show Nobody whatever but the last thing she had come for was to be dreary about it I m a survivor a survivor of a general wreck You see she added how that s to be taken into account that every one else HAS gone When I was ten years old there were with my father and my mother six of us I m all that s left But they died she went on to be fair all round of different things Still there it is And as I told you before I m American Not that I mean that makes me worse However you ll probably know what it makes me Yes he even showed amusement for it I know perfectly what it makes you It makes you to begin with a capital case She sighed though gratefully as if again before the social scene Ah there you are Oh no there we aren t at all There I am only but as much as you like I ve no end of American friends there THEY are if you please and it s a fact that you couldn t very well be in a better place than in their company It puts you with plenty of others and that isn t pure solitude Then he pursued I m sure you ve an excellent spirit but don t try to bear more things than you need Which after an instant he further explained Hard things have come to you in youth but you mustn t think life will be for you all hard things You ve the right to be happy You must make up your mind to it You must accept any form in which happiness may come Oh I ll accept any whatever she almost gaily returned And it seems to me for that matter that I m accepting a new one every day Now THIS she smiled This is very well so far as it goes You can depend on me the great man said for unlimited interest But I m only after all one element in fifty We must gather in plenty of others Don t mind who knows Knows I mean that you and I are friends Ah you do want to see some one she broke out You want to get at some one who cares for me With which however as he simply met this spontaneity in a manner to show that he had often had it from young persons of her race and that he was familiar even with the possibilities of THEIR familiarity she felt her freedom rendered vain by his silence and she immediately tried to think of the most reasonable thing she could say This would be precisely on the subject of that freedom which she now quickly spoke of as complete That s of course by itself a great boon so please don t think I don t know it I can do exactly what I like anything in all the wide world I haven t a creature to ask there s not a finger to stop me I can shake about till I m black and blue That perhaps isn t ALL joy but lots of people I know would like to try it He had appeared about to put a question but then had let her go on which she promptly did for she understood him the next moment as having thus taken it from her that her means were as great as might be She had simply given it to him so and this was all that would ever pass between them on the odious head Yet she couldn t help also knowing that an important effect for his judgement or at least for his amusement which was his feeling since marvellously he did have feeling was produced by it All her little pieces had now then fallen together for him like the morsels of coloured glass that used to make combinations under the hand in the depths of one of the polygonal peepshows of childhood So that if it s a question of my doing anything under the sun that will help You ll DO anything under the sun Good He took that beautifully ever so pleasantly for what it was worth but time was needed the minutes or so were needed on the spot to deal even provisionally with the substantive question It was convenient in its degree that there was nothing she wouldn t do but it seemed also highly and agreeably vague that she should have to do anything They thus appeared to be taking her together for the moment and almost for sociability as prepared to proceed to gratuitous extremities the upshot of which was in turn that after much interrogation auscultation exploration much noting of his own sequences and neglecting of hers had duly kept up the vagueness they might have struck themselves or may at least strike us as coming back from an undeterred but useless voyage to the North Pole Milly was ready under orders for the North Pole which fact was doubtless what made a blinding anticlimax of her friend s actual abstention from orders No she heard him again distinctly repeat it I don t want you for the present to do anything at all anything that is but obey a small prescription or two that will be made clear to you and let me within a few days come to see you at home It was at first heavenly Then you ll see missus Stringham But she didn t mind a bit now Well I shan t be afraid of missus Stringham And he said it once more as she asked once more Absolutely not I send you nowhere England s all right anywhere that s pleasant convenient decent will be all right You say you can do exactly as you like Oblige me therefore by being so good as to do it There s only one thing you ought of course now as soon as I ve seen you again to get out of London Milly thought May I then go back to the Continent By all means back to the Continent Do go back to the Continent Then how will you keep seeing me But perhaps she quickly added you won t want to keep seeing me He had it all ready he had really everything all ready I shall follow you up though if you mean that I don t want you to keep seeing ME Well she asked It was only just here that he struck her the least bit as stumbling Well see all you can That s what it comes to Worry about nothing You HAVE at least no worries It s a great rare chance She had got up for she had had from him both that he would send her something and would advise her promptly of the date of his coming to her by which she was virtually dismissed Yet for herself one or two things kept her May I come back to England too Rather Whenever you like But always when you do come immediately let me know Ah said Milly it won t be a great going to and fro Then if you ll stay with us so much the better It touched her the way he controlled his impatience of her and the fact itself affected her as so precious that she yielded to the wish to get more from it So you don t think I m out of my mind Perhaps that IS he smiled all that s the matter She looked at him longer No that s too good Shall I at any rate suffer Not a bit And yet then live My dear young lady said her distinguished friend isn t to live exactly what I m trying to persuade you to take the trouble to do Book Fifth Chapter four She had gone out with these last words so in her ears that when once she was well away back this time in the great square alone it was as if some instant application of them had opened out there before her It was positively that effect an excitement that carried her on she went forward into space under the sense of an impulse received an impulse simple and direct easy above all to act upon She was borne up for the hour and now she knew why she had wanted to come by herself No one in the world could have sufficiently entered into her state no tie would have been close enough to enable a companion to walk beside her without some disparity She literally felt in this first flush that her only company must be the human race at large present all round her but inspiringly impersonal and that her only field must be then and there the grey immensity of London Grey immensity had somehow of a sudden become her element grey immensity was what her distinguished friend had for the moment furnished her world with and what the question of living as he put it to her living by option by volition inevitably took on for its immediate face She went straight before her without weakness altogether with strength and still as she went she was more glad to be alone for nobody not Kate Croy not Susan Shepherd either would have wished to rush with her as she rushed She had asked him at the last whether being on foot she might go home so or elsewhere and he had replied as if almost amused again at her extravagance You re active luckily by nature it s beautiful therefore rejoice in it BE active without folly for you re not foolish be as active as you can and as you like That had been in fact the final push as well as the touch that most made a mixture of her consciousness a strange mixture that tasted at one and the same time of what she had lost and what had been given her It was wonderful to her while she took her random course that these quantities felt so equal she had been treated hadn t she as if it were in her power to live and yet one wasn t treated so was one unless it had come up quite as much that one might die The beauty of the bloom had gone from the small old sense of safety that was distinct she had left it behind her there for ever But the beauty of the idea of a great adventure a big dim experiment or struggle in which she might more responsibly than ever before take a hand had been offered her instead It was as if she had had to pluck off her breast to throw away some friendly ornament a familiar flower a little old jewel that was part of her daily dress and to take up and shoulder as a substitute some queer defensive weapon a musket a spear a battle axe conducive possibly in a higher degree to a striking appearance but demanding all the effort of the military posture She felt this instrument for that matter already on her back so that she proceeded now in very truth after the fashion of a soldier on a march proceeded as if for her initiation the first charge had been sounded She passed along unknown streets over dusty littery ways between long rows of fronts not enhanced by the August light she felt good for miles and only wanted to get lost there were moments at corners where she stopped and chose her direction in which she quite lived up to his injunction to rejoice that she was active It was like a new pleasure to have so new a reason she would affirm without delay her option her volition taking this personal possession of what surrounded her was a fair affirmation to start with and she really didn t care if she made it at the cost of alarms for Susie Susie would wonder in due course whatever as they said at the hotel had become of her yet this would be nothing either probably to wonderments still in store Wonderments in truth Milly felt even now attended her steps it was quite as if she saw in people s eyes the reflexion of her appearance and pace She found herself moving at times in regions visibly not haunted by odd looking girls from New York duskily draped sable plumed all but incongruously shod and gazing about them with extravagance she might from the curiosity she clearly excited in by ways in side streets peopled with grimy children and costermongers carts which she hoped were slums literally have had her musket on her shoulder have announced herself as freshly on the war path But for the fear of overdoing the character she would here and there have begun conversation have asked her way in spite of the fact that as this would help the requirements of adventure her way was exactly what she wanted not to know The difficulty was that she at last accidentally found it she had come out she presently saw at the Regent s Park round which on two or three occasions with Kate Croy her public chariot had solemnly rolled But she went into it further now this was the real thing the real thing was to be quite away from the pompous roads well within the centre and on the stretches of shabby grass Here were benches and smutty sheep here were idle lads at games of ball with their cries mild in the thick air here were wanderers anxious and tired like herself here doubtless were hundreds of others just in the same box Their box their great common anxiety what was it in this grim breathing space but the practical question of life They could live if they would that is like herself they had been told so she saw them all about her on seats digesting the information recognising it again as something in a slightly different shape familiar enough the blessed old truth that they would live if they could All she thus shared with them made her wish to sit in their company which she so far did that she looked for a bench that was empty eschewing a still emptier chair that she saw hard by and for which she would have paid with superiority a fee The last scrap of superiority had soon enough left her if only because she before long knew herself for more tired than she had proposed This and the charm after a fashion of the situation in itself made her linger and rest there was an accepted spell in the sense that nobody in the world knew where she was It was the first time in her life that this had happened somebody everybody appeared to have known before at every instant of it where she was so that she was now suddenly able to put it to herself that that hadn t been a life This present kind of thing therefore might be which was where precisely her distinguished friend seemed to be wishing her to come out He wished her also it was true not to make as she was perhaps doing now too much of her isolation at the same time however as he clearly desired to deny her no decent source of interest He was interested she arrived at that in her appealing to as many sources as possible and it fairly filtered into her as she sat and sat that he was essentially propping her up Had she been doing it herself she would have called it bolstering the bolstering that was simply for the weak and she thought and thought as she put together the proofs that it was as one of the weak he was treating her It was of course as one of the weak that she had gone to him but oh with how sneaking a hope that he might pronounce her as to all indispensables a veritable young lioness What indeed she was really confronted with was the consciousness that he hadn t after all pronounced her anything she nursed herself into the sense that he had beautifully got out of it Did he think however she wondered that he could keep out of it to the end though as she weighed the question she yet felt it a little unjust Milly weighed in this extraordinary hour questions numerous and strange but she had happily before she moved worked round to a simplification Stranger than anything for instance was the effect of its rolling over her that when one considered it he might perhaps have got out by one door but to come in with a beautiful beneficent dishonesty by another It kept her more intensely motionless there that what he might fundamentally be up to was some disguised intention of standing by her as a friend Wasn t that what women always said they wanted to do when they deprecated the addresses of gentlemen they couldn t more intimately go on with It was what they no doubt sincerely fancied they could make of men of whom they couldn t make husbands And she didn t even reason that it was by a similar law the expedient of doctors in general for the invalids of whom they couldn t make patients she was somehow so sufficiently aware that HER doctor was however fatuous it might sound exceptionally moved This was the damning little fact if she could talk of damnation that she could believe herself to have caught him in the act of irrelevantly liking her She hadn t gone to him to be liked she had gone to him to be judged and he was quite a great enough man to be in the habit as a rule of observing the difference She could like HIM as she distinctly did that was another matter all the more that her doing so was now so obviously for herself compatible with judgement Yet it would have been all portentously mixed had not as we say a final and merciful wave chilling rather but washing clear come to her assistance It came of a sudden when all other thought was spent She had been asking herself why if her case was grave and she knew what she meant by that he should have talked to her at all about what she might with futility do or why on the other hand if it were light he should attach an importance to the office of friendship She had him with her little lonely acuteness as acuteness went during the dog days in the Regent s Park in a cleft stick she either mattered and then she was ill or she didn t matter and then she was well enough Now he was acting as they said at home as if she did matter until he should prove the contrary It was too evident that a person at his high pressure must keep his inconsistencies which were probably his highest amusements only for the very greatest occasions Her prevision in fine of just where she should catch him furnished the light of that judgement in which we describe her as daring to indulge And the judgement it was that made her sensation simple He HAD distinguished her that was the chill He hadn t known how could he that she was devilishly subtle subtle exactly in the manner of the suspected the suspicious the condemned He in fact confessed to it in his way as to an interest in her combinations her funny race her funny losses her funny gains her funny freedom and no doubt above all her funny manners funny like those of Americans at their best without being vulgar legitimating amiability and helping to pass it off In his appreciation of these redundancies he dressed out for her the compassion he so signally permitted himself to waste but its operation for herself was as directly divesting denuding exposing It reduced her to her ultimate state which was that of a poor girl with her rent to pay for example staring before her in a great city Milly had her rent to pay her rent for her future everything else but how to meet it fell away from her in pieces in tatters This was the sensation the great man had doubtless not purposed Well she must go home like the poor girl and see There might after all be ways the poor girl too would be thinking It came back for that matter perhaps to views already presented She looked about her again on her feet at her scattered melancholy comrades some of them so melancholy as to be down on their stomachs in the grass turned away ignoring burrowing she saw once more with them those two faces of the question between which there was so little to choose for inspiration It was perhaps superficially more striking that one could live if one would but it was more appealing insinuating irresistible in short that one would live if one could She found after this for the day or two more amusement than she had ventured to count on in the fact if it were not a mere fancy of deceiving Susie and she presently felt that what made the difference was the mere fancy as this WAS one of a countermove to her great man His taking on himself should he do so to get at her companion made her suddenly she held irresponsible made any notion of her own all right for her though indeed at the very moment she invited herself to enjoy this impunity she became aware of new matter for surprise or at least for speculation Her idea would rather have been that missus Stringham would have looked at her hard her sketch of the grounds of her independent long excursion showing she could feel as almost cynically superficial Yet the dear woman so failed in the event to avail herself of any right of criticism that it was sensibly tempting to wonder for an hour if Kate Croy had been playing perfectly fair Hadn t she possibly from motives of the highest benevolence promptings of the finest anxiety just given poor Susie what she would have called the straight tip It must immediately be mentioned however that quite apart from a remembrance of the distinctness of Kate s promise Milly the next thing found her explanation in a truth that had the merit of being general If Susie at this crisis suspiciously spared her it was really that Susie was always suspiciously sparing her yet occasionally too with portentous and exceptional mercies The girl was conscious of how she dropped at times into inscrutable impenetrable deferences attitudes that though without at all intending it made a difference for familiarity for the ease of intimacy It was as if she recalled herself to manners to the law of court etiquette which last note above all helped our young woman to a just appreciation It was definite for her even if not quite solid that to treat her as a princess was a positive need of her companion s mind wherefore she couldn t help it if this lady had her transcendent view of the way the class in question were treated Susan had read history had read Gibbon and Froude and Saint Simon she had high lights as to the special allowances made for the class and since she saw them when young as effete and overtutored inevitably ironic and infinitely refined one must take it for amusing if she inclined to an indulgence verily Byzantine If one COULD only be Byzantine wasn t THAT what she insidiously led one on to sigh Milly tried to oblige her for it really placed Susan herself so handsomely to be Byzantine now The great ladies of that race it would be somewhere in Gibbon were apparently not questioned about their mysteries But oh poor Milly and hers Susan at all events proved scarce more inquisitive than if she had been a mosaic at Ravenna Susan was a porcelain monument to the odd moral that consideration might like cynicism have abysses Besides the Puritan finally disencumbered What starved generations wasn t missus Stringham in fancy going to make up for Kate Croy came straight to the hotel came that evening shortly before dinner specifically and publicly moreover in a hansom that driven apparently very fast pulled up beneath their windows almost with the clatter of an accident a smash Milly alone as happened in the great garnished void of their sitting room where a little really like a caged Byzantine she had been pacing through the queer long drawn almost sinister delay of night an effect she yet liked Milly at the sound one of the French windows standing open passed out to the balcony that overhung with pretensions the general entrance and so was in time for the look that Kate alighting paying her cabman happened to send up to the front The visitor moreover had a shilling back to wait for during which Milly from the balcony looked down at her and a mute exchange but with smiles and nods took place between them on what had occurred in the morning It was what Kate had called for and the tone was thus almost by accident determined for Milly before her friend came up What was also however determined for her was again yet irrepressibly again that the image presented to her the splendid young woman who looked so particularly handsome in impatience with the fine freedom of her signal was the peculiar property of somebody else s vision that this fine freedom in short was the fine freedom she showed mister Densher Just so was how she looked to him and just so was how Milly was held by her held as by the strange sense of seeing through that distant person s eyes It lasted as usual the strange sense but fifty seconds yet in so lasting it produced an effect It produced in fact more than one and we take them in their order The first was that it struck our young woman as absurd to say that a girl s looking so to a man could possibly be without connexions and the second was that by the time Kate had got into the room Milly was in mental possession of the main connexion it must have for herself She produced this commodity on the spot produced it in straight response to Kate s frank Well what The enquiry bore of course with Kate s eagerness on the issue of the morning s scene the great man s latest wisdom and it doubtless affected Milly a little as the cheerful demand for news is apt to affect troubled spirits when news is not in one of the neater forms prepared for delivery She couldn t have said what it was exactly that on the instant determined her the nearest description of it would perhaps have been as the more vivid impression of all her friend took for granted The contrast between this free quantity and the maze of possibilities through which for hours she had herself been picking her way put on in short for the moment a grossness that even friendly forms scarce lightened it helped forward in fact the revelation to herself that she absolutely had nothing to tell Besides which certainly there was something else an influence at the particular juncture still more obscure Kate had lost on the way upstairs the look THE look that made her young hostess so subtly think and one of the signs of which was that she never kept it for many moments at once yet she stood there none the less so in her bloom and in her strength so completely again the handsome girl beyond all others the handsome girl for whom Milly had at first gratefully taken her that to meet her now with the note of the plaintive would amount somehow to a surrender to a confession SHE would never in her life be ill the greatest doctor would keep her at the worst the fewest minutes and it was as if she had asked just WITH all this practical impeccability for all that was most mortal in her friend These things for Milly inwardly danced their dance but the vibration produced and the dust kicked up had lasted less than our account of them Almost before she knew it she was answering and answering beautifully with no consciousness of fraud only as with a sudden flare of the famous will power she had heard about read about and which was what her medical adviser had mainly thrown her back on Oh it s all right He s lovely Kate was splendid and it would have been clear for Milly now had the further presumption been needed that she had said no word to missus Stringham You mean you ve been absurd Absurd It was a simple word to say but the consequence of it for our young woman was that she felt it as soon as spoken to have done something for her safety And Kate really hung on her lips There s nothing at all the matter Nothing to worry about I shall need a little watching but I shan t have to do anything dreadful or even in the least inconvenient I can do in fact as I like It was wonderful for Milly how just to put it so made all its pieces fall at present quite properly into their places Yet even before the full effect came Kate had seized kissed blessed her My love you re too sweet It s too dear But it s as I was sure Then she grasped the full beauty You can do as you like Quite Isn t it charming Ah but catch you Kate triumphed with gaiety NOT doing And what SHALL you do For the moment simply enjoy it Enjoy Milly was completely luminous having got out of my scrape Learning you mean so easily that you ARE well It was as if Kate had but too conveniently put the words into her mouth Learning I mean so easily that I AM well Only no one s of course well enough to stay in London now He can t Kate went on want this of you Mercy no I m to knock about I m to go to places But not beastly climates Engadines Rivieras boredoms No just as I say where I prefer I m to go in for pleasure Oh the duck Kate with her own shades of familiarity abounded But what kind of pleasure The highest Milly smiled Her friend met it as nobly Which IS the highest Well it s just our chance to find out You must help me What have I wanted to do but help you Kate asked from the moment I first laid eyes on you Yet with this too Kate had her wonder I like your talking though about that What help with your luck all round do you need Book Fifth Chapter five Milly indeed at last couldn t say so that she had really for the time brought it along to the point so oddly marked for her by her visitor s arrival the truth that she was enviably strong She carried this out from that evening for each hour still left her and the more easily perhaps that the hours were now narrowly numbered All she actually waited for was Sir Luke Strett s promised visit as to her proceeding on which however her mind was quite made up Since he wanted to get at Susie he should have the freest access and then perhaps he would see how he liked it What was between THEM they might settle as between them and any pressure it should lift from her own spirit they were at liberty to convert to their use If the dear man wished to fire Susan Shepherd with a still higher ideal he would only after all at the worst have Susan on his hands If devotion in a word was what it would come up for the interested pair to organise she was herself ready to consume it as the dressed and served dish He had talked to her of her appetite her account of which she felt must have been vague But for devotion she could now see this appetite would be of the best Gross greedy ravenous these were doubtless the proper names for her she was at all events resigned in advance to the machinations of sympathy The day that followed her lonely excursion was to be the last but two or three of their stay in London and the evening of that day practically ranked for them as in the matter of outside relations the last of all People were by this time quite scattered and many of those who had so liberally manifested in calls in cards in evident sincerity about visits later on over the land had positively passed in music out of sight whether as members these latter more especially of missus Lowder s immediate circle or as members of Lord Mark s our friends being by this time able to make the distinction The general pitch had thus decidedly dropped and the occasions still to be dealt with were special and few One of these for Milly announced itself as the doctor s call already mentioned as to which she had now had a note from him the single other of importance was their appointed leave taking for the shortest separation in respect to missus Lowder and Kate The aunt and the niece were to dine with them alone intimately and easily as easily as should be consistent with the question of their afterwards going on together to some absurdly belated party at which they had had it from Aunt Maud that they would do well to show Sir Luke was to make his appearance on the morrow of this and in respect to that complication Milly had already her plan The night was at all events hot and stale and it was late enough by the time the four ladies had been gathered in for their small session at the hotel where the windows were still open to the high balconies and the flames of the candles behind the pink shades disposed as for the vigil of watchers were motionless in the air in which the season lay dead What was presently settled among them was that Milly who betrayed on this occasion a preference more marked than usual shouldn t hold herself obliged to climb that evening the social stair however it might stretch to meet her and that missus Lowder and missus Stringham facing the ordeal together Kate Croy should remain with her and await their return It was a pleasure to Milly ever to send Susan Shepherd forth she saw her go with complacency liked as it were to put people off with her and noted with satisfaction when she so moved to the carriage the further denudation a markedly ebbing tide of her little benevolent back If it wasn t quite Aunt Maud s ideal moreover to take out the new American girl s funny friend instead of the new American girl herself nothing could better indicate the range of that lady s merit than the spirit in which as at the present hour for instance she made the best of the minor advantage And she did this with a broad cheerful absence of illusion she did it confessing even as much to poor Susie because frankly she WAS good natured When missus Stringham observed that her own light was too abjectly borrowed and that it was as a link alone fortunately not missing that she was valued Aunt Maud concurred to the extent of the remark Well my dear you re better than nothing To night furthermore it came up for Milly that Aunt Maud had something particular in mind missus Stringham before adjourning with her had gone off for some shawl or other accessory and Kate as if a little impatient for their withdrawal had wandered out to the balcony where she hovered for the time unseen though with scarce more to look at than the dim London stars and the cruder glow up the street on a corner of a small public house in front of which a fagged cab horse was thrown into relief missus Lowder made use of the moment Milly felt as soon as she had spoken that what she was doing was somehow for use Dear Susan tells me that you saw in America mister Densher whom I ve never till now as you may have noticed asked you about But do you mind at last in connexion with him doing something for me She had lowered her fine voice to a depth though speaking with all her rich glibness and Milly after a small sharpness of surprise was already guessing the sense of her appeal Will you name him in any way you like to HER and Aunt Maud gave a nod at the window so that you may perhaps find out whether he s back Ever so many things for Milly fell into line at this it was a wonder she afterwards thought that she could be conscious of so many at once She smiled hard however for them all But I don t know that it s important to me to find out The array of things was further swollen however even as she said this by its striking her as too much to say She therefore tried as quickly to say less Except you mean of course that it s important to YOU She fancied Aunt Maud was looking at her almost as hard as she was herself smiling and that gave her another impulse You know I never HAVE yet named him to her so that if I should break out now Well missus Lowder waited Why she may wonder what I ve been making a mystery of She hasn t mentioned him you know Milly went on herself No her friend a little heavily weighed it she wouldn t So it s she you see then who has made the mystery Yes Milly but wanted to see only there was so much There has been of course no particular reason Yet that indeed was neither here nor there Do you think she asked he IS back It will be about his time I gather and rather a comfort to me definitely to know Then can t you ask her yourself Ah we never speak of him It helped Milly for the moment to the convenience of a puzzled pause Do you mean he s an acquaintance of whom you disapprove for her Aunt Maud as well just hung fire I disapprove of HER for the poor young man She doesn t care for him And HE cares so much Too much too much And my fear is said missus Lowder that he privately besets her She keeps it to herself but I don t want her worried Neither in truth she both generously and confidentially concluded do I want HIM Milly showed all her own effort to meet the case But what can I do You can find out where they are If I myself try missus Lowder explained I shall appear to treat them as if I supposed them deceiving me And you don t You don t Milly mused for her suppose them deceiving you Well said Aunt Maud whose fine onyx eyes failed to blink even though Milly s questions might have been taken as drawing her rather further than she had originally meant to go well Kate s thoroughly aware of my views for her and that I take her being with me at present in the way she IS with me if you know what I mean for a loyal assent to them Therefore as my views don t happen to provide a place at all for mister Densher much in a manner as I like him therefore in short she had been prompted to this step though she completed her sense but sketchily with the rattle of her large fan It assisted them for the moment perhaps however that Milly was able to pick out of her sense what might serve as the clearest part of it You do like him then Oh dear yes Don t you Milly waited for the question was somehow as the sudden point of something sharp on a nerve that winced She just caught her breath but she had ground for joy afterwards she felt in not really having failed to choose with quickness sufficient out of fifteen possible answers the one that would best serve her She was then almost proud as well that she had cheerfully smiled I did three times in New York So came and went in these simple words the speech that was to figure for her later on that night as the one she had ever uttered that cost her most She was to lie awake for the gladness of not having taken any line so really inferior as the denial of a happy impression For missus Lowder also moreover her simple words were the right ones they were at any rate that lady s laugh showed in the natural note of the racy You dear American thing But people may be very good and yet not good for what one wants Yes the girl assented even I suppose when what one wants is something very good Oh my child it would take too long just now to tell you all I want I want everything at once and together and ever so much for you too you know But you ve seen us Aunt Maud continued you ll have made out Ah said Milly I DON T make out for again it came that way in rushes she felt an obscurity in things Why if our friend here doesn t like him Should I conceive her interested in keeping things from me missus Lowder did justice to the question My dear how can you ask Put yourself in her place She meets me but on HER terms Proud young women are proud young women And proud old ones are well what I am Fond of you as we both are you can help us Milly tried to be inspired Does it come back then to my asking her straight At this however finally Aunt Maud threw her up Oh if you ve so many reasons not I ve not so many Milly smiled but I ve one If I break out so suddenly on my knowing him what will she make of my not having spoken before missus Lowder looked blank at it Why should you care what she makes You may have only been decently discreet Ah I HAVE been the girl made haste to say Besides her friend went on I suggested to you through Susan your line Yes that reason s a reason for ME And for ME missus Lowder insisted She s not therefore so stupid as not to do justice to grounds so marked You can tell her perfectly that I had asked you to say nothing And may I tell her that you ve asked me now to speak missus Lowder might well have thought yet oddly this pulled her up You can t do it without Milly was almost ashamed to be raising so many difficulties I ll do what I can if you ll kindly tell me one thing more She faltered a little it was so prying but she brought it out Will he have been writing to her It s exactly my dear what I should like to know missus Lowder was at last impatient Push in for yourself and I dare say she ll tell you Even now all the same Milly had not quite fallen back It will be pushing in she continued to smile for YOU She allowed her companion however no time to take this up The point will be that if he HAS been writing she may have answered But what point you subtle thing is that It isn t subtle it seems to me but quite simple Milly said that if she has answered she has very possibly spoken of me Very certainly indeed But what difference will it make The girl had a moment at this of thinking it natural missus Lowder herself should so fail of subtlety It will make the difference that he ll have written her in reply that he knows me And that in turn our young woman explained will give an oddity to my own silence How so if she s perfectly aware of having given you no opening The only oddity Aunt Maud lucidly professed is for yourself It s in HER not having spoken Ah there we are said Milly And she had uttered it evidently in a tone that struck her friend Then it HAS troubled you But the enquiry had only to be made to bring the rare colour with fine inconsequence to her face Not really the least little bit And quickly feeling the need to abound in this sense she was on the point to cut short of declaring that she cared after all no scrap how much she obliged Only she felt at this instant too the intervention of still other things missus Lowder was in the first place already beforehand already affected as by the sudden vision of her having herself pushed too far Milly could never judge from her face of her uppermost motive it was so little in its hard smooth sheen that kind of human countenance She looked hard when she spoke fair the only thing was that when she spoke hard she didn t likewise look soft Something none the less had arisen in her now a full appreciable tide entering by the rupture of some bar She announced that if what she had asked was to prove in the least a bore her young friend was not to dream of it making her young friend at the same time by the change in her tone dream on the spot more profusely She spoke with a belated light Milly could apprehend she could always apprehend from pity and the result of that perception for the girl was singular it proved to her as quickly that Kate keeping her secret had been straight with her From Kate distinctly then as to why she was to be pitied Aunt Maud knew nothing and was thereby simply putting in evidence the fine side of her own character This fine side was that she could almost at any hour by a kindled preference or a diverted energy glow for another interest than her own She exclaimed as well at this moment that Milly must have been thinking round the case much more than she had supposed and this remark could affect the girl as quickly and as sharply as any other form of the charge of weakness It was what every one if she didn t look out would soon be saying There s something the matter with you What one was therefore one s self concerned immediately to establish was that there was nothing at all I shall like to help you I shall like so far as that goes to help Kate herself she made such haste as she could to declare her eyes wandering meanwhile across the width of the room to that dusk of the balcony in which their companion perhaps a little unaccountably lingered She suggested hereby her impatience to begin she almost overtly wondered at the length of the opportunity this friend was giving them referring it however so far as words went to the other friend and breaking off with an amused How tremendously Susie must be beautifying It only marked Aunt Maud none the less as too preoccupied for her allusion The onyx eyes were fixed upon her with a polished pressure that must signify some enriched benevolence Let it go my dear We shall after all soon enough see If he HAS come back we shall certainly see Milly after a moment replied for he ll probably feel that he can t quite civilly not come to see me Then THERE she remarked we shall be It wouldn t then you see come through Kate at all it would come through him Except she wound up with a smile that he won t find me She had the most extraordinary sense of interesting her guest in spite of herself more than she wanted it was as if her doom so floated her on that she couldn t stop by very much the same trick it had played her with her doctor Shall you run away from him She neglected the question wanting only now to get off Then she went on you ll deal with Kate directly Shall you run away from HER missus Lowder profoundly enquired while they became aware of Susie s return through the room opening out behind them in which they had dined This affected Milly as giving her but an instant and suddenly with it everything she felt in the connexion rose to her lips for a question that even as she put it she knew she was failing to keep colourless Is it your own belief that he IS with her Aunt Maud took it in took in that is everything of the tone that she just wanted her not to and the result for some seconds was but to make their eyes meet in silence missus Stringham had rejoined them and was asking if Kate had gone an enquiry at once answered by this young lady s reappearance They saw her again in the open window where looking at them she had paused producing thus on Aunt Maud s part almost too impressive a Hush missus Lowder indeed without loss of time smothered any danger in a sweeping retreat with Susie but Milly s words to her just uttered about dealing with her niece directly struck our young woman as already recoiling on herself Directness however evaded would be fully for HER nothing in fact would ever have been for her so direct as the evasion Kate had remained in the window very handsome and upright the outer dark framing in a highly favourable way her summery simplicities and lightnesses of dress Milly had given the relation of space no real fear she had heard their talk only she hovered there as with conscious eyes and some added advantage Then indeed with small delay her friend sufficiently saw The conscious eyes the added advantage were but those she had now always at command those proper to the person Milly knew as known to Merton Densher It was for several seconds again as if the TOTAL of her identity had been that of the person known to him a determination having for result another sharpness of its own Kate had positively but to be there just as she was to tell her he had come back It seemed to pass between them in fine without a word that he was in London that he was perhaps only round the corner and surely therefore no dealing of Milly s with her would yet have been so direct Book Fifth Chapter six It was doubtless because this queer form of directness had in itself for the hour seemed so sufficient that Milly was afterwards aware of having really all the while during the strange indescribable session before the return of their companions done nothing to intensify it If she was most aware only afterwards under the long and discurtained ordeal of the morrow s dawn that was because she had really till their evening s end came ceased after a little to miss anything from their ostensible comfort What was behind showed but in gleams and glimpses what was in front never at all confessed to not holding the stage Three minutes hadn t passed before Milly quite knew she should have done nothing Aunt Maud had just asked her She knew it moreover by much the same light that had acted for her with that lady and with Sir Luke Strett It pressed upon her then and there that she was still in a current determined through her indifference timidity bravery generosity she scarce could say which by others that not she but the current acted and that somebody else always was the keeper of the lock or the dam Kate for example had but to open the flood gate the current moved in its mass the current as it had been of her doing as Kate wanted What somehow in the most extraordinary way in the world HAD Kate wanted but to be of a sudden more interesting than she had ever been Milly for their evening then quite held her breath with the appreciation of it If she hadn t been sure her companion would have had nothing from her moments with missus Lowder to go by she would almost have seen the admirable creature cutting in to anticipate a danger This fantasy indeed while they sat together dropped after a little even if only because other fantasies multiplied and clustered making fairly for our young woman the buoyant medium in which her friend talked and moved They sat together I say but Kate moved as much as she talked she figured there restless and charming just perhaps a shade perfunctory repeatedly quitting her place taking slowly to and fro in the trailing folds of her light dress the length of the room almost avowedly performing for the pleasure of her hostess missus Lowder had said to Milly at Matcham that she and her niece as allies could practically conquer the world but though it was a speech about which there had even then been a vague grand glamour the girl read into it at present more of an approach to a meaning Kate for that matter by herself could conquer anything and SHE Milly Theale was probably concerned with the world only as the small scrap of it that most impinged on her and that was therefore first to be dealt with On this basis of being dealt with she would doubtless herself do her share of the conquering she would have something to supply Kate something to take each of them thus to that tune something for squaring with Aunt Maud s ideal This in short was what it came to now that the occasion in the quiet late lamplight had the quality of a rough rehearsal of the possible big drama Milly knew herself dealt with handsomely completely she surrendered to the knowledge for so it was she felt that she supplied her helpful force And what Kate had to take Kate took as freely and to all appearance as gratefully accepting afresh with each of her long slow walks the relation between them so established and consecrating her companion s surrender simply by the interest she gave it The interest to Milly herself we naturally mean the interest to Kate Milly felt as probably inferior It easily and largely came for their present talk for the quick flight of the hour before the breach of the spell it all came when considered from the circumstance not in the least abnormal that the handsome girl was in extraordinary form Milly remembered her having said that she was at her best late at night remembered it by its having with its fine assurance made her wonder when SHE was at her best and how happy people must be who had such a fixed time She had no time at all she was never at her best unless indeed it were exactly as now in listening watching admiring collapsing If Kate moreover quite mercilessly had never been so good the beauty and the marvel of it was that she had never really been so frank being a person of such a calibre as Milly would have said that even while dealing with you and thereby as it were picking her steps she could let herself go could in irony in confidence in extravagance tell you things she had never told before That was the impression that she was telling things and quite conceivably for her own relief as well almost as if the errors of vision the mistakes of proportion the residuary innocence of spirit still to be remedied on the part of her auditor had their moments of proving too much for her nerves She went at them just now these sources of irritation with an amused energy that it would have been open to Milly to regard as cynical and that was nevertheless called for as to this the other was distinct by the way that in certain connexions the American mind broke down It seemed at least the American mind as sitting there thrilled and dazzled in Milly not to understand English society without a separate confrontation with ALL the cases It couldn t proceed by there was some technical term she lacked until Milly suggested both analogy and induction and then differently instinct none of which were right it had to be led up and introduced to each aspect of the monster enabled to walk all round it whether for the consequent exaggerated ecstasy or for the still more as appeared to this critic disproportionate shock It might the monster Kate conceded loom large for those born amid forms less developed and therefore no doubt less amusing it might on some sides be a strange and dreadful monster calculated to devour the unwary to abase the proud to scandalise the good but if one had to live with it one must not to be for ever sitting up learn how which was virtually in short to night what the handsome girl showed herself as teaching She gave away publicly in this process Lancaster Gate and everything it contained she gave away hand over hand Milly s thrill continued to note Aunt Maud and Aunt Maud s glories and Aunt Maud s complacencies she gave herself away most of all and it was naturally what most contributed to her candour She didn t speak to her friend once more in Aunt Maud s strain of how they could scale the skies she spoke by her bright perverse preference on this occasion of the need in the first place of being neither stupid nor vulgar It might have been a lesson for our young American in the art of seeing things as they were a lesson so various and so sustained that the pupil had as we have shown but receptively to gape The odd thing furthermore was that it could serve its purpose while explicitly disavowing every personal bias It wasn t that she disliked Aunt Maud who was everything she had on other occasions declared but the dear woman ineffaceably stamped by inscrutable nature and a dreadful art wasn t how COULD she be what she wasn t She wasn t any one She wasn t anything She wasn t anywhere Milly mustn t think it one couldn t as a good friend let her Those hours at Matcham were inesperees were pure manna from heaven or if not wholly that perhaps with humbugging old Lord Mark as a backer were vain as a ground for hopes and calculations Lord Mark was very well but he wasn t THE cleverest creature in England and even if he had been he still wouldn t have been the most obliging He weighed it out in ounces and indeed each of the pair was really waiting for what the other would put down She has put down YOU said Milly attached to the subject still and I think what you mean is that on the counter she still keeps hold of you Lest Kate took it up he should suddenly grab me and run Oh as he isn t ready to run he s much less ready naturally to grab I AM you re so far right as that on the counter when I m not in the shop window in and out of which I m thus conveniently commercially whisked the essence all of it of my position and the price as properly of my aunt s protection Lord Mark was substantially what she had begun with as soon as they were alone the impression was even yet with Milly of her having sounded his name having imposed it as a topic in direct opposition to the other name that missus Lowder had left in the air and that all her own look as we have seen kept there at first for her companion The immediate strange effect had been that of her consciously needing as it were an alibi which successfully she so found She had worked it to the end ridden it to and fro across the course marked for Milly by Aunt Maud and now she had quite so to speak broken it in The bore is that if she wants him so much wants him heaven forgive her for ME he has put us all out since your arrival by wanting somebody else I don t mean somebody else than you Milly threw off the charm sufficiently to shake her head Then I haven t made out who it is If I m any part of his alternative he had better stop where he is Truly truly always always Milly tried to insist with an equal gaiety Would you like me to swear Kate appeared for a moment though that was doubtless but gaiety too to think Haven t we been swearing enough You have perhaps but I haven t and I ought to give you the equivalent At any rate there it is Truly truly as you say always always So I m not in the way Thanks said Kate but that doesn t help me Oh it s as simplifying for HIM that I speak of it The difficulty really is that he s a person with so many ideas that it s particularly hard to simplify for him That s exactly of course what Aunt Maud has been trying He won t Kate firmly continued make up his mind about me Well Milly smiled give him time Her friend met it in perfection One s DOING that one IS But one remains all the same but one of his ideas There s no harm in that Milly returned if you come out in the end as the best of them What s a man she pursued especially an ambitious one without a variety of ideas No doubt The more the merrier And Kate looked at her grandly One can but hope to come out and do nothing to prevent it All of which made for the impression fantastic or not of the alibi The splendour the grandeur were for Milly the bold ironic spirit behind it so interesting too in itself What further was not less interesting was the fact as our young woman noted it that Kate confined her point to the difficulties so far as SHE was concerned raised only by Lord Mark She referred now to none that her own taste might present which circumstance again played its little part She was doing what she liked in respect to another person but she was in no way committed to the other person and her moreover talking of Lord Mark as not young and not true were only the signs of her clear self consciousness were all in the line of her slightly hard but scarce the less graceful extravagance She didn t wish to show too much her consent to be arranged for but that was a different thing from not wishing sufficiently to give it There was something on it all as well that Milly still found occasion to say If your aunt has been as you tell me put out by me I feel she has remained remarkably kind Oh but she has whatever might have happened in that respect plenty of use for you You put her in my dear more than you put her out You don t half see it but she has clutched your petticoat You can do anything you can do I mean lots that WE can t You re an outsider independent and standing by yourself you re not hideously relative to tiers and tiers of others And Kate facing in that direction went further and further wound up while Milly gaped with extraordinary words We re of no use to you it s decent to tell you You d be of use to us but that s a different matter My honest advice to you would be she went indeed all lengths to drop us while you can It would be funny if you didn t soon see how awfully better you can do We ve not really done for you the least thing worth speaking of nothing you mightn t easily have had in some other way Therefore you re under no obligation You won t want us next year we shall only continue to want YOU But that s no reason for you and you mustn t pay too dreadfully for poor missus Stringham s having let you in She has the best conscience in the world she s enchanted with what she has done but you shouldn t take your people from HER It has been quite awful to see you do it Milly tried to be amused so as not it was too absurd to be fairly frightened Strange enough indeed if not natural enough that late at night thus in a mere mercenary house with Susie away a want of confidence should possess her She recalled with all the rest of it the next day piecing things together in the dawn that she had felt herself alone with a creature who paced like a panther That was a violent image but it made her a little less ashamed of having been scared For all her scare none the less she had now the sense to find words And yet without Susie I shouldn t have had YOU It had been at this point however that Kate flickered highest Oh you may very well loathe me yet Really at last thus it had been too much as with her own least feeble flare after a wondering watch Milly had shown She hadn t cared she had too much wanted to know and though a small solemnity of remonstrance a sombre strain had broken into her tone it was to figure as her nearest approach to serving missus Lowder Why do you say such things to me This unexpectedly had acted by a sudden turn of Kate s attitude as a happy speech She had risen as she spoke and Kate had stopped before her shining at her instantly with a softer brightness Poor Milly hereby enjoyed one of her views of how people wincing oddly were often touched by her Because you re a dove With which she felt herself ever so delicately so considerately embraced not with familiarity or as a liberty taken but almost ceremonially and in the manner of an accolade partly as if though a dove who could perch on a finger one were also a princess with whom forms were to be observed It even came to her through the touch of her companion s lips that this form this cool pressure fairly sealed the sense of what Kate had just said It was moreover for the girl like an inspiration she found herself accepting as the right one while she caught her breath with relief the name so given her She met it on the instant as she would have met revealed truth it lighted up the strange dusk in which she lately had walked THAT was what was the matter with her She was a dove Oh WASN T she it echoed within her as she became aware of the sound outside of the return of their friends There was the next thing little enough doubt about it after Aunt Maud had been two minutes in the room She had come up missus Lowder with Susan which she needn t have done at that hour instead of letting Kate come down to her so that Milly could be quite sure it was to catch hold in some way of the loose end they had left Well the way she did catch was simply to make the point that it didn t now in the least matter She had mounted the stairs for this and she had her moment again with her younger hostess while Kate on the spot as the latter at the time noted gave Susan Shepherd unwonted opportunities Kate was in other words as Aunt Maud engaged her friend listening with the handsomest response to missus Stringham s impression of the scene they had just quitted It was in the tone of the fondest indulgence almost really that of dove cooing to dove that missus Lowder expressed to Milly the hope that it had all gone beautifully Her all had an ample benevolence it soothed and simplified she spoke as if it were the two young women not she and her comrade who had been facing the town together But Milly s answer had prepared itself while Aunt Maud was on the stair she had felt in a rush all the reasons that would make it the most dovelike and she gave it while she was about it as earnest as candid I don t THINK dear lady he s here It gave her straightway the measure of the success she could have as a dove that was recorded in the long look of deep criticism a look without a word that missus Lowder poured forth And the word presently bettered it still Oh you exquisite thing The luscious innuendo of it almost startling lingered in the room after the visitors had gone like an oversweet fragrance But left alone with missus Stringham Milly continued to breathe it she studied again the dovelike and so set her companion to mere rich reporting that she averted all enquiry into her own case That with the new day was once more her law though she saw before her of course as something of a complication her need each time to decide She should have to be clear as to how a dove WOULD act She settled it she thought well enough this morning by quite readopting her plan in respect to Sir Luke Strett That she was pleased to reflect had originally been pitched in the key of a merely iridescent drab and although missus Stringham after breakfast began by staring at it as if it had been a priceless Persian carpet suddenly unrolled at her feet she had no scruple at the end of five minutes in leaving her to make the best of it Sir Luke Strett comes by appointment to see me at eleven but I m going out on purpose He s to be told please deceptively that I m at home and you as my representative when he comes up are to see him instead He ll like that this time better So do be nice to him It had taken naturally more explanation and the mention above all of the fact that the visitor was the greatest of doctors yet when once the key had been offered Susie slipped it on her bunch and her young friend could again feel her lovely imagination operate It operated in truth very much as missus Lowder s at the last had done the night before it made the air heavy once more with the extravagance of assent It might afresh almost have frightened our young woman to see how people rushed to meet her HAD she then so little time to live that the road must always be spared her It was as if they were helping her to take it out on the spot Susie she couldn t deny and didn t pretend to might of a truth on HER side have treated such news as a flash merely lurid as to which to do Susie justice the pain of it was all there But none the less the margin always allowed her young friend was all there as well and the proposal now made her what was it in short but Byzantine The vision of Milly s perception of the propriety of the matter had at any rate quickly engulfed so far as her attitude was concerned any surprise and any shock so that she only desired the next thing perfectly to possess the facts Milly could easily speak on this as if there were only one she made nothing of such another as that she had felt herself menaced The great fact in fine was that she KNEW him to desire just now more than anything else to meet quite apart some one interested in her Who therefore so interested as her faithful Susan The only other circumstance that by the time she had quitted her friend she had treated as worth mentioning was the circumstance of her having at first intended to keep quiet She had originally best seen herself as sweetly secretive As to that she had changed and her present request was the result She didn t say why she had changed but she trusted her faithful Susan Their visitor would trust her not less and she herself would adore their visitor Moreover he wouldn t the girl felt sure tell her anything dreadful The worst would be that he was in love and that he needed a confidant to work it And now she was going to the National Gallery Book Fifth Chapter seven The idea of the National Gallery had been with her from the moment of her hearing from Sir Luke Strett about his hour of coming It had been in her mind as a place so meagrely visited as one of the places that had seemed at home one of the attractions of Europe and one of its highest aids to culture but that the old story the typical frivolous always ended by sacrificing to vulgar pleasures She had had perfectly at those whimsical moments on the Brunig the half shamed sense of turning her back on such opportunities for real improvement as had figured to her from of old in connexion with the continental tour under the general head of pictures and things and at last she knew for what she had done so The plea had been explicit she had done so for life as opposed to learning the upshot of which had been that life was now beautifully provided for In spite of those few dips and dashes into the many coloured stream of history for which of late Kate Croy had helped her to find time there were possible great chances she had neglected possible great moments she should save for to day have all but missed She might still she had felt overtake one or two of them among the Titians and the Turners she had been honestly nursing the hour and once she was in the benignant halls her faith knew itself justified It was the air she wanted and the world she would now exclusively choose the quiet chambers nobly overwhelming rich but slightly veiled opened out round her and made her presently say If I could lose myself HERE There were people people in plenty but admirably no personal question It was immense outside the personal question but she had blissfully left it outside and the nearest it came for a quarter of an hour to glimmering again into view was when she watched for a little one of the more earnest of the lady copyists Two or three in particular spectacled aproned absorbed engaged her sympathy to an absurd extent seemed to show her for the time the right way to live She should have been a lady copyist it met so the case The case was the case of escape of living under water of being at once impersonal and firm There it was before one one had only to stick and stick Milly yielded to this charm till she was almost ashamed she watched the lady copyists till she found herself wondering what would be thought by others of a young woman of adequate aspect who should appear to regard them as the pride of the place She would have liked to talk to them to get as it figured to her into their lives and was deterred but by the fact that she didn t quite see herself as purchasing imitations and yet feared she might excite the expectation of purchase She really knew before long that what held her was the mere refuge that something within her was after all too weak for the Turners and Titians They joined hands about her in a circle too vast though a circle that a year before she would only have desired to trace They were truly for the larger not for the smaller life the life of which the actual pitch for example was an interest the interest of compassion in misguided efforts She marked absurdly her little stations blinking in her shrinkage of curiosity at the glorious walls yet keeping an eye on vistas and approaches so that she shouldn t be flagrantly caught The vistas and approaches drew her in this way from room to room and she had been through many parts of the show as she supposed when she sat down to rest There were chairs in scant clusters places from which one could gaze Milly indeed at present fixed her eyes more than elsewhere on the appearance first that she couldn t quite after all have accounted to an examiner for the order of her schools and then on that of her being more tired than she had meant in spite of her having been so much less intelligent They found her eyes it should be added other occupation as well which she let them freely follow they rested largely in her vagueness on the vagueness of other visitors they attached themselves in especial with mixed results to the surprising stream of her compatriots She was struck with the circumstance that the great museum early in August was haunted with these pilgrims as also with that of her knowing them from afar marking them easily each and all and recognising not less promptly that they had ever new lights for her new lights on their own darkness She gave herself up at last and it was a consummation like another what she should have come to the National Gallery for to day would be to watch the copyists and reckon the Baedekers That perhaps was the moral of a menaced state of health that one would sit in public places and count the Americans It passed the time in a manner but it seemed already the second line of defence and this notwithstanding the pattern so unmistakeable of her country folk They were cut out as by scissors coloured labelled mounted but their relation to her failed to act they somehow did nothing for her Partly no doubt they didn t so much as notice or know her didn t even recognise their community of collapse with her the sign on her as she sat there that for her too Europe was tough It came to her idly thus for her humour could still play that she didn t seem then the same success with them as with the inhabitants of London who had taken her up on scarce more of an acquaintance She could wonder if they would be different should she go back with this glamour attached and she could also wonder if it came to that whether she should ever go back Her friends straggled past at any rate in all the vividness of their absent criticism and she had even at last the sense of taking a mean advantage There was a finer instant however at which three ladies clearly a mother and daughters had paused before her under compulsion of a comment apparently just uttered by one of them and referring to some object on the other side of the room Milly had her back to the object but her face very much to her young compatriot the one who had spoken and in whose look she perceived a certain gloom of recognition Recognition for that matter sat confessedly in her own eyes she KNEW the three generically as easily as a school boy with a crib in his lap would know the answer in class she felt like the school boy guilty enough questioned as honour went as to her right so to possess to dispossess people who hadn t consciously provoked her She would have been able to say where they lived and also how had the place and the way been but amenable to the positive she bent tenderly in imagination over marital paternal mister Whatever he was at home eternally named with all the honours and placidities but eternally unseen and existing only as some one who could be financially heard from The mother the puffed and composed whiteness of whose hair had no relation to her apparent age showed a countenance almost chemically clean and dry her companions wore an air of vague resentment humanised by fatigue and the three were equally adorned with short cloaks of coloured cloth surmounted by little tartan hoods The tartans were doubtless conceivable as different but the cloaks curiously only thinkable as one Handsome Well if you choose to say so It was the mother who had spoken who herself added after a pause during which Milly took the reference as to a picture In the English style The three pair of eyes had converged and their possessors had for an instant rested with the effect of a drop of the subject on this last characterisation with that too of a gloom not less mute in one of the daughters than murmured in the other Milly s heart went out to them while they turned their backs she said to herself that they ought to have known her that there was something between them they might have beautifully put together But she had lost THEM also they were cold they left her in her weak wonder as to what they had been looking at The handsome disposed her to turn all the more that the English style would be the English school which she liked only she saw before moving by the array on the side facing her that she was in fact among small Dutch pictures The action of this was again appreciable the dim surmise that it wouldn t then be by a picture that the spring in the three ladies had been pressed It was at all events time she should go and she turned as she got on her feet She had had behind her one of the entrances and various visitors who had come in while she sat visitors single and in pairs by one of the former of whom she felt her eyes suddenly held This was a gentleman in the middle of the place a gentleman who had removed his hat and was for a moment while he glanced absently as she could see at the top tier of the collection tapping his forehead with his pocket handkerchief The occupation held him long enough to give Milly time to take for granted and a few seconds sufficed that his face was the object just observed by her friends This could only have been because she concurred in their tribute even qualified and indeed the English style of the gentleman perhaps by instant contrast to the American was what had had the arresting power This arresting power at the same time and that was the marvel had already sharpened almost to pain for in the very act of judging the bared head with detachment she felt herself shaken by a knowledge of it It was Merton Densher s own and he was standing there standing long enough unconscious for her to fix him and then hesitate These successions were swift so that she could still ask herself in freedom if she had best let him see her She could still reply to this that she shouldn t like him to catch her in the effort to prevent it and she might further have decided that he was too preoccupied to see anything had not a perception intervened that surpassed the first in violence She was unable to think afterwards how long she had looked at him before knowing herself as otherwise looked at all she was coherently to put together was that she had had a second recognition without his having noticed her The source of this latter shock was nobody less than Kate Croy Kate Croy who was suddenly also in the line of vision and whose eyes met her eyes at their next movement Kate was but two yards off mister Densher wasn t alone Kate s face specifically said so for after a stare as blank at first as Milly s it broke into a far smile That was what wonderfully in addition to the marvel of their meeting passed from her for Milly the instant reduction to easy terms of the fact of their being there the two young women together It was perhaps only afterwards that the girl fully felt the connexion between this touch and her already established conviction that Kate was a prodigious person yet on the spot she none the less in a degree knew herself handled and again as she had been the night before dealt with absolutely even dealt with for her greater pleasure A minute in fine hadn t elapsed before Kate had somehow made her provisionally take everything as natural The provisional was just the charm acquiring that character from one moment to the other it represented happily so much that Kate would explain on the very first chance This left moreover and that was the greatest wonder all due margin for amusement at the way things happened the monstrous oddity of their turning up in such a place on the very heels of their having separated without allusion to it The handsome girl was thus literally in control of the scene by the time Merton Densher was ready to exclaim with a high flush or a vivid blush one didn t distinguish the embarrassment from the joy Why Miss Theale fancy and Why Miss Theale what luck Miss Theale had meanwhile the sense that for him too on Kate s part something wonderful and unspoken was determinant and this although distinctly his companion had no more looked at him with a hint than he had looked at her with a question He had looked and was looking only at Milly herself ever so pleasantly and considerately she scarce knew what to call it but without prejudice to her consciousness all the same that women got out of predicaments better than men The predicament of course wasn t definite nor phraseable and the way they let all phrasing pass was presently to recur to our young woman as a characteristic triumph of the civilised state but she took it for granted insistently with a small private flare of passion because the one thing she could think of to do for him was to show him how she eased him off She would really tired and nervous have been much disconcerted if the opportunity in question hadn t saved her It was what had saved her most what had made her after the first few seconds almost as brave for Kate as Kate was for her had made her only ask herself what their friend would like of her That he was at the end of three minutes without the least complicated reference so smoothly their friend was just the effect of their all being sublimely civilised The flash in which he saw this was for Milly fairly inspiring to that degree in fact that she was even now on such a plane yearning to be supreme It took no doubt a big dose of inspiration to treat as not funny or at least as not unpleasant the anomaly for Kate that SHE knew their gentleman and for herself that Kate was spending the morning with him but everything continued to make for this after Milly had tasted of her draught She was to wonder in subsequent reflexion what in the world they had actually said since they had made such a success of what they didn t say the sweetness of the draught for the time at any rate was to feel success assured What depended on this for mister Densher was all obscurity to her and she perhaps but invented the image of his need as a short cut to accommodation Whatever the facts their perfect manners all round saw them through The finest part of Milly s own inspiration it may further be mentioned was the quick perception that what would be of most service was so to speak her own native wood note She had long been conscious with shame for her thin blood or at least for her poor economy of her unused margin as an American girl closely indeed as in English air the text might appear to cover the page She still had reserves of spontaneity if not of comicality so that all this cash in hand could now find employment She became as spontaneous as possible and as American as it might conveniently appeal to mister Densher after his travels to find her She said things in the air and yet flattered herself that she struck him as saying them not in the tone of agitation but in the tone of New York In the tone of New York agitation was beautifully discounted and she had now a sufficient view of how much it might accordingly help her The help was fairly rendered before they left the place when her friends presently accepted her invitation to adjourn with her to luncheon at her hotel it was in Fifth Avenue that the meal might have waited Kate had never been there so straight but Milly was at present taking her and if mister Densher had been he had at least never had to come so fast She proposed it as the natural thing proposed it as the American girl and she saw herself quickly justified by the pace at which she was followed The beauty of the case was that to do it all she had only to appear to take Kate s hint This had said in its fine first smile Oh yes our look s queer but give me time and the American girl could give time as nobody else could What Milly thus gave she therefore made them take even if as they might surmise it was rather more than they wanted In the porch of the museum she expressed her preference for a four wheeler they would take their course in that guise precisely to multiply the minutes She was more than ever justified by the positive charm that her spirit imparted even to their use of this conveyance and she touched her highest point that is certainly for herself as she ushered her companions into the presence of Susie Susie was there with luncheon as well as with her return in prospect and nothing could now have filled her own consciousness more to the brim than to see this good friend take in how little she was abjectly anxious The cup itself actually offered to this good friend might in truth well be startling for it was composed beyond question of ingredients oddly mixed She caught Susie fairly looking at her as if to know whether she had brought in guests to hear Sir Luke Strett s report Well it was better her companion should have too much than too little to wonder about she had come out anyway as they said at home for the interest of the thing and interest truly sat in her eyes Milly was none the less at the sharpest crisis a little sorry for her she could of necessity extract from the odd scene so comparatively little of a soothing secret She saw mister Densher suddenly popping up but she saw nothing else that had happened She saw in the same way her young friend indifferent to her young friend s doom and she lacked what would explain it The only thing to keep her in patience was the way after luncheon Kate almost as might be said made up to her This was actually perhaps as well what most kept Milly herself in patience It had in fact for our young woman a positive beauty was so marked as a deviation from the handsome girl s previous courses Susie had been a bore to the handsome girl and the change was now suggestive The two sat together after they had risen from table in the apartment in which they had lunched making it thus easy for the other guest and his entertainer to sit in the room adjacent This for the latter personage was the beauty it was almost on Kate s part like a prayer to be relieved If she honestly liked better to be thrown with Susan Shepherd than with their other friend why that said practically everything It didn t perhaps altogether say why she had gone out with him for the morning but it said as one thought about as much as she could say to his face Little by little indeed under the vividness of Kate s behaviour the probabilities fell back into their order Merton Densher was in love and Kate couldn t help it could only be sorry and kind wouldn t that without wild flurries cover everything Milly at all events tried it as a cover tried it hard for the time pulled it over her in the front the larger room drew it up to her chin with energy If it didn t so treated do everything for her it did so much that she could herself supply the rest She made that up by the interest of her great question the question of whether seeing him once more with all that as she called it to herself had come and gone her impression of him would be different from the impression received in New York That had held her from the moment of their leaving the museum it kept her company through their drive and during luncheon and now that she was a quarter of an hour alone with him it became acute She was to feel at this crisis that no clear no common answer no direct satisfaction on this point was to reach her she was to see her question itself simply go to pieces She couldn t tell if he were different or not and she didn t know nor care if SHE were these things had ceased to matter in the light of the only thing she did know This was that she liked him as she put it to herself as much as ever and if that were to amount to liking a new person the amusement would be but the greater She had thought him at first very quiet in spite of his recovery from his original confusion though even the shade of bewilderment she yet perceived had not been due to such vagueness on the subject of her reintensified identity as the probable sight over there of many thousands of her kind would sufficiently have justified No he was quiet inevitably for the first half of the time because Milly s own lively line the line of spontaneity made everything else relative and because too so far as Kate was spontaneous it was ever so finely in the air among them that the normal pitch must be kept Afterwards when they had got a little more used as it were to each other s separate felicity he had begun to talk more clearly bethinking himself at a given moment of what HIS natural lively line would be It would be to take for granted she must wish to hear of the States and to give her in its order everything he had seen and done there He abounded of a sudden he almost insisted he returned after breaks to the charge and the effect was perhaps the more odd as he gave no clue whatever to what he had admired as he went or to what he hadn t He simply drenched her with his sociable story especially during the time they were away from the others She had stopped then being American all to let him be English a permission of which he took she could feel both immense and unconscious advantage She had really never cared less for the States than at this moment but that had nothing to do with the matter It would have been the occasion of her life to learn about them for nothing could put him off and he ventured on no reference to what had happened for herself It might have been almost as if he had known that the greatest of all these adventures was her doing just what she did then It was at this point that she saw the smash of her great question complete saw that all she had to do with was the sense of being there with him And there was no chill for this in what she also presently saw that however he had begun he was now acting from a particular desire determined either by new facts or new fancies to be like every one else simplifyingly kind to her He had caught on already as to manner fallen into line with every one else and if his spirits verily HAD gone up it might well be that he had thus felt himself lighting on the remedy for all awkwardness Whatever he did or he didn t Milly knew she should still like him there was no alternative to that but her heart could none the less sink a little on feeling how much his view of her was destined to have in common with as she now sighed over it THE view She could have dreamed of his not having THE view of his having something or other if need be quite viewless of his own but he might have what he could with least trouble and THE view wouldn t be after all a positive bar to her seeing him The defect of it in general if she might so ungraciously criticise was that by its sweet universality it made relations rather prosaically a matter of course It anticipated and superseded the likewise sweet operation of real affinities It was this that was doubtless marked in her power to keep him now this and her glassy lustre of attention to his pleasantness about the scenery in the Rockies She was in truth a little measuring her success in detaining him by Kate s success in standing Susan It wouldn t be if she could help it mister Densher who should first break down Such at least was one of the forms of the girl s inward tension but beneath even this deep reason was a motive still finer What she had left at home on going out to give it a chance was meanwhile still was more sharply and actively there What had been at the top of her mind about it and then been violently pushed down this quantity was again working up As soon as their friends should go Susie would break out and what she would break out upon wouldn t be interested in that gentleman as she had more than once shown herself the personal fact of mister Densher Milly had found in her face at luncheon a feverish glitter and it told what she was full of She didn t care now for mister Densher s personal facts mister Densher had risen before her only to find his proper place in her imagination already of a sudden occupied His personal fact failed so far as she was concerned to BE personal and her companion noticed the failure This could only mean that she was full to the brim of Sir Luke Strett and of what she had had from him What HAD she had from him It was indeed now working upward again that Milly would do well to know though knowledge looked stiff in the light of Susie s glitter It was therefore on the whole because Densher s young hostess was divided from it by so thin a partition that she continued to cling to the Rockies END OF VOLUME one of THE WINGS OF THE DOVE VOLUME two Book Sixth Chapter one I say you know Kate you DID stay had been Merton Densher s punctual remark on their adventure after they had as it were got out of it an observation which she not less promptly on her side let him see that she forgave in him only because he was a man She had to recognise with whatever disappointment that it was doubtless the most helpful he could make in this character The fact of the adventure was flagrant between them they had looked at each other on gaining the street as people look who have just rounded together a dangerous corner and there was therefore already enough unanimity sketched out to have lighted for her companion anything equivocal in her action But the amount of light men DID need Kate could have been eloquent at this moment about that What however on his seeing more struck him as most distinct in her was her sense that reunited after his absence and having been now half the morning together it behooved them to face without delay the question of handling their immediate future That it would require some handling that they should still have to deal deal in a crafty manner with difficulties and delays was the great matter he had come back to greater than any but the refreshed consciousness of their personal need of each other This need had had twenty minutes the afternoon before to find out where it stood and the time was fully accounted for by the charm of the demonstration He had arrived at Euston at five having wired her from Liverpool the moment he landed and she had quickly decided to meet him at the station whatever publicity might attend such an act When he had praised her for it on alighting from his train she had answered frankly enough that such things should be taken at a jump She didn t care to day who saw her and she profited by it for her joy To morrow inevitably she should have time to think and then as inevitably would become a baser creature a creature of alarms and precautions It was none the less for to morrow at an early hour that she had appointed their next meeting keeping in mind for the present a particular obligation to show at Lancaster Gate by six o clock She had given with imprecations her reason people to tea eternally and a promise to Aunt Maud but she had been liberal enough on the spot and had suggested the National Gallery for the morning quite as with an idea that had ripened in expectancy They might be seen there too but nobody would know them just as for that matter now in the refreshment room to which they had adjourned they would incur the notice but at the worst of the unacquainted They would have something there for the facility it would give Thus had it already come up for them again that they had no place of convenience He found himself on English soil with all sorts of feelings but he hadn t quite faced having to reckon with a certain ruefulness in regard to that subject as one of the strongest He was aware later on that there were questions his impatience had shirked whereby it actually rather smote him for want of preparation and assurance that he had nowhere to take his love He had taken it thus at Euston and on Kate s own suggestion into the place where people had beer and buns and had ordered tea at a small table in the corner which no doubt as they were lost in the crowd did well enough for a stop gap It perhaps did as well as her simply driving with him to the door of his lodging which had had to figure as the sole device of his own wit That wit the truth was had broken down a little at the sharp prevision that once at his door they would have to hang back She would have to stop there wouldn t come in with him couldn t possibly and he shouldn t be able to ask her would feel he couldn t without betraying a deficiency of what would be called even at their advanced stage respect for her that again was all that was clear except the further fact that it was maddening Compressed and concentrated confined to a single sharp pang or two but none the less in wait for him there on the Euston platform and lifting its head as that of a snake in the garden was the disconcerting sense that respect in their game seemed somehow he scarce knew what to call it a fifth wheel to the coach It was properly an inside thing not an outside a thing to make love greater not to make happiness less They had met again for happiness and he distinctly felt during his most lucid moment or two how he must keep watch on anything that really menaced that boon If Kate had consented to drive away with him and alight at his house there would probably enough have occurred for them at the foot of his steps one of those strange instants between man and woman that blow upon the red spark the spark of conflict ever latent in the depths of passion She would have shaken her head oh sadly divinely on the question of coming in and he though doing all justice to her refusal would have yet felt his eyes reach further into her own than a possible word at such a time could reach This would have meant the suspicion the dread of the shadow of an adverse will Lucky therefore in the actual case that the scant minutes took another turn and that by the half hour she did in spite of everything contrive to spend with him Kate showed so well how she could deal with things that maddened She seemed to ask him to beseech him and all for his better comfort to leave her now and henceforth to treat them in her own way She had still met it in naming so promptly for their early convenience one of the great museums and indeed with such happy art that his fully seeing where she had placed him hadn t been till after he left her His absence from her for so many weeks had had such an effect upon him that his demands his desires had grown and only the night before as his ship steamed beneath summer stars in sight of the Irish coast he had felt all the force of his particular necessity He hadn t in other words at any point doubted he was on his way to say to her that really their mistake must end Their mistake was to have believed that they COULD hold out hold out that is not against Aunt Maud but against an impatience that prolonged and exasperated made a man ill He had known more than ever on their separating in the court of the station how ill a man and even a woman could feel from such a cause but he struck himself as also knowing that he had already suffered Kate to begin finely to apply antidotes and remedies and subtle sedatives It had a vulgar sound as throughout in love the names of things the verbal terms of intercourse were compared with love itself horribly vulgar but it was as if after all he might have come back to find himself put off though it would take him of course a day or two to see His letters from the States had pleased whom it concerned though not so much as he had meant they should and he should be paid according to agreement and would now take up his money It wasn t in truth very much to take up so that he hadn t in the least come back flourishing a chequebook that new motive for bringing his mistress to terms he couldn t therefore pretend to produce The ideal certainty would have been to be able to present a change of prospect as a warrant for the change of philosophy and without it he should have to make shift but with the pretext of the lapse of time The lapse of time not so many weeks after all she might always of course say couldn t at any rate have failed to do something for him and that consideration it was that had just now tided him over all the more that he had his vision of what it had done personally for Kate This had come out for him with a splendour that almost scared him even in their small corner of the room at Euston almost scared him because it just seemed to blaze at him that waiting was the game of dupes Not yet had she been so the creature he had originally seen not yet had he felt so soundly safely sure It was all there for him playing on his pride of possession as a hidden master in a great dim church might play on the grandest organ His final sense was that a woman couldn t be like that and then ask of one the impossible She had been like that afresh on the morrow and so for the hour they had been able to float in the mere joy of contact such contact as their situation in pictured public halls permitted This poor makeshift for closeness confessed itself in truth by twenty small signs of unrest even on Kate s part inadequate so little could a decent interest in the interesting place presume to remind them of its claims They had met there in order not to meet in the streets and not again with an equal want of invention and of style at a railway station not again either in Kensington Gardens which they could easily and tacitly agree would have had too much of the taste of their old frustrations The present taste the taste that morning in the pictured halls had been a variation yet Densher had at the end of a quarter of an hour fully known what to conclude from it This fairly consoled him for their awkwardness as if he had been watching it affect her She might be as nobly charming as she liked and he had seen nothing to touch her in the States she couldn t pretend that in such conditions as those she herself BELIEVED it enough to appease him She couldn t pretend she believed he would believe it enough to render her a like service It wasn t enough for that purpose she as good as showed him it wasn t That was what he could be glad by demonstration to have brought her to He would have said to her had he put it crudely and on the spot NOW am I to understand you that you consider this sort of thing can go on It would have been open to her no doubt to reply that to have him with her again to have him all kept and treasured so still under her grasping hand as she had held him in their yearning interval was a sort of thing that he must allow her to have no quarrel about but that would be a mere gesture of her grace a mere sport of her subtlety She knew as well as he what they wanted in spite of which indeed he scarce could have said how beautifully he mightn t once more have named it and urged it if she hadn t at a given moment blurred as it were the accord They had soon seated themselves for better talk and so they had remained a while intimate and superficial The immediate things to say had been many for they hadn t exhausted them at Euston They drew upon them freely now and Kate appeared quite to forget which was prodigiously becoming to her to look about for surprises He was to try afterwards and try in vain to remember what speech or what silence of his own what natural sign of the eyes or accidental touch of the hand had precipitated for her in the midst of this a sudden different impulse She had got up with inconsequence as if to break the charm though he wasn t aware of what he had done at the moment to make the charm a danger She had patched it up agreeably enough the next minute by some odd remark about some picture to which he hadn t so much as replied it being quite independently of this that he had himself exclaimed on the dreadful closeness of the rooms He had observed that they must go out again to breathe and it was as if their common consciousness while they passed into another part was that of persons who infinitely engaged together had been startled and were trying to look natural It was probably while they were so occupied as the young man subsequently reconceived that they had stumbled upon his little New York friend He thought of her for some reason as little though she was of about Kate s height to which any more than to any other felicity in his mistress he had never applied the diminutive What was to be in the retrospect more distinct to him was the process by which he had become aware that Kate s acquaintance with her was greater than he had gathered She had written of it in due course as a new and amusing one and he had written back that he had met over there and that he much liked the young person whereupon she had answered that he must find out about her at home Kate in the event however had not returned to that and he had of course with so many things to find out about been otherwise taken up Little Miss Theale s individual history was not stuff for his newspaper besides which moreover he was seeing but too many little Miss Theales They even went so far as to impose themselves as one of the groups of social phenomena that fell into the scheme of his public letters For this group in especial perhaps the irrepressible the supereminent young persons his best pen was ready Thus it was that there could come back to him in London an hour or two after their luncheon with the American pair the sense of a situation for which Kate hadn t wholly prepared him Possibly indeed as marked as this was his recovered perception that preparations of more than one kind had been exactly what both yesterday and to day he felt her as having in hand That appearance in fact if he dwelt on it so ministered to apprehension as to require some brushing away He shook off the suspicion to some extent on their separating first from their hostesses and then from each other by the aid of a long and rather aimless walk He was to go to the office later but he had the next two or three hours and he gave himself as a pretext that he had eaten much too much After Kate had asked him to put her into a cab which as an announced a resumed policy on her part he found himself deprecating he stood a while by a corner and looked vaguely forth at his London There was always doubtless a moment for the absentee recaptured THE moment that of the reflux of the first emotion at which it was beyond disproof that one was back His full parenthesis was closed and he was once more but a sentence of a sort in the general text the text that from his momentary street corner showed as a great grey page of print that somehow managed to be crowded without being fine The grey however was more or less the blur of a point of view not yet quite seized again and there would be colour enough to come out He was back flatly enough but back to possibilities and prospects and the ground he now somewhat sightlessly covered was the act of renewed possession He walked northward without a plan without suspicion quite in the direction his little New York friend in her restless ramble had taken a day or two before He reached like Milly the Regent s Park and though he moved further and faster he finally sat down like Milly from the force of thought For him too in this position be it added and he might positively have occupied the same bench various troubled fancies folded their wings He had no more yet said what he really wanted than Kate herself had found time She should hear enough of that in a couple of days He had practically not pressed her as to what most concerned them it had seemed so to concern them during these first hours but to hold each other spiritually speaking close This at any rate was palpable that there were at present more things rather than fewer between them The explanation about the two ladies would be part of the lot yet could wait with all the rest They were not meanwhile certainly what most made him roam the missing explanations weren t That was what she had so often said before and always with the effect of suddenly breaking off Now please call me a good cab Their previous encounters the times when they had reached in their stroll the south side of the park had had a way of winding up with this special irrelevance It was effectively what most divided them for he would generally but for her reasons have been able to jump in with her What did she think he wished to do to her it was a question he had had occasion to put A small matter however doubtless since when it came to that they didn t depend on cabs good or bad for the sense of union its importance was less from the particular loss than as a kind of irritating mark of her expertness This expertness under providence had been great from the first so far as joining him was concerned and he was critical only because it had been still greater even from the first too in respect to leaving him He had put the question to her again that afternoon on the repetition of her appeal had asked her once more what she supposed he wished to do He recalled on his bench in the Regent s Park the freedom of fancy funny and pretty with which she had answered recalled the moment itself while the usual hansom charged them during which he felt himself disappointed as he was grimacing back at the superiority of her very humour in its added grace of gaiety to the celebrated solemn American Their fresh appointment had been at all events by that time made and he should see what her choice in respect to it a surprise as well as a relief would do toward really simplifying It meant either new help or new hindrance though it took them at least out of the streets And her naming this privilege had naturally made him ask if missus Lowder knew of his return Not from me Kate had replied But I shall speak to her now And she had argued as with rather a quick fresh view that it would now be quite easy We ve behaved for months so properly that I ve margin surely for my mention of you You ll come to see HER and she ll leave you with me she ll show her good nature and her lack of betrayed fear in that With her you know you ve never broken quite the contrary and she likes you as much as ever We re leaving town it will be the end just now therefore it s nothing to ask I ll ask to night Kate had wound up and if you ll leave it to me my cleverness I assure you has grown infernal I ll make it all right He had of course thus left it to her and he was wondering more about it now than he had wondered there in Brook Street He repeated to himself that if it wasn t in the line of triumph it was in the line of muddle This indeed no doubt was as a part of his wonder for still other questions Kate had really got off without meeting his little challenge about the terms of their intercourse with her dear Milly Her dear Milly it was sensible WAS somehow in the picture Her dear Milly popping up in his absence occupied he couldn t have said quite why he felt it more of the foreground than one would have expected her in advance to find clear She took up room and it was almost as if room had been made for her Kate had appeared to take for granted he would know why it had been made but that was just the point It was a foreground in which he himself in which his connexion with Kate scarce enjoyed a space to turn round But Miss Theale was perhaps at the present juncture a possibility of the same sort as the softened if not the squared Aunt Maud It might be true of her also that if she weren t a bore she d be a convenience It rolled over him of a sudden after he had resumed his walk that this might easily be what Kate had meant The charming girl adored her Densher had for himself made out that and would protect would lend a hand to their interviews These might take place in other words on her premises which would remove them still better from the streets THAT was an explanation which did hang together It was impaired a little of a truth by this fact that their next encounter was rather markedly not to depend upon her Yet this fact in turn would be accounted for by the need of more preliminaries One of the things he conceivably should gain on Thursday at Lancaster Gate would be a further view of that propriety Book Sixth Chapter two It was extraordinary enough that he should actually be finding himself when Thursday arrived none so wide of the mark Kate hadn t come all the way to this for him but she had come to a good deal by the end of a quarter of an hour What she had begun with was her surprise at her appearing to have left him on Tuesday anything more to understand The parts as he now saw under her hand did fall more or less together and it wasn t even as if she had spent the interval in twisting and fitting them She was bright and handsome not fagged and worn with the general clearness for it certainly stuck out enough that if the American ladies themselves weren t to be squared which was absurd they fairly imposed the necessity of trying Aunt Maud again One couldn t say to them kind as she had been to them We ll meet please whenever you ll let us at your house but we count on you to help us to keep it secret They must in other terms inevitably speak to Aunt Maud it would be of the last awkwardness to ask them not to Kate had embraced all this in her choice of speaking first What Kate embraced altogether was indeed wonderful to day for Densher though he perhaps struck himself rather as getting it out of her piece by piece than as receiving it in a steady light He had always felt however that the more he asked of her the more he found her prepared as he imaged it to hand out He had said to her more than once even before his absence You keep the key of the cupboard and I foresee that when we re married you ll dole me out my sugar by lumps She had replied that she rejoiced in his assumption that sugar would be his diet and the domestic arrangement so prefigured might have seemed already to prevail The supply from the cupboard at this hour was doubtless of a truth not altogether cloyingly sweet but it met in a manner his immediate requirements If her explanations at any rate prompted questions the questions no more exhausted them than they exhausted her patience And they were naturally of the series the simpler as for instance in his taking it from her that Miss Theale then could do nothing for them He frankly brought out what he had ventured to think possible If we can t meet here and we ve really exhausted the charms of the open air and the crowd some such little raft in the wreck some occasional opportunity like that of Tuesday has been present to me these two days as better than nothing But if our friends are so accountable to this house of course there s no more to be said And it s one more nail thank God in the coffin of our odious delay He was but too glad without more ado to point the moral Now I hope you see we can t work it anyhow If she laughed for this and her spirits seemed really high it was because of the opportunity that at the hotel he had most shown himself as enjoying Your idea s beautiful when one remembers that you hadn t a word except for Milly But she was as beautifully good humoured You might of course get used to her you WILL You re quite right so long as they re with us or near us And she put it lucidly that the dear things couldn t HELP simply as charming friends giving them a lift They ll speak to Aunt Maud but they won t shut their doors to us that would be another matter A friend always helps and she s a friend She had left missus Stringham by this time out of the question she had reduced it to Milly Besides she particularly likes us She particularly likes YOU I say old boy make something of that He felt her dodging the ultimatum he had just made sharp his definite reminder of how little at the best they could work it but there were certain of his remarks those mostly of the sharper penetration that it had been quite her practice from the first not formally not reverently to notice She showed the effect of them in ways less trite This was what happened now he didn t think in truth that she wasn t really minding She took him up none the less on a minor question You say we can t meet here but you see it s just what we do What could be more lovely than this It wasn t to torment him that again he didn t believe but he had to come to the house in some discomfort so that he frowned a little at her calling it thus a luxury Wasn t there an element in it of coming back into bondage The bondage might be veiled and varnished but he knew in his bones how little the very highest privileges of Lancaster Gate could ever be a sign of their freedom They were upstairs in one of the smaller apartments of state a room arranged as a boudoir but visibly unused it defied familiarity and furnished in the ugliest of blues He had immediately looked with interest at the closed doors and Kate had met his interest with the assurance that it was all right that Aunt Maud did them justice so far that was as this particular time was concerned that they should be alone and have nothing to fear But the fresh allusion to this that he had drawn from her acted on him now more directly brought him closer still to the question They WERE alone it WAS all right he took in anew the shut doors and the permitted privacy the solid stillness of the great house They connected themselves on the spot with something made doubly vivid in him by the whole present play of her charming strong will What it amounted to was that he couldn t have her hanged if he could evasive He couldn t and he wouldn t wouldn t have her inconvenient and elusive He didn t want her deeper than himself fine as it might be as wit or as character he wanted to keep her where their communications would be straight and easy and their intercourse independent The effect of this was to make him say in a moment Will you take me just as I am She turned a little pale for the tone of truth in it which qualified to his sense delightfully the strength of her will and the pleasure he found in this was not the less for her breaking out after an instant into a strain that stirred him more than any she had ever used with him Ah do let me try myself I assure you I see my way so don t spoil it wait for me and give me time Dear man Kate said only believe in me and it will be beautiful He hadn t come back to hear her talk of his believing in her as if he didn t but he had come back and it all was upon him now to seize her with a sudden intensity that her manner of pleading with him had made as happily appeared irresistible He laid strong hands upon her to say almost in anger Do you love me love me love me and she closed her eyes as with the sense that he might strike her but that she could gratefully take it Her surrender was her response her response her surrender and though scarce hearing what she said he so profited by these things that it could for the time be ever so intimately appreciable to him that he was keeping her The long embrace in which they held each other was the rout of evasion and he took from it the certitude that what she had from him was real to her It was stronger than an uttered vow and the name he was to give it in afterthought was that she had been sublimely sincere THAT was all he asked sincerity making a basis that would bear almost anything This settled so much and settled it so thoroughly that there was nothing left to ask her to swear to Oaths and vows apart now they could talk It seemed in fact only now that their questions were put on the table He had taken up more expressly at the end of five minutes her plea for her own plan and it was marked that the difference made by the passage just enacted was a difference in favour of her choice of means Means had somehow suddenly become a detail her province and her care it had grown more consistently vivid that her intelligence was one with her passion I certainly don t want he said and he could say it with a smile of indulgence to be all the while bringing it up that I don t trust you I should hope not What do you think I want to do He had really at this to make out a little what he thought and the first thing that put itself in evidence was of course the oddity after all of their game to which he could but frankly allude We re doing at the best in trying to temporise in so special a way a thing most people would call us fools for But his visit passed all the same without his again attempting to make just as he was serve He had no more money just as he was than he had had just as he had been or than he should have probably when it came to that just as he always would be whereas she on her side in comparison with her state of some months before had measureably more to relinquish He easily saw how their meeting at Lancaster Gate gave more of an accent to that quantity than their meeting at stations or in parks and yet on the other hand he couldn t urge this against it If missus Lowder was indifferent her indifference added in a manner to what Kate s taking him as he was would call on her to sacrifice Such in fine was her art with him that she seemed to put the question of their still waiting into quite other terms than the terms of ugly blue of florid Sevres of complicated brass in which their boudoir expressed it She said almost all in fact by saying on this article of Aunt Maud after he had once more pressed her that when he should see her as must inevitably soon happen he would understand Do you mean he asked at this that there s any DEFINITE sign of her coming round I m not talking he explained of mere hypocrisies in her or mere brave duplicities Remember after all that supremely clever as we are and as strong a team I admit as there is going remember that she can play with us quite as much as we play with her She doesn t want to play with ME my dear Kate lucidly replied she doesn t want to make me suffer a bit more than she need She cares for me too much and everything she does or doesn t do has a value THIS has a value her being as she has been about us to day I believe she s in her room where she s keeping strictly to herself while you re here with me But that isn t playing not a bit What is it then the young man returned from the moment it isn t her blessing and a cheque Kate was complete It s simply her absence of smallness There IS something in her above trifles She GENERALLY trusts us she doesn t propose to hunt us into corners and if we frankly ask for a thing why said Kate she shrugs but she lets it go She has really but one fault she s indifferent on such ground as she has taken about us to details However the girl cheerfully went on it isn t in detail we fight her It seems to me Densher brought out after a moment s thought of this that it s in detail we deceive her a speech that as soon as he had uttered it applied itself for him as also visibly for his companion to the afterglow of their recent embrace Any confusion attaching to this adventure however dropped from Kate whom as he could see with sacred joy it must take more than that to make compunctious I don t say we can do it again I mean she explained meet here Densher indeed had been wondering where they could do it again If Lancaster Gate was so limited that issue reappeared I mayn t come back at all Certainly to see her It s she really his companion smiled who s in love with you But it made him a trifle more grave look at her a moment Don t make out you know that every one s in love with me She hesitated I don t say every one You said just now Miss Theale I said she liked you yes Well it comes to the same thing With which however he pursued Of course I ought to thank missus Lowder in person I mean for THIS as from myself Ah but you know not too much She had an ironic gaiety for the implications of his this besides wishing to insist on a general prudence She ll wonder what you re thanking her for Densher did justice to both considerations Yes I can t very well tell her all It was perhaps because he said it so gravely that Kate was again in a manner amused Yet she gave out light You can t very well tell her anything and that doesn t matter Only be nice to her Please her make her see how clever you are only without letting her see that you re trying If you re charming to her you ve nothing else to do But she oversimplified too I can be charming to her so far as I see only by letting her suppose I give you up which I ll be hanged if I do It IS he said with feeling a game Of course it s a game But she ll never suppose you give me up or I give YOU if you keep reminding her how you enjoy our interviews Then if she has to see us as obstinate and constant Densher asked what good does it do Kate was for a moment checked What good does what Does my pleasing her does anything I CAN T he impatiently declared please her Kate looked at him hard again disappointed at his want of consistency but it appeared to determine in her something better than a mere complaint Then I can Leave it to me With which she came to him under the compulsion again that had united them shortly before and took hold of him in her urgency to the same tender purpose It was her form of entreaty renewed and repeated which made after all as he met it their great fact clear And it somehow clarified ALL things so to possess each other The effect of it was that once more on these terms he could only be generous He had so on the spot then left everything to her that she reverted in the course of a few moments to one of her previous and as positively seemed her most precious ideas You accused me just now of saying that Milly s in love with you Well if you come to that I do say it So there you are That s the good she ll do us It makes a basis for her seeing you so that she ll help us to go on Densher stared she was wondrous all round And what sort of a basis does it make for my seeing HER Oh I don t mind Kate smiled Don t mind my leading her on She put it differently Don t mind her leading YOU Well she won t so it s nothing not to mind But how can that help he pursued with what she knows What she knows That needn t prevent He wondered Prevent her loving us Prevent her helping you She s LIKE that Kate Croy explained It took indeed some understanding Making nothing of the fact that I love another Making everything said Kate To console you But for what For not getting your other He continued to stare But how does she know That you WON T get her She doesn t but on the other hand she doesn t know you will Meanwhile she sees you baffled for she knows of Aunt Maud s stand THAT Kate was lucid gives her the chance to be nice to you And what does it give ME the young man none the less rationally asked the chance to be A brute of a humbug to her Kate so possessed her facts as it were that she smiled at his violence You ll extraordinarily like her She s exquisite And there are reasons I mean others What others Well I ll tell you another time Those I give you the girl added are enough to go on with To go on to what Why to seeing her again say as soon as you can which moreover on all grounds is no more than decent of you He of course took in her reference and he had fully in mind what had passed between them in New York It had been no great quantity but it had made distinctly at the time for his pleasure so that anything in the nature of an appeal in the name of it could have a slight kindling consequence Oh I shall naturally call again without delay Yes said Densher her being in love with me is nonsense but I must quite independently of that make every acknowledgement of favours received It appeared practically all Kate asked Then you see I shall meet you there I don t quite see he presently returned why she should wish to receive YOU for it She receives me for myself that is for HER self She thinks no end of me That I should have to drum it into you Yet still he didn t take it Then I confess she s beyond me Well Kate could but leave it as she saw it She regards me as already in these few weeks her dearest friend It s quite separate We re in she and I ever so deep And it was to confirm this that as if it had flashed upon her that he was somewhere at sea she threw out at last her own real light She doesn t of course know I care for YOU She thinks I care so little that it s not worth speaking of That he HAD been somewhere at sea these remarks made quickly clear and Kate hailed the effect with surprise Have you been supposing that she does know About our situation Certainly if you re such friends as you show me and if you haven t otherwise represented it to her She uttered at this such a sound of impatience that he stood artlessly vague You HAVE denied it to her She threw up her arms at his being so backward Denied it My dear man we ve never spoken of you Never never Strange as it may appear to your glory never He couldn t piece it together But won t missus Lowder have spoken Very probably But of YOU Not of me This struck him as obscure How does she know me but as part and parcel of you How Kate triumphantly asked Why exactly to make nothing of it to have nothing to do with it to stick consistently to her line about it Aunt Maud s line is to keep all reality out of our relation that is out of my being in danger from you by not having so much as suspected or heard of it She ll get rid of it as she believes by ignoring it and sinking it if she only does so hard enough Therefore SHE in her manner denies it if you will That s how she knows you otherwise than as part and parcel of me She won t for a moment have allowed either to missus Stringham or to Milly that I ve in any way as they say distinguished you And you don t suppose said Densher that they must have made it out for themselves No my dear I don t not even Kate declared after Milly s so funnily bumping against us on Tuesday She doesn t see from THAT That you re so to speak mad about me Yes she sees no doubt that you regard me with a complacent eye for you show it I think always too much and too crudely But nothing beyond that I don t show it too much I don t perhaps to please you completely where others are concerned show it enough Can you show it or not as you like Densher demanded It pulled her up a little but she came out resplendent Not where YOU are concerned Beyond seeing that you re rather gone she went on Milly only sees that I m decently good to you Very good indeed she must think it Very good indeed then She easily sees me Kate smiled as very good indeed The young man brooded But in a sense to take some explaining Then I explain She was really fine it came back to her essential plea for her freedom of action and his beauty of trust I mean she added I WILL explain And what will I do Recognise the difference it must make if she thinks But here in truth Kate faltered It was his silence alone that for the moment took up her apparent meaning and before he again spoke she had returned to remembrance and prudence They were now not to forget that Aunt Maud s liberality having put them on their honour they mustn t spoil their case by abusing it He must leave her in time they should probably find it would help them But she came back to Milly too Mind you go to see her Densher still however took up nothing of this Then I may come again For Aunt Maud as much as you like But we can t again said Kate play her THIS trick I can t see you here alone Then where Go to see Milly she for all satisfaction repeated And what good will that do me Try it and you ll see You mean you ll manage to be there Densher asked Say you are how will that give us privacy Try it you ll see the girl once more returned We must manage as we can That s precisely what I feel It strikes me we might manage better His idea of this was a thing that made him an instant hesitate yet he brought it out with conviction Why won t you come to ME It was a question her troubled eyes seemed to tell him he was scarce generous in expecting her definitely to answer and by looking to him to wait at least she appealed to something that she presently made him feel as his pity It was on that special shade of tenderness that he thus found himself thrown back and while he asked of his spirit and of his flesh just what concession they could arrange she pressed him yet again on the subject of her singular remedy for their embarrassment It might have been irritating had she ever struck him as having in her mind a stupid corner You ll see she said the difference it will make Well since she wasn t stupid she was intelligent it was he who was stupid the proof of which was that he would do what she liked But he made a last effort to understand her allusion to the difference bringing him round to it He indeed caught at something subtle but strong even as he spoke Is what you meant a moment ago that the difference will be in her being made to believe you hate me Kate however had simply for this gross way of putting it one of her more marked shows of impatience with which in fact she sharply closed their discussion He opened the door on a sign from her and she accompanied him to the top of the stairs with an air of having so put their possibilities before him that questions were idle and doubts perverse I verily believe I SHALL hate you if you spoil for me the beauty of what I see Book Sixth Chapter three He was really notwithstanding to hear more from her of what she saw and the very next occasion had for him still other surprises than that He received from missus Lowder on the morning after his visit to Kate the telegraphic expression of a hope that he might be free to dine with them that evening and his freedom affected him as fortunate even though in some degree qualified by her missive
2514_149482_000004_000001	train-clean-100	 Expecting American friends whom I m so glad to find you know His knowledge of American friends was clearly an accident of which he was to taste the fruit to the last bitterness 
2514_149482_000004_000002	train-clean-100	This apprehension however we hasten to add enjoyed for him in the immediate event a certain merciful shrinkage the immediate event being that at Lancaster Gate five minutes after his due arrival prescribed him for eight thirty missus Stringham came in alone 
none	none	The long daylight the postponed lamps the habit of the hour made dinners late and guests still later so that punctual as he was he had found missus Lowder alone with Kate herself not yet in the field He had thus had with her several bewildering moments bewildering by reason fairly of their tacit invitation to him to be supernaturally simple 
2514_149482_000004_000005	train-clean-100	This was exactly goodness knew what he wanted to be but he had never had it so largely and freely SO supernaturally simply for that matter imputed to him as of easy achievement 
none	none	It was a particular in which Aunt Maud appeared to offer herself as an example appeared to say quite agreeably What I want of you don t you see is to be just exactly as I am The quantity of the article required was what might especially have caused him to stagger he liked so in general the quantities in which missus Lowder dealt 
2514_149482_000004_000007	train-clean-100	He would have liked as well to ask her how feasible she supposed it for a poor young man to resemble her at any point but he had after all soon enough perceived that he was doing as she wished by letting his wonder show just a little as silly 
none	none	He was conscious moreover of a small strange dread of the results of discussion with her strange truly because it was her good nature not her asperity that he feared Asperity might have made him angry in which there was always a comfort good nature in his conditions had a tendency to make him ashamed which Aunt Maud indeed wonderfully liking him for himself quite struck him as having guessed 
2514_149482_000004_000010	train-clean-100	To spare him therefore she also avoided discussion she kept him down by refusing to quarrel with him 
2514_149482_000004_000011	train-clean-100	This was what she now proposed to him to enjoy and his secret discomfort was his sense that on the whole it was what would best suit him 
none	none	Being kept down was a bore but his great dread verily was of being ashamed which was a thing distinct and it mattered but little that he was ashamed of that too It was of the essence of his position that in such a house as this the tables could always be turned on him
2514_149482_000005_000001	train-clean-100	 What do you offer what do you offer the place however muffled in convenience and decorum constantly hummed for him with that thick irony 
none	none	The irony was a renewed reference to obvious bribes and he had already seen how little aid came to him from denouncing the bribes as ugly in form That was what the precious metals they alone could afford to be it was vain enough for him accordingly to try to impart a gloss to his own comparative brummagem The humiliation of this impotence was precisely what Aunt Maud sought to mitigate for him by keeping him down and as her effort to that end had doubtless never yet been so visible he had probably never felt so definitely placed in the world as while he waited with her for her half dozen other guests 
2514_149482_000005_000005	train-clean-100	She welcomed him genially back from the States as to his view of which her few questions though not coherent were comprehensive and he had the amusement of seeing in her as through a clear glass the outbreak of a plan and the sudden consciousness of a curiosity 
2514_149482_000005_000006	train-clean-100	She became aware of America under his eyes as a possible scene for social operations the idea of a visit to the wonderful country had clearly but just occurred to her yet she was talking of it at the end of a minute as her favourite dream 
2514_149482_000005_000007	train-clean-100	He didn t believe in it but he pretended to this helped her as well as anything else to treat him as harmless and blameless 
2514_149482_000005_000008	train-clean-100	She was so engaged with the further aid of a complete absence of allusions when the highest effect was given her method by the beautiful entrance of Kate 
none	none	The method therefore received support all round for no young man could have been less formidable than the person to the relief of whose shyness her niece ostensibly came The ostensible in Kate struck him altogether on this occasion as prodigious while scarcely less prodigious for that matter was his own reading on the spot of the relation between his companions a relation lighted for him by the straight look not exactly loving nor lingering yet searching and soft that on the part of their hostess the girl had to reckon with as she advanced It took her in from head to foot and in doing so it told a story that made poor Densher again the least bit sick it marked so something with which Kate habitually and consummately reckoned 
2514_149482_000006_000000	train-clean-100	That was the story that she was always for her beneficent dragon under arms living up every hour but especially at festal hours to the value missus Lowder had attached to her 
2514_149482_000006_000001	train-clean-100	High and fixed this estimate ruled on each occasion at Lancaster Gate the social scene so that he now recognised in it something like the artistic idea the plastic substance imposed by tradition by genius by criticism in respect to a given character on a distinguished actress 
none	none	As such a person was to dress the part to walk to look to speak in every way to express the part so all this was what Kate was to do for the character she had undertaken under her aunt s roof to represent 
2514_149482_000006_000003	train-clean-100	It was made up the character of definite elements and touches things all perfectly ponderable to criticism and the way for her to meet criticism was evidently at the start to be sure her make up had had the last touch and that she looked at least no worse than usual 
none	none	Aunt Maud s appreciation of that to night was indeed managerial and the performer s own contribution fairly that of the faultless soldier on parade 
2514_149482_000006_000005	train-clean-100	Densher saw himself for the moment as in his purchased stall at the play the watchful manager was in the depths of a box and the poor actress in the glare of the footlights 
2514_149482_000006_000006	train-clean-100	But she PASSED the poor performer he could see how she always passed her wig her paint her jewels every mark of her expression impeccable and her entrance accordingly greeted with the proper round of applause 
none	none	Such impressions as we thus note for Densher come and go it must be granted in very much less time than notation demands but we may none the less make the point that there was still further time among them for him to feel almost too scared to take part in the ovation He struck himself as having lost for the minute his presence of mind so that in any case he only stared in silence at the older woman s technical challenge and at the younger one s disciplined face It was as if the drama it thus came to him for the fact of a drama there was no blinking was between THEM them quite preponderantly with Merton Densher relegated to mere spectatorship a paying place in front and one of the most expensive This was why his appreciation had turned for the instant to fear had just turned as we have said to sickness and in spite of the fact that the disciplined face did offer him over the footlights as he believed the small gleam fine faint but exquisite of a special intelligence So might a practised performer even when raked by double barrelled glasses seem to be all in her part and yet convey a sign to the person in the house she loved best 
2514_149482_000007_000000	train-clean-100	The drama at all events as Densher saw it meanwhile went on amplified soon enough by the advent of two other guests stray gentlemen both stragglers in the rout of the season who visibly presented themselves to Kate during the next moments as subjects for a like impersonal treatment and sharers in a like usual mercy 
2514_149482_000007_000001	train-clean-100	At opposite ends of the social course they displayed in respect to the figure that each in his way made one the expansive the other the contractile effect of the perfect white waistcoat 
none	none	A scratch company of two innocuous youths and a pacified veteran was therefore what now offered itself to missus Stringham who rustled in a little breathless and full of the compunction of having had to come alone 
2514_149482_000007_000003	train-clean-100	Her companion at the last moment had been indisposed positively not well enough and so had packed her off insistently with excuses with wild regrets 
none	none	This circumstance of their charming friend s illness was the first thing Kate took up with Densher on their being able after dinner without bravado to have ten minutes naturally as she called it which wasn t what HE did together but it was already as if the young man had by an odd impression throughout the meal not been wholly deprived of Miss Theale s participation missus Lowder had made dear Milly the topic and it proved on the spot a topic as familiar to the enthusiastic younger as to the sagacious older man Any knowledge they might lack missus Lowder s niece was moreover alert to supply while Densher himself was freely appealed to as the most privileged after all of the group Wasn t it he who had in a manner invented the wonderful creature through having seen her first caught her in her native jungle 
2514_149482_000007_000007	train-clean-100	Hadn t he more or less paved the way for her by his prompt recognition of her rarity by preceding her in a friendly spirit as he had the ear of society with a sharp flashlight or two 
2514_149482_000008_000000	train-clean-100	He met poor Densher these enquiries as he could listening with interest yet with discomfort wincing in particular dry journalist as he was to find it seemingly supposed of him that he had put his pen oh his pen at the service of private distinction 
2514_149482_000008_000001	train-clean-100	The ear of society they were talking or almost as if he had publicly paragraphed a modest young lady 
2514_149482_000008_000002	train-clean-100	They dreamt dreams in truth he appeared to perceive that fairly waked HIM up and he settled himself in his place both to resist his embarrassment and to catch the full revelation 
none	none	His embarrassment came naturally from the fact that if he could claim no credit for Miss Theale s success so neither could he gracefully insist on his not having been concerned with her 
2514_149482_000008_000004	train-clean-100	What touched him most nearly was that the occasion took on somehow the air of a commemorative banquet a feast to celebrate a brilliant if brief career 
none	none	There was of course more said about the heroine than if she hadn t been absent and he found himself rather stupefied at the range of Milly s triumph missus Lowder had wonders to tell of it the two wearers of the waistcoat either with sincerity or with hypocrisy professed in the matter an equal expertness and Densher at last seemed to know himself in presence of a social case 
2514_149482_000008_000007	train-clean-100	It was missus Stringham obviously whose testimony would have been most invoked hadn t she been as her friend s representative rather confined to the function of inhaling the incense so that Kate who treated her beautifully smiling at her cheering and consoling her across the table appeared benevolently both to speak and to interpret for her 
none	none	Kate spoke as if she wouldn t perhaps understand THEIR way of appreciating Milly but would let them none the less in justice to their good will express it in their coarser fashion Densher himself wasn t unconscious in respect to this of a certain broad brotherhood with missus Stringham wondering indeed while he followed the talk how it might move American nerves He had only heard of them before but in his recent tour he had caught them in the remarkable fact and there was now a moment or two when it came to him that he had perhaps and not in the way of an escape taken a lesson from them They quivered clearly they hummed and drummed they leaped and bounded in missus Stringham s typical organism this lady striking him as before all things excited as in the native phrase keyed up to a perception of more elements in the occasion than he was himself able to count She was accessible to sides of it he imagined that were as yet obscure to him for though she unmistakeably rejoiced and soared he none the less saw her at moments as even more agitated than pleasure required It was a state of emotion in her that could scarce represent simply an impatience to report at home 
2514_149482_000009_000003	train-clean-100	Her little dry New England brightness he had sampled all the shades of the American complexity if complexity it were had its actual reasons for finding relief most in silence so that before the subject was changed he perceived with surprise at the others that they had given her enough of it 
none	none	He had quite had enough of it himself by the time he was asked if it were true that their friend had really not made in her own country the mark she had chalked so large in London It was missus Lowder herself who addressed him that enquiry while he scarce knew if he were the more impressed with her launching it under missus Stringham s nose or with her hope that he would allow to London the honour of discovery The less expansive of the white waistcoats propounded the theory that they saw in London for all that was said much further than in the States it wouldn t be the first time he urged that they had taught the Americans to appreciate especially when it was funny some native product He didn t mean that Miss Theale was funny though she was weird and this was precisely her magic but it might very well be that New York in having her to show hadn t been aware of its luck 
2514_149482_000009_000008	train-clean-100	There WERE plenty of people who were nothing over there and yet were awfully taken up in England just as to make the balance right thank goodness they sometimes sent out beauties and celebrities who left the Briton cold 
none	none	The Briton s temperature in truth wasn t to be calculated a formulation of the matter that was not reached however without producing in missus Stringham a final feverish sally She announced that if the point of view for a proper admiration of her young friend HAD seemed to fail a little in New York there was no manner of doubt of her having carried Boston by storm It pointed the moral that Boston for the finer taste left New York nowhere and the good lady as the exponent of this doctrine which she set forth at a certain length made obviously to Densher s mind her nearest approach to supplying the weirdness in which Milly s absence had left them deficient 
2514_149482_000009_000012	train-clean-100	She made it indeed effective for him by suddenly addressing him 
2514_149482_000009_000013	train-clean-100	 You know nothing sir but not the least little bit about my friend 
2514_149482_000010_000000	train-clean-100	He hadn t pretended he did but there was a purity of reproach in missus Stringham s face and tone a purity charged apparently with solemn meanings so that for a little small as had been his claim he couldn t but feel that she exaggerated 
none	none	He wondered what she did mean but while doing so he defended himself
2514_149482_000010_000002	train-clean-100	 I certainly don t know enormously much beyond her having been most kind to me in New York as a poor bewildered and newly landed alien and my having tremendously appreciated it To which he added he scarce knew why what had an immediate success 
2514_149482_000010_000003	train-clean-100	 Remember missus Stringham that you weren t then present 
2514_149482_000011_000000	train-clean-100	 Ah there you are said Kate with much gay expression though what it expressed he failed at the time to make out 
2514_149482_000012_000000	train-clean-100	 You weren t present THEN dearest missus Lowder richly concurred 
none	none	You don t know she continued with mellow gaiety how far things may have gone It made the little woman he could see really lose her head She had more things in that head than any of them in any other unless perhaps it were Kate whom he felt as indirectly watching him during this foolish passage though it pleased him and because of the foolishness not to meet her eyes 
2514_149482_000013_000002	train-clean-100	He met missus Stringham s which affected him with her he could on occasion clear it up a sense produced by the mute communion between them and really the beginning as the event was to show of something extraordinary 
none	none	It was even already a little the effect of this communion that missus Stringham perceptibly faltered in her retort to missus Lowder s joke
2514_149482_000013_000004	train-clean-100	 Oh it s precisely my point that mister Densher CAN T have had vast opportunities And then she smiled at him 
2514_149482_000013_000005	train-clean-100	 I wasn t away you know long 
none	none	It made everything in the oddest way in the world immediately right for him And I wasn t THERE long either He positively saw with it that nothing for him so far as she was concerned would again be wrong She s beautiful but I don t say she s easy to know
2514_149482_000015_000000	train-clean-100	 Ah she s a thousand and one things replied the good lady as if now to keep well with him 
2514_149482_000016_000000	train-clean-100	He asked nothing better 
2514_149482_000016_000001	train-clean-100	 She was off with you to these parts before I knew it 
none	none	I myself was off too away off to wonderful parts where I had endlessly more to see But you didn t forget her Aunt Maud interposed with almost menacing archness
2514_149482_000018_000000	train-clean-100	 No of course I didn t forget her 
none	none	One doesn t forget such charming impressions But I never he lucidly maintained chattered to others about her She ll thank you for that sir said missus Stringham with a flushed firmness Yet doesn t silence in such a case Aunt Maud blandly enquired very often quite prove the depth of the impression He would have been amused hadn t he been slightly displeased at all they seemed desirous to fasten on him
2514_149482_000021_000001	train-clean-100	 Well the impression was as deep as you like 
none	none	But I really want Miss Theale to know he pursued for missus Stringham that I don t figure by any consent of my own as an authority about her Kate came to his assistance if assistance it was before their friend had had time to meet this charge You re right about her not being easy to know One SEES her with intensity sees her more than one sees almost any one but then one discovers that that isn t knowing her and that one may know better a person whom one doesn t see as I say half so much The discrimination was interesting but it brought them back to the fact of her success and it was at that comparatively gross circumstance now so fully placed before them that Milly s anxious companion sat and looked looked very much as some spectator in an old time circus might have watched the oddity of a Christian maiden in the arena mildly caressingly martyred It was the nosing and fumbling not of lions and tigers but of domestic animals let loose as for the joke 
2514_149482_000023_000002	train-clean-100	Even the joke made missus Stringham uneasy and her mute communion with Densher to which we have alluded was more and more determined by it 
none	none	He wondered afterwards if Kate had made this out though it was not indeed till much later on that he found himself in thought dividing the things she might have been conscious of from the things she must have missed 
2514_149482_000023_000004	train-clean-100	If she actually missed at any rate missus Stringham s discomfort that but showed how her own idea held her 
none	none	Her own idea was by insisting on the fact of the girl s prominence as a feature of the season s end to keep Densher in relation for the rest of them both to present and to past It s everything that has happened SINCE that makes you naturally a little shy about her You don t know what has happened since but we do we ve seen it and followed it we ve a little been OF it The great thing for him at this as Kate gave it WAS in fact quite irresistibly that the case was a real one the kind of thing that when one s patience was shorter than one s curiosity one had vaguely taken for possible in London but in which one had never been even to this small extent concerned The little American s sudden social adventure her happy and no doubt harmless flourish had probably been favoured by several accidents but it had been favoured above all by the simple spring board of the scene by one of those common caprices of the numberless foolish flock gregarious movements as inscrutable as ocean currents The huddled herd had drifted to her blindly it might as blindly have drifted away There had been of course a signal but the great reason was probably the absence at the moment of a larger lion The bigger beast would come and the smaller would then incontinently vanish 
2514_149482_000023_000010	train-clean-100	It was at all events characteristic and what was of the essence of it was grist to his scribbling mill matter for his journalising hand 
2514_149482_000023_000011	train-clean-100	That hand already in intention played over it the motive as a sign of the season a feature of the time of the purely expeditious and rough and tumble nature of the social boom 
none	none	The boom as in ITSELF required that would be the note the subject of the process a comparatively minor question Anything was boomable enough when nothing else was more so the author of the rotten book the beauty who was no beauty the heiress who was only that the stranger who was for the most part saved from being inconveniently strange but by being inconveniently familiar the American whose Americanism had been long desperately discounted the creature in fine as to whom spangles or spots of any sufficiently marked and exhibited sort could be loudly enough predicated So he judged at least within his limits and the idea that what he had thus caught in the fact was the trick of fashion and the tone of society went so far as to make him take up again his sense of independence 
2514_149482_000024_000001	train-clean-100	He had supposed himself civilised but if this was civilisation 
none	none	One could smoke one s pipe outside when twaddle was within He had rather avoided as we have remarked Kate s eyes but there came a moment when he would fairly have liked to put it across the table to her I say light of my life is THIS the great world There came another it must be added and doubtless as a result of something that over the cloth did hang between them when she struck him as having quite answered Dear no for what do you take me Not the least little bit only a poor silly though quite harmless imitation What she might have passed for saying however was practically merged in what she did say for she came overtly to his aid very much as if guessing some of his thoughts She enunciated to relieve his bewilderment the obvious truth that you couldn t leave London for three months at that time of the year and come back to find your friends just where they were As they had OF COURSE been jigging away they might well be so red in the face that you wouldn t know them She reconciled in fine his disclaimer about Milly with that honour of having discovered her which it was vain for him modestly to shirk 
2514_149482_000024_000007	train-clean-100	He HAD unearthed her but it was they all of them together who had developed her 
2514_149482_000024_000008	train-clean-100	She was always a charmer one of the greatest ever seen but she wasn t the person he had backed 
none	none	Densher was to feel sure afterwards that Kate had had in these pleasantries no conscious above all no insolent purpose of making light of poor Susan Shepherd s property in their young friend which property by such remarks was very much pushed to the wall but he was also to know that missus Stringham had secretly resented them missus Stringham holding the opinion of which he was ultimately to have a glimpse that all the Kate Croys in Christendom were but dust for the feet of her Milly That it was true would be what she must reveal only when driven to her last entrenchments and well cornered in her passion the rare passion of friendship the sole passion of her little life save the one other more imperturbably cerebral that she entertained for the art of Guy de Maupassant She slipped in the observation that her Milly was incapable of change was just exactly on the contrary the same Milly but this made little difference in the drift of Kate s contention 
2514_149482_000025_000003	train-clean-100	She was perfectly kind to Susie it was as if she positively knew her as handicapped for any disagreement by feeling that she Kate had type and by being committed to admiration of type 
none	none	Kate had occasion subsequently she found it somehow to mention to our young man Milly s having spoken to her of this view on the good lady s part 
2514_149482_000025_000005	train-clean-100	She would like Milly had had it from her to put Kate Croy in a book and see what she could so do with her

2514_149482_000025_000007	train-clean-100	It would be missus Stringham s however she understood because missus Stringham oddly felt that with such stuff as the strange English girl was made of stuff that in spite of Maud Manningham who was full of sentiment she had never known there was none other to be employed 
none	none	These things were of later evidence yet Densher might even then have felt them in the air They were practically in it already when Kate waiving the question of her friend s chemical change wound up with the comparatively unobjectionable proposition that he must now having missed so much take them all up on trust further on 
2514_149482_000025_000009	train-clean-100	He met it peacefully a little perhaps as an example to missus Stringham Oh as far on as you like This even had its effect missus Stringham appropriated as much of it as might be meant for herself 
none	none	The nice thing about her was that she could measure how much so that by the time dinner was over they had really covered ground Book Sixth Chapter four The younger of the other men it afterwards appeared was most in his element at the piano so that they had coffee and comic songs upstairs the gentlemen temporarily relinquished submitting easily in this interest to missus Lowder s parting injunction not to sit too tight Our especial young man sat tighter when restored to the drawing room he made it out perfectly with Kate that they might off and on foregather without offence He had perhaps stronger needs in this general respect than she but she had better names for the scant risks to which she consented It was the blessing of a big house that intervals were large and of an August night that windows were open whereby at a given moment on the wide balcony with the songs sufficiently sung Aunt Maud could hold her little court more freshly Densher and Kate during these moments occupied side by side a small sofa a luxury formulated by the latter as the proof under criticism of their remarkably good conscience To seem not to know each other once you re here would be the girl said to overdo it and she arranged it charmingly that they MUST have some passage to put Aunt Maud off the scent She would be wondering otherwise what in the world they found their account in For Densher none the less the profit of snatched moments snatched contacts was partial and poor there were in particular at present more things in his mind than he could bring out while watching the windows It was true on the other hand that she suddenly met most of them and more than he could see on the spot by coming out for him with a reference to Milly that was not in the key of those made at dinner She s not a bit right you know I mean in health Just see her to night I mean it looks grave For you she would have come you know if it had been at all possible He took this in such patience as he could muster What in the world s the matter with her But Kate continued without saying Unless indeed your being here has been just a reason for her funking it What in the world s the matter with her Densher asked again Why just what I ve told you that she likes you so much Then why should she deny herself the joy of meeting me Kate cast about it would take so long to explain And perhaps it s true that she IS bad She easily may be Quite easily I should say judging by missus Stringham who s visibly preoccupied and worried Visibly enough Yet it mayn t said Kate be only for that For what then But this question too on thinking she neglected Why if it s anything real doesn t that poor lady go home She d be anxious and she has done all she need to be civil I think Densher remarked she has been quite beautifully civil It made Kate he fancied look at him the least bit harder but she was already in a manner explaining Her preoccupation is probably on two different heads One of them would make her hurry back but the other makes her stay She s commissioned to tell Milly all about you Well then said the young man between a laugh and a sigh I m glad I felt downstairs a kind of drawing to her Wasn t I rather decent to her Awfully nice You ve instincts you fiend It s all Kate declared as it should be Except perhaps he after a moment cynically suggested that she isn t getting much good of me now Will she report to Milly on THIS And then as Kate seemed to wonder what this might be On our present disregard for appearances Ah leave appearances to me She spoke in her high way I ll make them all right Aunt Maud moreover she added has her so engaged that she won t notice Densher felt with this that his companion had indeed perceptive flights he couldn t hope to match had for instance another when she still subjoined And missus Stringham s appearing to respond just in order to make that impression Well Densher dropped with some humour life s very interesting I hope it s really as much so for you as you make it for others I mean judging by what you make it for me You seem to me to represent it as thrilling for ces dames in a different way for each Aunt Maud Susan Shepherd Milly But what IS he wound up the matter Do you mean she s as ill as she looks Kate s face struck him as replying at first that his derisive speech deserved no satisfaction then she appeared to yield to a need of her own the need to make the point that as ill as she looked was what Milly scarce could be If she had been as ill as she looked she could scarce be a question with them for her end would in that case be near She believed herself nevertheless and Kate couldn t help believing her too seriously menaced There was always the fact that they had been on the point of leaving town the two ladies and had suddenly been pulled up We bade them good bye or all but Aunt Maud and I the night before Milly popping so very oddly into the National Gallery for a farewell look found you and me together They were then to get off a day or two later But they ve not got off they re not getting off When I see them and I saw them this morning they have showy reasons They do mean to go but they ve postponed it With which the girl brought out They ve postponed it for YOU He protested so far as a man might without fatuity since a protest was itself credulous but Kate as ever understood herself You ve made Milly change her mind She wants not to miss you though she wants also not to show she wants you which is why as I hinted a moment ago she may consciously have hung back to night She doesn t know when she may see you again she doesn t know she ever may She doesn t see the future It has opened out before her in these last weeks as a dark confused thing Densher wondered After the tremendous time you ve all been telling me she has had That s it There s a shadow across it The shadow you consider of some physical break up Some physical break down Nothing less She s scared She has so much to lose And she wants more Ah well said Densher with a sudden strange sense of discomfort couldn t one say to her that she can t have everything No for one wouldn t want to She really Kate went on has been somebody here Ask Aunt Maud you may think me prejudiced the girl oddly smiled Aunt Maud will tell you the world s before her It has all come since you saw her and it s a pity you ve missed it for it certainly would have amused you She has really been a perfect success I mean of course so far as possible in the scrap of time and she has taken it like a perfect angel If you can imagine an angel with a thumping bank account you ll have the simplest expression of the kind of thing Her fortune s absolutely huge Aunt Maud has had all the facts or enough of them in the last confidence from Susie and Susie speaks by book Take them then in the last confidence from ME There she is Kate expressed above all what it most came to It s open to her to make you see the very greatest marriage I assure you we re not vulgar about her Her possibilities are quite plain Densher showed he neither disbelieved nor grudged them But what good then on earth can I do her Well she had it ready You can console her And for what For all that if she s stricken she must see swept away I shouldn t care for her if she hadn t so much Kate very simply said And then as it made him laugh not quite happily I shouldn t trouble about her if there were one thing she did have The girl spoke indeed with a noble compassion She has nothing Not all the young dukes Well we must see see if anything can come of them She at any rate does love life To have met a person like you Kate further explained is to have felt you become with all the other fine things a part of life Oh she has you arranged YOU have it strikes me my dear and he looked both detached and rueful Pray what am I to do with the dukes Oh the dukes will be disappointed Then why shan t I be You ll have expected less Kate wonderfully smiled Besides you WILL be You ll have expected enough for that Yet it s what you want to let me in for I want said the girl to make things pleasant for her I use for the purpose what I have You re what I have of most precious and you re therefore what I use most He looked at her long I wish I could use YOU a little more After which as she continued to smile at him Is it a bad case of lungs he asked Kate showed for a little as if she wished it might be Not lungs I think Isn t consumption taken in time now curable People are no doubt patched up But he wondered Do you mean she has something that s past patching And before she could answer It s really as if her appearance put her outside of such things being in spite of her youth that of a person who has been through all it s conceivable she should be exposed to She affects one I should say as a creature saved from a shipwreck Such a creature may surely in these days on the doctrine of chances go to sea again with confidence She has HAD her wreck she has met her adventure Oh I grant you her wreck Kate was all response so far But do let her have still her adventure There are wrecks that are not adventures Well if there be also adventures that are not wrecks Densher in short was willing but he came back to his point What I mean is that she has none of the effect on one s nerves or whatever of an invalid Kate on her side did this justice No that s the beauty of her The beauty Yes she s so wonderful She won t show for that any more than your watch when it s about to stop for want of being wound up gives you convenient notice or shows as different from usual She won t die she won t live by inches She won t smell as it were of drugs She won t taste as it were of medicine No one will know Then what he demanded frankly mystified now are we talking about In what extraordinary state IS she Kate went on as if at this making it out in a fashion for herself I believe that if she s ill at all she s very ill I believe that if she s bad she s not a LITTLE bad I can t tell you why but that s how I see her She ll really live or she ll really not She ll have it all or she ll miss it all Now I don t think she ll have it all Densher had followed this with his eyes upon her her own having thoughtfully wandered and as if it were more impressive than lucid You think and you don t think and yet you remain all the while without an inkling of her complaint No not without an inkling but it s a matter in which I don t want knowledge She moreover herself doesn t want one to want it she has as to what may be preying upon her a kind of ferocity of modesty a kind of I don t know what to call it intensity of pride And then and then But with this she faltered And then what I m a brute about illness I hate it It s well for you my dear Kate continued that you re as sound as a bell Thank you Densher laughed It s rather good then for yourself too that you re as strong as the sea She looked at him now a moment as for the selfish gladness of their young immunities It was all they had together but they had it at least without a flaw each had the beauty the physical felicity the personal virtue love and desire of the other Yet it was as if that very consciousness threw them back the next moment into pity for the poor girl who had everything else in the world the great genial good they alas didn t have but failed on the other hand of this How we re talking about her Kate compunctiously sighed But there were the facts From illness I keep away But you don t since here you are in spite of all you say in the midst of it Ah I m only watching And putting me forward in your place Thank you Oh said Kate I m breaking you in Let it give you the measure of what I shall expect of you One can t begin too soon She drew away as from the impression of a stir on the balcony the hand of which he had a minute before possessed himself and the warning brought him back to attention You haven t even an idea if it s a case for surgery I dare say it may be that is that if it comes to anything it may come to that Of course she s in the highest hands The doctors are after her then She s after THEM it s the same thing I think I m free to say it now she sees Sir Luke Strett It made him quickly wince Ah fifty thousand knives Then after an instant One seems to guess Yes but she waved it away Don t guess Only do as I tell you For a moment now in silence he took it all in might have had it before him What you want of me then is to make up to a sick girl Ah but you admit yourself that she doesn t affect you as sick You understand moreover just how much and just how little It s amazing he presently answered what you think I understand Well if you ve brought me to it my dear she returned that has been your way of breaking ME in Besides which so far as making up to her goes plenty of others will Densher for a little under this suggestion might have been seeing their young friend on a pile of cushions and in a perpetual tea gown amid flowers and with drawn blinds surrounded by the higher nobility Others can follow their tastes Besides others are free But so are you my dear She had spoken with impatience and her suddenly quitting him had sharpened it in spite of which he kept his place only looking up at her You re prodigious Of course I m prodigious and as immediately happened she gave a further sign of it that he fairly sat watching The door from the lobby had as she spoke been thrown open for a gentleman who immediately finding her within his view advanced to greet her before the announcement of his name could reach her companion Densher none the less felt himself brought quickly into relation Kate s welcome to the visitor became almost precipitately an appeal to her friend who slowly rose to meet it I don t know whether you know Lord Mark And then for the other party mister Merton Densher who has just come back from America Oh said the other party while Densher said nothing occupied as he mainly was on the spot with weighing the sound in question He recognised it in a moment as less imponderable than it might have appeared as having indeed positive claims It wasn t that is he knew the Oh of the idiot however great the superficial resemblance it was that of the clever the accomplished man it was the very specialty of the speaker and a deal of expensive training and experience had gone to producing it Densher felt somehow that as a thing of value accidentally picked up it would retain an interest of curiosity The three stood for a little together in an awkwardness to which he was conscious of contributing his share Kate failing to ask Lord Mark to be seated but letting him know that he would find missus Lowder with some others on the balcony Oh and Miss Theale I suppose as I seemed to hear outside from below missus Stringham s unmistakeable voice Yes but missus Stringham s alone Milly s unwell the girl explained and was compelled to disappoint us Ah disappoint rather And lingering a little he kept his eyes on Densher She isn t really bad I trust Densher after all he had heard easily supposed him interested in Milly but he could imagine him also interested in the young man with whom he had found Kate engaged and whom he yet considered without visible intelligence That young man concluded in a moment that he was doing what he wanted satisfying himself as to each To this he was aided by Kate who produced a prompt Oh dear no I think not I ve just been reassuring mister Densher she added who s as concerned as the rest of us I ve been calming his fears Oh said Lord Mark again and again it was just as good That was for Densher the latter could see or think he saw And then for the others MY fears would want calming We must take great care of her This way She went with him a few steps and while Densher hanging about gave them frank attention presently paused again for some further colloquy What passed between them their observer lost but she was presently with him again Lord Mark joining the rest Densher was by this time quite ready for her It s HE who s your aunt s man Oh immensely I mean for YOU That s what I mean too Kate smiled There he is Now you can judge Judge of what Judge of him Why should I judge of him Densher asked I ve nothing to do with him Then why do you ask about him To judge of you which is different Kate seemed for a little to look at the difference To take the measure do you mean of my danger He hesitated then he said I m thinking I dare say of Miss Theale s How does your aunt reconcile his interest in her With his interest in me With her own interest in you Densher said while she reflected If that interest missus Lowder s takes the form of Lord Mark hasn t he rather to look out for the forms HE takes Kate seemed interested in the question but Oh he takes them easily she answered The beauty is that she doesn t trust him That Milly doesn t Yes Milly either But I mean Aunt Maud Not really Densher gave it his wonder Takes him to her heart and yet thinks he cheats Yes said Kate that s the way people are What they think of their enemies goodness knows is bad enough but I m still more struck with what they think of their friends Milly s own state of mind however she went on is lucky That s Aunt Maud s security though she doesn t yet fully recognise it besides being Milly s own You conceive it a real escape then not to care for him She shook her head in beautiful grave deprecation You oughtn t to make me say too much But I m glad I don t Don t say too much Don t care for Lord Mark Oh Densher answered with a sound like his lordship s own To which he added You absolutely hold that that poor girl doesn t Ah you know what I hold about that poor girl It had made her again impatient Yet he stuck a minute to the subject You scarcely call him I suppose one of the dukes Mercy no far from it He s not compared with other possibilities in it Milly it s true she said to be exact has no natural sense of social values doesn t in the least understand our differences or know who s who or what s what I see That Densher laughed is her reason for liking ME Precisely She doesn t resemble me said Kate who at least know what I lose Well it had all risen for Densher to a considerable interest And Aunt Maud why shouldn t SHE know I mean that your friend there isn t really anything Does she suppose him of ducal value Scarcely save in the sense of being uncle to a duke That s undeniably something He s the best moreover we can get Oh oh said Densher and his doubt was not all derisive It isn t Lord Mark s grandeur she went on without heeding this because perhaps in the line of that alone as he has no money more could be done But she s not a bit sordid she only counts with the sordidness of others Besides he s grand enough with a duke in his family and at the other end of the string THE thing s his genius And do you believe in that In Lord Mark s genius Kate as if for a more final opinion than had yet been asked of her took a moment to think She balanced indeed so that one would scarce have known what to expect but she came out in time with a very sufficient Yes Political Universal I don t know at least she said what else to call it when a man s able to make himself without effort without violence without machinery of any sort so intensely felt He has somehow an effect without his being in any traceable way a cause Ah but if the effect said Densher with conscious superficiality isn t agreeable Oh but it is Not surely for every one If you mean not for you Kate returned you may have reasons and men don t count Women don t know if it s agreeable or not Then there you are Yes precisely that takes on his part genius Densher stood before her as if he wondered what everything she thus promptly easily and above all amusingly met him with would have been found should it have come to an analysis to take Something suddenly as if under a last determinant touch welled up in him and overflowed the sense of his good fortune and her variety of the future she promised the interest she supplied All women but you are stupid How can I look at another You re different and different and then you re different again No marvel Aunt Maud builds on you except that you re so much too good for what she builds FOR Even society won t know how good for it you are it s too stupid and you re beyond it You d have to pull it uphill it s you yourself who are at the top The women one meets what are they but books one has already read You re a whole library of the unknown the uncut He almost moaned he ached from the depth of his content Upon my word I ve a subscription She took it from him with her face again giving out all it had in answer and they remained once more confronted and united in their essential wealth of life It s you who draw me out I exist in you Not in others It had been however as if the thrill of their association itself pressed in him as great felicities do the sharp spring of fear See here you know don t DON T Don t what Don t fail me It would kill me She looked at him a minute with no response but her eyes So you think you ll kill ME in time to prevent it She smiled but he saw her the next instant as smiling through tears and the instant after this she had got in respect to the particular point quite off She had come back to another which was one of her own her own were so closely connected that Densher s were at best but parenthetic Still she had a distance to go You do then see your way She put it to him before they joined as was high time the others And she made him understand she meant his way with Milly He had dropped a little in presence of the explanation then she had brought him up to a sort of recognition He could make out by this light something of what he saw but a dimness also there was undispelled since his return There s something you must definitely tell me If our friend knows that all the while She came straight to his aid formulating for him his anxiety though quite to smooth it down All the while she and I here were growing intimate you and I were in unmentioned relation If she knows that yes she knows our relation must have involved your writing to me Then how could she suppose you weren t answering She doesn t suppose it How then can she imagine you never named her She doesn t She knows now I did name her I ve told her everything She s in possession of reasons that will perfectly do Still he just brooded She takes things from you exactly as I take them Exactly as you take them She s just such another victim Just such another You re a pair Then if anything happens said Densher we can console each other Ah something MAY indeed happen she returned if you ll only go straight He watched the others an instant through the window What do you mean by going straight Not worrying Doing as you like Try as I ve told you before and you ll see You ll have me perfectly always to refer to Oh rather I hope But if she s going away It pulled Kate up but a moment I ll bring her back There you are You won t be able to say I haven t made it smooth for you He faced it all and certainly it was queer But it wasn t the queerness that after another minute was uppermost He was in a wondrous silken web and it WAS amusing You spoil me He wasn t sure if missus Lowder who at this juncture reappeared had caught his word as it dropped from him probably not he thought her attention being given to missus Stringham with whom she came through and who was now none too soon taking leave of her They were followed by Lord Mark and by the other men but two or three things happened before any dispersal of the company began One of these was that Kate found time to say to him with furtive emphasis You must go now Another was that she next addressed herself in all frankness to Lord Mark drew near to him with an almost reproachful Come and talk to ME a challenge resulting after a minute for Densher in a consciousness of their installation together in an out of the way corner though not the same he himself had just occupied with her Still another was that missus Stringham in the random intensity of her farewells affected him as looking at him with a small grave intimation something into which he afterwards read the meaning that if he had happened to desire a few words with her after dinner he would have found her ready This impression was naturally light but it just left him with the sense of something by his own act overlooked unappreciated It gathered perhaps a slightly sharper shade from the mild formality of her Good night sir as she passed him a matter as to which there was now nothing more to be done thanks to the alertness of the young man he by this time had appraised as even more harmless than himself This personage had forestalled him in opening the door for her and was evidently with a view Densher might have judged to ulterior designs on Milly proposing to attend her to her carriage What further occurred was that Aunt Maud having released her immediately had a word for himself It was an imperative Wait a minute by which she both detained and dismissed him she was particular about her minute but he hadn t yet given her as happened a sign of withdrawal Return to our little friend You ll find her really interesting If you mean Miss Theale he said I shall certainly not forget her But you must remember that so far as her interest is concerned I myself discovered I as was said at dinner invented her Well one seemed rather to gather that you hadn t taken out the patent Don t I only mean in the press of other things too much neglect her Affected surprised by the coincidence of her appeal with Kate s he asked himself quickly if it mightn t help him with her He at any rate could but try You re all looking after my manners That s exactly you know what Miss Croy has been saying to me SHE keeps me up she has had so much to say about them He found pleasure in being able to give his hostess an account of his passage with Kate that while quite veracious might be reassuring to herself But Aunt Maud wonderfully and facing him straight took it as if her confidence were supplied with other props If she saw his intention in it she yet blinked neither with doubt nor with acceptance she only said imperturbably Yes she ll herself do anything for her friend so that she but preaches what she practises Densher really quite wondered if Aunt Maud knew how far Kate s devotion went He was moreover a little puzzled by this special harmony in face of which he quickly asked himself if missus Lowder had bethought herself of the American girl as a distraction for him and if Kate s mastery of the subject were therefore but an appearance addressed to her aunt What might really BECOME in all this of the American girl was therefore a question that on the latter contingency would lose none of its sharpness However questions could wait and it was easy so far as he understood to meet missus Lowder It isn t a bit all the same you know that I resist I find Miss Theale charming Well it was all she wanted Then don t miss a chance The only thing is he went on that she s naturally now leaving town and as I take it going abroad Aunt Maud looked indeed an instant as if she herself had been dealing with this difficulty She won t go she smiled in spite of it till she has seen you Moreover when she does go She paused leaving him uncertain But the next minute he was still more at sea We shall go too He gave a smile that he himself took for slightly strange And what good will that do ME We shall be near them somewhere and you ll come out to us Oh he said a little awkwardly I ll see that you do I mean I ll write to you Ah thank you thank you Merton Densher laughed She was indeed putting him on his honour and his honour winced a little at the use he rather helplessly saw himself suffering her to believe she could make of it There are all sorts of things he vaguely remarked to consider No doubt But there s above all the great thing And pray what s that Why the importance of your not losing the occasion of your life I m treating you handsomely I m looking after it for you I CAN I can smooth your path She s charming she s clever and she s good And her fortune s a real fortune Ah there she was Aunt Maud The pieces fell together for him as he felt her thus buying him off and buying him it would have been funny if it hadn t been so grave with Miss Theale s money He ventured derisive fairly to treat it as extravagant I m much obliged to you for the handsome offer Of what doesn t belong to me She wasn t abashed I don t say it does but there s no reason it shouldn t to YOU Mind you moreover she kept it up I m not one who talks in the air And you owe me something if you want to know why Distinct he felt her pressure he felt given her basis her consistency he even felt to a degree that was immediately to receive an odd confirmation her truth Her truth for that matter was that she believed him bribeable a belief that for his own mind as well while they stood there lighted up the impossible What then in this light did Kate believe him But that wasn t what he asked aloud Of course I know I owe you thanks for a deal of kind treatment Your inviting me for instance to night Yes my inviting you to night s a part of it But you don t know she added how far I ve gone for you He felt himself red and as if his honour were colouring up but he laughed again as he could I see how far you re going I m the most honest woman in the world but I ve nevertheless done for you what was necessary And then as her now quite sombre gravity only made him stare To start you it WAS necessary From ME it has the weight He but continued to stare and she met his blankness with surprise Don t you understand me I ve told the proper lie for you Still he only showed her his flushed strained smile in spite of which speaking with force and as if he must with a minute s reflexion see what she meant she turned away from him I depend upon you now to make me right The minute s reflexion he was of course more free to take after he had left the house He walked up the Bayswater Road but he stopped short under the murky stars before the modern church in the middle of the square that going eastward opened out on his left He had had his brief stupidity but now he understood She had guaranteed to Milly Theale through missus Stringham that Kate didn t care for him She had affirmed through the same source that the attachment was only his He made it out he made it out and he could see what she meant by its starting him She had described Kate as merely compassionate so that Milly might be compassionate too Proper indeed it was her lie the very properest possible and the most deeply richly diplomatic So Milly was successfully deceived Book Sixth Chapter five To see her alone the poor girl he none the less promptly felt was to see her after all very much on the old basis the basis of his three visits in New York the new element when once he was again face to face with her not really amounting to much more than a recognition with a little surprise of the positive extent of the old basis Everything but that everything embarrassing fell away after he had been present five minutes it was in fact wonderful that their excellent their pleasant their permitted and proper and harmless American relation the legitimacy of which he could thus scarce express in names enough should seem so unperturbed by other matters They had both since then had great adventures such an adventure for him was his mental annexation of her country and it was now for the moment as if the greatest of them all were this acquired consciousness of reasons other than those that had already served Densher had asked for her at her hotel the day after Aunt Maud s dinner with a rich that is with a highly troubled preconception of the part likely to be played for him at present in any contact with her by Kate s and missus Lowder s so oddly conjoined and so really superfluous attempts to make her interesting She had been interesting enough without them that appeared to day to come back to him and admirable and beautiful as was the charitable zeal of the two ladies it might easily have nipped in the bud the germs of a friendship inevitably limited but still perfectly open to him What had happily averted the need of his breaking off what would as happily continue to avert it was his own good sense and good humour a certain spring of mind in him which ministered imagination aiding to understandings and allowances and which he had positively never felt such ground as just now to rejoice in the possession of Many men he practically made the reflexion wouldn t have taken the matter that way would have lost patience finding the appeal in question irrational exorbitant and thereby making short work with it would have let it render any further acquaintance with Miss Theale impossible He had talked with Kate of this young woman s being sacrificed and that would have been one way so far as he was concerned to sacrifice her Such however had not been the tune to which his at first bewildered view had since the night before cleared itself up It wasn t so much that he failed of being the kind of man who chucked for he knew himself as the kind of man wise enough to mark the case in which chucking might be the minor evil and the least cruelty It was that he liked too much every one concerned willingly to show himself merely impracticable He liked Kate goodness knew and he also clearly enough liked missus Lowder He liked in particular Milly herself and hadn t it come up for him the evening before that he quite liked even Susan Shepherd He had never known himself so generally merciful It was a footing at all events whatever accounted for it on which he should surely be rather a muff not to manage by one turn or another to escape disobliging Should he find he couldn t work it there would still be time enough The idea of working it crystallised before him in such guise as not only to promise much interest fairly in case of success much enthusiasm but positively to impart to failure an appearance of barbarity Arriving thus in Brook Street both with the best intentions and with a margin consciously left for some primary awkwardness he found his burden to his great relief unexpectedly light The awkwardness involved in the responsibility so newly and so ingeniously traced for him turned round on the spot to present him another face This was simply the face of his old impression which he now fully recovered the impression that American girls when rare case they had the attraction of Milly were clearly the easiest people in the world Had what had happened been that this specimen of the class was from the first so committed to ease that nothing subsequent COULD ever make her difficult That affected him now as still more probable than on the occasion of the hour or two lately passed with her in Kate s society Milly Theale had recognised no complication to Densher s view while bringing him with his companion from the National Gallery and entertaining them at luncheon it was therefore scarce supposable that complications had become so soon too much for her His pretext for presenting himself was fortunately of the best and simplest the least he could decently do given their happy acquaintance was to call with an enquiry after learning that she had been prevented by illness from meeting him at dinner And then there was the beautiful accident of her other demonstration he must at any rate have given a sign as a sequel to the hospitality he had shared with Kate Well he was giving one now such as it was he was finding her to begin with accessible and very naturally and prettily glad to see him He had come after luncheon early though not so early but that she might already be out if she were well enough and she was well enough and yet was still at home He had an inner glimpse with this of the comment Kate would have made on it it wasn t absent from his thought that Milly would have been at home by HER account because expecting after a talk with missus Stringham that a certain person might turn up He even so pleasantly did things go enjoyed freedom of mind to welcome on that supposition a fresh sign of the beautiful hypocrisy of women He went so far as to enjoy believing the girl MIGHT have stayed in for him it helped him to enjoy her behaving as if she hadn t She expressed that is exactly the right degree of surprise she didn t a bit overdo it the lesson of which was perceptibly that so far as his late lights had opened the door to any want of the natural in their meetings he might trust her to take care of it for him as well as for herself She had begun this admirably on his entrance with her turning away from the table at which she had apparently been engaged in letter writing it was the very possibility of his betraying a concern for her as one of the afflicted that she had within the first minute conjured away She was never never did he understand to be one of the afflicted for him and the manner in which he understood it something of the answering pleasure that he couldn t help knowing he showed constituted he was very soon after to acknowledge something like a start for intimacy When things like that could pass people had in truth to be equally conscious of a relation It soon made one at all events when it didn t find one made She had let him ask there had been time for that his allusion to her friend s explanatory arrival at Lancaster Gate without her being inevitable but she had blown away and quite as much with the look in her eyes as with the smile on her lips every ground for anxiety and every chance for insistence How was she why she was as he thus saw her and as she had reasons of her own nobody else s business for desiring to appear Kate s account of her as too proud for pity as fiercely shy about so personal a secret came back to him so that he rejoiced he could take a hint especially when he wanted to The question the girl had quickly disposed of Oh it was nothing I m all right thank you was one he was glad enough to be able to banish It wasn t at all in spite of the appeal Kate had made to him on it his affair for his interest had been invoked in the name of compassion and the name of compassion was exactly what he felt himself at the end of two minutes forbidden so much as to whisper He had been sent to see her in order to be sorry for her and how sorry he might be quite privately he was yet to make out Didn t that signify however almost not at all inasmuch as whatever his upshot he was never to give her a glimpse of it Thus the ground was unexpectedly cleared though it was not till a slightly longer time had passed that he read clear at first with amusement and then with a strange shade of respect what had most operated Extraordinarily quite amazingly he began to see that if his pity hadn t had to yield to still other things it would have had to yield quite definitely to her own That was the way the case had turned round he had made his visit to be sorry for her but he would repeat it if he did repeat it in order that she might be sorry for him His situation made him she judged when once one liked him a subject for that degree of tenderness he felt this judgement in her and felt it as something he should really in decency in dignity in common honesty have very soon to reckon with Odd enough was it certainly that the question originally before him the question placed there by Kate should so of a sudden find itself quite dislodged by another This other it was easy to see came straight up with the fact of her beautiful delusion and her wasted charity the whole thing preparing for him as pretty a case of conscience as he could have desired and one at the prospect of which he was already wincing If he was interesting it was because he was unhappy and if he was unhappy it was because his passion for Kate had spent itself in vain and if Kate was indifferent inexorable it was because she had left Milly in no doubt of it That above all was what came up for him how clear an impression of this attitude how definite an account of his own failure Kate must have given her friend His immediate quarter of an hour there with the girl lighted up for him almost luridly such an inference it was almost as if the other party to their remarkable understanding had been with them as they talked had been hovering about had dropped in to look after her work The value of the work affected him as different from the moment he saw it so expressed in poor Milly Since it was false that he wasn t loved so his right was quite quenched to figure on that ground as important and if he didn t look out he should find himself appreciating in a way quite at odds with straightness the good faith of Milly s benevolence THERE was the place for scruples there the need absolutely to mind what he was about If it wasn t proper for him to enjoy consideration on a perfectly false footing where was the guarantee that if he kept on he mightn t soon himself pretend to the grievance in order not to miss the sweet Consideration from a charming girl was soothing on whatever theory and it didn t take him far to remember that he had himself as yet done nothing deceptive It was Kate s description of him his defeated state it was none of his own his responsibility would begin as he might say only with acting it out The sharp point was however in the difference between acting and not acting this difference in fact it was that made the case of conscience He saw it with a certain alarm rise before him that everything was acting that was not speaking the particular word If you like me because you think SHE doesn t it isn t a bit true she DOES like me awfully that would have been the particular word which there were at the same time but too palpably such difficulties about his uttering Wouldn t it be virtually as indelicate to challenge her as to leave her deluded and this quite apart from the exposure so to speak of Kate as to whom it would constitute a kind of betrayal Kate s design was something so extraordinarily special to Kate that he felt himself shrink from the complications involved in judging it Not to give away the woman one loved but to back her up in her mistakes once they had gone a certain length that was perhaps chief among the inevitabilities of the abjection of love Loyalty was of course supremely prescribed in presence of any design on her part however roundabout to do one nothing but good Densher had quite to steady himself not to be awestruck at the immensity of the good his own friend must on all this evidence have wanted to do him Of one thing indeed meanwhile he was sure Milly Theale wouldn t herself precipitate his necessity of intervention She would absolutely never say to him IS it so impossible she shall ever care for you seriously without which nothing could well be less delicate than for him aggressively to set her right Kate would be free to do that if Kate in some prudence some contrition for some better reason in fine should revise her plan but he asked himself what failing this HE could do that wouldn t be after all more gross than doing nothing This brought him round again to the acceptance of the fact that the poor girl liked him She put it for reasons of her own on a simple a beautiful ground a ground that already supplied her with the pretext she required The ground was there that is in the impression she had received retained cherished the pretext over and above it was the pretext for acting on it That she now believed as she did made her sure at last that she might act so that what Densher therefore would have struck at would be the root in her soul of a pure pleasure It positively lifted its head and flowered this pure pleasure while the young man now sat with her and there were things she seemed to say that took the words out of his mouth These were not all the things she did say they were rather what such things meant in the light of what he knew Her warning him for instance off the question of how she was the quick brave little art with which she did that represented to his fancy a truth she didn t utter I m well for YOU that s all you have to do with or need trouble about I shall never be anything so horrid as ill for you So there you are worry about me spare me please as little as you can Don t be afraid in short to ignore my interesting side It isn t you see even now while you sit here that there aren t lots of others Only do THEM justice and we shall get on beautifully This was what was folded finely up in her talk all quite ostensibly about her impressions and her intentions She tried to put Densher again on his American doings but he wouldn t have that to day As he thought of the way in which the other afternoon before Kate he had sat complacently jawing he accused himself of excess of having overdone it having made at least apparently more of a set at their entertainer than he was at all events then intending He turned the tables drawing her out about London about her vision of life there and only too glad to treat her as a person with whom he could easily have other topics than her aches and pains He spoke to her above all of the evidence offered him at Lancaster Gate that she had come but to conquer and when she had met this with full and gay assent How could I help being the feature of the season the what do you call it the theme of every tongue they fraternised freely over all that had come and gone for each since their interrupted encounter in New York At the same time while many things in quick succession came up for them came up in particular for Densher nothing perhaps was just so sharp as the odd influence of their present conditions on their view of their past ones It was as if they hadn t known how thick they had originally become as if in a manner they had really fallen to remembrance of more passages of intimacy than there had in fact at the time quite been room for They were in a relation now so complicated whether by what they said or by what they didn t say that it might have been seeking to justify its speedy growth by reaching back to one of those fabulous periods in which prosperous states place their beginnings He recalled what had been said at missus Lowder s about the steps and stages in people s careers that absence caused one to miss and about the resulting frequent sense of meeting them further on which with some other matters also recalled he took occasion to communicate to Milly The matters he couldn t mention mingled themselves with those he did so that it would doubtless have been hard to say which of the two groups now played most of a part He was kept face to face with this young lady by a force absolutely resident in their situation and operating for his nerves with the swiftness of the forces commonly regarded by sensitive persons as beyond their control The current thus determined had positively become for him by the time he had been ten minutes in the room something that but for the absurdity of comparing the very small with the very great he would freely have likened to the rapids of Niagara An uncriticised acquaintance between a clever young man and a responsive young woman could do nothing more at the most than go and his actual experiment went and went and went Nothing probably so conduced to make it go as the marked circumstance that they had spoken all the while not a word about Kate and this in spite of the fact that if it were a question for them of what had occurred in the past weeks nothing had occurred comparable to Kate s predominance Densher had but the night before appealed to her for instruction as to what he must do about her but he fairly winced to find how little this came to She had foretold him of course how little but it was a truth that looked different when shown him by Milly It proved to him that the latter had in fact been dealt with but it produced in him the thought that Kate might perhaps again conveniently be questioned He would have liked to speak to her before going further to make sure she really meant him to succeed quite so much With all the difference that as we say came up for him it came up afresh naturally that he might make his visit brief and never renew it yet the strangest thing of all was that the argument against that issue would have sprung precisely from the beautiful little eloquence involved in Milly s avoidances Precipitate these well might be since they emphasised the fact that she was proceeding in the sense of the assurances she had taken Over the latter she had visibly not hesitated for hadn t they had the merit of giving her a chance Densher quite saw her felt her take it the chance neither more nor less of help rendered him according to her freedom It was what Kate had left her with Listen to him I Never So do as you like What Milly liked was to do it thus appeared as she was doing our young man s glimpse of which was just what would have been for him not less a glimpse of the peculiar brutality of shaking her off The choice exhaled its shy fragrance of heroism for it was not aided by any question of parting with Kate She would be charming to Kate as well as to Kate s adorer she would incur whatever pain could dwell for her in the sight should she continue to be exposed to the sight of the adorer thrown with the adored It wouldn t really have taken much more to make him wonder if he hadn t before him one of those rare cases of exaltation food for fiction food for poetry in which a man s fortune with the woman who doesn t care for him is positively promoted by the woman who does It was as if Milly had said to herself Well he can at least meet her in my society if that s anything to him so that my line can only be to make my society attractive She certainly couldn t have made a different impression if she HAD so reasoned All of which none the less didn t prevent his soon enough saying to her quite as if she were to be whirled into space And now then what becomes of you Do you begin to rush about on visits to country houses She disowned the idea with a headshake that put on what face she would couldn t help betraying to him something of her suppressed view of the possibility ever ever perhaps of any such proceedings They weren t at any rate for her now Dear no We go abroad for a few weeks somewhere of high air That has been before us for many days we ve only been kept on by last necessities here However everything s done and the wind s in our sails May you scud then happily before it But when he asked do you come back She looked ever so vague then as if to correct it Oh when the wind turns And what do you do with your summer Ah I spend it in sordid toil I drench it with mercenary ink My work in your country counts for play as well You see what s thought of the pleasure your country can give My holiday s over I m sorry you had to take it said Milly at such a different time from ours If you could but have worked while we ve been working I might be playing while you play Oh the distinction isn t great with me There s a little of each for me of work and of play in either But you and missus Stringham with Miss Croy and missus Lowder you all he went on have been given up like navvies or niggers to real physical toil Your rest is something you ve earned and you need My labour s comparatively light Very true she smiled but all the same I like mine It doesn t leave you done Not a bit I don t get tired when I m interested Oh I could go far He bethought himself Then why don t you since you ve got here as I learn the whole place in your pocket Well it s a kind of economy I m saving things up I ve enjoyed so what you speak of though your account of it s fantastic that I m watching over its future that I can t help being anxious and careful I want in the interest itself of what I ve had and may still have not to make stupid mistakes The way not to make them is to get off again to a distance and see the situation from there I shall keep it fresh she wound up as if herself rather pleased with the ingenuity of her statement I shall keep it fresh by that prudence for my return Ah then you WILL return Can you promise one that Her face fairly lighted at his asking for a promise but she made as if bargaining a little Isn t London rather awful in winter He had been going to ask her if she meant for the invalid but he checked the infelicity of this and took the enquiry as referring to social life No I like it with one thing and another it s less of a mob than later on and it would have for US the merit should you come here then that we should probably see more of you So do reappear for us if it isn t a question of climate She looked at that a little graver If what isn t a question Why the determination of your movements You spoke just now of going somewhere for that For better air she remembered Oh yes one certainly wants to get out of London in August Rather of course he fully understood Though I m glad you ve hung on long enough for me to catch you Try us at any rate he continued once more Whom do you mean by us she presently asked It pulled him up an instant representing as he saw it might have seemed an allusion to himself as conjoined with Kate whom he was proposing not to mention any more than his hostess did But the issue was easy I mean all of us together every one you ll find ready to surround you with sympathy It made her none the less in her odd charming way challenge him afresh Why do you say sympathy Well it s doubtless a pale word What we SHALL feel for you will be much nearer worship As near then as you like With which at last Kate s name was sounded The people I d most come back for are the people you know I d do it for missus Lowder who has been beautifully kind to me So she has to ME said Densher I feel he added as she at first answered nothing that quite contrary to anything I originally expected I ve made a good friend of her I didn t expect it either its turning out as it has But I did said Milly with Kate I shall come back for her too I d do anything she kept it up for Kate Looking at him as with conscious clearness while she spoke she might for the moment have effectively laid a trap for whatever remains of the ideal straightness in him were still able to pull themselves together and operate He was afterwards to say to himself that something had at that moment hung for him by a hair Oh I know what one would do for Kate it had hung for him by a hair to break out with that which he felt he had really been kept from by an element in his consciousness stronger still The proof of the truth in question was precisely in his silence resisting the impulse to break out was what he WAS doing for Kate This at the time moreover came and went quickly enough he was trying the next minute but to make Milly s allusion easy for herself Of course I know what friends you are and of course I understand he permitted himself to add any amount of devotion to a person so charming That s the good turn then she ll do us all I mean her working for your return Oh you don t know said Milly how much I m really on her hands He could but accept the appearance of wondering how much he might show he knew Ah she s very masterful She s great Yet I don t say she bullies me No that s not the way At any rate it isn t hers he smiled He remembered however then that an undue acquaintance with Kate s ways was just what he mustn t show and he pursued the subject no further than to remark with a good intention that had the further merit of representing a truth I don t feel as if I knew her really to call know Well if you come to that I don t either she laughed The words gave him as soon as they were uttered a sense of responsibility for his own though during a silence that ensued for a minute he had time to recognise that his own contained after all no element of falsity Strange enough therefore was it that he could go too far if it WAS too far without being false His observation was one he would perfectly have made to Kate herself And before he again spoke and before Milly did he took time for more still for feeling how just here it was that he must break short off if his mind was really made up not to go further It was as if he had been at a corner and fairly put there by his last speech so that it depended on him whether or no to turn it The silence if prolonged but an instant might even have given him a sense of her waiting to see what he would do It was filled for them the next thing by the sound rather voluminous for the August afternoon of the approach in the street below them of heavy carriage wheels and of horses trained to step A rumble a great shake a considerable effective clatter had been apparently succeeded by a pause at the door of the hotel which was in turn accompanied by a due display of diminished prancing and stamping You ve a visitor Densher laughed and it must be at least an ambassador It s only my own carriage it does that isn t it wonderful every day But we find it missus Stringham and I in the innocence of our hearts very amusing She had got up as she spoke to assure herself of what she said and at the end of a few steps they were together on the balcony and looking down at her waiting chariot which made indeed a brave show Is it very awful It was to Densher s eyes save for its absurd heaviness only pleasantly pompous It seems to me delightfully rococo But how do I know You re mistress of these things in contact with the highest wisdom You occupy a position moreover thanks to which your carriage well by this time in the eye of London also occupies one But she was going out and he mustn t stand in her way What had happened the next minute was first that she had denied she was going out so that he might prolong his stay and second that she had said she would go out with pleasure if he would like to drive that in fact there were always things to do that there had been a question for her to day of several in particular and that this in short was why the carriage had been ordered so early They perceived as she said these things that an enquirer had presented himself and coming back they found Milly s servant announcing the carriage and prepared to accompany her This appeared to have for her the effect of settling the matter on the basis that is of Densher s happy response Densher s happy response however had as yet hung fire the process we have described in him operating by this time with extreme intensity The system of not pulling up not breaking off had already brought him headlong he seemed to feel to where they actually stood and just now it was with a vengeance that he must do either one thing or the other He had been waiting for some moments which probably seemed to him longer than they were this was because he was anxiously watching himself wait He couldn t keep that up for ever and since one thing or the other was what he must do it was for the other that he presently became conscious of having decided If he had been drifting it settled itself in the manner of a bump of considerable violence against a firm object in the stream Oh yes I ll go with you with pleasure It s a charming idea She gave no look to thank him she rather looked away she only said at once to her servant In ten minutes and then to her visitor as the man went out We ll go somewhere I shall like that But I must ask of you time as little as possible to get ready She looked over the room to provide for him keep him there There are books and things plenty and I dress very quickly He caught her eyes only as she went on which he thought them pretty and touching Why especially touching at that instant he could certainly scarce have said it was involved it was lost in the sense of her wishing to oblige him Clearly what had occurred was her having wished it so that she had made him simply wish in civil acknowledgement to oblige HER which he had now fully done by turning his corner He was quite round it his corner by the time the door had closed upon her and he stood there alone Alone he remained for three minutes more remained with several very living little matters to think about One of these was the phenomenon typical highly American he would have said of Milly s extreme spontaneity It was perhaps rather as if he had sought refuge refuge from another question in the almost exclusive contemplation of this Yet this in its way led him nowhere not even to a sound generalisation about American girls It was spontaneous for his young friend to have asked him to drive with her alone since she hadn t mentioned her companion but she struck him after all as no more advanced in doing it than Kate for instance who wasn t an American girl might have struck him in not doing it Besides Kate WOULD have done it though Kate wasn t at all in the same sense as Milly spontaneous And then in addition Kate HAD done it or things very like it Furthermore he was engaged to Kate even if his ostensibly not being put her public freedom on other grounds On all grounds at any rate the relation between Kate and freedom between freedom and Kate was a different one from any he could associate or cultivate as to anything with the girl who had just left him to prepare to give herself up to him It had never struck him before and he moved about the room while he thought of it touching none of the books placed at his disposal Milly was forward as might be said but not advanced whereas Kate was backward backward still comparatively as an English girl and yet advanced in a high degree However though this didn t straighten it out Kate was of course two or three years older which at their time of life considerably counted Thus ingeniously discriminating Densher continued slowly to wander yet without keeping at bay for long the sense of having rounded his corner He had so rounded it that he felt himself lose even the option of taking advantage of Milly s absence to retrace his steps If he might have turned tail vulgarly speaking five minutes before he couldn t turn tail now he must simply wait there with his consciousness charged to the brim Quickly enough moreover that issue was closed from without in the course of three minutes more Miss Theale s servant had returned He preceded a visitor whom he had met obviously at the foot of the stairs and whom throwing open the door he loudly announced as Miss Croy Kate on following him in stopped short at sight of Densher only after an instant as the young man saw with free amusement not from surprise and still less from discomfiture Densher immediately gave his explanation Miss Theale had gone to prepare to drive on receipt of which the servant effaced himself And you re going with her Kate asked Yes with your approval which I ve taken as you see for granted Oh she laughed my approval s complete She was thoroughly consistent and handsome about it What I mean is of course he went on for he was sensibly affected by her gaiety at your so lively instigation She had looked about the room she might have been vaguely looking for signs of the duration of the character of his visit a momentary aid in taking a decision Well instigation then as much as you like She treated it as pleasant the success of her plea with him she made a fresh joke of this direct impression of it So much so as that Do you know I think I won t wait Not to see her after coming Well with you in the field I came for news of her but she must be all right If she IS But he took her straight up Ah how do I know He was moved to say more It s not I who am responsible for her my dear It seems to me it s you She struck him as making light of a matter that had been costing him sundry qualms so that they couldn t both be quite just Either she was too easy or he had been too anxious He didn t want at all events to feel a fool for that I m doing nothing and shall not I assure you do anything but what I m told Their eyes met with some intensity over the emphasis he had given his words and he had taken it from her the next moment that he really needn t get into a state What in the world was the matter She asked it with interest for all answer Isn t she better if she s able to see you She assures me she s in perfect health Kate s interest grew I knew she would On which she added It won t have been really for illness that she stayed away last night For what then Well for nervousness Nervousness about what Oh you know She spoke with a hint of impatience smiling however the next moment I ve told you that He looked at her to recover in her face what she had told him then it was as if what he saw there prompted him to say What have you told HER She gave him her controlled smile and it was all as if they remembered where they were liable to surprise talking with softened voices even stretching their opportunity by such talk beyond a quite right feeling Milly s room would be close at hand and yet they were saying things For a moment none the less they kept it up Ask HER if you like you re free she ll tell you Act as you think best don t trouble about what you think I may or mayn t have told I m all right with her said Kate So there you are If you mean HERE I am he answered it s unmistakeable If you also mean that her believing in you is all I have to do with you re so far right as that she certainly does believe in you Well then take example by her She s really doing it for you Densher continued She s driving me out for you In that case said Kate with her soft tranquillity you can do it a little for HER I m not afraid she smiled He stood before her a moment taking in again the face she put on it and affected again as he had already so often been by more things in this face and in her whole person and presence than he was to his relief obliged to find words for It wasn t under such impressions a question of words I do nothing for any one in the world but you But for you I ll do anything Good good said Kate That s how I like you He waited again an instant Then you swear to it To it To what Why that you do like me Since it s all for that you know that I m letting you do well God knows what with me She gave at this with a stare a disheartened gesture the sense of which she immediately further expressed If you don t believe in me then after all hadn t you better break off before you ve gone further Break off with you Break off with Milly You might go now she said and I ll stay and explain to her why it is He wondered as if it struck him What would you say Why that you find you can t stand her and that there s nothing for me but to bear with you as I best may He considered of this How much do you abuse me to her Exactly enough As much as you see by her attitude Again he thought It doesn t seem to me I ought to mind her attitude Well then just as you like I ll stay and do my best for you He saw she was sincere was really giving him a chance and that of itself made things clearer The feeling of how far he had gone came back to him not in repentance but in this very vision of an escape and it was not of what he had done but of what Kate offered that he now weighed the consequence Won t it make her her not finding me here be rather more sure there s something between us Kate thought Oh I don t know It will of course greatly upset her But you needn t trouble about that She won t die of it Do you mean she WILL Densher presently asked Don t put me questions when you don t believe what I say You make too many conditions She spoke now with a shade of rational weariness that made the want of pliancy the failure to oblige her look poor and ugly so that what it suddenly came back to for him was his deficiency in the things a man of any taste so engaged so enlisted would have liked to make sure of being able to show imagination tact positively even humour The circumstance is doubtless odd but the truth is none the less that the speculation uppermost with him at this juncture was What if I should begin to bore this creature And that within a few seconds had translated itself If you ll swear again you love me She looked about at door and window as if he were asking for more than he said Here There s nothing between us here Kate smiled Oh ISN T there Her smile itself with this had so settled something for him that he had come to her pleadingly and holding out his hands which she immediately seized with her own as if both to check him and to keep him It was by keeping him thus for a minute that she did check him she held him long enough while with their eyes deeply meeting they waited in silence for him to recover himself and renew his discretion He coloured as with a return of the sense of where they were and that gave her precisely one of her usual victories which immediately took further form By the time he had dropped her hands he had again taken hold as it were of Milly s It was not at any rate with Milly he had broken I ll do all you wish he declared as if to acknowledge the acceptance of his condition that he had practically after all drawn from her a declaration on which she then recurring to her first idea promptly acted If you ARE as good as that I go You ll tell her that finding you with her I wouldn t wait Say that you know from yourself She ll understand She had reached the door with it she was full of decision but he had before she left him one more doubt I don t see how she can understand enough you know without understanding too much You don t need to see He required then a last injunction I must simply go it blind You must simply be kind to her And leave the rest to you Leave the rest to HER said Kate disappearing It came back then afresh to that as it had come before Milly three minutes after Kate had gone returned in her array her big black hat so little superstitiously in the fashion her fine black garments throughout the swathing of her throat which Densher vaguely took for an infinite number of yards of priceless lace and which its folded fabric kept in place by heavy rows of pearls hung down to her feet like the stole of a priestess He spoke to her at once of their friend s visit and flight She hadn t known she d find me he said and said at present without difficulty He had so rounded his corner that it wasn t a question of a word more or less She took this account of the matter as quite sufficient she glossed over whatever might be awkward I m sorry but I of course often see HER He felt the discrimination in his favour and how it justified Kate This was Milly s tone when the matter was left to her Well it should now be wholly left Book Seventh Chapter one When Kate and Densher abandoned her to missus Stringham on the day of her meeting them together and bringing them to luncheon Milly face to face with that companion had had one of those moments in which the warned the anxious fighter of the battle of life as if once again feeling for the sword at his side carries his hand straight to the quarter of his courage She laid hers firmly on her heart and the two women stood there showing each other a strange front Susan Shepherd had received their great doctor s visit which had been clearly no small affair for her but Milly had since then with insistence kept in place against communication and betrayal as she now practically confessed the barrier of their invited guests You ve been too dear With what I see you re full of you treated them beautifully ISN T Kate charming when she wants to be Poor Susie s expression contending at first as in a high fine spasm with different dangers had now quite let itself go She had to make an effort to reach a point in space already so remote Miss Croy Oh she was pleasant and clever She knew missus Stringham added She knew Milly braced herself but conscious above all at the moment of a high compassion for her mate She made her out as struggling struggling in all her nature against the betrayal of pity which in itself given her nature could only be a torment Milly gathered from the struggle how much there was of the pity and how therefore it was both in her tenderness and in her conscience that missus Stringham suffered Wonderful and beautiful it was that this impression instantly steadied the girl Ruefully asking herself on what basis of ease with the drop of their barrier they were to find themselves together she felt the question met with a relief that was almost joy The basis the inevitable basis was that she was going to be sorry for Susie who to all appearance had been condemned in so much more uncomfortable a manner to be sorry for HER missus Stringham s sorrow would hurt missus Stringham but how could her own ever hurt She had the poor girl at all events on the spot five minutes of exaltation in which she turned the tables on her friend with a pass of the hand a gesture of an energy that made a wind in the air Kate knew she asked that you were full of Sir Luke Strett She spoke of nothing but she was gentle and nice she seemed to want to help me through Which the good lady had no sooner said however than she almost tragically gasped at herself She glared at Milly with a pretended pluck What I mean is that she saw one had been taken up with something When I say she knows I should say she s a person who guesses And her grimace was also on its side heroic But SHE doesn t matter Milly The girl felt she by this time could face anything Nobody matters Susie Nobody Which her next words however rather contradicted Did he take it ill that I wasn t here to see him Wasn t it really just what he wanted to have it out so much more simply with YOU We didn t have anything out Milly missus Stringham delicately quavered Didn t he awfully like you Milly went on and didn t he think you the most charming person I could possibly have referred him to for an account of me Didn t you hit it off tremendously together and in fact fall quite in love so that it will really be a great advantage for you to have me as a common ground You re going to make I can see no end of a good thing of me My own child my own child missus Stringham pleadingly murmured yet showing as she did so that she feared the effect even of deprecation Isn t he beautiful and good too himself altogether whatever he may say a lovely acquaintance to have made You re just the right people for me I see it now and do you know what between you you must do Then as Susie still but stared wonderstruck and holding herself You must simply see me through Any way you choose Make it out together I on my side will be beautiful too and we ll be the three of us with whatever others oh as many as the case requires any one you like a sight for the gods I ll be as easy for you as carrying a feather Susie took it for a moment in such silence that her young friend almost saw her and scarcely withheld the observation as taking it for a part of the disease This accordingly helped Milly to be as she judged definite and wise He s at any rate awfully interesting isn t he which is so much to the good We haven t at least as we might have with the way we tumbled into it got hold of one of the dreary Interesting dearest missus Stringham felt her feet firmer I don t know if he s interesting or not but I do know my own she continued to quaver that he s just as much interested as you could possibly desire Certainly that s it Like all the world No my precious not like all the world Very much more deeply and intelligently Ah there you are Milly laughed That s the way Susie I want you So buck up my dear We ll have beautiful times with him Don t worry I m not worrying Milly And poor Susie s face registered the sublimity of her lie It was at this that too sharply penetrated her companion went to her met by her with an embrace in which things were said that exceeded speech Each held and clasped the other as if to console her for this unnamed woe the woe for missus Stringham of learning the torment of helplessness the woe for Milly of having HER at such a time to think of Milly s assumption was immense and the difficulty for her friend was that of not being able to gainsay it without bringing it more to the proof than tenderness and vagueness could permit Nothing in fact came to the proof between them but that they could thus cling together except indeed that as we have indicated the pledge of protection and support was all the younger woman s own I don t ask you she presently said what he told you for yourself nor what he told you to tell me nor how he took it really that I had left him to you nor what passed between you about me in any way It wasn t to get that out of you that I took my means to make sure of your meeting freely for there are things I don t want to know I shall see him again and again and shall know more than enough All I do want is that you shall see me through on HIS basis whatever it is which it s enough for the purpose that you yourself should know that is with him to show you how I ll make it charming for you that s what I mean I ll keep you up to it in such a way that half the time you won t know you re doing it And for that you re to rest upon me There It s understood We keep each other going and you may absolutely feel of me that I shan t break down So with the way you haven t so much as a dig of the elbow to fear how could you be safer He told me I CAN help you of course he told me that Susie on her side eagerly contended Why shouldn t he and for what else have I come out with you But he told me nothing dreadful nothing nothing nothing the poor lady passionately protested Only that you must do as you like and as he tells you which IS just simply to do as you like I must keep in sight of him I must from time to time go to him But that s of course doing as I like It s lucky Milly smiled that I like going to him missus Stringham was here in agreement she gave a clutch at the account of their situation that most showed it as workable That s what WILL be charming for me and what I m sure he really wants of me to help you to do as you like And also a little won t it be Milly laughed to save me from the consequences Of course she added there must first BE things I like Oh I think you ll find some missus Stringham more bravely said I think there ARE some as for instance just this one I mean she explained really having us so Milly thought Just as if I wanted you comfortable about HIM and him the same about you Yes I shall get the good of it Susan Shepherd appeared to wander from this into a slight confusion Which of them are you talking of Milly wondered an instant then had a light I m not talking of mister Densher With which moreover she showed amusement Though if you can be comfortable about mister Densher too so much the better Oh you meant Sir Luke Strett Certainly he s a fine type Do you know Susie continued whom he reminds me of Of OUR great man doctor Buttrick of Boston Milly recognised doctor Buttrick of Boston but she dropped him after a tributary pause What do you think now that you ve seen him of mister Densher It was not till after consideration with her eyes fixed on her friend s that Susie produced her answer I think he s very handsome Milly remained smiling at her though putting on a little the manner of a teacher with a pupil Well that will do for the first time I HAVE done she went on what I wanted Then that s all WE want You see there are plenty of things Milly shook her head for the plenty The best is not to know that includes them all I don t I don t know Nothing about anything except that you re WITH me Remember that please There won t be anything that on my side for you I shall forget So it s all right The effect of it by this time was fairly as intended to sustain Susie who dropped in spite of herself into the reassuring Most certainly it s all right I think you ought to understand that he sees no reason Why I shouldn t have a grand long life Milly had taken it straight up as to understand it and for a moment consider it But she disposed of it otherwise Oh of course I know THAT She spoke as if her friend s point were small missus Stringham tried to enlarge it Well what I mean is that he didn t say to me anything that he hasn t said to yourself Really I would in his place She might have been disappointed but she had her good humour He tells me to LIVE and she oddly limited the word It left Susie a little at sea Then what do you want more My dear the girl presently said I don t want as I assure you anything Still she added I AM living Oh yes I m living It put them again face to face but it had wound missus Stringham up So am I then you ll see she spoke with the note of her recovery Yet it was her wisdom now meaning by it as much as she did not to say more than that She had risen by Milly s aid to a certain command of what was before them the ten minutes of their talk had in fact made her more distinctly aware of the presence in her mind of a new idea It was really perhaps an old idea with a new value it had at all events begun during the last hour though at first but feebly to shine with a special light That was because in the morning darkness had so suddenly descended a sufficient shade of night to bring out the power of a star The dusk might be thick yet but the sky had comparatively cleared and Susan Shepherd s star from this time on continued to twinkle for her It was for the moment after her passage with Milly the one spark left in the heavens She recognised as she continued to watch it that it had really been set there by Sir Luke Strett s visit and that the impressions immediately following had done no more than fix it Milly s reappearance with mister Densher at her heels or so oddly perhaps at Miss Croy s heels Miss Croy being at Milly s had contributed to this effect though it was only with the lapse of the greater obscurity that Susie made that out The obscurity had reigned during the hour of their friends visit faintly clearing indeed while in one of the rooms Kate Croy s remarkable advance to her intensified the fact that Milly and the young man were conjoined in the other If it hadn t acquired on the spot all the intensity of which it was capable this was because the poor lady still sat in her primary gloom the gloom the great benignant doctor had practically left behind him The intensity the circumstance in question MIGHT wear to the informed imagination would have been sufficiently revealed for us no doubt and with other things to our purpose in two or three of those confidential passages with missus Lowder that she now permitted herself She hadn t yet been so glad that she believed in her old friend for if she hadn t had at such a pass somebody or other to believe in she should certainly have stumbled by the way Discretion had ceased to consist of silence silence was gross and thick whereas wisdom should taper however tremulously to a point She betook herself to Lancaster Gate the morning after the colloquy just noted and there in Maud Manningham s own sanctum she gradually found relief in giving an account of herself An account of herself was one of the things that she had long been in the habit of expecting herself regularly to give the regularity depending of course much on such tests of merit as might by laws beyond her control rise in her path She never spared herself in short a proper sharpness of conception of how she had behaved and it was a statement that she for the most part found herself able to make What had happened at present was that nothing as she felt was left of her to report to she was all too sunk in the inevitable and the abysmal To give an account of herself she must give it to somebody else and her first instalment of it to her hostess was that she must please let her cry She couldn t cry with Milly in observation at the hotel which she had accordingly left for that purpose and the power happily came to her with the good opportunity She cried and cried at first she confined herself to that it was for the time the best statement of her business missus Lowder moreover intelligently took it as such though knocking off a note or two more as she said while Susie sat near her table She could resist the contagion of tears but her patience did justice to her visitor s most vivid plea for it I shall never be able you know to cry again at least not ever with HER so I must take it out when I can Even if she does herself it won t be for me to give away for what would that be but a confession of despair I m not with her for that I m with her to be regularly sublime Besides Milly won t cry herself I m sure I hope said missus Lowder that she won t have occasion to She won t even if she does have occasion She won t shed a tear There s something that will prevent her Oh said missus Lowder Yes her pride missus Stringham explained in spite of her friend s doubt and it was with this that her communication took consistent form It had never been pride Maud Manningham had hinted that kept HER from crying when other things made for it it had only been that these same things at such times made still more for business arrangements correspondence the ringing of bells the marshalling of servants the taking of decisions I might be crying now she said if I weren t writing letters and this quite without harshness for her anxious companion to whom she allowed just the administrative margin for difference She had interrupted her no more than she would have interrupted the piano tuner It gave poor Susie time and when missus Lowder to save appearances and catch the post had with her addressed and stamped notes met at the door of the room the footman summoned by the pressure of a knob the facts of the case were sufficiently ready for her It took but two or three however given their importance to lay the ground for the great one missus Stringham s interview of the day before with Sir Luke who had wished to see her about Milly He had wished it himself I think he was glad of it Clearly indeed he was He stayed a quarter of an hour I could see that for HIM it was long He s interested said missus Stringham Do you mean in her case He says it ISN T a case What then is it It isn t at least missus Stringham explained the case she believed it to be thought it at any rate MIGHT be when without my knowledge she went to see him She went because there was something she was afraid of and he examined her thoroughly he has made sure She s wrong she hasn t what she thought And what did she think missus Lowder demanded He didn t tell me And you didn t ask I asked nothing said poor Susie I only took what he gave me He gave me no more than he had to he was beautiful she went on He IS thank God interested He must have been interested in YOU dear Maud Manningham observed with kindness Her visitor met it with candour Yes love I think he IS I mean that he sees what he can do with me missus Lowder took it rightly For HER For her Anything in the world he will or he must He can use me to the last bone and he likes at least that He says the great thing for her is to be happy It s surely the great thing for every one Why therefore missus Lowder handsomely asked should we cry so hard about it Only poor Susie wailed that it s so strange so beyond us I mean if she can t be She must be missus Lowder knew no impossibles She SHALL be Well if you ll help He thinks you know we CAN help missus Lowder faced a moment in her massive way what Sir Luke Strett thought She sat back there her knees apart not unlike a picturesque ear ringed matron at a market stall while her friend before her dropped their items tossed the separate truths of the matter one by one into her capacious apron But is that all he came to you for to tell you she must be happy That she must be MADE so that s the point It seemed enough as he told me missus Stringham went on he makes it somehow such a grand possible affair Ah well if he makes it possible I mean especially he makes it grand He gave it to me that is as MY part The rest s his own And what s the rest missus Lowder asked I don t know HIS business He means to keep hold of her Then why do you say it isn t a case It must be very much of one Everything in missus Stringham confessed to the extent of it It s only that it isn t THE case she herself supposed It s another It s another Examining her for what she supposed he finds something else Something else And what does he find Ah missus Stringham cried God keep me from knowing He didn t tell you that But poor Susie had recovered herself What I mean is that if it s there I shall know in time He s considering but I can trust him for it because he does I feel trust me He s considering she repeated He s in other words not sure Well he s watching I think that s what he means She s to get away now but to come back to him in three months Then I think said Maud Lowder that he oughtn t meanwhile to scare us It roused Susie a little Susie being already enrolled in the great doctor s cause This came out at least in her glimmer of reproach Does it scare us to enlist us for her happiness missus Lowder was rather stiff for it Yes it scares ME I m always scared I may call it so till I understand What happiness is he talking about missus Stringham at this came straight Oh you know She had really said it so that her friend had to take it which the latter in fact after a moment showed herself as having done A strange light humour in the matter even perhaps suddenly aiding she met it with a certain accommodation Well say one seems to see The point is But fairly too full now of her question she dropped The point is will it CURE Precisely Is it absolutely a remedy THE specific Well I should think we might know missus Stringham delicately declared Ah but we haven t the complaint Have you never dearest been in love Susan Shepherd enquired Yes my child but not by the doctor s direction Maud Manningham had spoken perforce with a break into momentary mirth which operated and happily too as a challenge to her visitor s spirit Oh of course we don t ask his leave to fall But it s something to know he thinks it good for us My dear woman missus Lowder cried it strikes me we know it without him So that when THAT S all he has to tell us Ah missus Stringham interposed it isn t all I feel Sir Luke will have more he won t have put me off with anything inadequate I m to see him again he as good as told me that he ll wish it So it won t be for nothing Then what will it be for Do you mean he has somebody of his own to propose Do you mean you told him nothing missus Stringham dealt with these questions I showed him I understood him That was all I could do I didn t feel at liberty to be explicit but I felt even though his visit so upset me the comfort of what I had from you night before last What I spoke to you of in the carriage when we had left her with Kate You had SEEN apparently in three minutes And now that he s here now that I ve met him and had my impression of him I feel said missus Stringham that you ve been magnificent Of course I ve been magnificent When asked Maud Manningham was I anything else But Milly won t be you know if she marries Merton Densher Oh it s always magnificent to marry the man one loves But we re going fast missus Stringham woefully smiled The thing IS to go fast if I see the case right What had I after all but my instinct of that on coming back with you night before last to pick up Kate I felt what I felt I knew in my bones the man had returned That s just where as I say you re magnificent But wait said missus Stringham till you ve seen him I shall see him immediately missus Lowder took it up with decision What IS then she asked your impression missus Stringham s impression seemed lost in her doubts How can he ever care for her Her companion in her companion s heavy manner sat on it By being put in the way of it For God s sake then missus Stringham wailed PUT him in the way You have him one feels in your hand Maud Lowder s eyes at this rested on her friend s Is that your impression of him It s my impression dearest of you You handle every one missus Lowder s eyes still rested and Susan Shepherd now felt for a wonder not less sincere by seeing that she pleased her But there was a great limitation I don t handle Kate It suggested something that her visitor hadn t yet had from her something the sense of which made missus Stringham gasp Do you mean Kate cares for HIM That fact the lady of Lancaster Gate had up to this moment as we know enshrouded and her friend s quick question had produced a change in her face She blinked then looked at the question hard after which whether she had inadvertently betrayed herself or had only reached a decision and then been affected by the quality of missus Stringham s surprise she accepted all results What took place in her for Susan Shepherd was not simply that she made the best of them but that she suddenly saw more in them to her purpose than she could have imagined A certain impatience in fact marked in her this transition she had been keeping back very hard an important truth and wouldn t have liked to hear that she hadn t concealed it cleverly Susie nevertheless felt herself pass as not a little of a fool with her for not having thought of it What Susie indeed however most thought of at present in the quick new light of it was the wonder of Kate s dissimulation She had time for that view while she waited for an answer to her cry Kate thinks she cares But she s mistaken And no one knows it These things distinct and responsible were missus Lowder s retort Yet they weren t all of it YOU don t know it that must be your line Or rather your line must be that you deny it utterly Deny that she cares for him Deny that she so much as thinks that she does Positively and absolutely Deny that you ve so much as heard of it Susie faced this new duty To Milly you mean if she asks To Milly naturally No one else WILL ask Well said missus Stringham after a moment Milly won t missus Lowder wondered Are you sure Yes the more I think of it And luckily for ME I lie badly I lie well thank God missus Lowder almost snorted when as sometimes will happen there s nothing else so good One must always do the best But without lies then she went on perhaps we can work it out Her interest had risen her friend saw her as within some minutes more enrolled and inflamed presently felt in her what had made the difference missus Stringham it was true descried this at the time but dimly she only made out at first that Maud had found a reason for helping her The reason was that strangely she might help Maud too for which she now desired to profess herself ready even to lying What really perhaps most came out for her was that her hostess was a little disappointed at her doubt of the social solidity of this appliance and that in turn was to become a steadier light The truth about Kate s delusion as her aunt presented it the delusion about the state of her affections which might be removed this was apparently the ground on which they now might more intimately meet missus Stringham saw herself recruited for the removal of Kate s delusion by arts however in truth that she as yet quite failed to compass Or was it perhaps to be only for the removal of mister Densher s success in which indeed might entail other successes Before that job unfortunately her heart had already failed She felt that she believed in her bones what Milly believed and what would now make working for Milly such a dreadful upward tug All this within her was confusedly present a cloud of questions out of which Maud Manningham s large seated self loomed however as a mass more and more definite taking in fact for the consultative relation something of the form of an oracle From the oracle the sound did come or at any rate the sense did a sense all accordant with the insufflation she had just seen working Yes the sense was I ll help you for Milly because if that comes off I shall be helped by its doing so for Kate a view into which missus Stringham could now sufficiently enter She found herself of a sudden strange to say quite willing to operate to Kate s harm or at least to Kate s good as missus Lowder with a noble anxiety measured it She found herself in short not caring what became of Kate only convinced at bottom of the predominance of Kate s star Kate wasn t in danger Kate wasn t pathetic Kate Croy whatever happened would take care of Kate Croy She saw moreover by this time that her friend was travelling even beyond her own speed missus Lowder had already in mind drafted a rough plan of action a plan vividly enough thrown off as she said You must stay on a few days and you must immediately both of you meet him at dinner In addition to which Maud claimed the merit of having by an instinct of pity of prescient wisdom done much two nights before to prepare that ground The poor child when I was with her there while you were getting your shawl quite gave herself away to me Oh I remember how you afterwards put it to me Though it was nothing more Susie did herself the justice to observe than what I too had quite felt But missus Lowder fronted her so on this that she wondered what she had said I suppose I ought to be edified at what you can so beautifully give up Give up missus Stringham echoed Why I give up nothing I cling Her hostess showed impatience turning again with some stiffness to her great brass bound cylinder desk and giving a push to an object or two disposed there I give up then You know how little such a person as mister Densher was to be my idea for her You know what I ve been thinking perfectly possible Oh you ve been great Susie was perfectly fair A duke a duchess a princess a palace you ve made me believe in them too But where we break down is that SHE doesn t believe in them Luckily for her as it seems to be turning out she doesn t want them So what s one to do I assure you I ve had many dreams But I ve only one dream now missus Stringham s tone in these last words gave so fully her meaning that missus Lowder could but show herself as taking it in They sat a moment longer confronted on it Her having what she does want If it WILL do anything for her missus Lowder seemed to think what it might do but she spoke for the instant of something else It does provoke me a bit you know for of course I m a brute And I had thought of all sorts of things Yet it doesn t prevent the fact that we must be decent We must take her missus Stringham carried that out as she is And we must take mister Densher as HE is With which missus Lowder gave a sombre laugh It s a pity he isn t better Well if he were better her friend rejoined you d have liked him for your niece and in that case Milly would interfere I mean Susie added interfere with YOU She interferes with me as it is not that it matters now But I saw Kate and her really as soon as you came to me set up side by side I saw your girl I don t mind telling you helping my girl and when I say that missus Lowder continued you ll probably put in for yourself that it was part of the reason of my welcome to you So you see what I give up I do give it up But when I take that line she further set forth I take it handsomely So good bye to it all Good day to missus Densher Heavens she growled Susie held herself a minute Even as missus Densher my girl will be somebody Yes she won t be nobody Besides said missus Lowder we re talking in the air Her companion sadly assented We re leaving everything out It s nevertheless interesting And missus Lowder had another thought HE S not quite nobody either It brought her back to the question she had already put and which her friend hadn t at the time dealt with What in fact do you make of him Susan Shepherd at this for reasons not clear even to herself was moved a little to caution So she remained general He s charming She had met missus Lowder s eyes with that extreme pointedness in her own to which people resort when they are not quite candid a circumstance that had its effect Yes he s charming The effect of the words however was equally marked they almost determined in missus Stringham a return of amusement I thought you didn t like him I don t like him for Kate But you don t like him for Milly either missus Stringham rose as she spoke and her friend also got up I like him my dear for myself Then that s the best way of all Well it s one way He s not good enough for my niece and he s not good enough for you One s an aunt one s a wretch and one s a fool Oh I M not not either Susie declared But her companion kept on One lives for others YOU do that If I were living for myself I shouldn t at all mind him But missus Stringham was sturdier Ah if I find him charming it s however I m living Well it broke missus Lowder down She hung fire but an instant giving herself away with a laugh Of course he s all right in himself That s all I contend Susie said with more reserve and the note in question what Merton Densher was in himself closed practically with some inconsequence this first of their councils Book Seventh Chapter two It had at least made the difference for them they could feel of an informed state in respect to the great doctor whom they were now to take as watching waiting studying or at any rate as proposing to himself some such process before he should make up his mind missus Stringham understood him as considering the matter meanwhile in a spirit that on this same occasion at Lancaster Gate she had come back to a rough notation of before retiring She followed the course of his reckoning If what they had talked of COULD happen if Milly that is could have her thoughts taken off herself it wouldn t do any harm and might conceivably do much good If it couldn t happen if anxiously though tactfully working they themselves conjoined could do nothing to contribute to it they would be in no worse a box than before Only in this latter case the girl would have had her free range for the summer for the autumn she would have done her best in the sense enjoined on her and coming back at the end to her eminent man would besides having more to show him find him more ready to go on with her It was visible further to Susan Shepherd as well as being ground for a second report to her old friend that Milly did her part for a working view of the general case inasmuch as she mentioned frankly and promptly that she meant to go and say good bye to Sir Luke Strett and thank him She even specified what she was to thank him for his having been so easy about her behaviour You see I didn t know that for the liberty I took I shouldn t afterwards get a stiff note from him So much Milly had said to her and it had made her a trifle rash Oh you ll never get a stiff note from him in your life She felt her rashness the next moment at her young friend s question Why not as well as any one else who has played him a trick Well because he doesn t regard it as a trick He could understand your action It s all right you see Yes I do see It IS all right He s easier with me than with any one else because that s the way to let me down He s only making believe and I m not worth hauling up Rueful at having provoked again this ominous flare poor Susie grasped at her only advantage Do you really accuse a man like Sir Luke Strett of trifling with you She couldn t blind herself to the look her companion gave her a strange half amused perception of what she made of it Well so far as it s trifling with me to pity me so much He doesn t pity you Susie earnestly reasoned He just the same as any one else likes you He has no business then to like me He s not the same as any one else Why not if he wants to work for you Milly gave her another look but this time a wonderful smile Ah there you are missus Stringham coloured for there indeed she was again But Milly let her off Work for me all the same work for me It s of course what I want Then as usual she embraced her friend I m not going to be as nasty as this to HIM I m sure I hope not and missus Stringham laughed for the kiss I ve no doubt however he d take it from you It s YOU my dear who are not the same as any one else Milly s assent to which after an instant gave her the last word No so that people can take anything from me And what missus Stringham did indeed resignedly take after this was the absence on her part of any account of the visit then paid It was the beginning in fact between them of an odd independence an independence positively of action and custom on the subject of Milly s future They went their separate ways with the girl s intense assent this being really nothing but what she had so wonderfully put in her plea for after missus Stringham s first encounter with Sir Luke She fairly favoured the idea that Susie had or was to have other encounters private pointed personal she favoured every idea but most of all the idea that she herself was to go on as if nothing were the matter Since she was to be worked for that would be her way and though her companions learned from herself nothing of it this was in the event her way with her medical adviser She put her visit to him on the simplest ground she had come just to tell him how touched she had been by his good nature That required little explaining for as missus Stringham had said he quite understood he could but reply that it was all right I had a charming quarter of an hour with that clever lady You ve got good friends So each one of them thinks of all the others But so I also think Milly went on of all of them together You re excellent for each other And it s in that way I dare say that you re best for me There came to her on this occasion one of the strangest of her impressions which was at the same time one of the finest of her alarms the glimmer of a vision that if she should go as it were too far she might perhaps deprive their relation of facility if not of value Going too far was failing to try at least to remain simple He would be quite ready to hate her if she did by heading him off at every point embarrass his exercise of a kindness that no doubt rather constituted for him a high method Susie wouldn t hate her since Susie positively wanted to suffer for her Susie had a noble idea that she might somehow so do her good Such however was not the way in which the greatest of London doctors was to be expected to wish to do it He wouldn t have time even should he wish whereby in a word Milly felt herself intimately warned Face to face there with her smooth strong director she enjoyed at a given moment quite such another lift of feeling as she had known in her crucial talk with Susie It came round to the same thing him too she would help to help her if that could possibly be but if it couldn t possibly be she would assist also to make this right It wouldn t have taken many minutes more on the basis in question almost to reverse for her their characters of patient and physician What WAS he in fact but patient what was she but physician from the moment she embraced once for all the necessity adopted once for all the policy of saving him alarms about her subtlety She would leave the subtlety to him he would enjoy his use of it and she herself no doubt would in time enjoy his enjoyment She went so far as to imagine that the inward success of these reflexions flushed her for the minute to his eyes with a certain bloom a comparative appearance of health and what verily next occurred was that he gave colour to the presumption Every little helps no doubt he noticed good humouredly her harmless sally But help or no help you re looking you know remarkably well Oh I thought I was she answered and it was as if already she saw his line Only she wondered what he would have guessed If he had guessed anything at all it would be rather remarkable of him As for what there WAS to guess he couldn t if this was present to him have arrived at it save by his own acuteness That acuteness was therefore immense and if it supplied the subtlety she thought of leaving him to his portion would be none so bad Neither for that matter would hers be which she was even actually enjoying She wondered if really then there mightn t be something for her She hadn t been sure in coming to him that she was better and he hadn t used he would be awfully careful not to use that compromising term about her in spite of all of which she would have been ready to say for the amiable sympathy of it Yes I MUST be for he had this unaided sense of something that had happened to her It was a sense unaided because who could have told him of anything Susie she was certain hadn t yet seen him again and there were things it was impossible she could have told him the first time Since such was his penetration therefore why shouldn t she gracefully in recognition of it accept the new circumstance the one he was clearly wanting to congratulate her on as a sufficient cause If one nursed a cause tenderly enough it might produce an effect and this to begin with would be a way of nursing You gave me the other day she went on plenty to think over and I ve been doing that thinking it over quite as you ll have probably wished me I think I must be pretty easy to treat she smiled since you ve already done me so much good The only obstacle to reciprocity with him was that he looked in advance so closely related to all one s possibilities that one missed the pleasure of really improving it Oh no you re extremely difficult to treat I ve need with you I assure you of all my wit Well I mean I do come up She hadn t meanwhile a bit believed in his answer convinced as she was that if she HAD been difficult it would be the last thing he would have told her I m doing she said as I like Then it s as I like But you must really though we re having such a decent month get straight away In pursuance of which when she had replied with promptitude that her departure for the Tyrol and then for Venice was quite fixed for the fourteenth he took her up with alacrity For Venice That s perfect for we shall meet there I ve a dream of it for October when I m hoping for three weeks off three weeks during which if I can get them clear my niece a young person who has quite the whip hand of me is to take me where she prefers I heard from her only yesterday that she expects to prefer Venice That s lovely then I shall expect you there And anything that in advance or in any way I can do for you Oh thank you My niece I seem to feel does for me But it will be capital to find you there I think it ought to make you feel she said after a moment that I AM easy to treat But he shook his head again he wouldn t have it You ve not come to that YET One has to be so bad for it Well I don t think I ve ever come to it to ease of treatment I doubt if it s possible I ve not if it is found any one bad enough The ease you see is for YOU I see I see They had an odd friendly but perhaps the least bit awkward pause on it after which Sir Luke asked And that clever lady she goes with you missus Stringham Oh dear yes She ll stay with me I hope to the end He had a cheerful blankness To the end of what Well of everything Ah then he laughed you re in luck The end of everything is far off This you know I m hoping said Sir Luke is only the beginning And the next question he risked might have been a part of his hope Just you and she together No two other friends two ladies of whom we ve seen more here than of any one and who are just the right people for us He thought a moment You ll be four women together then Ah said Milly we re widows and orphans But I think she added as if to say what she saw would reassure him that we shall not be unattractive as we move to gentlemen When you talk of life I suppose you mean mainly gentlemen When I talk of life he made answer after a moment during which he might have been appreciating her raciness when I talk of life I think I mean more than anything else the beautiful show of it in its freshness made by young persons of your age So go on as you are I see more and more HOW you are You can t he went so far as to say for pleasantness better it She took it from him with a great show of peace One of our companions will be Miss Croy who came with me here first It s in HER that life is splendid and a part of that is even that she s devoted to me But she s above all magnificent in herself So that if you d like she freely threw out to see HER Oh I shall like to see any one who s devoted to you for clearly it will be jolly to be in it So that if she s to be at Venice I SHALL see her We must arrange it I shan t fail She moreover has a friend who may also be there Milly found herself going on to this He s likely to come I believe for he always follows her Sir Luke wondered You mean they re lovers HE is Milly smiled but not she She doesn t care for him Sir Luke took an interest What s the matter with him Nothing but that she doesn t like him Sir Luke kept it up Is he all right Oh he s very nice Indeed he s remarkably so And he s to be in Venice So she tells me she fears For if he is there he ll be constantly about with her And she ll be constantly about with you As we re great friends yes Well then said Sir Luke you won t be four women alone Oh no I quite recognise the chance of gentlemen But he won t Milly pursued in the same wondrous way have come you see for ME No I see But can t you help him Can t YOU Milly after a moment quaintly asked Then for the joke of it she explained I m putting you you see in relation with my entourage It might have been for the joke of it too by this time that her eminent friend fell in But if this gentleman ISN T of your entourage I mean if he s of what do you call her Miss Croy s Unless indeed you also take an interest in him Oh certainly I take an interest in him You think there may be then some chance for him I like him said Milly enough to hope so Then that s all right But what pray Sir Luke next asked have I to do with him Nothing said Milly except that if you re to be there so may he be And also that we shan t in that case be simply four dreary women He considered her as if at this point she a little tried his patience YOU RE the least dreary woman I ve ever ever seen Ever do you know There s no reason why you shouldn t have a really splendid life So every one tells me she promptly returned The conviction strong already when I had seen you once is strengthened in me by having seen your friend There s no doubt about it The world s before you What did my friend tell you Milly asked Nothing that wouldn t have given you pleasure We talked about you and freely I don t deny that But it shows me I don t require of you the impossible She was now on her feet I think I know what you require of me Nothing for you he went on IS impossible So go on He repeated it again wanting her so to feel that to day he saw it You re all right Well she smiled keep me so Oh you ll get away from me Keep me keep me she simply continued with her gentle eyes on him She had given him her hand for good bye and he thus for a moment did keep her Something then while he seemed to think if there were anything more came back to him though something of which there wasn t too much to be made Of course if there s anything I CAN do for your friend I mean the gentleman you speak of He gave out in short that he was ready Oh mister Densher It was as if she had forgotten mister Densher is that his name Yes but his case isn t so dreadful She had within a minute got away from that No doubt if YOU take an interest She had got away but it was as if he made out in her eyes though they also had rather got away a reason for calling her back Still if there s anything one can do She looked at him while she thought while she smiled I m afraid there s really nothing one can do Book Seventh Chapter three Not yet so much as this morning had she felt herself sink into possession gratefully glad that the warmth of the Southern summer was still in the high florid rooms palatial chambers where hard cool pavements took reflexions in their lifelong polish and where the sun on the stirred sea water flickering up through open windows played over the painted subjects in the splendid ceilings medallions of purple and brown of brave old melancholy colour medals as of old reddened gold embossed and beribboned all toned with time and all flourished and scolloped and gilded about set in their great moulded and figured concavity a nest of white cherubs friendly creatures of the air and appreciated by the aid of that second tier of smaller lights straight openings to the front which did everything even with the Baedekers and photographs of Milly s party dreadfully meeting the eye to make of the place an apartment of state This at last only though she had enjoyed the palace for three weeks seemed to count as effective occupation perhaps because it was the first time she had been alone really to call alone since she had left London it ministered to her first full and unembarrassed sense of what the great Eugenio had done for her The great Eugenio recommended by grand dukes and Americans had entered her service during the last hours of all had crossed from Paris after multiplied pourparlers with missus Stringham to whom she had allowed more than ever a free hand on purpose to escort her to the Continent and encompass her there and had dedicated to her from the moment of their meeting all the treasures of his experience She had judged him in advance polyglot and universal very dear and very deep as probably but a swindler finished to the finger tips for he was for ever carrying one well kept Italian hand to his heart and plunging the other straight into her pocket which as she had instantly observed him to recognise fitted it like a glove The remarkable thing was that these elements of their common consciousness had rapidly gathered into an indestructible link formed the ground of a happy relation being by this time strangely grotesquely delightfully what most kept up confidence between them and what most expressed it She had seen quickly enough what was happening the usual thing again yet once again Eugenio had in an interview of five minutes understood her had got hold like all the world of the idea not so much of the care with which she must be taken up as of the care with which she must be let down All the world understood her all the world had got hold but for nobody yet she felt would the idea have been so close a tie or won from herself so patient a surrender Gracefully respectfully consummately enough always with hands in position and the look in his thick neat white hair smooth fat face and black professional almost theatrical eyes as of some famous tenor grown too old to make love but with an art still to make money did he on occasion convey to her that she was of all the clients of his glorious career the one in whom his interest was most personal and paternal The others had come in the way of business but for her his sentiment was special Confidence rested thus on her completely believing that there was nothing of which she felt more sure It passed between them every time they conversed he was abysmal but this intimacy lived on the surface He had taken his place already for her among those who were to see her through and meditation ranked him in the constant perspective for the final function side by side with poor Susie whom she was now pitying more than ever for having to be herself so sorry and to say so little about it Eugenio had the general tact of a residuary legatee which was a character that could be definitely worn whereas she could see Susie in the event of her death in no character at all Susie being insistently exclusively concerned in her mere makeshift duration This principle for that matter Milly at present with a renewed flare of fancy felt she should herself have liked to believe in Eugenio had really done for her more than he probably knew he didn t after all know everything in having for the wind up of the autumn on a weak word from her so admirably so perfectly established her Her weak word as a general hint had been At Venice please if possible no dreadful no vulgar hotel but if it can be at all managed you know what I mean some fine old rooms wholly independent for a series of months Plenty of them too and the more interesting the better part of a palace historic and picturesque but strictly inodorous where we shall be to ourselves with a cook don t you know with servants frescoes tapestries antiquities the thorough make believe of a settlement The proof of how he better and better understood her was in all the place as to his masterly acquisition of which she had from the first asked no questions She had shown him enough what she thought of it and her forbearance pleased him with the part of the transaction that mainly concerned her she would soon enough become acquainted and his connexion with such values as she would then find noted could scarce help growing as it were still more residuary Charming people conscious Venice lovers evidently had given up their house to her and had fled to a distance to other countries to hide their blushes alike over what they had however briefly alienated and over what they had however durably gained They had preserved and consecrated and she now her part of it was shameless appropriated and enjoyed Palazzo Leporelli held its history still in its great lap even like a painted idol a solemn puppet hung about with decorations Hung about with pictures and relics the rich Venetian past the ineffaceable character was here the presence revered and served which brings us back to our truth of a moment ago the fact that more than ever this October morning awkward novice though she might be Milly moved slowly to and fro as the priestess of the worship Certainly it came from the sweet taste of solitude caught again and cherished for the hour always a need of her nature moreover when things spoke to her with penetration It was mostly in stillness they spoke to her best amid voices she lost the sense Voices had surrounded her for weeks and she had tried to listen had cultivated them and had answered back these had been weeks in which there were other things they might well prevent her from hearing More than the prospect had at first promised or threatened she had felt herself going on in a crowd and with a multiplied escort the four ladies pictured by her to Sir Luke Strett as a phalanx comparatively closed and detached had in fact proved a rolling snowball condemned from day to day to cover more ground Susan Shepherd had compared this portion of the girl s excursion to the Empress Catherine s famous progress across the steppes of Russia improvised settlements appeared at each turn of the road villagers waiting with addresses drawn up in the language of London Old friends in fine were in ambush missus Lowder s Kate Croy s her own when the addresses weren t in the language of London they were in the more insistent idioms of American centres The current was swollen even by Susie s social connexions so that there were days at hotels at Dolomite picnics on lake steamers when she could almost repay to Aunt Maud and Kate with interest the debt contracted by the London success to which they had opened the door missus Lowder s success and Kate s amid the shock of Milly s and missus Stringham s compatriots failed but little really of the concert pitch it had gone almost as fast as the boom over the sea of the last great native novel Those ladies were so different different observably enough from the ladies so appraising them it being throughout a case mainly of ladies of a dozen at once sometimes in Milly s apartment pointing also at once that moral and many others Milly s companions were acclaimed not only as perfectly fascinating in themselves the nicest people yet known to the acclaimers but as obvious helping hands socially speaking for the eccentric young woman evident initiators and smoothers of her path possible subduers of her eccentricity Short intervals to her own sense stood now for great differences and this renewed inhalation of her native air had somehow left her to feel that she already that she mainly struck the compatriot as queer and dissociated She moved such a critic it would appear as to rather an odd suspicion a benevolence induced by a want of complete trust all of which showed her in the light of a person too plain and too ill clothed for a thorough good time and yet too rich and too befriended an intuitive cunning within her managing this last for a thorough bad one The compatriots in short by what she made out approved her friends for their expert wisdom with her in spite of which judicial sagacity it was the compatriots who recorded themselves as the innocent parties She saw things in these days that she had never seen before and she couldn t have said why save on a principle too terrible to name whereby she saw that neither Lancaster Gate was what New York took it for nor New York what Lancaster Gate fondly fancied it in coquetting with the plan of a series of American visits The plan might have been humorously on missus Lowder s part for the improvement of her social position and it had verily in that direction lights that were perhaps but half a century too prompt at all of which Kate Croy assisted with the cool controlled facility that went so well as the others said with her particular kind of good looks the kind that led you to expect the person enjoying them WOULD dispose of disputations speculations aspirations in a few very neatly and brightly uttered words so simplified in sense however that they sounded even when guiltless like rather aggravated slang It wasn t that Kate hadn t pretended too that SHE should like to go to America it was only that with this young woman Milly had constantly proceeded and more than ever of late on the theory of intimate confessions private frank ironies that made up for their public grimaces and amid which face to face they wearily put off the mask These puttings off of the mask had finally quite become the form taken by their moments together moments indeed not increasingly frequent and not prolonged thanks to the consciousness of fatigue on Milly s side whenever as she herself expressed it she got out of harness They flourished their masks the independent pair as they might have flourished Spanish fans they smiled and sighed on removing them but the gesture the smiles the sighs strangely enough might have been suspected the greatest reality in the business Strangely enough we say for the volume of effusion in general would have been found by either on measurement to be scarce proportional to the paraphernalia of relief It was when they called each other s attention to their ceasing to pretend it was then that what they were keeping back was most in the air There was a difference no doubt and mainly to Kate s advantage Milly didn t quite see what her friend could keep back was possessed of in fine that would be so subject to retention whereas it was comparatively plain sailing for Kate that poor Milly had a treasure to hide This was not the treasure of a shy an abject affection concealment on that head belonging to quite another phase of such states it was much rather a principle of pride relatively bold and hard a principle that played up like a fine steel spring at the lightest pressure of too near a footfall Thus insuperably guarded was the truth about the girl s own conception of her validity thus was a wondering pitying sister condemned wistfully to look at her from the far side of the moat she had dug round her tower Certain aspects of the connexion of these young women show for us such is the twilight that gathers about them in the likeness of some dim scene in a Maeterlinck play we have positively the image in the delicate dusk of the figures so associated and yet so opposed so mutually watchful that of the angular pale princess ostrich plumed black robed hung about with amulets reminders relics mainly seated mainly still and that of the upright restless slow circling lady of her court who exchanges with her across the black water streaked with evening gleams fitful questions and answers The upright lady with thick dark braids down her back drawing over the grass a more embroidered train makes the whole circuit and makes it again and the broken talk brief and sparingly allusive seems more to cover than to free their sense This is because when it fairly comes to not having others to consider they meet in an air that appears rather anxiously to wait for their words Such an impression as that was in fact grave and might be tragic so that plainly enough systematically at last they settled to a care of what they said There could be no gross phrasing to Milly in particular of the probability that if she wasn t so proud she might be pitied with more comfort more to the person pitying there could be no spoken proof no sharper demonstration than the consistently considerate attitude that this marvellous mixture of her weakness and of her strength her peril if such it were and her option made her kept her irresistibly interesting Kate s predicament in the matter was after all very much missus Stringham s own and Susan Shepherd herself indeed in our Maeterlinck picture might well have hovered in the gloaming by the moat It may be declared for Kate at all events that her sincerity about her friend through this time was deep her compassionate imagination strong and that these things gave her a virtue a good conscience a credibility for herself so to speak that were later to be precious to her She grasped with her keen intelligence the logic of their common duplicity went unassisted through the same ordeal as Milly s other hushed follower easily saw that for the girl to be explicit was to betray divinations gratitudes glimpses of the felt contrast between her fortune and her fear all of which would have contradicted her systematic bravado That was it Kate wonderingly saw to recognise was to bring down the avalanche the avalanche Milly lived so in watch for and that might be started by the lightest of breaths though less possibly the breath of her own stifled plaint than that of the vain sympathy the mere helpless gaping inference of others With so many suppressions as these therefore between them their withdrawal together to unmask had to fall back as we have hinted on a nominal motive which was decently represented by a joy at the drop of chatter Chatter had in truth all along attended their steps but they took the despairing view of it on purpose to have ready when face to face some view or other of something The relief of getting out of harness that was the moral of their meetings but the moral of this in turn was that they couldn t so much as ask each other why harness need be worn Milly wore it as a general armour She was out of it at present for some reason as she hadn t been for weeks she was always out of it that is when alone and her companions had never yet so much as just now affected her as dispersed and suppressed It was as if still again still more tacitly and wonderfully Eugenio had understood her taking it from her without a word and just bravely and brilliantly in the name for instance of the beautiful day Yes get me an hour alone take them off I don t care where absorb amuse detain them drown them kill them if you will so that I may just a little all by myself see where I am She was conscious of the dire impatience of it for she gave up Susie as well as the others to him Susie who would have drowned her very self for her gave her up to a mercenary monster through whom she thus purchased respites Strange were the turns of life and the moods of weakness strange the flickers of fancy and the cheats of hope yet lawful all the same weren t they those experiments tried with the truth that consisted at the worst but in practising on one s self She was now playing with the thought that Eugenio might INCLUSIVELY assist her he had brought home to her and always by remarks that were really quite soundless the conception hitherto ungrasped of some complete use of her wealth itself some use of it as a counter move to fate It had passed between them as preposterous that with so much money she should just stupidly and awkwardly WANT any more want a life a career a consciousness than want a house a carriage or a cook It was as if she had had from him a kind of expert professional measure of what he was in a position at a stretch to undertake for her the thoroughness of which for that matter she could closely compare with a looseness on Sir Luke Strett s part that at least in Palazzo Leporelli when mornings were fine showed as almost amateurish Sir Luke hadn t said to her Pay enough money and leave the rest to ME which was distinctly what Eugenio did say Sir Luke had appeared indeed to speak of purchase and payment but in reference to a different sort of cash Those were amounts not to be named nor reckoned and such moreover as she wasn t sure of having at her command Eugenio this was the difference could name could reckon and prices of HIS kind were things she had never suffered to scare her She had been willing goodness knew to pay enough for anything for everything and here was simply a new view of the sufficient quantity She amused herself for it came to that since Eugenio was there to sign the receipt with possibilities of meeting the bill She was more prepared than ever to pay enough and quite as much as ever to pay too much What else if such were points at which your most trusted servant failed was the use of being as the dear Susies of earth called you a princess in a palace She made now alone the full circuit of the place noble and peaceful while the summer sea stirring here and there a curtain or an outer blind breathed into its veiled spaces She had a vision of clinging to it that perhaps Eugenio could manage She was IN it as in the ark of her deluge and filled with such a tenderness for it that why shouldn t this in common mercy be warrant enough She would never never leave it she would engage to that would ask nothing more than to sit tight in it and float on and on The beauty and intensity the real momentary relief of this conceit reached their climax in the positive purpose to put the question to Eugenio on his return as she had not yet put it though the design it must be added dropped a little when coming back to the great saloon from which she had started on her pensive progress she found Lord Mark of whose arrival in Venice she had been unaware and who had now while a servant was following her through empty rooms been asked in her absence to wait He had waited then Lord Mark he was waiting oh unmistakeably never before had he so much struck her as the man to do that on occasion with patience to do it indeed almost as with gratitude for the chance though at the same time with a sort of notifying firmness The odd thing as she was afterwards to recall was that her wonder for what had brought him was not immediate but had come at the end of five minutes and also quite incoherently that she felt almost as glad to see him and almost as forgiving of his interruption of her solitude as if he had already been in her thought or acting at her suggestion He was somehow at the best the end of a respite one might like him very much and yet feel that his presence tempered precious solitude more than any other known to one in spite of all of which as he was neither dear Susie nor dear Kate nor dear Aunt Maud nor even for the least dear Eugenio in person the sight of him did no damage to her sense of the dispersal of her friends She hadn t been so thoroughly alone with him since those moments of his showing her the great portrait at Matcham the moments that had exactly made the high water mark of her security the moments during which her tears themselves those she had been ashamed of were the sign of her consciously rounding her protective promontory quitting the blue gulf of comparative ignorance and reaching her view of the troubled sea His presence now referred itself to his presence then reminding her how kind he had been altogether at Matcham and telling her unexpectedly at a time when she could particularly feel it that for such kindness and for the beauty of what they remembered together she hadn t lost him quite the contrary To receive him handsomely to receive him there to see him interested and charmed as well clearly as delighted to have found her without some other person to spoil it these things were so pleasant for the first minutes that they might have represented on her part some happy foreknowledge She gave an account of her companions while he on his side failed to press her about them even though describing his appearance so unheralded as the result of an impulse obeyed on the spot He had been shivering at Carlsbad belated there and blue when taken by it so that knowing where they all were he had simply caught the first train He explained how he had known where they were he had heard what more natural from their friends Milly s and his He mentioned this betimes but it was with his mention singularly that the girl became conscious of her inner question about his reason She noticed his plural which added to missus Lowder or added to Kate but she presently noticed also that it didn t affect her as explaining Aunt Maud had written to him Kate apparently and this was interesting had written to him but their design presumably hadn t been that he should come and sit there as if rather relieved so far as THEY were concerned at postponements He only said Oh and again Oh when she sketched their probable morning for him under Eugenio s care and missus Stringham s sounding it quite as if any suggestion that he should overtake them at the Rialto or the Bridge of Sighs would leave him temporarily cold This precisely it was that after a little operated for Milly as an obscure but still fairly direct check to confidence He had known where they all were from the others but it was not for the others that in his actual dispositions he had come That strange to say was a pity for stranger still to say she could have shown him more confidence if he himself had had less intention His intention so chilled her from the moment she found herself divining it that just for the pleasure of going on with him fairly just for the pleasure of their remembrance together of Matcham and the Bronzino the climax of her fortune she could have fallen to pleading with him and to reasoning to undeceiving him in time There had been for ten minutes with the directness of her welcome to him and the way this clearly pleased him something of the grace of amends made even though he couldn t know it amends for her not having been originally sure for instance at that first dinner of Aunt Maud s that he was adequately human That first dinner of Aunt Maud s added itself to the hour at Matcham added itself to other things to consolidate for her present benevolence the ease of their relation making it suddenly delightful that he had thus turned up He exclaimed as he looked about on the charm of the place What a temple to taste and an expression of the pride of life yet with all that what a jolly HOME so that for his entertainment she could offer to walk him about though she mentioned that she had just been for her own purposes in a general prowl taking everything in more susceptibly than before He embraced her offer without a scruple and seemed to rejoice that he was to find her susceptible Book Seventh Chapter four She couldn t have said what it was in the conditions that renewed the whole solemnity but by the end of twenty minutes a kind of wistful hush had fallen upon them as before something poignant in which her visitor also participated That was nothing verily but the perfection of the charm or nothing rather but their excluded disinherited state in the presence of it The charm turned on them a face that was cold in its beauty that was full of a poetry never to be theirs that spoke with an ironic smile of a possible but forbidden life It all rolled afresh over Milly Oh the impossible romance The romance for her yet once more would be to sit there for ever through all her time as in a fortress and the idea became an image of never going down of remaining aloft in the divine dustless air where she would hear but the plash of the water against stone The great floor on which they moved was at an altitude and this prompted the rueful fancy Ah not to go down never never to go down she strangely sighed to her friend But why shouldn t you he asked with that tremendous old staircase in your court There ought of course always to be people at top and bottom in Veronese costumes to watch you do it She shook her head both lightly and mournfully enough at his not understanding Not even for people in Veronese costumes I mean that the positive beauty is that one needn t go down I don t move in fact she added now I ve not been out you know I stay up That s how you happily found me Lord Mark wondered he was oh yes adequately human You don t go about She looked over the place the storey above the apartments in which she had received him the sala corresponding to the sala below and fronting the great canal with its gothic arches The casements between the arches were open the ledge of the balcony broad the sweep of the canal so overhung admirable and the flutter toward them of the loose white curtain an invitation to she scarce could have said what But there was no mystery after a moment she had never felt so invited to anything as to make that and that only just where she was her adventure It would be to this it kept coming back the adventure of not stirring I go about just here Do you mean Lord Mark presently asked that you re really not well They were at the window pausing lingering with the fine old faded palaces opposite and the slow Adriatic tide beneath but after a minute and before she answered she had closed her eyes to what she saw and unresistingly dropped her face into her arms which rested on the coping She had fallen to her knees on the cushion of the window place and she leaned there in a long silence with her forehead down She knew that her silence was itself too straight an answer but it was beyond her now to say that she saw her way She would have made the question itself impossible to others impossible for example to such a man as Merton Densher and she could wonder even on the spot what it was a sign of in her feeling for Lord Mark that from his lips it almost tempted her to break down This was doubtless really because she cared for him so little to let herself go with him thus suffer his touch to make her cup overflow would be the relief since it was actually for her nerves a question of relief that would cost her least If he had come to her moreover with the intention she believed or even if this intention had but been determined in him by the spell of their situation he mustn t be mistaken about her value for what value did she now have It throbbed within her as she knelt there that she had none at all though holding herself not yet speaking she tried even in the act to recover what might be possible of it With that there came to her a light wouldn t her value for the man who should marry her be precisely in the ravage of her disease SHE mightn t last but her money would For a man in whom the vision of her money should be intense in whom it should be most of the ground for making up to her any prospective failure on her part to be long for this world might easily count as a positive attraction Such a man proposing to please persuade secure her appropriate her for such a time shorter or longer as nature and the doctors should allow would make the best of her ill damaged disagreeable though she might be for the sake of eventual benefits she being clearly a person of the sort esteemed likely to do the handsome thing by a stricken and sorrowing husband She had said to herself betimes in a general way that whatever habits her youth might form that of seeing an interested suitor in every bush should certainly never grow to be one of them an attitude she had early judged as ignoble as poisonous She had had accordingly in fact as little to do with it as possible and she scarce knew why at the present moment she should have had to catch herself in the act of imputing an ugly motive It didn t sit the ugly motive in Lord Mark s cool English eyes the darker side of it at any rate showed to her imagination but briefly Suspicion moreover with this simplified itself there was a beautiful reason indeed there were two why her companion s motive shouldn t matter One was that even should he desire her without a penny she wouldn t marry him for the world the other was that she felt him after all perceptively kindly very pleasantly and humanly concerned for her They were also two things his wishing to be well to be very well with her and his beginning to feel her as threatened haunted blighted but they were melting together for him making him by their combination only the more sure that as he probably called it to himself he liked her That was presently what remained with her his really doing it and with the natural and proper incident of being conciliated by her weakness Would she really have had him she could ask herself that disconcerted or disgusted by it If he could only be touched enough to do what she preferred not to raise not to press any question he might render her a much better service than by merely enabling her to refuse him Again again it was strange but he figured to her for the moment as the one safe sympathiser It would have made her worse to talk to others but she wasn t afraid with him of how he might wince and look pale She would keep him that is her one easy relation in the sense of easy for himself Their actual outlook had meanwhile such charm what surrounded them within and without did so much toward making appreciative stillness as natural as at the opera that she could consider she hadn t made him hang on her lips when at last instead of saying if she were well or ill she repeated I go about here I don t get tired of it I never should it suits me so I adore the place she went on and I don t want in the least to give it up Neither should I if I had your luck Still with that luck for one s ALL Should you positively like to live here I think I should like said poor Milly after an instant to die here Which made him precisely laugh That was what she wanted when a person did care it was the pleasant human way without depths of darkness Oh it s not good enough for THAT That requires picking But can t you keep it It is you know the sort of place to see you in you carry out the note fill it people it quite by yourself and you might do much worse I mean for your friends than show yourself here a while three or four months every year But it s not my notion for the rest of the time One has quite other uses for you What sort of a use for me is it she smilingly enquired to kill me Do you mean we should kill you in England Well I ve seen you and I m afraid You re too much for me too many England bristles with questions This is more as you say there my form Oho oho he laughed again as if to humour her Can t you then buy it for a price Depend upon it they ll treat for money That is for money enough I ve exactly she said been wondering if they won t I think I shall try But if I get it I shall cling to it They were talking sincerely It will be my life paid for as that It will become my great gilded shell so that those who wish to find me must come and hunt me up Ah then you WILL be alive said Lord Mark Well not quite extinct perhaps but shrunken wasted wizened rattling about here like the dried kernel of a nut Oh Lord Mark returned we much as you mistrust us can do better for you than that In the sense that you ll feel it better for me really to have it over He let her see now that she worried him and after a look at her of some duration without his glasses which always altered the expression of his eyes he re settled the nippers on his nose and went back to the view But the view in turn soon enough released him Do you remember something I said to you that day at Matcham or at least fully meant to Oh yes I remember everything at Matcham It s another life Certainly it will be I mean the kind of thing what I then wanted it to represent for you Matcham you know he continued is symbolic I think I tried to rub that into you a little She met him with the full memory of what he had tried not an inch not an ounce of which was lost to her What I meant is that it seems a hundred years ago Oh for me it comes in better Perhaps a part of what makes me remember it he pursued is that I was quite aware of what might have been said about what I was doing I wanted you to take it from me that I should perhaps be able to look after you well rather better Rather better of course than certain other persons in particular Precisely than missus Lowder than Miss Croy even than missus Stringham Oh missus Stringham s all right Lord Mark promptly amended It amused her even with what she had else to think of and she could show him at all events how little in spite of the hundred years she had lost what he alluded to The way he was with her at this moment made in fact the other moment so vivid as almost to start again the tears it had started at the time You could do so much for me yes I perfectly understood you I wanted you see he despite this explained to FIX your confidence I mean you know in the right place Well Lord Mark you did it s just exactly now my confidence where you put it then The only difference said Milly is that I seem now to have no use for it Besides she then went on I do seem to feel you disposed to act in a way that would undermine it a little He took no more notice of these last words than if she hadn t said them only watching her at present as with a gradual new light Are you REALLY in any trouble To this on her side she gave no heed Making out his light was a little a light for herself Don t say don t try to say anything that s impossible There are much better things you can do He looked straight at it and then straight over it It s too monstrous that one can t ask you as a friend what one wants so to know What is it you want to know She spoke as by a sudden turn with a slight hardness Do you want to know if I m badly ill The sound of it in truth though from no raising of her voice invested the idea with a kind of terror but a terror all for others Lord Mark winced and flushed clearly couldn t help it but he kept his attitude together and spoke even with unwonted vivacity Do you imagine I can see you suffer and not say a word You won t see me suffer don t be afraid I shan t be a public nuisance That s why I should have liked THIS it s so beautiful in itself and yet it s out of the gangway You won t know anything about anything she added and then as if to make with decision an end And you DON T No not even you He faced her through it with the remains of his expression and she saw him as clearly for HIM bewildered which made her wish to be sure not to have been unkind She would be kind once for all that would be the end I m very badly ill And you don t do anything I do everything Everything s THIS she smiled I m doing it now One can t do more than live Ah than live in the right way no But is THAT what you do Why haven t you advice He had looked about at the rococo elegance as if there were fifty things it didn t give her so that he suggested with urgency the most absent But she met his remedy with a smile I ve the best advice in the world I m acting under it now I act upon it in receiving you in talking with you thus One can t as I tell you do more than live Oh live Lord Mark ejaculated Well it s immense for ME She finally spoke as if for amusement now that she had uttered her truth that he had learnt it from herself as no one had yet done her emotion had by the fact dried up There she was but it was as if she would never speak again I shan t she added have missed everything Why should you have missed ANYTHING She felt as he sounded this to what within the minute he had made up his mind You re the person in the world for whom that s least necessary for whom one would call it in fact most impossible for whom missing at all will surely require an extraordinary amount of misplaced good will Since you believe in advice for God s sake take MINE I know what you want Oh she knew he would know it But she had brought it on herself or almost Yet she spoke with kindness I think I want not to be too much worried You want to be adored It came at last straight Nothing would worry you less I mean as I shall do it It IS so he firmly kept it up You re not loved enough Enough for what Lord Mark Why to get the full good of it Well she didn t after all mock at him I see what you mean That full good of it which consists in finding one s self forced to love in return She had grasped it but she hesitated Your idea is that I might find myself forced to love YOU Oh forced He was so fine and so expert so awake to anything the least ridiculous and of a type with which the preaching of passion somehow so ill consorted he was so much all these things that he had absolutely to take account of them himself And he did so in a single intonation beautifully Milly liked him again liked him for such shades as that liked him so that it was woeful to see him spoiling it and still more woeful to have to rank him among those minor charms of existence that she gasped at moments to remember she must give up Is it inconceivable to you that you might try To be so favourably affected by you To believe in me To believe in me Lord Mark repeated Again she hesitated To try in return for your trying Oh I shouldn t have to he quickly declared The prompt neat accent however his manner of disposing of her question failed of real expression as he himself the next moment intelligently helplessly almost comically saw a failure pointed moreover by the laugh into which Milly was immediately startled As a suggestion to her of a healing and uplifting passion it WAS in truth deficient it wouldn t do as the communication of a force that should sweep them both away And the beauty of him was that he too even in the act of persuasion of self persuasion could understand that and could thereby show but the better as fitting into the pleasant commerce of prosperity The way she let him see that she looked at him was a thing to shut him out of itself from services of danger a thing that made a discrimination against him never yet made made at least to any consciousness of his own Born to float in a sustaining air this would be his first encounter with a judgement formed in the sinister light of tragedy The gathering dusk of HER personal world presented itself to him in her eyes as an element in which it was vain for him to pretend he could find himself at home since it was charged with depressions and with dooms with the chill of the losing game Almost without her needing to speak and simply by the fact that there could be in such a case no decent substitute for a felt intensity he had to take it from her that practically he was afraid whether afraid to protest falsely enough or only afraid of what might be eventually disagreeable in a compromised alliance being a minor question She believed she made out besides wonderful girl that he had never quite expected to have to protest about anything beyond his natural convenience more in fine than his disposition and habits his education as well his personal moyens in short permitted His predicament was therefore one he couldn t like and also one she willingly would have spared him hadn t he brought it on himself No man she was quite aware could enjoy thus having it from her that he wasn t good for what she would have called her reality It wouldn t have taken much more to enable her positively to make out in him that he was virtually capable of hinting had his innermost feeling spoken at the propriety rather in his interest of some cutting down some dressing up of the offensive real He would meet that halfway but the real must also meet HIM Milly s sense of it for herself which was so conspicuously so financially supported couldn t or wouldn t so accommodate him and the perception of that fairly showed in his face after a moment like the smart of a blow It had marked the one minute during which he could again be touching to her By the time he had tried once more after all to insist he had quite ceased to be so By this time she had turned from their window to make a diversion had walked him through other rooms appealing again to the inner charm of the place going even so far for that purpose as to point afresh her independent moral to repeat that if one only had such a house for one s own and loved it and cherished it enough it would pay one back in kind would close one in from harm He quite grasped for the quarter of an hour the perch she held out to him grasped it with one hand that is while she felt him attached to his own clue with the other he was by no means either so sore or so stupid to do him all justice as not to be able to behave more or less as if nothing had happened It was one of his merits to which she did justice too that both his native and his acquired notion of behaviour rested on the general assumption that nothing nothing to make a deadly difference for him ever COULD happen It was socially a working view like another and it saw them easily enough through the greater part of the rest of their adventure Downstairs again however with the limit of his stay in sight the sign of his smarting when all was said reappeared for her breaking out moreover with an effect of strangeness in another quite possibly sincere allusion to her state of health He might for that matter have been seeing what he could do in the way of making it a grievance that she should snub him for a charity on his own part exquisitely roused It s true you know all the same and I don t care a straw for your trying to freeze one up He seemed to show her poor man bravely how little he cared Everybody knows affection often makes things out when indifference doesn t notice And that s why I know that I notice Are you sure you ve got it right the girl smiled I thought rather that affection was supposed to be blind Blind to faults not to beauties Lord Mark promptly returned And are my extremely private worries my entirely domestic complications which I m ashamed to have given you a glimpse of are they beauties Yes for those who care for you as every one does Everything about you is a beauty Besides which I don t believe he declared in the seriousness of what you tell me It s too absurd you should have ANY trouble about which something can t be done If you can t get the right thing who CAN in all the world I should like to know You re the first young woman of your time I mean what I say He looked to do him justice quite as if he did not ardent but clear simply so competent in such a position to compare that his quiet assertion had the force not so much perhaps of a tribute as of a warrant We re all in love with you I ll put it that way dropping any claim of my own if you can bear it better I speak as one of the lot You weren t born simply to torment us you were born to make us happy Therefore you must listen to us She shook her head with her slowness but this time with all her mildness No I mustn t listen to you that s just what I mustn t do The reason is please that it simply kills me I must be as attached to you as you will since you give that lovely account of yourselves I give you in return the fullest possible belief of what it would be And she pulled up a little I give and give and give there you are stick to me as close as you like and see if I don t Only I can t listen or receive or accept I can t AGREE I can t make a bargain I can t really You must believe that from me It s all I ve wanted to say to you and why should it spoil anything He let her question fall though clearly it might have seemed because for reasons or for none there was so much that WAS spoiled You want somebody of your own He came back whether in good faith or in bad to that and it made her repeat her headshake He kept it up as if his faith were of the best You want somebody you want somebody She was to wonder afterwards if she hadn t been at this juncture on the point of saying something emphatic and vulgar Well I don t at all events want YOU What somehow happened nevertheless the pity of it being greater than the irritation the sadness to her vivid sense of his being so painfully astray wandering in a desert in which there was nothing to nourish him was that his error amounted to positive wrongdoing She was moreover so acquainted with quite another sphere of usefulness for him that her having suffered him to insist almost convicted her of indelicacy Why hadn t she stopped him off with her first impression of his purpose She could do so now only by the allusion she had been wishing not to make Do you know I don t think you re doing very right and as a thing quite apart I mean from my listening to you That s not right either except that I m NOT listening You oughtn t to have come to Venice to see ME and in fact you ve not come and you mustn t behave as if you had You ve much older friends than I and ever so much better Really if you ve come at all you can only have come properly and if I may say so honourably for the best friend as I believe her to be that you have in the world When once she had said it he took it oddly enough as if he had been more or less expecting it Still he looked at her very hard and they had a moment of this during which neither pronounced a name each apparently determined that the other should It was Milly s fine coercion in the event that was the stronger Miss Croy Lord Mark asked It might have been difficult to make out that she smiled missus Lowder He did make out something and then fairly coloured for its attestation of his comparative simplicity I call HER on the whole the best I can t imagine a man s having a better Still with his eyes on her he turned it over Do you want me to marry missus Lowder At which it seemed to her that it was he who was almost vulgar But she wouldn t in any way have that You know Lord Mark what I mean One isn t in the least turning you out into the cold world There s no cold world for you at all I think she went on nothing but a very warm and watchful and expectant world that s waiting for you at any moment you choose to take it up He never budged but they were standing on the polished concrete and he had within a few minutes possessed himself again of his hat Do you want me to marry Kate Croy missus Lowder wants it I do no wrong I think in saying that and she understands moreover that you know she does Well he showed how beautifully he could take it and it wasn t obscure to her on her side that it was a comfort to deal with a gentleman It s ever so kind of you to see such opportunities for me But what s the use of my tackling Miss Croy Milly rejoiced on the spot to be so able to point out Because she s the handsomest and cleverest and most charming creature I ever saw and because if I were a man I should simply adore her In fact I do as it is It was a luxury of response Oh my dear lady plenty of people adore her But that can t further the case of ALL Ah she went on I know about people If the case of one s bad the case of another s good I don t see what you have to fear from any one else she said save through your being foolish this way about ME So she said but she was aware the next moment of what he was making of what she didn t see Is it your idea since we re talking of these things in these ways that the young lady you describe in such superlative terms is to be had for the asking Well Lord Mark try She IS a great person But don t be humble She was almost gay It was this apparently at last that was too much for him But don t you really KNOW As a challenge practically to the commonest intelligence she could pretend to it made her of course wish to be fair I know yes that a particular person s very much in love with her Then you must know by the same token that she s very much in love with a particular person Ah I beg your pardon and Milly quite flushed at having so crude a blunder imputed to her You re wholly mistaken It s not true It s not true His stare became a smile Are you very very sure As sure as one can be and Milly s manner could match it when one has every assurance I speak on the best authority He hesitated missus Lowder s No I don t call missus Lowder s the best Oh I thought you were just now saying he laughed that everything about her s so good Good for you she was perfectly clear For you she went on let her authority be the best She doesn t believe what you mention and you must know yourself how little she makes of it So you can take it from her I take it But Milly with the positive tremor of her emphasis pulled up You take it from Kate From Kate herself That she s thinking of no one at all Of no one at all Then with her intensity she went on She has given me her word for it Oh said Lord Mark To which he next added And what do you call her word It made Milly on her side stare though perhaps partly but with the instinct of gaining time for the consciousness that she was already a little further in than she had designed Why Lord Mark what should YOU call her word Ah I m not obliged to say I ve not asked her You apparently have Well it threw her on her defence a defence that she felt however especially as of Kate We re very intimate she said in a moment so that without prying into each other s affairs she naturally tells me things Lord Mark smiled as at a lame conclusion You mean then she made you of her own movement the declaration you quote Milly thought again though with hindrance rather than help in her sense of the way their eyes now met met as for their each seeing in the other more than either said What she most felt that she herself saw was the strange disposition on her companion s part to disparage Kate s veracity She could be only concerned to stand up for that I mean what I say that when she spoke of her having no private interest She took her oath to you Lord Mark interrupted Milly didn t quite see why he should so catechise her but she met it again for Kate She left me in no doubt whatever of her being free At this Lord Mark did look at her though he continued to smile And thereby in no doubt of YOUR being too It was as if as soon as he had said it however he felt it as something of a mistake and she couldn t herself have told by what queer glare at him she had instantly signified that He at any rate gave her glare no time to act further he fell back on the spot and with a light enough movement within his rights That s all very well but why in the world dear lady should she be swearing to you She had to take this dear lady as applying to herself which disconcerted her when he might now so gracefully have used it for the aspersed Kate Once more it came to her that she must claim her own part of the aspersion Because as I ve told you we re such tremendous friends Oh said Lord Mark who for the moment looked as if that might have stood rather for an absence of such rigours He was going however as if he had in a manner at the last got more or less what he wanted Milly felt while he addressed his next few words to leave taking that she had given rather more than she intended or than she should be able when once more getting herself into hand theoretically to defend Strange enough in fact that he had had from her about herself and under the searching spell of the place infinitely straight what no one else had had neither Kate nor Aunt Maud nor Merton Densher nor Susan Shepherd He had made her within a minute in particular she was aware lose her presence of mind and she now wished he would take himself off so that she might either recover it or bear the loss better in solitude If he paused however she almost at the same time saw it was because of his watching the approach from the end of the sala of one of the gondoliers who whatever excursions were appointed for the party with the attendance of the others always as the most decorative most sashed and starched remained at the palace on the theory that she might whimsically want him which she never in her caged freedom had yet done Brown Pasquale slipping in white shoes over the marble and suggesting to her perpetually charmed vision she could scarce say what either a mild Hindoo too noiseless almost for her nerves or simply a barefooted seaman on the deck of a ship Pasquale offered to sight a small salver which he obsequiously held out to her with its burden of a visiting card Lord Mark and as if also for admiration of him delayed his departure to let her receive it on which she read it with the instant effect of another blow to her presence of mind This precarious quantity was indeed now so gone that even for dealing with Pasquale she had to do her best to conceal its disappearance The effort was made none the less by the time she had asked if the gentleman were below and had taken in the fact that he had come up He had followed the gondolier and was waiting at the top of the staircase I ll see him with pleasure To which she added for her companion while Pasquale went off mister Merton Densher Oh said Lord Mark in a manner that making it resound through the great cool hall might have carried it even to Densher s ear as a judgement of his identity heard and noted once before Book Eighth Chapter one Densher became aware afresh that he disliked his hotel and all the more promptly that he had had occasion of old to make the same discrimination The establishment choked at that season with the polyglot herd cockneys of all climes mainly German mainly American mainly English it appeared as the corresponding sensitive nerve was touched sounded loud and not sweet sounded anything and everything but Italian but Venetian The Venetian was all a dialect he knew yet it was pure Attic beside some of the dialects at the bustling inn It made abroad both for his pleasure and his pain that he had to feel at almost any point how he had been through everything before He had been three or four times in Venice during other visits through this pleasant irritation of paddling away away from the concert of false notes in the vulgarised hall away from the amiable American families and overfed German porters He had in each case made terms for a lodging more private and not more costly and he recalled with tenderness these shabby but friendly asylums the windows of which he should easily know again in passing on canal or through campo The shabbiest now failed of an appeal to him but he found himself at the end of forty eight hours forming views in respect to a small independent quartiere far down the Grand Canal which he had once occupied for a month with a sense of pomp and circumstance and yet also with a growth of initiation into the homelier Venetian mysteries The humour of those days came back to him for an hour and what further befell in this interval to be brief was that emerging on a traghetto in sight of the recognised house he made out on the green shutters of his old of his young windows the strips of white pasted paper that figure in Venice as an invitation to tenants This was in the course of his very first walk apart a walk replete with impressions to which he responded with force He had been almost without cessation since his arrival at Palazzo Leporelli where as happened a turn of bad weather on the second day had kept the whole party continuously at home The episode had passed for him like a series of hours in a museum though without the fatigue of that and it had also resembled something that he was still with a stirred imagination to find a name for He might have been looking for the name while he gave himself up subsequently to the ramble he saw that even after years he couldn t lose his way crowned with his stare across the water at the little white papers He was to dine at the palace in an hour or two and he had lunched there at an early luncheon that morning He had then been out with the three ladies the three being missus Lowder missus Stringham and Kate and had kept afloat with them under a sufficient Venetian spell until Aunt Maud had directed him to leave them and return to Miss Theale Of two circumstances connected with this disposition of his person he was even now not unmindful the first being that the lady of Lancaster Gate had addressed him with high publicity and as if expressing equally the sense of her companions who had not spoken but who might have been taken yes Susan Shepherd quite equally with Kate for inscrutable parties to her plan What he could as little contrive to forget was that he had before the two others as it struck him that was to say especially before Kate done exactly as he was bidden gathered himself up without a protest and retraced his way to the palace Present with him still was the question of whether he looked a fool for it of whether the awkwardness he felt as the gondola rocked with the business of his leaving it they could but make in submission for a landing place that was none of the best had furnished his friends with such entertainment as was to cause them behind his back to exchange intelligent smiles He had found Milly Theale twenty minutes later alone and he had sat with her till the others returned to tea The strange part of this was that it had been very easy extraordinarily easy He knew it for strange only when he was away from her because when he was away from her he was in contact with particular things that made it so At the time in her presence it was as simple as sitting with his sister might have been and not if the point were urged very much more thrilling He continued to see her as he had first seen her that remained ineffaceably behind missus Lowder Susan Shepherd his own Kate might each in proportion see her as a princess as an angel as a star but for himself luckily she hadn t as yet complications to any point of discomfort the princess the angel the star were muffled over ever so lightly and brightly with the little American girl who had been kind to him in New York and to whom certainly though without making too much of it for either of them he was perfectly willing to be kind in return She appreciated his coming in on purpose but there was nothing in that from the moment she was always at home that they couldn t easily keep up The only note the least bit high that had even yet sounded between them was this admission on her part that she found it best to remain within She wouldn t let him call it keeping quiet for she insisted that her palace with all its romance and art and history had set up round her a whirlwind of suggestion that never dropped for an hour It wasn t therefore within such walls confinement it was the freedom of all the centuries in respect to which Densher granted good humouredly that they were then blown together she and he as much as she liked through space Kate had found on the present occasion a moment to say to him that he suggested a clever cousin calling on a cousin afflicted and bored for his pains and though he denied on the spot the bored he could so far see it as an impression he might make that he wondered if the same image wouldn t have occurred to Milly As soon as Kate appeared again the difference came up the oddity as he then instantly felt it of his having sunk so deep It was sinking because it was all doing what Kate had conceived for him it wasn t in the least doing and that had been his notion of his life anything he himself had conceived The difference accordingly renewed sharp sore was the irritant under which he had quitted the palace and under which he was to make the best of the business of again dining there He said to himself that he must make the best of everything that was in his mind at the traghetto even while with his preoccupation about changing quarters he studied across the canal the look of his former abode It had done for the past would it do for the present would it play in any manner into the general necessity of which he was conscious That necessity of making the best was the instinct as he indeed himself knew of a man somehow aware that if he let go at one place he should let go everywhere If he took off his hand the hand that at least helped to hold it together the whole queer fabric that built him in would fall away in a minute and admit the light It was really a matter of nerves it was exactly because he was nervous that he COULD go straight yet if that condition should increase he must surely go wild He was walking in short on a high ridge steep down on either side where the proprieties once he could face at all remaining there reduced themselves to his keeping his head It was Kate who had so perched him and there came up for him at moments as he found himself planting one foot exactly before another a sensible sharpness of irony as to her management of him It wasn t that she had put him in danger to be in real danger with her would have had another quality There glowed for him in fact a kind of rage at what he wasn t having an exasperation a resentment begotten truly by the very impatience of desire in respect to his postponed and relegated his so extremely manipulated state It was beautifully done of her but what was the real meaning of it unless that he was perpetually bent to her will His idea from the first from the very first of his knowing her had been to be as the French called it bon prince with her mindful of the good humour and generosity the contempt in the matter of confidence for small outlays and small savings that belonged to the man who wasn t generally afraid There were things enough goodness knew for it was the moral of his plight that he couldn t afford but what had had a charm for him if not the notion of living handsomely to make up for it in another way of not at all events reading the romance of his existence in a cheap edition All he had originally felt in her came back to him was indeed actually as present as ever how he had admired and envied what he called to himself her pure talent for life as distinguished from his own a poor weak thing of the occasion amateurishly patched up only it irritated him the more that this was exactly what was now ever so characteristically standing out in her It was thanks to her pure talent for life verily that he was just where he was and that he was above all just HOW he was The proof of a decent reaction in him against so much passivity was with no great richness that he at least knew knew that is how he was and how little he liked it as a thing accepted in mere helplessness He was for the moment wistful that above all described it that was so large a part of the force that as the autumn afternoon closed in kept him on his traghetto positively throbbing with his question His question connected itself even while he stood with his special smothered soreness his sense almost of shame and the soreness and the shame were less as he let himself with the help of the conditions about him regard it as serious It was born for that matter partly of the conditions those conditions that Kate had so almost insolently braved had been willing without a pang to see him ridiculously ridiculously so far as just complacently exposed to How little it COULD be complacently he was to feel with the last thoroughness before he had moved from his point of vantage His question as we have called it was the interesting question of whether he had really no will left How could he know that was the point without putting the matter to the test It had been right to be bon prince and the joy something of the pride of having lived in spirit handsomely was even now compatible with the impulse to look into their account but he held his breath a little as it came home to him with supreme sharpness that whereas he had done absolutely everything that Kate had wanted she had done nothing whatever that he had So it was in fine that his idea of the test by which he must try that possibility kept referring itself in the warm early dusk the approach of the Southern night conditions these such as we just spoke of to the glimmer more and more ghostly as the light failed of the little white papers on his old green shutters By the time he looked at his watch he had been for a quarter of an hour at this post of observation and reflexion but by the time he walked away again he had found his answer to the idea that had grown so importunate Since a proof of his will was wanted it was indeed very exactly in wait for him it lurked there on the other side of the Canal A ferryman at the little pier had from time to time accosted him but it was a part of the play of his nervousness to turn his back on that facility He would go over but he walked very quickly round and round crossing finally by the Rialto The rooms in the event were unoccupied the ancient padrona was there with her smile all a radiance but her recognition all a fable the ancient rickety objects too refined in their shabbiness amiable in their decay as to which on his side demonstrations were tenderly veracious so that before he took his way again he had arranged to come in on the morrow He was amusing about it that evening at dinner in spite of an odd first impulse which at the palace quite melted away to treat it merely as matter for his own satisfaction This need this propriety he had taken for granted even up to the moment of suddenly perceiving in the course of talk that the incident would minister to innocent gaiety Such was quite its effect with the aid of his picture an evocation of the quaint of the humblest rococo of a Venetian interior in the true old note He made the point for his hostess that her own high chambers though they were a thousand grand things weren t really this made it in fact with such success that she presently declared it his plain duty to invite her on some near day to tea She had expressed as yet he could feel it as felt among them all no such clear wish to go anywhere not even to make an effort for a parish feast or an autumn sunset nor to descend her staircase for Titian or Gianbellini It was constantly Densher s view that as between himself and Kate things were understood without saying so that he could catch in her as she but too freely could in him innumerable signs of it the whole soft breath of consciousness meeting and promoting consciousness This view was so far justified to night as that Milly s offer to him of her company was to his sense taken up by Kate in spite of her doing nothing to show it It fell in so perfectly with what she had desired and foretold that she was and this was what most struck him sufficiently gratified and blinded by it not to know from the false quality of his response from his tone and his very look which for an instant instinctively sought her own that he had answered inevitably almost shamelessly in a mere time gaining sense It gave him on the spot her failure of perception almost a beginning of the advantage he had been planning for that is at least if she too were not darkly dishonest She might he was not unaware have made out from some deep part of her the bearing in respect to herself of the little fact he had announced for she was after all capable of that capable of guessing and yet of simultaneously hiding her guess It wound him up a turn or two further none the less to impute to her now a weakness of vision by which he could himself feel the stronger Whatever apprehension of his motive in shifting his abode might have brushed her with its wings she at all events certainly didn t guess that he was giving their friend a hollow promise That was what she had herself imposed on him there had been in the prospect from the first a definite particular point at which hollowness to call it by its least compromising name would have to begin Therefore its hour had now charmingly sounded Whatever in life he had recovered his old rooms for he had not recovered them to receive Milly Theale which made no more difference in his expression of happy readiness than if he had been just what he was trying not to be fully hardened and fully base So rapid in fact was the rhythm of his inward drama that the quick vision of impossibility produced in him by his hostess s direct and unexpected appeal had the effect slightly sinister of positively scaring him It gave him a measure of the intensity the reality of his now mature motive It prompted in him certainly no quarrel with these things but it made them as vivid as if they already flushed with success It was before the flush of success that his heart beat almost to dread The dread was but the dread of the happiness to be compassed only that was in itself a symptom That a visit from Milly should in this projection of necessities strike him as of the last incongruity quite as a hateful idea and above all as spoiling should one put it grossly his game the adoption of such a view might of course have an identity with one of those numerous ways of being a fool that seemed so to abound for him It would remain none the less the way to which he should be in advance most reconciled His mature motive as to which he allowed himself no grain of illusion had thus in an hour taken imaginative possession of the place that precisely was how he saw it seated there already unpacked and settled for Milly s innocence for Milly s beauty no matter how short a time to be housed with There were things she would never recognise never feel never catch in the air but this made no difference in the fact that her brushing against them would do nobody any good The discrimination and the scruple were for HIM So he felt all the parts of the case together while Kate showed admirably as feeling none of them Of course however when hadn t it to be his last word Kate was always sublime That came up in all connexions during the rest of these first days came up in especial under pressure of the fact that each time our plighted pair snatched in its passage at the good fortune of half an hour together they were doomed though Densher felt it as all by HIS act to spend a part of the rare occasion in wonder at their luck and in study of its queer character This was the case after he might be supposed to have got in a manner used to it it was the case after the girl ready always as we say with the last word had given him the benefit of her righting of every wrong appearance a support familiar to him now in reference to other phases It was still the case after he possibly might with a little imagination as she freely insisted have made out by the visible working of the crisis what idea on missus Lowder s part had determined it Such as the idea was and that it suited Kate s own book she openly professed he had only to see how things were turning out to feel it strikingly justified Densher s reply to all this vividness was that of course Aunt Maud s intervention hadn t been occult even for HIS vividness from the moment she had written him with characteristic concentration that if he should see his way to come to Venice for a fortnight she should engage he would find it no blunder It took Aunt Maud really to do such things in such ways just as it took him he was ready to confess to do such others as he must now strike them all didn t he as committed to missus Lowder s admonition had been of course a direct reference to what she had said to him at Lancaster Gate before his departure the night Milly had failed them through illness only it had at least matched that remarkable outbreak in respect to the quantity of good nature it attributed to him The young man s discussions of his situation which were confined to Kate he had none with Aunt Maud herself suffered a little it may be divined by the sense that he couldn t put everything off as he privately expressed it on other people His ears in solitude were apt to burn with the reflexion that missus Lowder had simply tested him seen him as he was and made out what could be done with him She had had but to whistle for him and he had come If she had taken for granted his good nature she was as justified as Kate declared This awkwardness of his conscience both in respect to his general plasticity the fruit of his feeling plasticity within limits to be a mode of life like another certainly better than some and particularly in respect to such confusion as might reign about what he had really come for this inward ache was not wholly dispelled by the style charming as that was of Kate s poetic versions Even the high wonder and delight of Kate couldn t set him right with himself when there was something quite distinct from these things that kept him wrong In default of being right with himself he had meanwhile for one thing the interest of seeing and quite for the first time in his life whether on a given occasion that might be quite so necessary to happiness as was commonly assumed and as he had up to this moment never doubted He was engaged distinctly in an adventure he who had never thought himself cut out for them and it fairly helped him that he was able at moments to say to himself that he mustn t fall below it At his hotel alone by night or in the course of the few late strolls he was finding time to take through dusky labyrinthine alleys and empty campi overhung with mouldering palaces where he paused in disgust at his want of ease and where the sound of a rare footstep on the enclosed pavement was like that of a retarded dancer in a banquet hall deserted during these interludes he entertained cold views even to the point at moments on the principle that the shortest follies are the best of thinking of immediate departure as not only possible but as indicated He had however only to cross again the threshold of Palazzo Leporelli to see all the elements of the business compose as painters called it differently It began to strike him then that departure wouldn t curtail but would signally coarsen his folly and that above all as he hadn t really begun anything had only submitted consented but too generously indulged and condoned the beginnings of others he had no call to treat himself with superstitious rigour The single thing that was clear in complications was that whatever happened one was to behave as a gentleman to which was added indeed the perhaps slightly less shining truth that complications might sometimes have their tedium beguiled by a study of the question of how a gentleman would behave This question I hasten to add was not in the last resort Densher s greatest worry Three women were looking to him at once and though such a predicament could never be from the point of view of facility quite the ideal it yet had thank goodness its immediate workable law The law was not to be a brute in return for amiabilities He hadn t come all the way out from England to be a brute He hadn t thought of what it might give him to have a fortnight however handicapped with Kate in Venice to be a brute He hadn t treated missus Lowder as if in responding to her suggestion he had understood her he hadn t done that either to be a brute And what he had prepared least of all for such an anti climax was the prompt and inevitable the achieved surrender AS a gentleman oh that indubitably to the unexpected impression made by poor pale exquisite Milly as the mistress of a grand old palace and the dispenser of an hospitality more irresistible thanks to all the conditions than any ever known to him This spectacle had for him an eloquence an authority a felicity he scarce knew by what strange name to call it for which he said to himself that he had not consciously bargained Her welcome her frankness sweetness sadness brightness her disconcerting poetry as he made shift at moments to call it helped as it was by the beauty of her whole setting and by the perception at the same time on the observer s part that this element gained from her in a manner for effect and harmony as much as it gave her whole attitude had to his imagination meanings that hung about it waiting upon her hovering dropping and quavering forth again like vague faint snatches mere ghosts of sound of old fashioned melancholy music It was positively well for him he had his times of reflecting that he couldn t put it off on Kate and missus Lowder as a gentleman so conspicuously wouldn t that well that he had been rather taken in by not having known in advance There had been now five days of it all without his risking even to Kate alone any hint of what he ought to have known and of what in particular therefore had taken him in The truth was doubtless that really when it came to any free handling and naming of things they were living together the five of them in an air in which an ugly effect of blurting out might easily be produced He came back with his friend on each occasion to the blest miracle of renewed propinquity which had a double virtue in that favouring air He breathed on it as if he could scarcely believe it yet the time had passed in spite of this privilege without his quite committing himself for her ear to any such comment on Milly s high style and state as would have corresponded with the amount of recognition it had produced in him Behind everything for him was his renewed remembrance which had fairly become a habit that he had been the first to know her This was what they had all insisted on in her absence that day at missus Lowder s and this was in especial what had made him feel its influence on his immediately paying her a second visit Its influence had been all there been in the high hung rumbling carriage with them from the moment she took him to drive covering them in together as if it had been a rug of softest silk It had worked as a clear connexion with something lodged in the past something already their own He had more than once recalled how he had said to himself even at that moment at some point in the drive that he was not THERE not just as he was in so doing it through Kate and Kate s idea but through Milly and Milly s own and through himself and HIS own unmistakeably as well as through the little facts whatever they had amounted to of his time in New York Book Eighth Chapter two There was at last with everything that made for it an occasion when he got from Kate on what she now spoke of as his eternal refrain an answer of which he was to measure afterwards the precipitating effect His eternal refrain was the way he came back to the riddle of missus Lowder s view of her profit a view so hard to reconcile with the chances she gave them to meet Impatiently at this the girl denied the chances wanting to know from him with a fine irony that smote him rather straight whether he felt their opportunities as anything so grand He looked at her deep in the eyes when she had sounded this note it was the least he could let her off with for having made him visibly flush For some reason then with it the sharpness dropped out of her tone which became sweet and sincere Meet my dear man she expressively echoed does it strike you that we get after all so very much out of our meetings On the contrary they re starvation diet All I mean is and it s all I ve meant from the day I came that we at least get more than Aunt Maud Ah but you see Kate replied you don t understand what Aunt Maud gets Exactly so and it s what I don t understand that keeps me so fascinated with the question SHE gives me no light she s prodigious She takes everything as of a natural She takes it as of a natural that at this rate I shall be making my reflexions about you There s every appearance for her Kate went on that what she had made her mind up to as possible IS possible that what she had thought more likely than not to happen IS happening The very essence of her as you surely by this time have made out for yourself is that when she adopts a view she well to her own sense really brings the thing about fairly terrorises with her view any other any opposite view and those not less who represent that I ve often thought success comes to her Kate continued to study the phenomenon by the spirit in her that dares and defies her idea not to prove the right one One has seen it so again and again in the face of everything BECOME the right one Densher had for this as he listened a smile of the largest response Ah my dear child if you can explain I of course needn t not understand I m condemned to that he on his side presently explained only when understanding fails He took a moment then he pursued Does she think she terrorises US To which he added while without immediate speech Kate but looked over the place Does she believe anything so stiff as that you ve really changed about me He knew now that he was probing the girl deep something told him so but that was a reason the more Has she got it into her head that you dislike me To this of a sudden Kate s answer was strong You could yourself easily put it there He wondered By telling her so No said Kate as with amusement at his simplicity I don t ask that of you Oh my dear Densher laughed when you ask you know so little There was a full irony in this on his own part that he saw her resist the impulse to take up I m perfectly justified in what I ve asked she quietly returned It s doing beautifully for you Their eyes again intimately met and the effect was to make her proceed You re not a bit unhappy Oh ain t I he brought out very roundly It doesn t practically show which is enough for Aunt Maud You re wonderful you re beautiful Kate said and if you really want to know whether I believe you re doing it you may take from me perfectly that I see it coming With which by a quick transition as if she had settled the case she asked him the hour Oh only twelve ten he had looked at his watch We ve taken but thirteen minutes we ve time yet Then we must walk We must go toward them Densher from where they had been standing measured the long reach of the Square They re still in their shop They re safe for half an hour That shows then that shows said Kate This colloquy had taken place in the middle of Piazza San Marco always as a great social saloon a smooth floored blue roofed chamber of amenity favourable to talk or rather to be exact not in the middle but at the point where our pair had paused by a common impulse after leaving the great mosque like church It rose now domed and pinnacled but a little way behind them and they had in front the vast empty space enclosed by its arcades to which at that hour movement and traffic were mostly confined Venice was at breakfast the Venice of the visitor and the possible acquaintance and except for the parties of importunate pigeons picking up the crumbs of perpetual feasts their prospect was clear and they could see their companions hadn t yet been and weren t for a while longer likely to be disgorged by the lace shop in one of the loggie where shortly before they had left them for a look in the expression was artfully Densher s at Saint Mark s Their morning had happened to take such a turn as brought this chance to the surface yet his allusion just made to Kate hadn t been an overstatement of their general opportunity The worst that could be said of their general opportunity was that it was essentially in presence in presence of every one every one consisting at this juncture in a peopled world of Susan Shepherd Aunt Maud and Milly But the proof how even in presence the opportunity could become special was furnished precisely by this view of the compatibility of their comfort with a certain amount of lingering The others had assented to their not waiting in the shop it was of course the least the others could do What had really helped them this morning was the fact that on his turning up as he always called it at the palace Milly had not as before been able to present herself Custom and use had hitherto seemed fairly established on his coming round day after day eight days had been now so conveniently marked their friends Milly s and his conveniently dispersed and left him to sit with her till luncheon Such was the perfect operation of the scheme on which he had been as he phrased it to himself had out so that certainly there was that amount of justification for Kate s vision of success He HAD for missus Lowder he couldn t help it while sitting there the air which was the thing to be desired of no absorption in Kate sufficiently deep to be alarming He had failed their young hostess each morning as little as she had failed him it was only to day that she hadn t been well enough to see him That had made a mark all round the mark was in the way in which gathered in the room of state with the place from the right time all bright and cool and beflowered as always to receive her descent they the rest of them simply looked at each other It was lurid lurid in all probability for each of them privately that they had uttered no common regrets It was strange for our young man above all that if the poor girl was indisposed to THAT degree the hush of gravity of apprehension of significance of some sort should be the most the case that of the guests could permit itself The hush for that matter continued after the party of four had gone down to the gondola and taken their places in it Milly had sent them word that she hoped they would go out and enjoy themselves and this indeed had produced a second remarkable look a look as of their knowing one quite as well as the other what such a message meant as provision for the alternative beguilement of Densher She wished not to have spoiled his morning and he had therefore in civility to take it as pleasantly patched up missus Stringham had helped the affair out missus Stringham who when it came to that knew their friend better than any of them She knew her so well that she knew herself as acting in exquisite compliance with conditions comparatively obscure approximately awful to them by not thinking it necessary to stay at home She had corrected that element of the perfunctory which was the slight fault for all of them of the occasion she had invented a preference for missus Lowder and herself she had remembered the fond dreams of the visitation of lace that had hitherto always been brushed away by accidents and it had come up as well for her that Kate had the day before spoken of the part played by fatality in her own failure of real acquaintance with the inside of Saint Mark s Densher s sense of Susan Shepherd s conscious intervention had by this time a corner of his mind all to itself something that had begun for them at Lancaster Gate was now a sentiment clothed in a shape her action ineffably discreet had at all events a way of affecting him as for the most part subtly even when not superficially in his own interest They were not as a pair as a team really united there were too many persons at least three and too many things between them but meanwhile something was preparing that would draw them closer He scarce knew what probably nothing but his finding at some hour when it would be a service to do so that she had all the while understood him He even had a presentiment of a juncture at which the understanding of every one else would fail and this deep little person s alone survive Such was to day in its freshness the moral air as we may say that hung about our young friends these had been the small accidents and quiet forces to which they owed the advantage we have seen them in some sort enjoying It seemed in fact fairly to deepen for them as they stayed their course again the splendid Square which had so notoriously in all the years witnessed more of the joy of life than any equal area in Europe furnished them in their remoteness from earshot with solitude and security It was as if being in possession they could say what they liked and it was also as if in consequence of that each had an apprehension of what the other wanted to say It was most of all for them moreover as if this very quantity seated on their lips in the bright historic air where the only sign for their cars was the flutter of the doves begot in the heart of each a fear There might have been a betrayal of that in the way Densher broke the silence resting on her last words What did you mean just now that I can do to make missus Lowder believe For myself stupidly if you will I don t see from the moment I can t lie to her what else there IS but lying Well she could tell him You can say something both handsome and sincere to her about Milly whom you honestly like so much That wouldn t be lying and coming from you it would have an effect You don t you know say much about her And Kate put before him the fruit of observation You don t you know speak of her at all And has Aunt Maud Densher asked told you so Then as the girl for answer only seemed to bethink herself You must have extraordinary conversations he exclaimed Yes she had bethought herself We have extraordinary conversations His look while their eyes met marked him as disposed to hear more about them but there was something in her own apparently that defeated the opportunity He questioned her in a moment on a different matter which had been in his mind a week yet in respect to which he had had no chance so good as this Do you happen to know then as such wonderful things pass between you what she makes of the incident the other day of Lord Mark s so very superficial visit his having spent here as I gather but the two or three hours necessary for seeing our friend and yet taken no time at all since he went off by the same night s train for seeing any one else What can she make of his not having waited to see YOU or to see herself with all he owes her Oh of course said Kate she understands He came to make Milly his offer of marriage he came for nothing but that As Milly wholly declined it his business was for the time at an end He couldn t quite on the spot turn round to make up to US Kate had looked surprised that as a matter of taste on such an adventurer s part Densher shouldn t see it But Densher was lost in another thought Do you mean that when turning up myself I found him leaving her that was what had been taking place between them Didn t you make it out my dear Kate enquired What sort of a blundering weathercock then IS he the young man went on in his wonder Oh don t make too little of him Kate smiled Do you pretend that Milly didn t tell you How great an ass he had made of himself Kate continued to smile You ARE in love with her you know He gave her another long look Why since she has refused him should my opinion of Lord Mark show it I m not obliged however to think well of him for such treatment of the other persons I ve mentioned and I feel I don t understand from you why missus Lowder should She doesn t but she doesn t care Kate explained You know perfectly the terms on which lots of London people live together even when they re supposed to live very well He s not committed to us he was having his try Mayn t an unsatisfied man she asked always have his try And come back afterwards with confidence in a welcome to the victim of his inconstancy Kate consented as for argument to be thought of as a victim Oh but he has HAD his try at ME So it s all right Through your also having you mean refused him She balanced an instant during which Densher might have just wondered if pure historic truth were to suffer a slight strain But she dropped on the right side I haven t let it come to that I ve been too discouraging Aunt Maud she went on now as lucid as ever considers no doubt that she has a pledge from him in respect to me a pledge that would have been broken if Milly had accepted him As the case stands that makes no difference Densher laughed out It isn t HIS merit that he has failed It s still his merit my dear that he s Lord Mark He s just what he was and what he knew he was It s not for me either to reflect on him after I ve so treated him Oh said Densher impatiently you ve treated him beautifully I m glad she smiled that you can still be jealous But before he could take it up she had more to say I don t see why it need puzzle you that Milly s so marked line gratifies Aunt Maud more than anything else can displease her What does she see but that Milly herself recognises her situation with you as too precious to be spoiled Such a recognition as that can t but seem to her to involve in some degree your own recognition Out of which she therefore gets it that the more you have for Milly the less you have for me There were moments again we know that from the first they had been numerous when he felt with a strange mixed passion the mastery of her mere way of putting things There was something in it that bent him at once to conviction and to reaction And this effect however it be named now broke into his tone Oh if she began to know what I have for you It wasn t ambiguous but Kate stood up to it Luckily for us we may really consider she doesn t So successful have we been Well he presently said I take from you what you give me and I suppose that to be consistent to stand on my feet where I do stand at all I ought to thank you Only you know what you give me seems to me more than anything else the larger and larger size of my job It seems to me more than anything else what you expect of me It never seems to me somehow what I may expect of YOU There s so much you DON T give me She appeared to wonder And pray what is it I don t I give you proof said Densher You give me none What then do you call proof she after a moment ventured to ask Your doing something for me She considered with surprise Am I not doing THIS for you Do you call this nothing Nothing at all Ah I risk my dear everything for it They had strolled slowly further but he was brought up short I thought you exactly contend that with your aunt so bamboozled you risk nothing It was the first time since the launching of her wonderful idea that he had seen her at a loss He judged the next instant moreover that she didn t like it either the being so or the being seen for she soon spoke with an impatience that showed her as wounded an appearance that produced in himself he no less quickly felt a sharp pang of indulgence What then do you wish me to risk The appeal from danger touched him but all to make him as he would have said worse What I wish is to be loved How can I feel at this rate that I AM Oh she understood him for all she might so bravely disguise it and that made him feel straighter than if she hadn t Deep always was his sense of life with her deep as it had been from the moment of those signs of life that in the dusky London of two winters ago they had originally exchanged He had never taken her for unguarded ignorant weak and if he put to her a claim for some intenser faith between them this was because he believed it could reach her and she could meet it I can go on perhaps he said with help But I can t go on without She looked away from him now and it showed him how she understood We ought to be there I mean when they come out They WON T come out not yet And I don t care if they do To which he straightway added as if to deal with the charge of selfishness that his words sounding for himself struck him as enabling her to make Why not have done with it all and face the music as we are It broke from him in perfect sincerity Good God if you d only TAKE me It brought her eyes round to him again and he could see how after all somewhere deep within she felt his rebellion more sweet than bitter Its effect on her spirit and her sense was visibly to hold her an instant We ve gone too far she none the less pulled herself together to reply Do you want to kill her He had an hesitation that wasn t all candid Kill you mean Aunt Maud You know whom I mean We ve told too many lies Oh at this his head went up I my dear have told none He had brought it out with a sharpness that did him good but he had naturally none the less to take the look it made her give him Thank you very much Her expression however failed to check the words that had already risen to his lips Rather than lay myself open to the least appearance of it I ll go this very night Then go said Kate Croy He knew after a little while they walked on again together that what was in the air for him and disconcertingly was not the violence but much rather the cold quietness of the way this had come from her They walked on together and it was for a minute as if their difference had become of a sudden in all truth a split as if the basis of his departure had been settled Then incoherently and still more suddenly recklessly moreover since they now might easily from under the arcades be observed he passed his hand into her arm with a force that produced for them another pause I ll tell any lie you want any your idea requires if you ll only come to me Come to you Come to me How Where She spoke low but there was somehow for his uncertainty a wonder in her being so equal to him To my rooms which are perfectly possible and in taking which the other day I had you as you must have felt in view We can arrange it with two grains of courage People in our case always arrange it She listened as for the good information and there was support for him since it was a question of his going step by step in the way she took no refuge in showing herself shocked He had in truth not expected of her that particular vulgarity but the absence of it only added the thrill of a deeper reason to his sense of possibilities For the knowledge of what she was he had absolutely to SEE her now incapable of refuge stand there for him in all the light of the day and of his admirable merciless meaning Her mere listening in fact made him even understand himself as he hadn t yet done Idea for idea his own was thus already and in the germ beautiful There s nothing for me possible but to feel that I m not a fool It s all I have to say but you must know what it means WITH you I can do it I ll go as far as you demand or as you will yourself Without you I ll be hanged And I must be sure She listened so well that she was really listening after he had ceased to speak He had kept his grasp of her drawing her close and though they had again for the time stopped walking his talk for others at a distance might have been in the matchless place that of any impressed tourist to any slightly more detached companion On possessing himself of her arm he had made her turn so that they faced afresh to Saint Mark s over the great presence of which his eyes moved while she twiddled her parasol She now however made a motion that confronted them finally with the opposite end Then only she spoke Please take your hand out of my arm He understood at once she had made out in the shade of the gallery the issue of the others from their place of purchase So they went to them side by side and it was all right The others had seen them as well and waited for them complacent enough under one of the arches They themselves too he argued that Kate would argue looked perfectly ready decently patient properly accommodating They themselves suggested nothing worse always by Kate s system than a pair of the children of a supercivilised age making the best of an awkwardness They didn t nevertheless hurry that would overdo it so he had time to feel as it were what he felt He felt ever so distinctly it was with this he faced missus Lowder that he was already in a sense possessed of what he wanted There was more to come everything he had by no means with his companion had it all out Yet what he was possessed of was real the fact that she hadn t thrown over his lucidity the horrid shadow of cheap reprobation Of this he had had so sore a fear that its being dispelled was in itself of the nature of bliss The danger had dropped it was behind him there in the great sunny space So far she was good for what he wanted Book Eighth Chapter three She was good enough as it proved for him to put to her that evening and with further ground for it the next sharpest question that had been on his lips in the morning which his other preoccupation had then to his consciousness crowded out His opportunity was again made as befell by his learning from missus Stringham on arriving as usual with the close of day at the palace that Milly must fail them again at dinner but would to all appearance be able to come down later He had found Susan Shepherd alone in the great saloon where even more candles than their friend s large common allowance she grew daily more splendid they were all struck with it and chaffed her about it lighted up the pervasive mystery of Style He had thus five minutes with the good lady before missus Lowder and Kate appeared minutes illumined indeed to a longer reach than by the number of Milly s candles MAY she come down ought she if she isn t really up to it He had asked that in the wonderment always stirred in him by glimpses rare as were these of the inner truth about the girl There was of course a question of health it was in the air it was in the ground he trod in the food he tasted in the sounds he heard it was everywhere But it was everywhere with the effect of a request to him to his very delicacy to the common discretion of others as well as his own that no allusion to it should be made There had practically been none that morning on her explained non appearance the absence of it as we know quite monstrous and awkward and this passage with missus Stringham offered him his first licence to open his eyes He had gladly enough held them closed all the more that his doing so performed for his own spirit a useful function If he positively wanted not to be brought up with his nose against Milly s facts what better proof could he have that his conduct was marked by straightness It was perhaps pathetic for her and for himself was perhaps even ridiculous but he hadn t even the amount of curiosity that he would have had about an ordinary friend He might have shaken himself at moments to try for a sort of dry decency to have it but that too it appeared wouldn t come In what therefore was the duplicity He was at least sure about his feelings it being so established that he had none at all They were all for Kate without a feather s weight to spare He was acting for Kate not by the deviation of an inch for her friend He was accordingly not interested for had he been interested he would have cared and had he cared he would have wanted to know Had he wanted to know he wouldn t have been purely passive and it was his pure passivity that had to represent his dignity and his honour His dignity and his honour at the same time let us add fortunately fell short to night of spoiling his little talk with Susan Shepherd One glimpse it was as if she had wished to give him that and it was as if for himself on current terms he could oblige her by accepting it She not only permitted she fairly invited him to open his eyes I m so glad you re here It was no answer to his question but it had for the moment to serve And the rest was fully to come He smiled at her and presently found himself as a kind of consequence of communion with her talking her own language It s a very wonderful experience Well and her raised face shone up at him that s all I want you to feel about it If I weren t afraid she added there are things I should like to say to you And what are you afraid of please he encouragingly asked Of other things that I may possibly spoil Besides I don t you know seem to have the chance You re always you know WITH her He was strangely supported it struck him in his fixed smile which was the more fixed as he felt in these last words an exact description of his course It was an odd thing to have come to but he WAS always with her Ah he none the less smiled I m not with her now No and I m so glad since I get this from it She s ever so much better Better Then she HAS been worse missus Stringham waited She has been marvellous that s what she has been She IS marvellous But she s really better Oh then if she s really better But he checked himself wanting only to be easy about it and above all not to appear engaged to the point of mystification We shall miss her the more at dinner Susan Shepherd however was all there for him She s keeping herself You ll see You ll not really need to miss anything There s to be a little party Ah I do see by this aggravated grandeur Well it IS lovely isn t it I want the whole thing She s lodged for the first time as she ought from her type to be and doing it I mean bringing out all the glory of the place makes her really happy It s a Veronese picture as near as can be with me as the inevitable dwarf the small blackamoor put into a corner of the foreground for effect If I only had a hawk or a hound or something of that sort I should do the scene more honour The old housekeeper the woman in charge here has a big red cockatoo that I might borrow and perch on my thumb for the evening These explanations and sundry others missus Stringham gave though not all with the result of making him feel that the picture closed him in What part was there for HIM with his attitude that lacked the highest style in a composition in which everything else would have it They won t however be at dinner the few people she expects they come round afterwards from their respective hotels and Sir Luke Strett and his niece the principal ones will have arrived from London but an hour or two ago It s for HIM she has wanted to do something to let it begin at once We shall see more of him because she likes him and I m so glad she ll be glad too that YOU RE to see him The good lady in connexion with it was urgent was almost unnaturally bright So I greatly hope But her hope fairly lost itself in the wide light of her cheer He considered a little this appearance while she let him he thought into still more knowledge than she uttered What is it you hope Well that you ll stay on Do you mean after dinner She meant he seemed to feel so much that he could scarce tell where it ended or began Oh that of course Why we re to have music beautiful instruments and songs and not Tasso declaimed as in the guide books either She has arranged it or at least I have That is Eugenio has Besides you re in the picture Oh I said Densher almost with the gravity of a real protest You ll be the grand young man who surpasses the others and holds up his head and the wine cup What we hope missus Stringham pursued is that you ll be faithful to us that you ve not come for a mere foolish few days Densher s more private and particular shabby realities turned without comfort he was conscious at this touch in the artificial repose he had in his anxiety about them but half managed to induce The way smooth ladies travelling for their pleasure and housed in Veronese pictures talked to plain embarrassed workingmen engaged in an unprecedented sacrifice of time and of the opportunity for modest acquisition The things they took for granted and the general misery of explaining He couldn t tell them how he had tried to work how it was partly what he had moved into rooms for only to find himself almost for the first time in his life stricken and sterile because that would give them a false view of the source of his restlessness if not of the degree of it It would operate indirectly perhaps but infallibly to add to that weight as of expected performance which these very moments with missus Stringham caused more and more to settle on his heart He had incurred it the expectation of performance the thing was done and there was no use talking again again the cold breath of it was in the air So there he was And at best he floundered I m afraid you won t understand when I say I ve very tiresome things to consider Botherations necessities at home The pinch the pressure in London But she understood in perfection she rose to the pinch and the pressure and showed how they had been her own very element Oh the daily task and the daily wage the golden guerdon or reward No one knows better than I how they haunt one in the flight of the precious deceiving days Aren t they just what I myself have given up I ve given up all to follow HER I wish you could feel as I do And can t you she asked write about Venice He very nearly wished for the minute that he could feel as she did and he smiled for her kindly Do YOU write about Venice No but I would oh wouldn t I if I hadn t so completely given up She s you know my princess and to one s princess One makes the whole sacrifice Precisely There you are It pressed on him with this that never had a man been in so many places at once I quite understand that she s yours Only you see she s not mine He felt he could somehow for honesty risk that as he had the moral certainty she wouldn t repeat it and least of all to missus Lowder who would find in it a disturbing implication This was part of what he liked in the good lady that she didn t repeat and also that she gave him a delicate sense of her shyly wishing him to know it That was in itself a hint of possibilities between them of a relation beneficent and elastic for him which wouldn t engage him further than he could see Yet even as he afresh made this out he felt how strange it all was She wanted Susan Shepherd then as appeared the same thing Kate wanted only wanted it as still further appeared in so different a way and from a motive so different even though scarce less deep Then missus Lowder wanted by so odd an evolution of her exuberance exactly what each of the others did and he was between them all he was in the midst Such perceptions made occasions well occasions for fairly wondering if it mightn t be best just to consent luxuriously to BE the ass the whole thing involved Trying not to be and yet keeping in it was of the two things the more asinine He was glad there was no male witness it was a circle of petticoats he shouldn t have liked a man to see him He only had for a moment a sharp thought of Sir Luke Strett the great master of the knife whom Kate in London had spoken of Milly as in commerce with and whose renewed intervention at such a distance just announced to him required some accounting for He had a vision of great London surgeons if this one was a surgeon as incisive all round so that he should perhaps after all not wholly escape the ironic attention of his own sex The most he might be able to do was not to care while he was trying not to he could take that in It was a train however that brought up the vision of Lord Mark as well Lord Mark had caught him twice in the fact the fact of his absurd posture and that made a second male But it was comparatively easy not to mind Lord Mark His companion had before this taken him up and in a tone to confirm her discretion on the matter of Milly s not being his princess Of course she s not You must do something first Densher gave it his thought Wouldn t it be rather SHE who must It had more than he intended the effect of bringing her to a stand I see No doubt if one takes it so Her cheer was for the time in eclipse and she looked over the place avoiding his eyes as in the wonder of what Milly could do And yet she has wanted to be kind It made him on the spot feel a brute Of course she has No one could be more charming She has treated me as if I were somebody Call her my hostess as I ve never had nor imagined a hostess and I m with you altogether Of course he added in the right spirit for her I do see that it s quite court life She promptly showed how this was almost all she wanted of him That s all I mean if you understand it of such a court as never was one of the courts of heaven the court of a reigning seraph a sort of a vice queen of an angel That will do perfectly Oh well then I grant it Only court life as a general thing you know he observed isn t supposed to pay Yes one has read but this is beyond any book That s just the beauty here it s why she s the great and only princess With her at her court said missus Stringham it does pay Then as if she had quite settled it for him You ll see for yourself He waited a moment but said nothing to discourage her I think you were right just now One must do something first Well you ve done something No I don t see that I can do more Oh well she seemed to say if he would have it so You can do everything you know Everything was rather too much for him to take up gravely and he modestly let it alone speaking the next moment to avert fatuity of a different but a related matter Why has she sent for Sir Luke Strett if as you tell me she s so much better She hasn t sent He has come of himself missus Stringham explained He has wanted to come Isn t that rather worse then if it means he mayn t be easy He was coming from the first for his holiday She has known that these several weeks After which missus Stringham added You can MAKE him easy I can he candidly wondered It was truly the circle of petticoats What have I to do with it for a man like that How do you know said his friend what he s like He s not like any one you ve ever seen He s a great beneficent being Ah then he can do without me I ve no call as an outsider to meddle Tell him all the same missus Stringham urged what you think What I think of Miss Theale Densher stared It was as they said a large order But he found the right note It s none of his business It did seem a moment for missus Stringham too the right note She fixed him at least with an expression still bright but searching that showed almost to excess what she saw in it though what this might be he was not to make out till afterwards Say THAT to him then Anything will do for him as a means of getting at you And why should he get at me Give him a chance to Let him talk to you Then you ll see All of which on missus Stringham s part sharpened his sense of immersion in an element rather more strangely than agreeably warm a sense that was moreover during the next two or three hours to be fed to satiety by several other impressions Milly came down after dinner half a dozen friends objects of interest mainly it appeared to the ladies of Lancaster Gate having by that time arrived and with this call on her attention the further call of her musicians ushered by Eugenio but personally and separately welcomed and the supreme opportunity offered in the arrival of the great doctor who came last of all he felt her diffuse in wide warm waves the spell of a general a beatific mildness There was a deeper depth of it doubtless for some than for others what he in particular knew of it was that he seemed to stand in it up to his neck He moved about in it and it made no plash he floated he noiselessly swam in it and they were all together for that matter like fishes in a crystal pool The effect of the place the beauty of the scene had probably much to do with it the golden grace of the high rooms chambers of art in themselves took care as an influence of the general manner and made people bland without making them solemn They were only people as missus Stringham had said staying for the week or two at the inns people who during the day had fingered their Baedekers gaped at their frescoes and differed over fractions of francs with their gondoliers But Milly let loose among them in a wonderful white dress brought them somehow into relation with something that made them more finely genial so that if the Veronese picture of which he had talked with missus Stringham was not quite constituted the comparative prose of the previous hours the traces of insensibility qualified by beating down were at last almost nobly disowned There was perhaps something for him in the accident of his seeing her for the first time in white but she hadn t yet had occasion circulating with a clearness intensified to strike him as so happily pervasive She was different younger fairer with the colour of her braided hair more than ever a not altogether lucky challenge to attention yet he was loth wholly to explain it by her having quitted this once for some obscure yet doubtless charming reason her almost monastic her hitherto inveterate black Much as the change did for the value of her presence she had never yet when all was said made it for HIM and he was not to fail of the further amusement of judging her determined in the matter by Sir Luke Strett s visit If he could in this connexion have felt jealous of Sir Luke Strett whose strong face and type less assimilated by the scene perhaps than any others he was anon to study from the other side of the saloon that would doubtless have been most amusing of all But he couldn t be invidious even to profit by so high a tide he felt himself too much in it as he might have said a moment s reflexion put him more in than any one The way Milly neglected him for other cares while Kate and missus Lowder without so much as the attenuation of a joke introduced him to English ladies that was itself a proof for nothing really of so close a communion had up to this time passed between them as the single bright look and the three gay words all ostensibly of the last lightness with which her confessed consciousness brushed by him She was acquitting herself to night as hostess he could see under some supreme idea an inspiration which was half her nerves and half an inevitable harmony but what he especially recognised was the character that had already several times broken out in her and that she so oddly appeared able by choice or by instinctive affinity to keep down or to display She was the American girl as he had originally found her found her at certain moments it was true in New York more than at certain others she was the American girl as still more than then he had seen her on the day of her meeting him in London and in Kate s company It affected him as a large though queer social resource in her such as a man for instance to his diminution would never in the world be able to command and he wouldn t have known whether to see it in an extension or a contraction of personality taking it as he did most directly for a confounding extension of surface Clearly too it was the right thing this evening all round that came out for him in a word from Kate as she approached him to wreak on him a second introduction He had under cover of the music melted away from the lady toward whom she had first pushed him and there was something in her to affect him as telling evasively a tale of their talk in the Piazza To what did she want to coerce him as a form of penalty for what he had done to her there It was thus in contact uppermost for him that he had done something not only caused her perfect intelligence to act in his interest but left her unable to get away by any mere private effort from his inattackable logic With him thus in presence and near him and it had been as unmistakeable through dinner there was no getting away for her at all there was less of it than ever so she could only either deal with the question straight either frankly yield or ineffectually struggle or insincerely argue or else merely express herself by following up the advantage she did possess It was part of that advantage for the hour a brief fallacious makeweight to his pressure that there were plenty of things left in which he must feel her will They only told him these indications how much she was in such close quarters feeling his and it was enough for him again that her very aspect as great a variation in its way as Milly s own gave him back the sense of his action It had never yet in life been granted him to know almost materially to taste as he could do in these minutes the state of what was vulgarly called conquest He had lived long enough to have been on occasion liked but it had never begun to be allowed him to be liked to any such tune in any such quarter It was a liking greater than Milly s or it would be he felt it in him to answer for that So at all events he read the case while he noted that Kate was somehow for Kate wanting in lustre As a striking young presence she was practically superseded of the mildness that Milly diffused she had assimilated all her share she might fairly have been dressed to night in the little black frock superficially indistinguishable that Milly had laid aside This represented he perceived the opposite pole from such an effect as that of her wonderful entrance under her aunt s eyes he had never forgotten it the day of their younger friend s failure at Lancaster Gate She was in her accepted effacement it was actually her acceptance that made the beauty and repaired the damage under her aunt s eyes now but whose eyes were not effectually preoccupied It struck him none the less certainly that almost the first thing she said to him showed an exquisite attempt to appear if not unconvinced at least self possessed Don t you think her good enough NOW Almost heedless of the danger of overt freedoms she eyed Milly from where they stood noted her in renewed talk over her further wishes with the members of her little orchestra who had approached her with demonstrations of deference enlivened by native humours things quite in the line of old Venetian comedy The girl s idea of music had been happy a real solvent of shyness yet not drastic thanks to the intermissions discretions a general habit of mercy to gathered barbarians that reflected the good manners of its interpreters representatives though these might be but of the order in which taste was natural and melody rank It was easy at all events to answer Kate Ah my dear you know how good I think her But she s TOO nice Kate returned with appreciation Everything suits her so especially her pearls They go so with her old lace I ll trouble you really to look at them Densher though aware he had seen them before had perhaps not really looked at them and had thus not done justice to the embodied poetry his mind for Milly s aspects kept coming back to that which owed them part of its style Kate s face as she considered them struck him the long priceless chain wound twice round the neck hung heavy and pure down the front of the wearer s breast so far down that Milly s trick evidently unconscious of holding and vaguely fingering and entwining a part of it conduced presumably to convenience She s a dove Kate went on and one somehow doesn t think of doves as bejewelled Yet they suit her down to the ground Yes down to the ground is the word Densher saw now how they suited her but was perhaps still more aware of something intense in his companion s feeling about them Milly was indeed a dove this was the figure though it most applied to her spirit Yet he knew in a moment that Kate was just now for reasons hidden from him exceptionally under the impression of that element of wealth in her which was a power which was a great power and which was dove like only so far as one remembered that doves have wings and wondrous flights have them as well as tender tints and soft sounds It even came to him dimly that such wings could in a given case HAD truly in the case with which he was concerned spread themselves for protection Hadn t they for that matter lately taken an inordinate reach and weren t Kate and missus Lowder weren t Susan Shepherd and he wasn t HE in particular nestling under them to a great increase of immediate ease All this was a brighter blur in the general light out of which he heard Kate presently going on Pearls have such a magic that they suit every one They would uncommonly suit you he frankly returned Oh yes I see myself As she saw herself suddenly he saw her she would have been splendid and with it he felt more what she was thinking of Milly s royal ornament had under pressure now not wholly occult taken on the character of a symbol of differences differences of which the vision was actually in Kate s face It might have been in her face too that well as she certainly would look in pearls pearls were exactly what Merton Densher would never be able to give her Wasn t THAT the great difference that Milly to night symbolised She unconsciously represented to Kate and Kate took it in at every pore that there was nobody with whom she had less in common than a remarkably handsome girl married to a man unable to make her on any such lines as that the least little present Of these absurdities however it was not till afterwards that Densher thought He could think now to any purpose only of what missus Stringham had said to him before dinner He could but come back to his friend s question of a minute ago She s certainly good enough as you call it in the sense that I m assured she s better missus Stringham an hour or two since was in great feather to me about it She evidently believes her better Well if they choose to call it so And what do YOU call it as against them I don t call it anything to any one but you I m not against them Kate added as with just a fresh breath of impatience for all he had to be taught That s what I m talking about he said What do you call it to me It made her wait a little She isn t better She s worse But that has nothing to do with it Nothing to do He wondered But she was clear Nothing to do with US Except of course that we re doing our best for her We re making her want to live And Kate again watched her To night she does want to live She spoke with a kindness that had the strange property of striking him as inconsequent so much and doubtless so unjustly had all her clearness been an implication of the hard It s wonderful It s beautiful It s beautiful indeed He hated somehow the helplessness of his own note but she had given it no heed She s doing it for HIM and she nodded in the direction of Milly s medical visitor She wants to be for him at her best But she can t deceive him Densher had been looking too which made him say in a moment And do you think YOU can I mean if he s to be with us here about your sentiments If Aunt Maud s so thick with him Aunt Maud now occupied in fact a place at his side and was visibly doing her best to entertain him though this failed to prevent such a direction of his own eyes determined in the way such things happen precisely by the attention of the others as Densher became aware of and as Kate promptly marked He s looking at YOU He wants to speak to you So missus Stringham the young man laughed advised me he would Then let him Be right with him I don t need Kate went on in answer to the previous question to deceive him Aunt Maud if it s necessary will do that I mean that knowing nothing about me he can see me only as she sees me She sees me now so well He has nothing to do with me Except to reprobate you Densher suggested For not caring for YOU Perfectly As a brilliant young man driven by it into your relation with Milly as all THAT I leave you to him Well said Densher sincerely enough I think I can thank you for leaving me to some one easier perhaps with me than yourself She had been looking about again meanwhile the lady having changed her place for the friend of missus Lowder s to whom she had spoken of introducing him All the more reason why I should commit you then to Lady Wells Oh but wait It was not only that he distinguished Lady Wells from afar that she inspired him with no eagerness and that somewhere at the back of his head he was fairly aware of the question in germ of whether this was the kind of person he should be involved with when they were married It was furthermore that the consciousness of something he had not got from Kate in the morning and that logically much concerned him had been made more keen by these very moments to say nothing of the consciousness that with their general smallness of opportunity he must squeeze each stray instant hard If Aunt Maud over there with Sir Luke noted him as a little attentive that might pass for a futile demonstration on the part of a gentleman who had to confess to having not very gracefully changed his mind Besides just now he didn t care for Aunt Maud except in so far as he was immediately to show How can missus Lowder think me disposed of with any finality if I m disposed of only to a girl who s dying If you re right about that about the state of the case you re wrong about missus Lowder s being squared If Milly as you say he lucidly pursued can t deceive a great surgeon or whatever the great surgeon won t deceive other people not those that is who are closely concerned He won t at any rate deceive missus Stringham who s Milly s greatest friend and it will be very odd if missus Stringham deceives Aunt Maud who s her own Kate showed him at this the cold glow of an idea that really was worth his having kept her for Why will it be odd I marvel at your seeing your way so little Mere curiosity even about his companion had now for him its quick its slightly quaking intensities He had compared her once we know to a new book an uncut volume of the highest the rarest quality and his emotion to justify that was again and again like the thrill of turning the page Well you know how deeply I marvel at the way YOU see it It doesn t in the least follow Kate went on that anything in the nature of what you call deception on missus Stringham s part will be what you call odd Why shouldn t she hide the truth From missus Lowder Densher stared Why should she To please you And how in the world can it please me Kate turned her head away as if really at last almost tired of his density But she looked at him again as she spoke Well then to please Milly And before he could question Don t you feel by this time that there s nothing Susan Shepherd won t do for you He had verily after an instant to take it in so sharply it corresponded with the good lady s recent reception of him It was queerer than anything again the way they all came together round him But that was an old story and Kate s multiplied lights led him on and on It was with a reserve however that he confessed this She s ever so kind Only her view of the right thing may not be the same as yours How can it be anything different if it s the view of serving you Densher for an instant but only for an instant hung fire Oh the difficulty is that I don t upon my honour even yet quite make out how yours does serve me It helps you put it then said Kate very simply to serve ME It gains you time Time for what For everything She spoke at first once more with impatience then as usual she qualified For anything that may happen Densher had a smile but he felt it himself as strained You re cryptic love It made her keep her eyes on him and he could thus see that by one of those incalculable motions in her without which she wouldn t have been a quarter so interesting they half filled with tears from some source he had too roughly touched I m taking a trouble for you I never dreamed I should take for any human creature Oh it went home making him flush for it yet he soon enough felt his reply on his lips Well isn t my whole insistence to you now that I can conjure trouble away And he let it his insistence come out again it had so constantly had all the week but its step or two to make There NEED be none whatever between us There need be nothing but our sense of each other It had only the effect at first that her eyes grew dry while she took up again one of the so numerous links in her close chain You can tell her anything you like anything whatever missus Stringham I HAVE nothing to tell her You can tell her about US I mean she wonderfully pursued that you do still like me It was indeed so wonderful that it amused him Only not that you still like me She let his amusement pass I m absolutely certain she wouldn t repeat it I see To Aunt Maud You don t quite see Neither to Aunt Maud nor to any one else Kate then he saw was always seeing Milly much more after all than he was and she showed it again as she went on THERE accordingly is your time She did at last make him think and it was fairly as if light broke though not quite all at once You must let me say I DO see Time for something in particular that I understand you regard as possible Time too that I further understand is time for you as well Time indeed for me as well And encouraged visibly by his glow of concentration she looked at him as through the air she had painfully made clear Yet she was still on her guard Don t think however I ll do ALL the work for you If you want things named you must name them He had quite within the minute been turning names over and there was only one which at last stared at him there dreadful that properly fitted Since she s to die I m to marry her It struck him even at the moment as fine in her that she met it with no wincing nor mincing She might for the grace of silence for favour to their conditions have only answered him with her eyes But her lips bravely moved To marry her So that when her death has taken place I shall in the natural course have money It was before him enough now and he had nothing more to ask he had only to turn on the spot considerably cold with the thought that all along to his stupidity his timidity it had been it had been only what she meant Now that he was in possession moreover she couldn t forbear strangely enough to pronounce the words she hadn t pronounced they broke through her controlled and colourless voice as if she should be ashamed to the very end to have flinched You ll in the natural course have money We shall in the natural course be free Oh oh oh Densher softly murmured Yes yes yes But she broke off Come to Lady Wells He never budged there was too much else I m to propose it then marriage on the spot There was no ironic sound he needed to give it the more simply he spoke the more he seemed ironic But she remained consummately proof Oh I can t go into that with you and from the moment you don t wash your hands of me I don t think you ought to ask me You must act as you like and as you can He thought again I m far as I sufficiently showed you this morning from washing my hands of you Then said Kate it s all right All right His eagerness flamed You ll come But he had had to see in a moment that it wasn t what she meant You ll have a free hand a clear field a chance well quite ideal Your descriptions her ideal was such a touch are prodigious And what I don t make out is how caring for me you can like it I don t like it but I m a person thank goodness who can do what I don t like It wasn t till afterwards that going back to it he was to read into this speech a kind of heroic ring a note of character that belittled his own incapacity for action Yet he saw indeed even at the time the greatness of knowing so well what one wanted At the time too moreover he next reflected that he after all knew what HE did But something else on his lips was uppermost What I don t make out then is how you can even bear it Well when you know me better you ll find out how much I can bear And she went on before he could take up as it were her too many implications That it was left to him to know her spiritually better after his long sacrifice to knowledge this for instance was a truth he hadn t been ready to receive so full in the face She had mystified him enough heaven knew but that was rather by his own generosity than by hers And what with it did she seem to suggest she might incur at his hands In spite of these questions she was carrying him on All you ll have to do will be to stay And proceed to my business under your eyes Oh dear no we shall go Go he wondered Go when go where In a day or two straight home Aunt Maud wishes it now It gave him all he could take in to think of Then what becomes of Miss Theale What I tell you She stays on and you stay with her He stared All alone She had a smile that was apparently for his tone You re old enough with plenty of missus Stringham Nothing might have been so odd for him now could he have measured it as his being able to feel quite while he drew from her these successive cues that he was essentially seeing what she would say an instinct compatible for him therefore with that absence of a need to know her better to which she had a moment before done injustice If it hadn t been appearing to him in gleams that she would somewhere break down he probably couldn t have gone on Still as she wasn t breaking down there was nothing for him but to continue Is your going missus Lowder s idea Very much indeed Of course again you see what it does for us And I don t she added refer only to our going but to Aunt Maud s view of the general propriety of it I see again as you say Densher said after a moment It makes everything fit Everything The word for a little held the air and he might have seemed the while to be looking by no means dimly now at all it stood for But he had in fact been looking at something else You leave her here then to die Ah she believes she won t die Not if you stay I mean Kate explained Aunt Maud believes And that s all that s necessary Still indeed she didn t break down Didn t we long ago agree that what she believes is the principal thing for us He recalled it under her eyes but it came as from long ago Oh yes I can t deny it Then he added So that if I stay It won t she was prompt be our fault If missus Lowder still you mean suspects us If she still suspects us But she won t Kate gave it an emphasis that might have appeared to leave him nothing more and he might in fact well have found nothing if he hadn t presently found But what if she doesn t accept me It produced in her a look of weariness that made the patience of her tone the next moment touch him You can but try Naturally I can but try Only you see one has to try a little hard to propose to a dying girl She isn t for you as if she s dying It had determined in Kate the flash of justesse he could perhaps most on consideration have admired since her retort touched the truth There before him was the fact of how Milly to night impressed him and his companion with her eyes in his own and pursuing his impression to the depths of them literally now perched on the fact in triumph She turned her head to where their friend was again in range and it made him turn his so that they watched a minute in concert Milly from the other side happened at the moment to notice them and she sent across toward them in response all the candour of her smile the lustre of her pearls the value of her life the essence of her wealth It brought them together again with faces made fairly grave by the reality she put into their plan Kate herself grew a little pale for it and they had for a time only a silence The music however gay and vociferous had broken out afresh and protected more than interrupted them When Densher at last spoke it was under cover I might stay you know without trying Oh to stay IS to try To have for herself you mean the appearance of it I don t see how you can have the appearance more Densher waited You think it then possible she may OFFER marriage I can t think if you really want to know what she may NOT offer In the manner of princesses who do such things In any manner you like So be prepared Well he looked as if he almost were It will be for me then to accept But that s the way it must come Kate s silence so far let it pass but presently said You ll on your honour stay then His answer made her wait but when it came it was distinct Without you you mean Without us And you yourselves go at latest Not later than Thursday It made three days Well he said I ll stay on my honour if you ll come to me On YOUR honour Again as before this made her momentarily rigid with a rigour out of which at a loss she vaguely cast about her Her rigour was more to him nevertheless than all her readiness for her readiness was the woman herself and this other thing a mask a stop gap and a dodge She cast about however as happened and not for the instant in vain Her eyes turned over the room caught at a pretext Lady Wells is tired of waiting she s coming see to US Densher saw in fact but there was a distance for their visitor to cross and he still had time If you decline to understand me I wholly decline to understand you I ll do nothing Nothing It was as if she tried for the minute to plead I ll do nothing I ll go off before you I ll go to morrow He was to have afterwards the sense of her having then as the phrase was and for vulgar triumphs too seen he meant it She looked again at Lady Wells who was nearer but she quickly came back And if I do understand I ll do everything She found anew a pretext in her approaching friend he was fairly playing with her pride He had never he then knew tasted in all his relation with her of anything so sharp too sharp for mere sweetness as the vividness with which he saw himself master in the conflict Well I understand On your honour On my honour You ll come I ll come Book Ninth Chapter one It was after they had gone that he truly felt the difference which was most to be felt moreover in his faded old rooms He had recovered from the first a part of his attachment to this scene of contemplation within sight as it was of the Rialto bridge on the hither side of that arch of associations and the left going up the Canal he had seen it in a particular light to which more and more his mind and his hands adjusted it but the interest the place now wore for him had risen at a bound becoming a force that on the spot completely engaged and absorbed him and relief from which if relief was the name he could find only by getting away and out of reach What had come to pass within his walls lingered there as an obsession importunate to all his senses it lived again as a cluster of pleasant memories at every hour and in every object it made everything but itself irrelevant and tasteless It remained in a word a conscious watchful presence active on its own side for ever to be reckoned with in face of which the effort at detachment was scarcely less futile than frivolous Kate had come to him it was only once and this not from any failure of their need but from such impossibilities for bravery alike and for subtlety as there was at the last no blinking yet she had come that once to stay as people called it and what survived of her what reminded and insisted was something he couldn t have banished if he had wished Luckily he didn t wish even though there might be for a man almost a shade of the awful in so unqualified a consequence of his act It had simply WORKED his idea the idea he had made her accept and all erect before him really covering the ground as far as he could see was the fact of the gained success that this represented It was otherwise but the fact of the idea as directly applied as converted from a luminous conception into an historic truth He had known it before but as desired and urged as convincingly insisted on for the help it would render so that at present WITH the help rendered it seemed to acknowledge its office and to set up for memory and faith an insistence of its own He had in fine judged his friend s pledge in advance as an inestimable value and what he must now know his case for was that of a possession of the value to the full Wasn t it perhaps even rather the value that possessed HIM kept him thinking of it and waiting on it turning round and round it and making sure of it again from this side and that It played for him certainly in this prime afterglow the part of a treasure kept at home in safety and sanctity something he was sure of finding in its place when with each return he worked his heavy old key in the lock The door had but to open for him to be with it again and for it to be all there so intensely there that as we say no other act was possible to him than the renewed act almost the hallucination of intimacy Wherever he looked or sat or stood to whatever aspect he gave for the instant the advantage it was in view as nothing of the moment nothing begotten of time or of chance could be or ever would it was in view as when the curtain has risen the play on the stage is in view night after night for the fiddlers He remained thus in his own theatre in his single person perpetual orchestra to the ordered drama the confirmed run playing low and slow moreover in the regular way for the situations of most importance No other visitor was to come to him he met he bumped occasionally in the Piazza or in his walks against claimants to acquaintance remembered or forgotten at present mostly effusive sometimes even inquisitive but he gave no address and encouraged no approach he couldn t for his life he felt have opened his door to a third person Such a person would have interrupted him would have profaned his secret or perhaps have guessed it would at any rate have broken the spell of what he conceived himself in the absence of anything to show to be inwardly doing He was giving himself up that was quite enough to the general feeling of his renewed engagement to fidelity The force of the engagement the quantity of the article to be supplied the special solidity of the contract the way above all as a service for which the price named by him had been magnificently paid his equivalent office was to take effect such items might well fill his consciousness when there was nothing from outside to interfere Never was a consciousness more rounded and fastened down over what filled it which is precisely what we have spoken of as in its degree the oppression of success the somewhat chilled state tending to the solitary of supreme recognition If it was slightly awful to feel so justified this was by the loss of the warmth of the element of mystery The lucid reigned instead of it and it was into the lucid that he sat and stared He shook himself out of it a dozen times a day tried to break by his own act his constant still communion It wasn t still communion she had meant to bequeath him it was the very different business of that kind of fidelity of which the other name was careful action Nothing he perfectly knew was less like careful action than the immersion he enjoyed at home The actual grand queerness was that to be faithful to Kate he had positively to take his eyes his arms his lips straight off her he had to let her alone He had to remember it was time to go to the palace which in truth was a mercy since the check was not less effectual than imperative What it came to fortunately as yet was that when he closed the door behind him for an absence he always shut her in Shut her out it came to that rather when once he had got a little away and before he reached the palace much more after hearing at his heels the bang of the greater portone he felt free enough not to know his position as oppressively false As Kate was ALL in his poor rooms and not a ghost of her left for the grander it was only on reflexion that the falseness came out so long as he left it to the mercy of beneficent chance it offered him no face and made of him no claim that he couldn t meet without aggravation of his inward sense This aggravation had been his original horror yet what in Milly s presence each day was horror doing with him but virtually letting him off He shouldn t perhaps get off to the end there was time enough still for the possibility of shame to pounce Still however he did constantly a little more what he liked best and that kept him for the time more safe What he liked best was in any case to know WHY things were as he felt them and he knew it pretty well in this case ten days after the retreat of his other friends He then fairly perceived that even putting their purity of motive at its highest it was neither Kate nor he who made his strange relation to Milly who made her own so far as it might be innocent it was neither of them who practically purged it if practically purged it was Milly herself did everything so far at least as he was concerned Milly herself and Milly s house and Milly s hospitality and Milly s manner and Milly s character and perhaps still more than anything else Milly s imagination missus Stringham and Sir Luke indeed a little aiding whereby he knew the blessing of a fair pretext to ask himself what more he had to do Something incalculable wrought for them for him and Kate something outside beyond above themselves and doubtless ever so much better than they which wasn t a reason however its being so much better for them not to profit by it Not to profit by it so far as profit could be reckoned would have been to go directly against it and the spirit of generosity at present engendered in Densher could have felt no greater pang than by his having to go directly against Milly To go WITH her was the thing so far as she could herself go which from the moment her tenure of her loved palace stretched on was possible but by his remaining near her This remaining was of course on the face of it the most marked of demonstrations which was exactly why Kate had required it it was so marked that on the very evening of the day it had taken effect Milly herself hadn t been able not to reach out to him with an exquisite awkwardness for some account of it It was as if she had wanted from him some name that now they were to be almost alone together they could for their further ease know it and call it by it being after all almost rudimentary that his presence of which the absence of the others made quite a different thing couldn t but have for himself some definite basis She only wondered about the basis it would have for himself and how he would describe it that would quite do for her it even would have done for her he could see had he produced some reason merely trivial had he said he was waiting for money or clothes for letters or for orders from Fleet Street without which as she might have heard newspaper men never took a step He hadn t in the event quite sunk to that but he had none the less had there with her that night on missus Stringham s leaving them alone missus Stringham proved really prodigious his acquaintance with a shade of awkwardness darker than any Milly could know He had supposed himself beforehand on the question of what he was doing or pretending in possession of some tone that would serve but there were three minutes of his feeling incapable of promptness quite in the same degree in which a gentleman whose pocket has been picked feels incapable of purchase It even didn t help him oddly that he was sure Kate would in some way have spoken for him or rather not so much in some way as in one very particular way He hadn t asked her at the last what she might in the connexion have said nothing would have induced him to put such a question after she had been to see him his lips were so sealed by that passage his spirit in fact so hushed in respect to any charge upon her freedom There was something he could only therefore read back into the probabilities and when he left the palace an hour afterwards it was with a sense of having breathed there in the very air the truth he had been guessing Just this perception it was however that had made him for the time ugly to himself in his awkwardness It was horrible with this creature to BE awkward it was odious to be seeking excuses for the relation that involved it Any relation that involved it was by the very fact as much discredited as a dish would be at dinner if one had to take medicine as a sauce What Kate would have said in one of the young women s last talks was that if Milly absolutely must have the truth about it mister Densher was staying because she had really seen no way but to require it of him If he stayed he didn t follow her or didn t appear to her aunt to be doing so and when she kept him from following her missus Lowder couldn t pretend in scenes the renewal of which at this time of day was painful that she after all didn t snub him as she might She did nothing in fact BUT snub him wouldn t that have been part of the story only Aunt Maud s suspicions were of the sort that had repeatedly to be dealt with He had been by the same token reasonable enough as he now for that matter well might he had consented to oblige them aunt and niece by giving the plainest sign possible that he could exist away from London To exist away from London was to exist away from Kate Croy which was a gain much appreciated to the latter s comfort There was a minute at this hour out of Densher s three during which he knew the terror of Milly s uttering some such allusion to their friend s explanation as he must meet with words that wouldn t destroy it To destroy it was to destroy everything to destroy probably Kate herself to destroy in particular by a breach of faith still uglier than anything else the beauty of their own last passage He had given her his word of honour that if she would come to him he would act absolutely in her sense and he had done so with a full enough vision of what her sense implied What it implied for one thing was that to night in the great saloon noble in its half lighted beauty and straight in the white face of his young hostess divine in her trust or at any rate inscrutable in her mercy what it implied was that he should lie with his lips The single thing of all things that could save him from it would be Milly s letting him off after having thus scared him What made her mercy inscrutable was that if she had already more than once saved him it was yet apparently without knowing how nearly he was lost These were transcendent motions not the less blest for being obscure whereby yet once more he was to feel the pressure lighten He was kept on his feet in short by the felicity of her not presenting him with Kate s version as a version to adopt He couldn t stand up to lie he felt as if he should have to go down on his knees As it was he just sat there shaking a little for nervousness the leg he had crossed over the other She was sorry for his suffered snub but he had nothing more to subscribe to to perjure himself about than the three or four inanities he had on his own side feebly prepared for the crisis He scrambled a little higher than the reference to money and clothes letters and directions from his manager but he brought out the beauty of the chance for him there before him like a temptress painted by Titian to do a little quiet writing He was vivid for a moment on the difficulty of writing quietly in London and he was precipitate almost explosive on his idea long cherished of a book The explosion lighted her face You ll do your book here I hope to begin it It s something you haven t begun Well only just And since you came She was so full of interest that he shouldn t perhaps after all be too easily let off I tried to think a few days ago that I had broken ground Scarcely anything it was indeed clear could have let him in deeper I m afraid we ve made an awful mess of your time Of course you have But what I m hanging on for now is precisely to repair that ravage Then you mustn t mind me you know You ll see he tried to say with ease how little I shall mind anything You ll want Milly had thrown herself into it the best part of your days He thought a moment he did what he could to wreathe it in smiles Oh I shall make shift with the worst part The best will be for YOU And he wished Kate could hear him It didn t help him moreover that he visibly even pathetically imaged to her by such touches his quest for comfort against discipline He was to bury Kate s so signal snub and also the hard law she had now laid on him under a high intellectual effort This at least was his crucifixion that Milly was so interested She was so interested that she presently asked him if he found his rooms propitious while he felt that in just decently answering her he put on a brazen mask He should need it quite particularly were she to express again her imagination of coming to tea with him an extremity that he saw he was not to be spared We depend on you Susie and I you know not to forget we re coming the extremity was but to face that remainder yet it demanded all his tact Facing their visit itself to that no matter what he might have to do he would never consent as we know to be pushed and this even though it might be exactly such a demonstration as would figure for him at the top of Kate s list of his proprieties He could wonder freely enough deep within if Kate s view of that especial propriety had not been modified by a subsequent occurrence but his deciding that it was quite likely not to have been had no effect on his own preference for tact It pleased him to think of tact as his present prop in doubt that glossed his predicament over for it was of application among the sensitive and the kind He wasn t inhuman in fine so long as it would serve It had to serve now accordingly to help him not to sweeten Milly s hopes He didn t want to be rude to them but he still less wanted them to flower again in the particular connexion so that casting about him in his anxiety for a middle way to meet her he put his foot with unhappy effect just in the wrong place Will it be safe for you to break into your custom of not leaving the house Safe She had for twenty seconds an exquisite pale glare Oh but he didn t need it by that time to wince he had winced for himself as soon as he had made his mistake He had done what so unforgettably she had asked him in London not to do he had touched all alone with her here the supersensitive nerve of which she had warned him He had not since the occasion in London touched it again till now but he saw himself freshly warned that it was able to bear still less So for the moment he knew as little what to do as he had ever known it in his life He couldn t emphasise that he thought of her as dying yet he couldn t pretend he thought of her as indifferent to precautions Meanwhile too she had narrowed his choice You suppose me so awfully bad He turned in his pain within himself but by the time the colour had mounted to the roots of his hair he had found what he wanted I ll believe whatever you tell me Well then I m splendid Oh I don t need you to tell me that I mean I m capable of life I ve never doubted it I mean she went on that I want so to live Well he asked while she paused with the intensity of it Well that I know I CAN Whatever you do He shrank from solemnity about it Whatever I do If I want to If you want to do it If I want to live I CAN Milly repeated He had clumsily brought it on himself but he hesitated with all the pity of it Ah then THAT I believe I will I will she declared yet with the weight of it somehow turned for him to mere light and sound He felt himself smiling through a mist You simply must It brought her straight again to the fact Well then if you say it why mayn t we pay you our visit Will it help you to live Every little helps she laughed and it s very little for me in general to stay at home Only I shan t want to miss it Yes she had dropped again Well on the day you give us a chance It was amazing what so brief an exchange had at this point done with him His great scruple suddenly broke giving way to something inordinately strange something of a nature to become clear to him only when he had left her You can come he said when you like What had taken place for him however the drop almost with violence of everything but a sense of her own reality apparently showed in his face or his manner and even so vividly that she could take it for something else I see how you feel that I m an awful bore about it and that sooner than have any such upset you ll go So it s no matter No matter Oh he quite protested now If it drives you away to escape us We want you not to go It was beautiful how she spoke for missus Stringham Whatever it was at any rate he shook his head I won t go Then I won t go she brightly declared You mean you won t come to me No never now It s over But it s all right I mean apart from that she went on that I won t do anything I oughtn t or that I m not forced to Oh who can ever force you he asked with his hand to mouth way at all times of speaking for her encouragement You re the least coercible of creatures Because you think I m so free The freest person probably now in the world You ve got everything Well she smiled call it so I don t complain On which again in spite of himself it let him in No I know you don t complain As soon as he had said it he had himself heard the pity in it His telling her she had everything was extravagant kind humour whereas his knowing so tenderly that she didn t complain was terrible kind gravity Milly felt he could see the difference he might as well have praised her outright for looking death in the face This was the way she just looked HIM again and it was of no attenuation that she took him up more gently than ever It isn t a merit when one sees one s way To peace and plenty Well I dare say not I mean to keeping what one has Oh that s success If what one has is good Densher said at random it s enough to try for Well it s my limit I m not trying for more To which then she added with a change And now about your book My book He had got in a moment so far from it The one you re now to understand that nothing will induce either Susie or me to run the risk of spoiling He cast about but he made up his mind I m not doing a book Not what you said she asked in a wonder You re not writing He already felt relieved I don t know upon my honour what I m doing It made her visibly grave so that disconcerted in another way he was afraid of what she would see in it She saw in fact exactly what he feared but again his honour as he called it was saved even while she didn t know she had threatened it Taking his words for a betrayal of the sense that he on his side MIGHT complain what she clearly wanted was to urge on him some such patience as he should be perhaps able to arrive at with her indirect help Still more clearly however she wanted to be sure of how far she might venture and he could see her make out in a moment that she had a sort of test Then if it s not for your book What AM I staying for I mean with your London work with all you have to do Isn t it rather empty for you Empty for me He remembered how Kate had held that she might propose marriage and he wondered if this were the way she would naturally begin it It would leave him such an incident he already felt at a loss and the note of his finest anxiety might have been in the vagueness of his reply Oh well I ask too many questions She settled it for herself before he could protest You stay because you ve got to He grasped at it I stay because I ve got to And he couldn t have said when he had uttered it if it were loyal to Kate or disloyal It gave her in a manner away it showed the tip of the ear of her plan Yet Milly took it he perceived but as a plain statement of his truth He was waiting for what Kate would have told her of the permission from Lancaster Gate to come any nearer To remain friends with either niece or aunt he mustn t stir without it All this Densher read in the girl s sense of the spirit of his reply so that it made him feel he was lying and he had to think of something to correct that What he thought of was in an instant Isn t it enough whatever may be one s other complications to stay after all for YOU Oh you must judge He was by this time on his feet to take leave and was also at last too restless The speech in question at least wasn t disloyal to Kate that was the very tone of their bargain So was it by being loyal another kind of lie the lie of the uncandid profession of a motive He was staying so little for Milly that he was staying positively against her He didn t none the less know and at last thank goodness didn t care The only thing he could say might make it either better or worse Well then so long as I don t go you must think of me all AS judging Book Ninth Chapter two He didn t go home on leaving her he didn t want to he walked instead through his narrow ways and his campi with gothic arches to a small and comparatively sequestered cafe where he had already more than once found refreshment and comparative repose together with solutions that consisted mainly and pleasantly of further indecisions It was a literal fact that those awaiting him there to night while he leaned back on his velvet bench with his head against a florid mirror and his eyes not looking further than the fumes of his tobacco might have been regarded by him as a little less limp than usual This wasn t because before getting to his feet again there was a step he had seen his way to it was simply because the acceptance of his position took sharper effect from his sense of what he had just had to deal with When half an hour before at the palace he had turned about to Milly on the question of the impossibility so inwardly felt turned about on the spot and under her eyes he had acted by the sudden force of his seeing much further seeing how little how not at all impossibilities mattered It wasn t a case for pedantry when people were at HER pass everything was allowed And her pass was now as by the sharp click of a spring just completely his own to the extent as he felt of her deep dependence on him Anything he should do or shouldn t would have close reference to her life which was thus absolutely in his hands and ought never to have reference to anything else It was on the cards for him that he might kill her that was the way he read the cards as he sat in his customary corner The fear in this thought made him let everything go kept him there actually all motionless for three hours on end He renewed his consumption and smoked more cigarettes than he had ever done in the time What had come out for him had come out with this first intensity as a terror so that action itself of any sort the right as well as the wrong if the difference even survived had heard in it a vivid Hush the injunction to keep from that moment intensely still He thought in fact while his vigil lasted of several different ways for his doing so and the hour might have served him as a lesson in going on tiptoe What he finally took home when he ventured to leave the place was the perceived truth that he might on any other system go straight to destruction Destruction was represented for him by the idea of his really bringing to a point on Milly s side anything whatever Nothing so brought he easily argued but MUST be in one way or another a catastrophe He was mixed up in her fate or her fate if that should be better was mixed up in HIM so that a single false motion might either way snap the coil They helped him it was true these considerations to a degree of eventual peace for what they luminously amounted to was that he was to do nothing and that fell in after all with the burden laid on him by Kate He was only not to budge without the girl s leave not oddly enough at the last to move without it whether further or nearer any more than without Kate s It was to this his wisdom reduced itself to the need again simply to be kind That was the same as being still as studying to create the minimum of vibration He felt himself as he smoked shut up to a room on the wall of which something precious was too precariously hung A false step would bring it down and it must hang as long as possible He was aware when he walked away again that even Fleet Street wouldn t at this juncture successfully touch him His manager might wire that he was wanted but he could easily be deaf to his manager His money for the idle life might be none too much happily however Venice was cheap and it was moreover the queer fact that Milly in a manner supported him The greatest of his expenses really was to walk to the palace to dinner He didn t want in short to give that up and he should probably be able he felt to stay his breath and his hand He should be able to be still enough through everything He tried that for three weeks with the sense after a little of not having failed There had to be a delicate art in it for he wasn t trying quite the contrary to be either distant or dull That would not have been being nice which in its own form was the real law That too might just have produced the vibration he desired to avert so that he best kept everything in place by not hesitating or fearing as it were to let himself go go in the direction that is to say of staying It depended on where he went which was what he meant by taking care When one went on tiptoe one could turn off for retreat without betraying the manoeuvre Perfect tact the necessity for which he had from the first as we know happily recognised was to keep all intercourse in the key of the absolutely settled It was settled thus for instance that they were indissoluble good friends and settled as well that her being the American girl was just in time and for the relation they found themselves concerned in a boon inappreciable If at least as the days went on she was to fall short of her prerogative of the great national the great maidenly ease if she didn t diviningly and responsively desire and labour to record herself as possessed of it this wouldn t have been for want of Densher s keeping her with his idea well up to it wouldn t have been in fine for want of his encouragement and reminder He didn t perhaps in so many words speak to her of the quantity itself as of the thing she was least to intermit but he talked of it freely in what he flattered himself was an impersonal way and this held it there before her since he was careful also to talk pleasantly It was at once their idea when all was said and the most marked of their conveniences The type was so elastic that it could be stretched to almost anything and yet not stretched it kept down remained normal remained properly within bounds And he HAD meanwhile thank goodness without being too much disconcerted the sense for the girl s part of the business of the queerest conscious compliance of her doing very much what he wanted even though without her quite seeing why She fairly touched this once in saying Oh yes you like us to be as we are because it s a kind of facilitation to you that we don t quite measure I think one would have to be English to measure it and that too strangely enough without prejudice to her good nature She might have been conceived as doing that is of being what he liked in order perhaps only to judge where it would take them They really as it went on SAW each other at the game she knowing he tried to keep her in tune with his conception and he knowing she thus knew it Add that he again knew she knew and yet that nothing was spoiled by it and we get a fair impression of the line they found most completely workable The strangest fact of all for us must be that the success he himself thus promoted was precisely what figured to his gratitude as the something above and beyond him above and beyond Kate that made for daily decency There would scarce have been felicity certainly too little of the right lubricant had not the national character so invoked been not less inscrutably than entirely in Milly s chords It made up her unity and was the one thing he could unlimitedly take for granted He did so then daily for twenty days without deepened fear of the undue vibration that was keeping him watchful He knew in his nervousness that he was living at best from day to day and from hand to mouth yet he had succeeded he believed in avoiding a mistake All women had alternatives and Milly s would doubtless be shaky too but the national character was firm in her whether as all of her practically by this time or but as a part the national character that in a woman still so young made of the air breathed a virtual non conductor It wasn t till a certain occasion when the twenty days had passed that going to the palace at tea time he was met by the information that the signorina padrona was not receiving The announcement met him in the court on the lips of one of the gondoliers met him he thought with such a conscious eye as the knowledge of his freedoms of access hitherto conspicuously shown could scarce fail to beget Densher had not been at Palazzo Leporelli among the mere receivable but had taken his place once for all among the involved and included so that on being so flagrantly braved he recognised after a moment the propriety of a further appeal Neither of the two ladies it appeared received and yet Pasquale was not prepared to say that either was poco bene He was yet not prepared to say that either was anything and he would have been blank Densher mentally noted if the term could ever apply to members of a race in whom vacancy was but a nest of darknesses not a vain surface but a place of withdrawal in which something obscure something always ominous indistinguishably lived He felt afresh indeed at this hour the force of the veto laid within the palace on any mention any cognition of the liabilities of its mistress The state of her health was never confessed to there as a reason How much it might deeply be taken for one was another matter of which he grew fully aware on carrying his question further This appeal was to his friend Eugenio whom he immediately sent for with whom for three rich minutes protected from the weather he was confronted in the gallery that led from the water steps to the court and whom he always called in meditation his friend seeing it was so elegantly presumable he would have put an end to him if he could That produced a relation which required a name of its own an intimacy of consciousness in truth for each an intimacy of eye of ear of general sensibility of everything but tongue It had been in other words for the five weeks far from occult to our young man that Eugenio took a view of him not less finely formal than essentially vulgar but which at the same time he couldn t himself raise an eyebrow to prevent It was all in the air now again it was as much between them as ever while Eugenio waited on him in the court The weather from early morning had turned to storm the first sea storm of the autumn and Densher had almost invidiously brought him down the outer staircase the massive ascent the great feature of the court to Milly s piano nobile This was to pay him it was the one chance for all imputations the imputation in particular that clever tanto bello and not rich the young man from London was by the obvious way pressing Miss Theale s fortune hard It was to pay him for the further ineffable intimation that a gentleman must take the young lady s most devoted servant interested scarcely less in the high attraction for a strangely casual appendage if he counted in such a connexion on impunity and prosperity These interpretations were odious to Densher for the simple reason that they might have been so true of the attitude of an inferior man and three things alone accordingly had kept him from righting himself One of these was that his critic sought expression only in an impersonality a positive inhumanity of politeness the second was that refinements of expression in a friend s servant were not a thing a visitor could take action on and the third was the fact that the particular attribution of motive did him after all no wrong It was his own fault if the vulgar view the view that might have been taken of an inferior man happened so incorrigibly to fit him He apparently wasn t so different from inferior men as that came to If therefore in fine Eugenio figured to him as my friend because he was conscious of his seeing so much of him what he made him see on the same lines in the course of their present interview was ever so much more Densher felt that he marked himself no doubt as insisting by dissatisfaction with the gondolier s answer on the pursuit taken for granted in him and yet felt it only in the augmented the exalted distance that was by this time established between them Eugenio had of course reflected that a word to Miss Theale from such a pair of lips would cost him his place but he could also bethink himself that so long as the word never came and it was on the basis he had arranged impossible he enjoyed the imagination of mounting guard He had never so mounted guard Densher could see as during these minutes in the damp loggia where the storm gusts were strong and there came in fact for our young man as a result of his presence a sudden sharp sense that everything had turned to the dismal Something had happened he didn t know what and it wasn t Eugenio who would tell him What Eugenio told him was that he thought the ladies as if their liability had been equal were a leetle fatigued just a leetle leetle and without any cause named for it It was one of the signs of what Densher felt in him that by a profundity a true deviltry of resource he always met the latter s Italian with English and his English with Italian He now as usual slightly smiled at him in the process but ever so slightly this time his manner also being attuned our young man made out to the thing whatever it was that constituted the rupture of peace This manner while they stood a long minute facing each other over all they didn t say played a part as well in the sudden jar to Densher s protected state It was a Venice all of evil that had broken out for them alike so that they were together in their anxiety if they really could have met on it a Venice of cold lashing rain from a low black sky of wicked wind raging through narrow passes of general arrest and interruption with the people engaged in all the water life huddled stranded and wageless bored and cynical under archways and bridges Our young man s mute exchange with his friend contained meanwhile such a depth of reference that had the pressure been but slightly prolonged they might have reached a point at which they were equally weak Each had verily something in mind that would have made a hash of mutual suspicion and in presence of which as a possibility they were more united than disjoined But it was to have been a moment for Densher that nothing could ease off not even the formal propriety with which his interlocutor finally attended him to the portone and bowed upon his retreat Nothing had passed about his coming back and the air had made itself felt as a non conductor of messages Densher knew of course as he took his way again that Eugenio s invitation to return was not what he missed yet he knew at the same time that what had happened to him was part of his punishment Out in the square beyond the fondamenta that gave access to the land gate of the palace out where the wind was higher he fairly with the thought of it pulled his umbrella closer down It couldn t be his consciousness unseen enough by others the base predicament of having by a concatenation just to TAKE such things such things as the fact that one very acute person in the world whom he couldn t dispose of as an interested scoundrel enjoyed an opinion of him that there was no attacking no disproving no what was worst of all even noticing One had come to a queer pass when a servant s opinion so mattered Eugenio s would have mattered even if as founded on a low vision of appearances it had been quite wrong It was the more disagreeable accordingly that the vision of appearances was quite right and yet was scarcely less low Such as it was at any rate Densher shook it off with the more impatience that he was independently restless He had to walk in spite of weather and he took his course through crooked ways to the Piazza where he should have the shelter of the galleries Here in the high arcade half Venice was crowded close while on the Molo at the limit of the expanse the old columns of the Saint Theodore and of the Lion were the frame of a door wide open to the storm It was odd for him as he moved that it should have made such a difference if the difference wasn t only that the palace had for the first time failed of a welcome There was more but it came from that that gave the harsh note and broke the spell The wet and the cold were now to reckon with and it was to Densher precisely as if he had seen the obliteration at a stroke of the margin on a faith in which they were all living The margin had been his name for it for the thing that though it had held out could bear no shock The shock in some form had come and he wondered about it while threading his way among loungers as vague as himself he dropped his eyes sightlessly on the rubbish in shops There were stretches of the gallery paved with squares of red marble greasy now with the salt spray and the whole place in its huge elegance the grace of its conception and the beauty of its detail was more than ever like a great drawing room the drawing room of Europe profaned and bewildered by some reverse of fortune He brushed shoulders with brown men whose hats askew and the loose sleeves of whose pendent jackets made them resemble melancholy maskers The tables and chairs that overflowed from the cafes were gathered still with a pretence of service into the arcade and here and there a spectacled German with his coat collar up partook publicly of food and philosophy These were impressions for Densher too but he had made the whole circuit thrice before he stopped short in front of Florian s with the force of his sharpest His eye had caught a face within the cafe he had spotted an acquaintance behind the glass The person he had thus paused long enough to look at twice was seated well within range at a small table on which a tumbler half emptied and evidently neglected still remained and though he had on his knee as he leaned back a copy of a French newspaper the heading of the Figaro was visible he stared straight before him at the little opposite rococo wall Densher had him for a minute in profile had him for a time during which his identity produced however quickly all the effect of establishing connexions connexions startling and direct and then as if it were the one thing more needed seized the look determined by a turn of the head that might have been a prompt result of the sense of being noticed This wider view showed him ALL Lord Mark Lord Mark as encountered several weeks before the day of the first visit of each to Palazzo Leporelli For it had been all Lord Mark that was going out on that occasion as he came in he had felt it in the hall at the time and he was accordingly the less at a loss to recognise in a few seconds as renewed meeting brought it to the surface the same potential quantity It was a matter the whole passage it could only be but of a few seconds for as he might neither stand there to stare nor on the other hand make any advance from it he had presently resumed his walk this time to another pace It had been for all the world during his pause as if he had caught his answer to the riddle of the day Lord Mark had simply faced him as he had faced HIM not placed by him not at first as one of the damp shuffling crowd Recognition though hanging fire had then clearly come yet no light of salutation had been struck from these certainties Acquaintance between them was scant enough for neither to take it up That neither had done so was not however what now mattered but that the gentleman at Florian s should be in the place at all He couldn t have been in it long Densher as inevitably a haunter of the great meeting ground would in that case have seen him before He paid short visits he was on the wing the question for him even as he sat there was of his train or of his boat He had come back for something as a sequel to his earlier visit and whatever he had come back for it had had time to be done He might have arrived but last night or that morning he had already made the difference It was a great thing for Densher to get this answer He held it close he hugged it quite leaned on it as he continued to circulate It kept him going and going it made him no less restless But it explained and that was much for with explanations he might somehow deal The vice in the air otherwise was too much like the breath of fate The weather had changed the rain was ugly the wind wicked the sea impossible BECAUSE of Lord Mark It was because of him a fortiori that the palace was closed Densher went round again twice he found the visitor each time as he had found him first Once that is he was staring before him the next time he was looking over his Figaro which he had opened out Densher didn t again stop but left him apparently unconscious of his passage on another repetition of which Lord Mark had disappeared He had spent but the day he would be off that night he had now gone to his hotel for arrangements These things were as plain to Densher as if he had had them in words The obscure had cleared for him if cleared it was there was something he didn t see the great thing but he saw so round it and so close to it that this was almost as good He had been looking at a man who had done what he had come for and for whom as done it temporarily sufficed The man had come again to see Milly and Milly had received him His visit would have taken place just before or just after luncheon and it was the reason why he himself had found her door shut He said to himself that evening he still said even on the morrow that he only wanted a reason and that with this perception of one he could now mind as he called it his business His business he had settled as we know was to keep thoroughly still and he asked himself why it should prevent this that he could feel in connexion with the crisis so remarkably blameless He gave the appearances before him all the benefit of being critical so that if blame were to accrue he shouldn t feel he had dodged it But it wasn t a bit he who that day had touched her and if she was upset it wasn t a bit his act The ability so to think about it amounted for Densher during several hours to a kind of exhilaration The exhilaration was heightened fairly besides by the visible conditions sharp striking ugly to him of Lord Mark s return His constant view of it for all the next hours of which there were many was as a demonstration on the face of it sinister even to his own actual ignorance He didn t need for seeing it as evil seeing it as to a certainty in a high degree nasty to know more about it than he had so easily and so wonderfully picked up You couldn t drop on the poor girl that way without by the fact being brutal Such a visit was a descent an invasion an aggression constituting precisely one or other of the stupid shocks he himself had so decently sought to spare her Densher had indeed drifted by the next morning to the reflexion which he positively with occasion might have brought straight out that the only delicate and honourable way of treating a person in such a state was to treat her as HE Merton Densher did With time actually for the impression but deepened this sense of the contrast to the advantage of Merton Densher became a sense of relief and that in turn a sense of escape It was for all the world and he drew a long breath on it as if a special danger for him had passed Lord Mark had without in the least intending such a service got it straight out of the way It was HE the brute who had stumbled into just the wrong inspiration and who had therefore produced for the very person he had wished to hurt an impunity that was comparative innocence that was almost like purification The person he had wished to hurt could only be the person so unaccountably hanging about To keep still meanwhile was for this person more comprehensively to keep it all up and to keep it all up was if that seemed on consideration best not for the day or two to go back to the palace The day or two passed stretched to three days and with the effect extraordinarily that Densher felt himself in the course of them washed but the more clean Some sign would come if his return should have the better effect and he was at all events in absence without the particular scruple It wouldn t have been meant for him by either of the women that he was to come back but to face Eugenio That was impossible the being again denied for it made him practically answerable and answerable was what he wasn t There was no neglect either in absence inasmuch as from the moment he didn t get in the one message he could send up would be some hope on the score of health Since accordingly that sort of expression was definitely forbidden him he had only to wait which he was actually helped to do by his feeling with the lapse of each day more and more wound up to it The days in themselves were anything but sweet the wind and the weather lasted the fireless cold hinted at worse the broken charm of the world about was broken into smaller pieces He walked up and down his rooms and listened to the wind listened also to tinkles of bells and watched for some servant of the palace He might get a note but the note never came there were hours when he stayed at home not to miss it When he wasn t at home he was in circulation again as he had been at the hour of his seeing Lord Mark He strolled about the Square with the herd of refugees he raked the approaches and the cafes on the chance the brute as he now regularly imaged him MIGHT be still there He could only be there he knew to be received afresh and that one had but to think of it would be indeed stiff He had gone however it was proved though Densher s care for the question either way only added to what was most acrid in the taste of his present ordeal It all came round to what he was doing for Milly spending days that neither relief nor escape could purge of a smack of the abject What was it but abject for a man of his parts to be reduced to such pastimes What was it but sordid for him shuffling about in the rain to have to peep into shops and to consider possible meetings What was it but odious to find himself wondering what as between him and another man a possible meeting would produce There recurred moments when in spite of everything he felt no straighter than another man And yet even on the third day when still nothing had come he more than ever knew that he wouldn t have budged for the world He thought of the two women in their silence at last he at all events thought of Milly as probably for her reasons now intensely wishing him to go The cold breath of her reasons was with everything else in the air but he didn t care for them any more than for her wish itself and he would stay in spite of her stay in spite of odium stay in spite perhaps of some final experience that would be for the pain of it all but unbearable That would be his one way purified though he was to mark his virtue beyond any mistake It would be accepting the disagreeable and the disagreeable would be a proof a proof of his not having stayed for the thing the agreeable as it were that Kate had named The thing Kate had named was not to have been the odium of staying in spite of hints It was part of the odium as actual too that Kate was for her comfort just now well aloof These were the first hours since her flight in which his sense of what she had done for him on the eve of that event was to incur a qualification It was strange it was perhaps base to be thinking such things so soon but one of the intimations of his solitude was that she had provided for herself She was out of it all by her act as much as he was in it and this difference grew positively as his own intensity increased She had said in their last sharp snatch of talk sharp though thickly muffled and with every word in it final and deep unlike even the deepest words they had ever yet spoken Letters Never NOW Think of it Impossible So that as he had sufficiently caught her sense into which he read all the same a strange inconsequence they had practically wrapped their understanding in the breach of their correspondence He had moreover on losing her done justice to her law of silence for there was doubtless a finer delicacy in his not writing to her than in his writing as he must have written had he spoken of themselves That would have been a turbid strain and her idea had been to be noble which in a degree was a manner Only it left her for the pinch comparatively at ease And it left HIM in the conditions peculiarly alone He was alone that is till on the afternoon of his third day in gathering dusk and renewed rain with his shabby rooms looking doubtless in their confirmed dreariness for the mere eyes of others at their worst the grinning padrona threw open the door and introduced missus Stringham That made at a bound a difference especially when he saw that his visitor was weighted It appeared part of her weight that she was in a wet waterproof that she allowed her umbrella to be taken from her by the good woman without consciousness or care and that her face under her veil richly rosy with the driving wind was and the veil too as splashed as if the rain were her tears Book Ninth Chapter three They came to it almost immediately he was to wonder afterwards at the fewness of their steps She has turned her face to the wall You mean she s worse The poor lady stood there as she had stopped Densher had in the instant flare of his eagerness his curiosity all responsive at sight of her waved away on the spot the padrona who had offered to relieve her of her mackintosh She looked vaguely about through her wet veil intensely alive now to the step she had taken and wishing it not to have been in the dark but clearly as yet seeing nothing I don t know HOW she is and it s why I ve come to you I m glad enough you ve come he said and it s quite you make me feel as if I had been wretchedly waiting for you She showed him again her blurred eyes she had caught at his word Have you been wretched Now however on his lips the word expired It would have sounded for him like a complaint and before something he already made out in his visitor he knew his own trouble as small Hers under her damp draperies which shamed his lack of a fire was great and he felt she had brought it all with her He answered that he had been patient and above all that he had been still As still as a mouse you ll have seen it for yourself Stiller for three days together than I ve ever been in my life It has seemed to me the only thing This qualification of it as a policy or a remedy was straightway for his friend he saw a light that her own light could answer It has been best I ve wondered for you But it has been best she said again Yet it has done no good I don t know I ve been afraid you were gone Then as he gave a headshake which though slow was deeply mature You WON T go Is to go he asked to be still Oh I mean if you ll stay for me I ll do anything for you Isn t it for you alone now I can She thought of it and he could see even more of the relief she was taking from him His presence his face his voice the old rooms themselves so meagre yet so charged where Kate had admirably been to him these things counted for her now she had them as the help she had been wanting so that she still only stood there taking them all in With it however popped up characteristically a throb of her conscience What she thus tasted was almost a personal joy It told Densher of the three days she on her side had spent Well anything you do for me IS for her too Only only Only nothing now matters She looked at him a minute as if he were the fact itself that he expressed Then you know Is she dying he asked for all answer missus Stringham waited her face seemed to sound him Then her own reply was strange She hasn t so much as named you We haven t spoken Not for three days No more she simply went on than if it were all over Not even by the faintest allusion Oh said Densher with more light you mean you haven t spoken about ME About what else No more than if you were dead Well he answered after a moment I AM dead Then I am said Susan Shepherd with a drop of her arms on her waterproof It was a tone that for the minute imposed itself in its dry despair it represented in the bleak place which had no life of its own none but the life Kate had left the sense of which for that matter by mystic channels might fairly be reaching the visitor the very impotence of their extinction And Densher had nothing to oppose it withal nothing but again Is she dying It made her however as if these were crudities almost material pangs only say as before Then you know Yes he at last returned I know But the marvel to me is that YOU do I ve no right in fact to imagine or to assume that you do You may said Susan Shepherd all the same I know Everything Her eyes through her veil kept pressing him No not everything That s why I ve come That I shall really tell you With which as she hesitated and it affected him he brought out in a groan a doubting Oh oh It turned him from her to the place itself which was a part of what was in him was the abode the worn shrine more than ever of the fact in possession the fact now a thick association for which he had hired it THAT was not for telling but Susan Shepherd was none the less so decidedly wonderful that the sense of it might really have begun by an effect already operating to be a part of her knowledge He saw and it stirred him that she hadn t come to judge him had come rather so far as she might dare to pity This showed him her own abasement that at any rate of grief and made him feel with a rush of friendliness that he liked to be with her The rush had quickened when she met his groan with an attenuation We shall at all events if that s anything be together It was his own good impulse in herself It s what I ve ventured to feel It s much She replied in effect silently that it was whatever he liked on which so far as he had been afraid for anything he knew his fear had dropped The comfort was huge for it gave back to him something precious over which in the effort of recovery his own hand had too imperfectly closed Kate he remembered had said to him with her sole and single boldness and also on grounds he hadn t then measured that missus Stringham was a person who WOULDN T at a pinch in a stretch of confidence wince It was but another of the cases in which Kate was always showing You don t think then very horridly of me And her answer was the more valuable that it came without nervous effusion quite as if she understood what he might conceivably have believed She turned over in fact what she thought and that was what helped him Oh you ve been extraordinary It made him aware the next moment of how they had been planted there She took off her cloak with his aid though when she had also accepting a seat removed her veil he recognised in her personal ravage that the words she had just uttered to him were the one flower she had to throw They were all her consolation for him and the consolation even still depended on the event She sat with him at any rate in the grey clearance as sad as a winter dawn made by their meeting The image she again evoked for him loomed in it but the larger She has turned her face to the wall He saw with the last vividness and it was as if in their silences they were simply so leaving what he saw She doesn t speak at all I don t mean not of me Of nothing of no one And she went on Susan Shepherd giving it out as she had had to take it She doesn t WANT to die Think of her age Think of her goodness Think of her beauty Think of all she is Think of all she HAS She lies there stiffening herself and clinging to it all So I thank God the poor lady wound up with a wan inconsequence He wondered You thank God That she s so quiet He continued to wonder IS she so quiet She s more than quiet She s grim It s what she has never been So you see all these days I can t tell you but it s better so It would kill me if she WERE to tell me To tell you He was still at a loss How she feels How she clings How she doesn t want it How she doesn t want to die Of course she doesn t want it He had a long pause and they might have been thinking together of what they could even now do to prevent it This however was not what he brought out Milly s grimness and the great hushed palace were present to him present with the little woman before him as she must have been waiting there and listening Only what harm have YOU done her missus Stringham looked about in her darkness I don t know I come and talk of her here with you It made him again hesitate Does she utterly hate me I don t know How CAN I No one ever will She ll never tell She ll never tell Once more he thought She must be magnificent She IS magnificent His friend after all helped him and he turned it so far as he could all over Would she see me again It made his companion stare Should you like to see her You mean as you describe her He felt her surprise and it took him some time No Ah then missus Stringham sighed But if she could bear it I d do anything She had for the moment her vision of this but it collapsed I don t see what you can do I don t either But SHE might missus Stringham continued to think It s too late Too late for her to see Too late The very decision of her despair it was after all so lucid kindled in him a heat But the doctor all the while Tacchini Oh he s kind He comes He s proud of having been approved and coached by a great London man He hardly in fact goes away so that I scarce know what becomes of his other patients He thinks her justly enough a great personage he treats her like royalty he s waiting on events But she has barely consented to see him and though she has told him generously for she THINKS of me dear creature that he may come that he may stay for my sake he spends most of his time only hovering at her door prowling through the rooms trying to entertain me in that ghastly saloon with the gossip of Venice and meeting me in doorways in the sala on the staircase with an agreeable intolerable smile We don t said Susan Shepherd talk of her By her request Absolutely I don t do what she doesn t wish We talk of the price of provisions By her request too Absolutely She named it to me as a subject when she said the first time that if it would be any comfort to me he might stay as much as we liked Densher took it all in But he isn t any comfort to you None whatever That however she added isn t his fault Nothing s any comfort Certainly Densher observed as I but too horribly feel I M not No But I didn t come for that You came for ME Well then call it that But she looked at him a moment with eyes filled full and something came up in her the next instant from deeper still I came at bottom of course You came at bottom of course for our friend herself But if it s as you say too late for me to do anything She continued to look at him and with an irritation which he saw grow in her from the truth itself So I did say But with you here and she turned her vision again strangely about her with you here and with everything I feel we mustn t abandon her God forbid we should abandon her Then you WON T His tone had made her flush again How do you mean I won t if she abandons ME What can I do if she won t see me But you said just now you wouldn t like it I said I shouldn t like it in the light of what you tell me I shouldn t like it only to see her as you make me I should like it if I could help her But even then Densher pursued without faith she would have to want it first herself And there he continued to make out is the devil of it She WON T want it herself She CAN T He had got up in his impatience of it and she watched him while he helplessly moved There s one thing you can do There s only that and even for that there are difficulties But there IS that He stood before her with his hands in his pockets and he had soon enough from her eyes seen what was coming She paused as if waiting for his leave to utter it and as he only let her wait they heard in the silence on the Canal the renewed downpour of rain She had at last to speak but as if still with her fear she only half spoke I think you really know yourself what it is He did know what it was and with it even as she said rather there were difficulties He turned away on them on everything for a moment he moved to the other window and looked at the sheeted channel wider like a river where the houses opposite blurred and belittled stood at twice their distance missus Stringham said nothing was as mute in fact for the minute as if she had had him and he was the first again to speak When he did so however it was not in straight answer to her last remark he only started from that He said as he came back to her Let me you know SEE one must understand almost as if he had for the time accepted it And what he wished to understand was where on the essence of the question was the voice of Sir Luke Strett If they talked of not giving her up shouldn t HE be the one least of all to do it Aren t we at the worst in the dark without him Oh said missus Stringham it s he who has kept me going I wired the first night and he answered like an angel He ll come like one Only he can t arrive at the nearest till Thursday afternoon Well then that s something She considered Something yes She likes him Rather I can see it still the face with which when he was here in October that night when she was in white when she had people there and those musicians she committed him to my care It was beautiful for both of us she put us in relation She asked me for the time to take him about I did so and we quite hit it off That proved Densher said with a quick sad smile that she liked him He liked YOU Susan Shepherd presently risked Ah I know nothing about that You ought to then He went with you to galleries and churches you saved his time for him showed him the choicest things and you perhaps will remember telling me myself that if he hadn t been a great surgeon he might really have been a great judge I mean of the beautiful Well the young man admitted that s what he is in having judged HER He hasn t he went on judged her for nothing His interest in her which we must make the most of can only be supremely beneficent He still roamed while he spoke with his hands in his pockets and she saw him on this as her eyes sufficiently betrayed trying to keep his distance from the recognition he had a few moments before partly confessed to I m glad she dropped you like him There was something for him in the sound of it Well I do no more dear lady than you do yourself Surely YOU like him Surely when he was here we all liked him Yes but I seem to feel I know what he thinks And I should think with all the time you spent with him you d know it she said yourself Densher stopped short though at first without a word We never spoke of her Neither of us mentioned her even to sound her name and nothing whatever in connexion with her passed between us missus Stringham stared up at him surprised at this picture But she had plainly an idea that after an instant resisted it That was his professional propriety Precisely But it was also my sense of that virtue in him and it was something more besides And he spoke with sudden intensity I couldn t TALK to him about her Oh said Susan Shepherd I can t talk to any one about her Except to ME his friend continued Except to you The ghost of her smile a gleam of significance had waited on her words and it kept him for honesty looking at her For honesty too that is for his own words he had quickly coloured he was sinking so at a stroke the burden of his discourse with Kate His visitor for the minute while their eyes met might have been watching him hold it down And he HAD to hold it down the effort of which precisely made him red He couldn t let it come up at least not yet She might make what she would of it He attempted to repeat his statement but he really modified it Sir Luke at all events had nothing to tell me and I had nothing to tell him Make believe talk was impossible for us and And REAL she had taken him right up with a huge emphasis was more impossible still No doubt he didn t deny it and she had straightway drawn her conclusion Then that proves what I say that there were immensities between you Otherwise you d have chattered I dare say Densher granted we were both thinking of her You were neither of you thinking of any one else That s why you kept together Well that too if she desired he took from her but he came straight back to what he had originally said I haven t a notion all the same of what he thinks She faced him visibly with the question into which he had already observed that her special shade of earnestness was perpetually flowering right and left Are you VERY sure and he could only note her apparent difference from himself You I judge believe that he thinks she s gone She took it but she bore up It doesn t matter what I believe Well we shall see and he felt almost basely superficial More and more for the last five minutes had he known she had brought something with her and never in respect to anything had he had such a wish to postpone He would have liked to put everything off till Thursday he was sorry it was now Tuesday he wondered if he were afraid Yet it wasn t of Sir Luke who was coming nor of Milly who was dying nor of missus Stringham who was sitting there It wasn t strange to say of Kate either for Kate s presence affected him suddenly as having swooned or trembled away Susan Shepherd s thus prolonged had cast on it some influence under which it had ceased to act She was as absent to his sensibility as she had constantly been since her departure absent as an echo or a reference from the palace and it was the first time among the objects now surrounding him that his sensibility so noted her He knew soon enough that it was of himself he was afraid and that even if he didn t take care he should infallibly be more so Meanwhile he added for his companion it has been everything for me to see you She slowly rose at the words which might almost have conveyed to her the hint of his taking care She stood there as if she had in fact seen him abruptly moved to dismiss her But the abruptness would have been in this case so marked as fairly to offer ground for insistence to her imagination of his state It would take her moreover she clearly showed him she was thinking but a minute or two to insist Besides she had already said it Will you do it if HE asks you I mean if Sir Luke himself puts it to you And will you give him oh she was earnest now the opportunity to put it to you The opportunity to put what That if you deny it to her that may still do something Densher felt himself as had already once befallen him in the quarter of an hour turn red to the top of his forehead Turning red had however for him as a sign of shame been so to speak discounted his consciousness of it at the present moment was rather as a sign of his fear It showed him sharply enough of what he was afraid If I deny what to her Hesitation on the demand revived in her for hadn t he all along been letting her see that he knew Why what Lord Mark told her And what did Lord Mark tell her missus Stringham had a look of bewilderment of seeing him as suddenly perverse I ve been judging that you yourself know And it was she who now blushed deep It quickened his pity for her but he was beset too by other things Then YOU know Of his dreadful visit She stared Why it s what has done it Yes I understand that But you also know He had faltered again but all she knew she now wanted to say I m speaking she said soothingly of what he told her It s THAT that I ve taken you as knowing Oh he sounded in spite of himself It appeared to have for her he saw the next moment the quality of relief as if he had supposed her thinking of something else Thereupon straightway that lightened it Oh you thought I ve known it for TRUE Her light had heightened her flush and he saw that he had betrayed himself Not however that it mattered as he immediately saw still better There it was now all of it at last and this at least there was no postponing They were left with her idea the one she was wishing to make him recognise He had expressed ten minutes before his need to understand and she was acting after all but on that Only what he was to understand was no small matter it might be larger even than as yet appeared He took again one of his turns not meeting what she had last said he mooned a minute as he would have called it at a window and of course she could see that she had driven him to the wall She did clearly without delay see it on which her sense of having caught him became as promptly a scruple which she spoke as if not to press What I mean is that he told her you ve been all the while engaged to Miss Croy He gave a jerk round it was almost to hear it the touch of a lash and he said idiotically as he afterwards knew the first thing that came into his head All WHAT while Oh it s not I who say it She spoke in gentleness I only repeat to you what he told her Densher from whom an impatience had escaped had already caught himself up Pardon my brutality Of course I know what you re talking about I saw him toward the evening he further explained in the Piazza only just saw him through the glass at Florian s without any words In fact I scarcely know him there wouldn t have been occasion It was but once moreover he must have gone that night But I knew he wouldn t have come for nothing and I turned it over what he would have come for Oh so had missus Stringham He came for exasperation Densher approved He came to let her know that he knows better than she for whom it was she had a couple of months before in her fool s paradise refused him How you DO know and missus Stringham almost smiled I know that but I don t know the good it does him The good he thinks if he has patience not too much may be to come He doesn t know what he has done to her Only WE you see do that He saw but he wondered She kept from him what she felt She was able I m sure of it not to show anything He dealt her his blow and she took it without a sign missus Stringham it was plain spoke by book and it brought into play again her appreciation of what she related She s magnificent Densher again gravely assented Magnificent And HE she went on is an idiot of idiots An idiot of idiots For a moment on it all on the stupid doom in it they looked at each other Yet he s thought so awfully clever So awfully it s Maud Lowder s own view And he was nice in London said missus Stringham to ME One could almost pity him he has had such a good conscience That s exactly the inevitable ass Yes but it wasn t I could see from the only few things she first told me that he meant HER the least harm He intended none whatever That s always the ass at his worst Densher returned He only of course meant harm to me And good to himself he thought that would come He had been unable to swallow missus Stringham pursued what had happened on his other visit He had been then too sharply humiliated Oh I saw that Yes and he also saw you He saw you received as it were while he was turned away Perfectly Densher said I ve filled it out And also that he has known meanwhile for WHAT I was then received For a stay of all these weeks He had had it to think of Precisely it was more than he could bear But he has it said missus Stringham to think of still Only after all asked Densher who himself somehow at this point was having more to think of even than he had yet had only after all how has he happened to know That is to know enough What do you call enough missus Stringham enquired He can only have acted it would have been his sole safety from full knowledge He had gone on without heeding her question but face to face as they were something had none the less passed between them It was this that after an instant made her again interrogative What do you mean by full knowledge Densher met it indirectly Where has he been since October I think he has been back to England He came in fact I ve reason to believe straight from there Straight to do this job All the way for his half hour Well to try again with the help perhaps of a new fact To make himself possibly right with her a different attempt from the other He had at any rate something to tell her and he didn t know his opportunity would reduce itself to half an hour Or perhaps indeed half an hour would be just what was most effective It HAS been said Susan Shepherd Her companion took it in understanding but too well yet as she lighted the matter for him more really than his own courage had quite dared putting the absent dots on several i s he saw new questions swarm They had been till now in a bunch entangled and confused and they fell apart each showing for itself The first he put to her was at any rate abrupt Have you heard of late from missus Lowder Oh yes two or three times She depends naturally upon news of Milly He hesitated And does she depend naturally upon news of ME His friend matched for an instant his deliberation I ve given her none that hasn t been decently good This will have been the first This Densher was thinking Lord Mark s having been here and her being as she is He thought a moment longer What has missus Lowder written about him Has she written that he has been with them She has mentioned him but once it was in her letter before the last Then she said something And what did she say missus Stringham produced it with an effort Well it was in reference to Miss Croy That she thought Kate was thinking of him Or perhaps I should say rather that he was thinking of HER only it seemed this time to have struck Maud that he was seeing the way more open to him Densher listened with his eyes on the ground but he presently raised them to speak and there was that in his face which proved him aware of a queerness in his question Does she mean he has been encouraged to PROPOSE to her niece I don t know what she means Of course not he recovered himself and I oughtn t to seem to trouble you to piece together what I can t piece myself Only I guess he added I CAN piece it She spoke a little timidly but she risked it I dare say I can piece it too It was one of the things in her and his conscious face took it from her as such that from the moment of her coming in had seemed to mark for him as to what concerned him the long jump of her perception They had parted four days earlier with many things between them deep down But these things were now on their troubled surface and it wasn t he who had brought them so quickly up Women were wonderful at least this one was But so not less was Milly was Aunt Maud so most of all was his very Kate Well he already knew what he had been feeling about the circle of petticoats They were all SUCH petticoats It was just the fineness of his tangle The sense of that in its turn for us too might have been not unconnected with his putting to his visitor a question that quite passed over her remark Has Miss Croy meanwhile written to our friend Oh missus Stringham amended HER friend also But not a single word that I know of He had taken it for certain she hadn t the thing being after all but a shade more strange than his having himself with Milly never for six weeks mentioned the young lady in question It was for that matter but a shade more strange than Milly s not having mentioned her In spite of which and however inconsequently he blushed anew for Kate s silence He got away from it in fact as quickly as possible and the furthest he could get was by reverting for a minute to the man they had been judging How did he manage to get AT her She had only with what had passed between them before to say she couldn t see him Oh she was disposed to kindness She was easier the good lady explained with a slight embarrassment than at the other time Easier She was off her guard There was a difference Yes But exactly not THE difference Exactly not the difference of her having to be harsh Perfectly She could afford to be the opposite With which as he said nothing she just impatiently completed her sense She had had YOU here for six weeks Oh Densher softly groaned Besides I think he must have written her first written I mean in a tone to smooth his way That it would be a kindness to himself Then on the spot On the spot Densher broke in he unmasked The horrid little beast It made Susan Shepherd turn slightly pale though quickening as for hope the intensity of her look at him Oh he went off without an alarm And he must have gone off also without a hope Ah that certainly Then it WAS mere base revenge Hasn t he known her into the bargain the young man asked didn t he weeks before see her judge her feel her as having for such a suit as his not more perhaps than a few months to live missus Stringham at first for reply but looked at him in silence and it gave more force to what she then remarkably added He has doubtless been aware of what you speak of just as you have yourself been aware He has wanted her you mean just BECAUSE Just because said Susan Shepherd The hound Merton Densher brought out He moved off however with a hot face as soon as he had spoken conscious again of an intention in his visitor s reserve Dusk was now deeper and after he had once more taken counsel of the dreariness without he turned to his companion Shall we have lights a lamp or the candles Not for me Nothing Not for me He waited at the window another moment and then faced his friend with a thought He WILL have proposed to Miss Croy That s what has happened Her reserve continued It s you who must judge Well I do judge missus Lowder will have done so too only SHE poor lady wrong Miss Croy s refusal of him will have struck him Densher continued to make it out as a phenomenon requiring a reason And you ve been clear to him AS the reason Not too clear since I m sticking here and since that has been a fact to make his descent on Miss Theale relevant But clear enough He has believed said Densher bravely that I may have been a reason at Lancaster Gate and yet at the same time have been up to something in Venice missus Stringham took her courage from his own Up to something Up to what God knows To some game as they say To some deviltry To some duplicity Which of course missus Stringham observed is a monstrous supposition Her companion after a stiff minute sensibly long for each fell away from her again and then added to it another minute which he spent once more looking out with his hands in his pockets This was no answer he perfectly knew to what she had dropped and it even seemed to state for his own ears that no answer was possible She left him to himself and he was glad she had declined for their further colloquy the advantage of lights These would have been an advantage mainly to herself Yet she got her benefit too even from the absence of them It came out in her very tone when at last she addressed him so differently for confidence in words she had already used If Sir Luke himself asks it of you as something you can do for HIM will you deny to Milly herself what she has been made so dreadfully to believe Oh how he knew he hung back But at last he said You re absolutely certain then that she does believe it Certain She appealed to their whole situation Judge He took his time again to judge Do YOU believe it He was conscious that his own appeal pressed her hard it eased him a little that her answer must be a pain to her discretion She answered none the less and he was truly the harder pressed What I believe will inevitably depend more or less on your action You can perfectly settle it if you care I promise to believe you down to the ground if to save her life you consent to a denial But a denial when it comes to that confound the whole thing don t you see of exactly what It was as if he were hoping she would narrow but in fact she enlarged Of everything Everything had never even yet seemed to him so incalculably much Oh he simply moaned into the gloom Book Ninth Chapter four The near Thursday coming nearer and bringing Sir Luke Strett brought also blessedly an abatement of other rigours The weather changed the stubborn storm yielded and the autumn sunshine baffled for many days but now hot and almost vindictive came into its own again and with an almost audible paean a suffusion of bright sound that was one with the bright colour took large possession Venice glowed and plashed and called and chimed again the air was like a clap of hands and the scattered pinks yellows blues sea greens were like a hanging out of vivid stuffs a laying down of fine carpets Densher rejoiced in this on the occasion of his going to the station to meet the great doctor He went after consideration which as he was constantly aware was at present his imposed his only way of doing anything That was where the event had landed him where no event in his life had landed him before He had thought no doubt from the day he was born much more than he had acted except indeed that he remembered thoughts a few of them which at the moment of their coming to him had thrilled him almost like adventures But anything like his actual state he had not as to the prohibition of impulse accident range the prohibition in other words of freedom hitherto known The great oddity was that if he had felt his arrival so few weeks back especially as an adventure nothing could now less resemble one than the fact of his staying It would be an adventure to break away to depart to go back above all to London and tell Kate Croy he had done so but there was something of the merely the almost meanly obliged and involved sort in his going on as he was That was the effect in particular of missus Stringham s visit which had left him as with such a taste in his mouth of what he couldn t do It had made this quantity clear to him and yet had deprived him of the sense the other sense of what for a refuge he possibly COULD It was but a small make believe of freedom he knew to go to the station for Sir Luke Nothing equally free at all events had he yet turned over so long What then was his odious position but that again and again he was afraid He stiffened himself under this consciousness as if it had been a tax levied by a tyrant He hadn t at any time proposed to himself to live long enough for fear to preponderate in his life Such was simply the advantage it had actually got of him He was afraid for instance that an advance to his distinguished friend might prove for him somehow a pledge or a committal He was afraid of it as a current that would draw him too far yet he thought with an equal aversion of being shabby being poor through fear What finally prevailed with him was the reflexion that whatever might happen the great man had after that occasion at the palace their young woman s brief sacrifice to society and the hour of missus Stringham s appeal had brought it well to the surface shown him marked benevolence missus Stringham s comments on the relation in which Milly had placed them made him it was unmistakeable feel things he perhaps hadn t felt It was in the spirit of seeking a chance to feel again adequately whatever it was he had missed it was no doubt in that spirit so far as it went a stroke for freedom that Densher arriving betimes paced the platform before the train came in Only after it had come and he had presented himself at the door of Sir Luke s compartment with everything that followed only as the situation developed the sense of an anti climax to so many intensities deprived his apprehensions and hesitations even of the scant dignity they might claim He could scarce have said if the visitor s manner less showed the remembrance that might have suggested expectation or made shorter work of surprise in presence of the fact Sir Luke had clean forgotten so Densher read the rather remarkable young man he had formerly gone about with though he picked him up again on the spot with one large quiet look The young man felt himself so picked and the thing immediately affected him as the proof of a splendid economy Opposed to all the waste with which he was now connected the exhibition was of a nature quite nobly to admonish him The eminent pilgrim in the train all the way had used the hours as he needed thinking not a moment in advance of what finally awaited him An exquisite case awaited him of which in this queer way the remarkable young man was an outlying part but the single motion of his face the motion into which Densher from the platform lightly stirred its stillness was his first renewed cognition If however he had suppressed the matter by leaving Victoria he would at once suppress now in turn whatever else suited The perception of this became as a symbol of the whole pitch so far as one might one s self be concerned of his visit One saw our friend further meditated everything that in contact he appeared to accept if only for much not to trouble to sink it what one missed was the inward use he made of it Densher began wondering at the great water steps outside what use he would make of the anomaly of their having there to separate Eugenio had been on the platform in the respectful rear and the gondola from the palace under his direction bestirred itself with its attaching mixture of alacrity and dignity on their coming out of the station together Densher didn t at all mind now that he himself of necessity refusing a seat on the deep black cushions beside the guest of the palace he had Milly s three emissaries for spectators and this susceptibility he also knew it was something to have left behind All he did was to smile down vaguely from the steps they could see him the donkeys as shut out as they would I don t he said with a sad headshake go there now Oh Sir Luke Strett returned and made no more of it so that the thing was splendid Densher fairly thought as an inscrutability quite inevitable and unconscious His friend appeared not even to make of it that he supposed it might be for respect to the crisis He didn t moreover afterwards make much more of anything after the classic craft that is obeying in the main Pasquale s inimitable stroke from the poop had performed the manoeuvre by which it presented receding a back so to speak rendered positively graceful by the high black hump of its felze Densher watched the gondola out of sight he heard Pasquale s cry borne to him across the water for the sharp firm swerve into a side canal a short cut to the palace He had no gondola of his own it was his habit never to take one and he humbly as in Venice it IS humble walked away though not without having for some time longer stood as if fixed where the guest of the palace had left him It was strange enough but he found himself as never yet and as he couldn t have reckoned in presence of the truth that was the truest about Milly He couldn t have reckoned on the force of the difference instantly made for it was all in the air as he heard Pasquale s cry and saw the boat disappear by the mere visibility on the spot of the personage summoned to her aid He hadn t only never been near the facts of her condition which counted so as a blessing for him he hadn t only with all the world hovered outside an impenetrable ring fence within which there reigned a kind of expensive vagueness made up of smiles and silences and beautiful fictions and priceless arrangements all strained to breaking but he had also with every one else as he now felt actively fostered suppressions which were in the direct interest of every one s good manner every one s pity every one s really quite generous ideal It was a conspiracy of silence as the cliche went to which no one had made an exception the great smudge of mortality across the picture the shadow of pain and horror finding in no quarter a surface of spirit or of speech that consented to reflect it The mere aesthetic instinct of mankind our young man had more than once in the connexion said to himself letting the rest of the proposition drop but touching again thus sufficiently on the outrage even to taste involved in one s having to SEE So then it had been a general conscious fool s paradise from which the specified had been chased like a dangerous animal What therefore had at present befallen was that the specified standing all the while at the gate had now crossed the threshold as in Sir Luke Strett s person and quite on such a scale as to fill out the whole precinct Densher s nerves absolutely his heart beats too had measured the change before he on this occasion moved away The facts of physical suffering of incurable pain of the chance grimly narrowed had been made at a stroke intense and this was to be the way he was now to feel them The clearance of the air in short making vision not only possible but inevitable the one thing left to be thankful for was the breadth of Sir Luke s shoulders which should one be able to keep in line with them might in some degree interpose It was however far from plain to Densher for the first day or two that he was again to see his distinguished friend at all That he couldn t on any basis actually serving return to the palace this was as solid to him every whit as the other feature of his case the fact of the publicity attaching to his proscription through his not having taken himself off He had been seen often enough in the Leporelli gondola As accordingly he was not on any presumption destined to meet Sir Luke about the town where the latter would have neither time nor taste to lounge nothing more would occur between them unless the great man should surprisingly wait upon him His doing that Densher further reflected wouldn t even simply depend on missus Stringham s having decided to as they might say turn him on It would depend as well for there would be practically some difference to her on her actually attempting it and it would depend above all on what Sir Luke would make of such an overture Densher had for that matter his own view of the amount to say nothing of the particular sort of response it might expect from him He had his own view of the ability of such a personage even to understand such an appeal To what extent could he be prepared and what importance in fine could he attach Densher asked himself these questions in truth to put his own position at the worst He should miss the great man completely unless the great man should come to see him and the great man could only come to see him for a purpose unsupposable Therefore he wouldn t come at all and consequently there was nothing to hope It wasn t in the least that Densher invoked this violence to all probability but it pressed on him that there were few possible diversions he could afford now to miss Nothing in his predicament was so odd as that incontestably afraid of himself he was not afraid of Sir Luke He had an impression which he clung to based on a previous taste of the visitor s company that HE would somehow let him off The truth about Milly perched on his shoulders and sounded in his tread became by the fact of his presence the name and the form for the time of everything in the place but it didn t for the difference sit in his face the face so squarely and easily turned to Densher at the earlier season His presence on the first occasion not as the result of a summons but as a friendly whim of his own had had quite another value and though our young man could scarce regard that value as recoverable he yet reached out in imagination to a renewal of the old contact He didn t propose as he privately and forcibly phrased the matter to be a hog but there was something he after all did want for himself It was something this stuck to him that Sir Luke would have had for him if it hadn t been impossible These were his worst days the two or three those on which even the sense of the tension at the palace didn t much help him not to feel that his destiny made but light of him He had never been as he judged it so down In mean conditions without books without society almost without money he had nothing to do but to wait His main support really was his original idea which didn t leave him of waiting for the deepest depth his predicament could sink him to Fate would invent if he but gave it time some refinement of the horrible It was just inventing meanwhile this suppression of Sir Luke When the third day came without a sign he knew what to think He had given missus Stringham during her call on him no such answer as would have armed her faith and the ultimatum she had described as ready for him when HE should be ready was therefore if on no other ground than her want of this power to answer for him not to be presented The presentation heaven knew was not what he desired That was not either we hasten to declare as Densher then soon enough saw the idea with which Sir Luke finally stood before him again For stand before him again he finally did just when our friend had gloomily embraced the belief that the limit of his power to absent himself from London obligations would have been reached Four or five days exclusive of journeys represented the largest supposable sacrifice to a head not crowned on the part of one of the highest medical lights in the world so that really when the personage in question following up a tinkle of the bell solidly rose in the doorway it was to impose on Densher a vision that for the instant cut like a knife It spoke the fact and in a single dreadful word of the magnitude he shrank from calling it anything else of Milly s case The great man had not gone then and an immense surrender to her immense need was so expressed in it that some effect some help some hope were flagrantly part of the expression It was for Densher with his reaction from disappointment as if he were conscious of ten things at once the foremost being that just conceivably since Sir Luke WAS still there she had been saved Close upon its heels however and quite as sharply came the sense that the crisis plainly even now to be prolonged for him was to have none of that sound simplicity Not only had his visitor not dropped in to gossip about Milly he hadn t dropped in to mention her at all he had dropped in fairly to show that during the brief remainder of his stay the end of which was now in sight as little as possible of that was to be looked for The demonstration such as it was was in the key of their previous acquaintance and it was their previous acquaintance that had made him come He was not to stop longer than the Saturday next at hand but there were things of interest he should like to see again meanwhile It was for these things of interest for Venice and the opportunity of Venice for a prowl or two as he called it and a turn about that he had looked his young man up producing on the latter s part as soon as the case had with the lapse of a further twenty four hours so defined itself the most incongruous yet most beneficent revulsion Nothing could in fact have been more monstrous on the surface and Densher was well aware of it than the relief he found during this short period in the tacit drop of all reference to the palace in neither hearing news nor asking for it That was what had come out for him on his visitor s entrance even in the very seconds of suspense that were connecting the fact also directly and intensely with Milly s state He had come to say he had saved her he had come as from missus Stringham to say how she might BE saved he had come in spite of missus Stringham to say she was lost the distinct throbs of hope of fear simultaneous for all their distinctness merged their identity in a bound of the heart just as immediate and which remained after they had passed It simply did wonders for him this was the truth that Sir Luke was as he would have said quiet The result of it was the oddest consciousness as of a blest calm after a storm He had been trying for weeks as we know to keep superlatively still and trying it largely in solitude and silence but he looked back on it now as on the heat of fever The real the right stillness was this particular form of society They walked together and they talked looked up pictures again and recovered impressions Sir Luke knew just what he wanted haunted a little the dealers in old wares sat down at Florian s for rest and mild drinks blessed above all the grand weather a bath of warm air a pageant of autumn light Once or twice while they rested the great man closed his eyes keeping them so for some minutes while his companion the more easily watching his face for it made private reflexions on the subject of lost sleep He had been up at night with her he in person for hours but this was all he showed of it and was apparently to remain his nearest approach to an allusion The extraordinary thing was that Densher could take it in perfectly as evidence could turn cold at the image looking out of it and yet that he could at the same time not intermit a throb of his response to accepted liberation The liberation was an experience that held its own and he continued to know why in spite of his deserts in spite of his folly in spite of everything he had so fondly hoped for it He had hoped for it had sat in his room there waiting for it because he had thus divined in it should it come some power to let him off He was BEING let off dealt with in the only way that didn t aggravate his responsibility The beauty was also that this wasn t on system or on any basis of intimate knowledge it was just by being a man of the world and by knowing life by feeling the real that Sir Luke did him good There had been in all the case too many women A man s sense of it another man s changed the air and he wondered what man had he chosen would have been more to his purpose than this one He was large and easy that was the benediction he knew what mattered and what didn t he distinguished between the essence and the shell the just grounds and the unjust for fussing One was thus if one were concerned with him or exposed to him at all in his hands for whatever he should do and not much less affected by his mercy than one might have been by his rigour The grand thing it did come to that was the way he carried off as one might fairly call it the business of making odd things natural Nothing if they hadn t taken it so could have exceeded the unexplained oddity between them of Densher s now complete detachment from the poor ladies at the palace nothing could have exceeded the no less marked anomaly of the great man s own abstentions of speech He made as he had done when they met at the station nothing whatever of anything and the effect of it Densher would have said was a relation with him quite resembling that of doctor and patient One took the cue from him as one might have taken a dose except that the cue was pleasant in the taking That was why one could leave it to his tacit discretion why for the three or four days Densher again and again did so leave it merely wondering a little at the most on the eve of Saturday the announced term of the episode Waiting once more on this latter occasion the Saturday morning for Sir Luke s reappearance at the station our friend had to recognise the drop of his own borrowed ease the result naturally enough of the prospect of losing a support The difficulty was that on such lines as had served them the support was Sir Luke s personal presence Would he go without leaving some substitute for that and without breaking either his silence in respect to his errand Densher was in still deeper ignorance than at the hour of his call and what was truly prodigious at so supreme a moment was that as had immediately to appear no gleam of light on what he had been living with for a week found its way out of him What he had been doing was proof of a huge interest as well as of a huge fee yet when the Leporelli gondola again and somewhat tardily approached his companion watching from the water steps studied his fine closed face as much as ever in vain It was like a lesson from the highest authority on the subject of the relevant so that its blankness affected Densher of a sudden almost as a cruelty feeling it quite awfully compatible as he did with Milly s having ceased to exist And the suspense continued after they had passed together as time was short directly into the station where Eugenio in the field early was mounting guard over the compartment he had secured The strain though probably lasting at the carriage door but a couple of minutes prolonged itself so for our poor gentleman s nerves that he involuntarily directed a long look at Eugenio who met it however as only Eugenio could Sir Luke s attention was given for the time to the right bestowal of his numerous effects about which he was particular and Densher fairly found himself so far as silence could go questioning the representative of the palace It didn t humiliate him now it didn t humiliate him even to feel that that personage exactly knew how little he satisfied him Eugenio resembled to that extent Sir Luke to the extent of the extraordinary things with which his facial habit was compatible By the time however that Densher had taken from it all its possessor intended Sir Luke was free and with a hand out for farewell He offered the hand at first without speech only on meeting his eyes could our young man see that they had never yet so completely looked at him It was never with Sir Luke that they looked harder at one time than at another but they looked longer and this even a shade of it might mean on his part everything It meant Densher for ten seconds believed that Milly Theale was dead so that the word at last spoken made him start I shall come back Then she s better I shall come back within the month Sir Luke repeated without heeding the question He had dropped Densher s hand but he held him otherwise still I bring you a message from Miss Theale he said as if they hadn t spoken of her I m commissioned to ask you from her to go and see her Densher s rebound from his supposition had a violence that his stare betrayed SHE asks me Sir Luke had got into the carriage the door of which the guard had closed but he spoke again as he stood at the window bending a little but not leaning out She told me she d like it and I promised that as I expected to find you here I d let you know Densher on the platform took it from him but what he took brought the blood into his face quite as what he had had to take from missus Stringham And he was also bewildered Then she can receive She can receive you And you re coming back Oh because I must She s not to move She s to stay I come to her I see I see said Densher who indeed did see saw the sense of his friend s words and saw beyond it as well What missus Stringham had announced and what he had yet expected not to have to face HAD then come Sir Luke had kept it for the last but there it was and the colourless compact form it was now taking the tone of one man of the world to another who after what had happened would understand was but the characteristic manner of his appeal Densher was to understand remarkably much and the great thing certainly was to show that he did I m particularly obliged I ll go to day He brought that out but in his pause while they continued to look at each other the train had slowly creaked into motion There was time but for one more word and the young man chose it out of twenty with intense concentration Then she s better Sir Luke s face was wonderful Yes she s better And he kept it at the window while the train receded holding him with it still It was to be his nearest approach to the utter reference they had hitherto so successfully avoided If it stood for everything never had a face had to stand for more So Densher held after the train had gone sharply reflected so he reflected asking himself into what abyss it pushed him even while conscious of retreating under the maintained observation of Eugenio Book Tenth Chapter one Then it has been what do you say a whole fortnight without your making a sign Kate put that to him distinctly in the December dusk of Lancaster Gate and on the matter of the time he had been back but he saw with it straightway that she was as admirably true as ever to her instinct which was a system as well of not admitting the possibility between them of small resentments of trifles to trip up their general trust That by itself the renewed beauty of it would at this fresh sight of her have stirred him to his depths if something else something no less vivid but quite separate hadn t stirred him still more It was in seeing her that he felt what their interruption had been and that they met across it even as persons whose adventures on either side in time and space of the nature of perils and exiles had had a peculiar strangeness He wondered if he were as different for her as she herself had immediately appeared which was but his way indeed of taking in with his thrill that even going by the mere first look she had never been so handsome That fact bloomed for him in the firelight and lamplight that glowed their welcome through the London fog as the flower of her difference just as her difference itself part of which was her striking him as older in a degree for which no mere couple of months could account was the fruit of their intimate relation If she was different it was because they had chosen together that she should be and she might now as a proof of their wisdom their success of the reality of what had happened of what in fact for the spirit of each was still happening been showing it to him for pride His having returned and yet kept for numbered days so still had been he was quite aware the first point he should have to tackle with which consciousness indeed he had made a clean breast of it in finally addressing missus Lowder a note that had led to his present visit He had written to Aunt Maud as the finer way and it would doubtless have been to be noted that he needed no effort not to write to Kate Venice was three weeks behind him he had come up slowly but it was still as if even in London he must conform to her law That was exactly how he was able with his faith in her steadiness to appeal to her feeling for the situation and explain his stretched delicacy He had come to tell her everything so far as occasion would serve them and if nothing was more distinct than that his slow journey his waits his delay to reopen communication had kept pace with this resolve so the inconsequence was doubtless at bottom but one of the elements of intensity He was gathering everything up everything he should tell her That took time and the proof was that as he felt on the spot he couldn t have brought it all with him before this afternoon He HAD brought it to the last syllable and out of the quantity it wouldn t be hard as he in fact found to produce for Kate s understanding his first reason A fortnight yes it was a fortnight Friday but I ve only been keeping in you see with our wonderful system He was so easily justified as that this of itself plainly enough prevented her saying she didn t see Their wonderful system was accordingly still vivid for her and such a gage of its equal vividness for himself was precisely what she must have asked He hadn t even to dot his i s beyond the remark that on the very face of it she would remember their wonderful system attached no premium to rapidities of transition I couldn t quite don t you know take my rebound with a rush and I suppose I ve been instinctively hanging off to minimise for you as well as for myself the appearances of rushing There s a sort of fitness But I knew you d understand It was presently as if she really understood so well that she almost appealed from his insistence yet looking at him too he was not unconscious as if this mastery of fitnesses was a strong sign for her of what she had done to him He might have struck her as expert for contingencies in the very degree of her having in Venice struck HIM as expert He smiled over his plea for a renewal with stages and steps a thing shaded as they might say and graduated though finely as she must respond she met the smile but as she had met his entrance five minutes before Her soft gravity at that moment which was yet not solemnity but the look of a consciousness charged with life to the brim and wishing not to overflow had not qualified her welcome what had done this being much more the presence in the room for a couple of minutes of the footman who had introduced him and who had been interrupted in preparing the tea table missus Lowder s reply to Densher s note had been to appoint the tea hour five o clock on Sunday for his seeing them Kate had thereafter wired him without a signature Come on Sunday BEFORE tea about a quarter of an hour which will help us and he had arrived therefore scrupulously at twenty minutes to five Kate was alone in the room and hadn t delayed to tell him that Aunt Maud as she had happily gathered was to be for the interval not long but precious engaged with an old servant retired and pensioned who had been paying her a visit and who was within the hour to depart again for the suburbs They were to have the scrap of time after the withdrawal of the footman to themselves and there was a moment when in spite of their wonderful system in spite of the proscription of rushes and the propriety of shades it proclaimed itself indeed precious And all without prejudice that was what kept it noble to Kate s high sobriety and her beautiful self command If he had his discretion she had her perfect manner which was HER decorum missus Stringham he had to finish with the question of his delay furthermore observed missus Stringham would have written to missus Lowder of his having quitted the place so that it wasn t as if he were hoping to cheat them They d know he was no longer there Yes we ve known it And you continue to hear From missus Stringham Certainly By which I mean Aunt Maud does Then you ve recent news Her face showed a wonder Up to within a day or two I believe But haven t YOU No I ve heard nothing And it was now that he felt how much he had to tell her I don t get letters But I ve been sure missus Lowder does With which he added Then of course you know He waited as if she would show what she knew but she only showed in silence the dawn of a surprise that she couldn t control There was nothing but for him to ask what he wanted Is Miss Theale alive Kate s look at this was large Don t you KNOW How should I my dear in the absence of everything And he himself stared as for light She s dead Then as with her eyes on him she slowly shook her head he uttered a strange Not yet It came out in Kate s face that there were several questions on her lips but the one she presently put was Is it very terrible The manner of her so consciously and helplessly dying He had to think a moment Well yes since you ask me very terrible to ME so far as before I came away I had any sight of it But I don t think he went on that though I ll try I CAN quite tell you what it was what it is for me That s why I probably just sounded to you he explained as if I hoped it might be over She gave him her quietest attention but he by this time saw that so far as telling her all was concerned she would be divided between the wish and the reluctance to hear it between the curiosity that not unnaturally would consume her and the opposing scruple of a respect for misfortune The more she studied him too and he had never so felt her closely attached to his face the more the choice of an attitude would become impossible to her There would simply be a feeling uppermost and the feeling wouldn t be eagerness This perception grew in him fast and he even with his imagination had for a moment the quick forecast of her possibly breaking out at him should he go too far with a wonderful What horrors are you telling me It would have the sound wouldn t it be open to him fairly to bring that out himself of a repudiation for pity and almost for shame of everything that in Venice had passed between them Not that she would confess to any return upon herself not that she would let compunction or horror give her away but it was in the air for him yes that she wouldn t want details that she positively wouldn t take them and that if he would generously understand it from her she would prefer to keep him down Nothing however was more definite for him than that at the same time he must remain down but so far as it suited him Something rose strong within him against his not being free with her She had been free enough about it all three months before with HIM That was what she was at present only in the sense of treating him handsomely I can believe she said with perfect consideration how dreadful for you much of it must have been He didn t however take this up there were things about which he wished first to be clear There s no other possibility by what you now know I mean for her life And he had just to insist she would say as little as she could She IS dying She s dying It was strange to him in the matter of Milly that Lancaster Gate could make him any surer yet what in the world in the matter of Milly wasn t strange Nothing was so much so as his own behaviour his present as well as his past He could but do as he must Has Sir Luke Strett he asked gone back to her I believe he s there now Then said Densher it s the end She took it in silence for whatever he deemed it to be but she spoke otherwise after a minute You won t know unless you ve perhaps seen him yourself that Aunt Maud has been to him Oh Densher exclaimed with nothing to add to it For real news Kate herself after an instant added She hasn t thought missus Stringham s real It s perhaps only I who haven t It was on Aunt Maud s trying again three days ago to see him that she heard at his house of his having gone He had started I believe some days before And won t then by this time be back Kate shook her head She sent yesterday to know He won t leave her then Densher had turned it over while she lives He ll stay to the end He s magnificent I think SHE is said Kate It had made them again look at each other long and what it drew from him rather oddly was Oh you don t know Well she s after all my friend It was somehow with her handsome demur the answer he had least expected of her and it fanned with its breath for a brief instant his old sense of her variety I see You would have been sure of it You WERE sure of it Of course I was sure of it And a pause again with this fell upon them which Densher however presently broke If you don t think missus Stringham s news real what do you think of Lord Mark s She didn t think anything Lord Mark s You haven t seen him Not since he saw her You ve known then of his seeing her Certainly From missus Stringham And have you known Densher went on the rest Kate wondered What rest Why everything It was his visit that she couldn t stand it was what then took place that simply killed her Oh Kate seriously breathed But she had turned pale and he saw that whatever her degree of ignorance of these connexions it wasn t put on missus Stringham hasn t said THAT He observed none the less that she didn t ask what had then taken place and he went on with his contribution to her knowledge The way it affected her was that it made her give up She has given up beyond all power to care again and that s why she s dying Oh Kate once more slowly sighed but with a vagueness that made him pursue One can see now that she was living by will which was very much what you originally told me of her I remember That was it Well then her will at a given moment broke down and the collapse was determined by that fellow s dastardly stroke He told her the scoundrel that you and I are secretly engaged Kate gave a quick glare But he doesn t know it That doesn t matter SHE did by the time he had left her Besides Densher added he does know it When he continued did you last see him But she was lost now in the picture before her THAT was what made her worse He watched her take it in it so added to her sombre beauty Then he spoke as missus Stringham had spoken She turned her face to the wall Poor Milly said Kate Slight as it was her beauty somehow gave it style so that he continued consistently She learned it you see too soon since of course one s idea had been that she might never even learn it at all And she HAD felt sure through everything we had done of there not being between us so far at least as you were concerned anything she need regard as a warning She took another moment for thought It wasn t through anything YOU did whatever that may have been that she gained her certainty It was by the conviction she got from me Oh it s very handsome Densher said for you to take your share Do you suppose Kate asked that I think of denying it Her look and her tone made him for the instant regret his comment which indeed had been the first that rose to his lips as an effect absolutely of what they would have called between them her straightness Her straightness visibly was all his own loyalty could ask Still that was comparatively beside the mark Of course I don t suppose anything but that we re together in our recognitions our responsibilities whatever we choose to call them It isn t a question for us of apportioning shares or distinguishing invidiously among such impressions as it was our idea to give It wasn t YOUR idea to give impressions said Kate He met this with a smile that he himself felt in its strained character as queer Don t go into that It was perhaps not as going into it that she had another idea an idea born she showed of the vision he had just evoked Wouldn t it have been possible then to deny the truth of the information I mean of Lord Mark s Densher wondered Possible for whom Why for you To tell her he lied To tell her he s mistaken Densher stared he was stupefied the possible thus glanced at by Kate being exactly the alternative he had had to face in Venice and to put utterly away from him Nothing was stranger than such a difference in their view of it And to lie myself you mean to do it We ARE my dear child he said I suppose still engaged Of course we re still engaged But to save her life He took in for a little the way she talked of it Of course it was to be remembered she had always simplified and it brought back his sense of the degree in which to her energy as compared with his own many things were easy the very sense that so often before had moved him to admiration Well if you must know and I want you to be clear about it I didn t even seriously think of a denial to her face The question of it AS possibly saving her was put to me definitely enough but to turn it over was only to dismiss it Besides he added it wouldn t have done any good You mean she would have had no faith in your correction She had spoken with a promptitude that affected him of a sudden as almost glib but he himself paused with the overweight of all he meant and she meanwhile went on Did you try I hadn t even a chance Kate maintained her wonderful manner the manner of at once having it all before her and yet keeping it all at its distance She wouldn t see you Not after your friend had been with her She hesitated Couldn t you write It made him also think but with a difference She had turned her face to the wall This again for a moment hushed her and they were both too grave now for parenthetic pity But her interest came out for at least the minimum of light She refused even to let you speak to her My dear girl Densher returned she was miserably prohibitively ill Well that was what she had been before And it didn t prevent No Densher admitted it didn t and I don t pretend that she s not magnificent She s prodigious said Kate Croy He looked at her a moment So are you my dear But that s how it is he wound up and there we are His idea had been in advance that she would perhaps sound him much more deeply asking him above all two or three specific things He had fairly fancied her even wanting to know and trying to find out how far as the odious phrase was he and Milly had gone and how near by the same token they had come He had asked himself if he were prepared to hear her do that and had had to take for answer that he was prepared of course for everything Wasn t he prepared for her ascertaining if her two or three prophecies had found time to be made true He had fairly believed himself ready to say whether or no the overture on Milly s part promised according to the boldest of them had taken place But what was in fact blessedly coming to him was that so far as such things were concerned his readiness wouldn t be taxed Kate s pressure on the question of what had taken place remained so admirably general that even her present enquiry kept itself free of sharpness So then that after Lord Mark s interference you never again met It was what he had been all the while coming to No we met once so far as it could be called a meeting I had stayed I didn t come away That said Kate was no more than decent Precisely he felt himself wonderful and I wanted to be no less She sent for me I went to her and that night I left Venice His companion waited Wouldn t THAT then have been your chance To refute Lord Mark s story No not even if before her there I had wanted to What did it signify either She was dying Well Kate in a manner persisted why not just BECAUSE she was dying She had however all her discretion But of course I know that seeing her you could judge Of course seeing her I could judge And I did see her If I had denied you moreover Densher said with his eyes on her I d have stuck to it She took for a moment the intention of his face You mean that to convince her you d have insisted or somehow proved I mean that to convince YOU I d have insisted or somehow proved Kate looked for her moment at a loss To convince me I wouldn t have made my denial in such conditions only to take it back afterwards With this quickly light came for her and with it also her colour flamed Oh you d have broken with me to make your denial a truth You d have chucked me she embraced it perfectly to save your conscience I couldn t have done anything else said Merton Densher So you see how right I was not to commit myself and how little I could dream of it If it ever again appears to you that I MIGHT have done so remember what I say Kate again considered but not with the effect at once to which he pointed You ve fallen in love with her Well then say so with a dying woman Why need you mind and what does it matter It came from him the question straight out of the intensity of relation and the face to face necessity into which from the first from his entering the room they had found themselves thrown but it gave them their most extraordinary moment Wait till she IS dead missus Stringham Kate added is to telegraph After which in a tone still different For what then she asked did Milly send for you It was what I tried to make out before I went I must tell you moreover that I had no doubt of its really being to give me as you say a chance She believed I suppose that I MIGHT deny and what to my own mind was before me in going to her was the certainty that she d put me to my test She wanted from my own lips so I saw it the truth But I was with her for twenty minutes and she never asked me for it She never wanted the truth Kate had a high headshake She wanted YOU She would have taken from you what you could give her and been glad of it even if she had known it false You might have lied to her from pity and she have seen you and felt you lie and yet since it was all for tenderness she would have thanked you and blessed you and clung to you but the more For that was your strength my dear man that she loves you with passion Oh my strength Densher coldly murmured Otherwise since she had sent for you what was it to ask of you And then quite without irony as he waited a moment to say Was it just once more to look at you She had nothing to ask of me nothing that is but not to stay any longer She did to that extent want to see me She had supposed at first after he had been with her that I had seen the propriety of taking myself off Then since I hadn t seeing my propriety as I did in another way she found days later that I was still there This said Densher affected her Of course it affected her Again she struck him for all her dignity as glib If it was somehow for HER I was still staying she wished that to end she wished me to know how little there was need of it And as a manner of farewell she wished herself to tell me so And she did tell you so Face to face yes Personally as she desired And as YOU of course did No Kate he returned with all their mutual consideration not as I did I hadn t desired it in the least You only went to oblige her To oblige her And of course also to oblige you Oh for myself certainly I m glad Glad he echoed vaguely the way it rang out I mean you did quite the right thing You did it especially in having stayed But that was all Kate went on That you mustn t wait That was really all and in perfect kindness Ah kindness naturally from the moment she asked of you such a well such an effort That you mustn t wait that was the point Kate added to see her die That was the point my dear Densher said And it took twenty minutes to make it He thought a little I didn t time it to a second I paid her the visit just like another Like another person Like another visit Oh said Kate Which had apparently the effect of slightly arresting his speech an arrest she took advantage of to continue making with it indeed her nearest approach to an enquiry of the kind against which he had braced himself Did she receive you in her condition in her room Not she said Merton Densher She received me just as usual in that glorious great salone in the dress she always wears from her inveterate corner of her sofa And his face for the moment conveyed the scene just as hers equally embraced it Do you remember what you originally said to me of her Ah I ve said so many things That she wouldn t smell of drugs that she wouldn t taste of medicine Well she didn t So that it was really almost happy It took him a long time to answer occupied as he partly was in feeling how nobody but Kate could have invested such a question with the tone that was perfectly right She meanwhile however patiently waited I don t think I can attempt to say now what it was Some day perhaps For it would be worth it for us Some day certainly She seemed to record the promise Yet she spoke again abruptly She ll recover Well said Densher you ll see She had the air an instant of trying to Did she show anything of her feeling I mean Kate explained of her feeling of having been misled She didn t press hard surely but he had just mentioned that he would have rather to glide She showed nothing but her beauty and her strength Then his companion asked what s the use of her strength He seemed to look about for a use he could name but he had soon given it up She must die my dear in her own extraordinary way Naturally But I don t see then what proof you have that she was ever alienated I have the proof that she refused for days and days to see me But she was ill That hadn t prevented her as you yourself a moment ago said during the previous time If it had been only illness it would have made no difference with her She would still have received you She would still have received me Oh well said Kate if you know Of course I know I know moreover as well from missus Stringham And what does missus Stringham know Everything She looked at him longer Everything Everything Because you ve told her Because she has seen for herself I ve told her nothing She s a person who does see Kate thought That s by her liking you too She as well is prodigious You see what interest in a man does It does it all round So you needn t be afraid I m not afraid said Densher Kate moved from her place then looking at the clock which marked five She gave her attention to the tea table where Aunt Maud s huge silver kettle which had been exposed to its lamp and which she had not soon enough noticed was hissing too hard Well it s all most wonderful she exclaimed as she rather too profusely a sign her friend noticed ladled tea into the pot He watched her a moment at this occupation coming nearer the table while she put in the steaming water You ll have some He hesitated Hadn t we better wait For Aunt Maud She saw what he meant the deprecation by their old law of betrayals of the intimate note Oh you needn t mind now We ve done it Humbugged her Squared her You ve pleased her Densher mechanically accepted his tea He was thinking of something else and his thought in a moment came out What a brute then I must be A brute To have pleased so many people Ah said Kate with a gleam of gaiety you ve done it to please ME But she was already with her gleam reverting a little What I don t understand is won t you have any sugar Yes please What I don t understand she went on when she had helped him is what it was that had occurred to bring her round again If she gave you up for days and days what brought her back to you She asked the question with her own cup in her hand but it found him ready enough in spite of his sense of the ironic oddity of their going into it over the tea table It was Sir Luke Strett who brought her back His visit his presence there did it He brought her back then to life Well to what I saw And by interceding for you I don t think he interceded I don t indeed know what he did Kate wondered Didn t he tell you I didn t ask him I met him again but we practically didn t speak of her Kate stared Then how do you know I see I feel I was with him again as I had been before Oh and you pleased him too That was it He understood said Densher But understood what He waited a moment That I had meant awfully well Ah and made HER understand I see she went on as he said nothing But how did he convince her Densher put down his cup and turned away You must ask Sir Luke He stood looking at the fire and there was a time without sound The great thing Kate then resumed is that she s satisfied Which she continued looking across at him is what I ve worked for Satisfied to die in the flower of her youth Well at peace with you Oh peace he murmured with his eyes on the fire The peace of having loved He raised his eyes to her Is THAT peace Of having BEEN loved she went on That is Of having she wound up realised her passion She wanted nothing more She has had ALL she wanted Lucid and always grave she gave this out with a beautiful authority that he could for the time meet with no words He could only again look at her though with the sense in so doing that he made her more than he intended take his silence for assent Quite indeed as if she did so take it she quitted the table and came to the fire You may think it hideous that I should now that I should YET she made a point of the word pretend to draw conclusions But we ve not failed Oh he only again murmured She was once more close to him close as she had been the day she came to him in Venice the quickly returning memory of which intensified and enriched the fact He could practically deny in such conditions nothing that she said and what she said was with it visibly a fruit of that knowledge We ve succeeded She spoke with her eyes deep in his own She won t have loved you for nothing It made him wince but she insisted And you won t have loved ME Book Tenth Chapter two He was to remain for several days under the deep impression of this inclusive passage so luckily prolonged from moment to moment but interrupted at its climax as may be said by the entrance of Aunt Maud who found them standing together near the fire The bearings of the colloquy however sharp as they were were less sharp to his intelligence strangely enough than those of a talk with missus Lowder alone for which she soon gave him or for which perhaps rather Kate gave him full occasion What had happened on her at last joining them was to conduce he could immediately see to her desiring to have him to herself Kate and he no doubt at the opening of the door had fallen apart with a certain suddenness so that she had turned her hard fine eyes from one to the other but the effect of this lost itself to his mind the next minute in the effect of his companion s rare alertness She instantly spoke to her aunt of what had first been uppermost for herself inviting her thereby intimately to join them and doing it the more happily also no doubt because the fact she resentfully named gave her ample support Had you quite understood my dear that it s full three weeks And she effaced herself as if to leave missus Lowder to deal from her own point of view with this extravagance Densher of course straightway noted that his cue for the protection of Kate was to make no less all of it he could and their tracks as he might have said were fairly covered by the time their hostess had taken afresh on his renewed admission the measure of his scant eagerness Kate had moved away as if no great showing were needed for her personal situation to be seen as delicate She had been entertaining their visitor on her aunt s behalf a visitor she had been at one time suspected of favouring too much and who had now come back to them as the stricken suitor of another person It wasn t that the fate of the other person her exquisite friend didn t in its tragic turn also concern herself it was only that her acceptance of mister Densher as a source of information could scarcely help having an awkwardness She invented the awkwardness under Densher s eyes and he marvelled on his side at the instant creation It served her as the fine cloud that hangs about a goddess in an epic and the young man was but vaguely to know at what point of the rest of his visit she had for consideration melted into it and out of sight He was taken up promptly with another matter the truth of the remarkable difference neither more nor less that the events of Venice had introduced into his relation with Aunt Maud and that these weeks of their separation had caused quite richly to ripen for him She had not sat down to her tea table before he felt himself on terms with her that were absolutely new nor could she press on him a second cup without her seeming herself and quite wittingly so to define and establish them She regretted but she quite understood that what was taking place had obliged him to hang off they had after hearing of him from poor Susan as gone been hoping for an early sight of him they would have been interested naturally in his arriving straight from the scene Yet she needed no reminder that the scene precisely by which she meant the tragedy that had so detained and absorbed him the memory the shadow the sorrow of it was what marked him for unsociability She thus presented him to himself as it were in the guise in which she had now adopted him and it was the element of truth in the character that he found himself for his own part adopting She treated him as blighted and ravaged as frustrate and already bereft and for him to feel that this opened for him a new chapter of frankness with her he scarce had also to perceive how it smoothed his approaches to Kate It made the latter accessible as she hadn t yet begun to be it set up for him at Lancaster Gate an association positively hostile to any other legend It was quickly vivid to him that were he minded he could work this association he had but to use the house freely for his prescribed attitude and he need hardly ever be out of it Stranger than anything moreover was to be the way that by the end of a week he stood convicted to his own sense of a surrender to missus Lowder s view He had somehow met it at a point that had brought him on brought him on a distance that he couldn t again retrace He had private hours of wondering what had become of his sincerity he had others of simply reflecting that he had it all in use His only want of candour was Aunt Maud s wealth of sentiment She was hugely sentimental and the worst he did was to take it from her He wasn t so himself everything was too real but it was none the less not false that he HAD been through a mill It was in particular not false for instance that when she had said to him on the Sunday almost cosily from her sofa behind the tea I want you not to doubt you poor dear that I m WITH you to the end his meeting her halfway had been the only course open to him She was with him to the end or she might be in a way Kate wasn t and even if it literally made her society meanwhile more soothing he must just brush away the question of why it shouldn t Was he professing to her in any degree the possession of an aftersense that wasn t real How in the world COULD he when his aftersense day by day was his greatest reality Such only was at bottom what there was between them and two or three times over it made the hour pass These were occasions two and a scrap on which he had come and gone without mention of Kate Now that almost as never yet he had licence to ask for her the queer turn of their affair made it a false note It was another queer turn that when he talked with Aunt Maud about Milly nothing else seemed to come up He called upon her almost avowedly for that purpose and it was the queerest turn of all that the state of his nerves should require it He liked her better he was really behaving he had occasion to say to himself as if he liked her best The thing was absolutely that she met HIM halfway Nothing could have been broader than her vision than her loquacity than her sympathy It appeared to gratify to satisfy her to see him as he was that too had its effect It was all of course the last thing that could have seemed on the cards a change by which he was completely FREE with this lady and it wouldn t indeed have come about if for another monstrosity he hadn t ceased to be free with Kate Thus it was that on the third time in especial of being alone with her he found himself uttering to the elder woman what had been impossible of utterance to the younger missus Lowder gave him in fact on the ground of what he must keep from her but one uneasy moment That was when on the first Sunday after Kate had suppressed herself she referred to her regret that he mightn t have stayed to the end He found his reason difficult to give her but she came after all to his help You simply couldn t stand it I simply couldn t stand it Besides you see But he paused Besides what He had been going to say more then he saw dangers luckily however she had again assisted him Besides oh I know men haven t in many relations the courage of women They haven t the courage of women Kate or I would have stayed she declared if we hadn t come away for the special reason that you so frankly appreciated Densher had said nothing about his appreciation hadn t his behaviour since the hour itself sufficiently shown it But he presently said he couldn t help going so far I don t doubt certainly that Miss Croy would have stayed And he saw again into the bargain what a marvel was Susan Shepherd She did nothing but protect him she had done nothing but keep it up In copious communication with the friend of her youth she had yet it was plain favoured this lady with nothing that compromised him Milly s act of renouncement she had described but as a change for the worse she had mentioned Lord Mark s descent as even without her it might be known so that she mustn t appear to conceal it but she had suppressed explanations and connexions and indeed for all he knew blessed Puritan soul had invented commendable fictions Thus it was absolutely that he WAS at his ease Thus it was that shaking for ever in the unrest that didn t drop his crossed leg he leaned back in deep yellow satin chairs and took such comfort as came She asked it was true Aunt Maud questions that Kate hadn t but this was just the difference that from her he positively liked them He had taken with himself on leaving Venice the resolution to regard Milly as already dead to him that being for his spirit the only thinkable way to pass the time of waiting He had left her because it was what suited her and it wasn t for him to go as they said in America behind this which imposed on him but the sharper need to arrange himself with his interval Suspense was the ugliest ache to him and he would have nothing to do with it the last thing he wished was to be unconscious of her what he wished to ignore was her own consciousness tortured for all he knew crucified by its pain Knowingly to hang about in London while the pain went on what would that do but make his days impossible His scheme was accordingly to convince himself and by some art about which he was vague that the sense of waiting had passed What in fact he restlessly reflected have I any further to do with it Let me assume the thing actually over as it at any moment may be and I become good again for something at least to somebody I m good as it is for nothing to anybody least of all to HER He consequently tried so far as shutting his eyes and stalking grimly about was a trial but his plan was carried out it may well be guessed neither with marked success nor with marked consistency The days whether lapsing or lingering were a stiff reality the suppression of anxiety was a thin idea the taste of life itself was the taste of suspense That he WAS waiting was in short at the bottom of everything and it required no great sifting presently to feel that if he took so much more as he called it to missus Lowder this was just for that reason She helped him to hold out all the while that she was subtle enough and he could see her divine it as what he wanted not to insist on the actuality of their tension His nearest approach to success was thus in being good for something to Aunt Maud in default of any one better her company eased his nerves even while they pretended together that they had seen their tragedy out They spoke of the dying girl in the past tense they said no worse of her than that she had BEEN stupendous On the other hand however and this was what wasn t for Densher pure peace they insisted enough that stupendous was the word It was the thing this recognition that kept him most quiet he came to it with her repeatedly talking about it against time and in particular we have noted speaking of his supreme personal impression as he hadn t spoken to Kate It was almost as if she herself enjoyed the perfection of the pathos she sat there before the scene as he couldn t help giving it out to her very much as a stout citizen s wife might have sat during a play that made people cry in the pit or the family circle What most deeply stirred her was the way the poor girl must have wanted to live Ah yes indeed she did she did why in pity shouldn t she with everything to fill her world The mere MONEY of her the darling if it isn t too disgusting at such a time to mention that Aunt Maud mentioned it and Densher quite understood but as fairly giving poetry to the life Milly clung to a view of the might have been before which the good lady was hushed anew to tears She had had her own vision of these possibilities and her own social use for them and since Milly s spirit had been after all so at one with her about them what was the cruelty of the event but a cruelty of a sort to herself That came out when he named as THE horrible thing to know the fact of their young friend s unapproachable terror of the end keep it down though she would coming out therefore often since in so naming it he found the strangest of reliefs He allowed it all its vividness as if on the principle of his not at least spiritually shirking Milly had held with passion to her dream of a future and she was separated from it not shrieking indeed but grimly awfully silent as one might imagine some noble young victim of the scaffold in the French Revolution separated at the prison door from some object clutched for resistance Densher in a cold moment so pictured the case for missus Lowder but no moment cold enough had yet come to make him so picture it to Kate And it was the front so presented that had been in Milly heroic presented with the highest heroism Aunt Maud by this time knew on the occasion of his taking leave of her He had let her know absolutely for the girl s glory how he had been received on that occasion with a positive effect since she was indeed so perfectly the princess that missus Stringham always called her of princely state Before the fire in the great room that was all arabesques and cherubs all gaiety and gilt and that was warm at that hour too with a wealth of autumn sun the state in question had been maintained and the situation well Densher said for the convenience of exquisite London gossip sublime The gossip for it came to as much at Lancaster Gate wasn t the less exquisite for his use of the silver veil nor on the other hand was the veil so touched too much drawn aside He himself for that matter took in the scene again at moments as from the page of a book He saw a young man far off and in a relation inconceivable saw him hushed passive staying his breath but half understanding yet dimly conscious of something immense and holding himself painfully together not to lose it The young man at these moments so seen was too distant and too strange for the right identity and yet outside afterwards it was his own face Densher had known He had known then at the same time what the young man had been conscious of and he was to measure after that day by day how little he had lost At present there with missus Lowder he knew he had gathered all that passed between them mutely as in the intervals of their associated gaze they exchanged looks of intelligence This was as far as association could go but it was far enough when she knew the essence The essence was that something had happened to him too beautiful and too sacred to describe He had been to his recovered sense forgiven dedicated blessed but this he couldn t coherently express It would have required an explanation fatal to missus Lowder s faith in him of the nature of Milly s wrong So as to the wonderful scene they just stood at the door They had the sense of the presence within they felt the charged stillness after which their association deepened by it they turned together away That itself indeed for our restless friend became by the end of a week the very principle of reaction so that he woke up one morning with such a sense of having played a part as he needed self respect to gainsay He hadn t in the least stated at Lancaster Gate that as a haunted man a man haunted with a memory he was harmless but the degree to which missus Lowder accepted admired and explained his new aspect laid upon him practically the weight of a declaration What he hadn t in the least stated her own manner was perpetually stating it was as haunted and harmless that she was constantly putting him down There offered itself however to his purpose such an element as plain honesty and he had embraced by the time he dressed his proper corrective They were on the edge of Christmas but Christmas this year was as in the London of so many other years disconcertingly mild the still air was soft the thick light was grey the great town looked empty and in the Park where the grass was green where the sheep browsed where the birds multitudinously twittered the straight walks lent themselves to slowness and the dim vistas to privacy He held it fast this morning till he had got out his sacrifice to honour and then went with it to the nearest post office and fixed it fast in a telegram thinking of it moreover as a sacrifice only because he had for reasons felt it as an effort Its character of effort it would owe to Kate s expected resistance not less probable than on the occasion of past appeals which was precisely why he perhaps innocently made his telegram persuasive It had as a recall of tender hours to be for the young woman at the counter a trifle cryptic but there was a good deal of it in one way and another representing as it did a rich impulse and costing him a couple of shillings There was also a moment later on that day when in the Park as he measured watchfully one of their old alleys he might have been supposed by a cynical critic to be reckoning his chance of getting his money back He was waiting but he had waited of old Lancaster Gate as a danger was practically at hand but she had risked that danger before Besides it was smaller now with the queer turn of their affair in spite of which indeed he was graver as he lingered and looked out Kate came at last by the way he had thought least likely came as if she had started from the Marble Arch but her advent was response that was the great matter response marked in her face and agreeable to him even after Aunt Maud s responses as nothing had been since his return to London She had not it was true answered his wire and he had begun to fear as she was late that with the instinct of what he might be again intending to press upon her she had decided though not with ease to deprive him of his chance He would have of course she knew other chances but she perhaps saw the present as offering her special danger This in fact Densher could himself feel was exactly why he had so prepared it and he had rejoiced even while he waited in all that the conditions had to say to him of their simpler and better time The shortest day of the year though it might be it was in the same place by a whim of the weather almost as much to their purpose as the days of sunny afternoons when they had taken their first trysts This and that tree within sight on the grass stretched bare boughs over the couple of chairs in which they had sat of old and in which for they really could sit down again they might recover the clearness of their prime It was to all intents however this very reference that showed itself in Kate s face as with her swift motion she came toward him It helped him her swift motion when it finally brought her nearer helped him for that matter at first if only by showing him afresh how terribly well she looked It had been all along he certainly remembered a phenomenon of no rarity that he had felt her at particular moments handsomer than ever before one of these for instance being still present to him as her entrance under her aunt s eyes at Lancaster Gate the day of his dinner there after his return from America and another her aspect on the same spot two Sundays ago the light in which she struck the eyes he had brought back from Venice In the course of a minute or two now he got as he had got it the other times his apprehension of the special stamp of the fortune of the moment Whatever it had been determined by as the different hours recurred to him it took on at present a prompt connexion with an effect produced for him in truth more than once during the past week only now much intensified This effect he had already noted and named it was that of the attitude assumed by his friend in the presence of the degree of response on his part to missus Lowder s welcome which she couldn t possibly have failed to notice She HAD noticed it and she had beautifully shown him so wearing in its honour the finest shade of studied serenity a shade almost of gaiety over the workings of time Everything of course was relative with the shadow they were living under but her condonation of the way in which he now for confidence distinguished Aunt Maud had almost the note of cheer She had so by her own air consecrated the distinction invidious in respect to herself though it might be and nothing really more than this demonstration could have given him had he still wanted it the measure of her superiority It was doubtless for that matter this superiority alone that on the winter noon gave smooth decision to her step and charming courage to her eyes a courage that deepened in them when he had presently got to what he did want He had delayed after she had joined him not much more than long enough for him to say to her drawing her hand into his arm and turning off where they had turned of old that he wouldn t pretend he hadn t lately had moments of not quite believing he should ever again be so happy She answered passing over the reasons whatever they had been of his doubt that her own belief was in high happiness for them if they would only have patience though nothing at the same time could be dearer than his idea for their walk It was only make believe of course with what had taken place for them that they couldn t meet at home she spoke of their opportunities as suffering at no point He had at any rate soon let her know that he wished the present one to suffer at none and in a quiet spot beneath a great wintry tree he let his entreaty come sharp We ve played our dreadful game and we ve lost We owe it to ourselves we owe it to our feeling FOR ourselves and for each other not to wait another day Our marriage will fundamentally somehow don t you see right everything that s wrong and I can t express to you my impatience We ve only to announce it and it takes off the weight To announce it Kate asked She spoke as if not understanding though she had listened to him without confusion To accomplish it then to morrow if you will DO it and announce it as done That s the least part of it after it nothing will matter We shall be so right he said that we shall be strong we shall only wonder at our past fear It will seem an ugly madness It will seem a bad dream She looked at him without flinching with the look she had brought at his call but he felt now the strange chill of her brightness My dear man what has happened to you Well that I can bear it no longer THAT S simply what has happened Something has snapped has broken in me and here I am It s AS I am that you must have me He saw her try for a time to appear to consider it but he saw her also not consider it Yet he saw her felt her further he heard her with her clear voice try to be intensely kind with him I don t see you know what has changed She had a large strange smile We ve been going on together so well and you suddenly desert me It made him helplessly gaze You call it so well You ve touches upon my soul I call it perfect from my original point of view I m just where I was and you must give me some better reason than you do my dear for YOUR not being It seems to me she continued that we re only right as to what has been between us so long as we do wait I don t think we wish to have behaved like fools He took in while she talked her imperturbable consistency which it was quietly queerly hopeless to see her stand there and breathe into their mild remembering air He had brought her there to be moved and she was only immoveable which was not moreover either because she didn t understand She understood everything and things he refused to and she had reasons deep down the sense of which nearly sickened him She had too again most of all her strange significant smile Of course if it s that you really KNOW something It was quite conceivable and possible to her he could see that he did But he didn t even know what she meant and he only looked at her in gloom His gloom however didn t upset her You do I believe only you ve a delicacy about saying it Your delicacy to me my dear is a scruple too much I should have no delicacy in hearing it so that if you can TELL me you know Well he asked as she still kept what depended on it Why then I ll do what you want We needn t I grant you in that case wait and I can see what you mean by thinking it nicer of us not to I don t even ask you she continued for a proof I m content with your moral certainty By this time it had come over him it had the force of a rush The point she made was clear as clear as that the blood while he recognised it mantled in his face I know nothing whatever You ve not an idea I ve not an idea I d consent she said I d announce it to morrow to day I d go home this moment and announce it to Aunt Maud for an idea I mean an idea straight FROM you I mean as your own given me in good faith There my dear and she smiled again I call that really meeting you If it WAS then what she called it it disposed of his appeal and he could but stand there with his wasted passion for it was in high passion that he had from the morning acted in his face She made it all out bent upon her the idea he didn t have and the idea he had and his failure of insistence when it brought up THAT challenge and his sense of her personal presence and his horror almost of her lucidity They made in him a mixture that might have been rage but that was turning quickly to mere cold thought thought which led to something else and was like a new dim dawn It affected her then and she had one of the impulses in all sincerity that had before this between them saved their position When she had come nearer to him when putting her hand upon him she made him sink with her as she leaned to him into their old pair of chairs she prevented irresistibly she forestalled the waste of his passion She had an advantage with his passion now Book Tenth Chapter three He had said to her in the Park when challenged on it that nothing had happened to him as a cause for the demand he there made of her happened he meant since the account he had given after his return of his recent experience But in the course of a few days they had brought him to Christmas morning he was conscious enough in preparing again to seek her out of a difference on that score Something HAD in this case happened to him and after his taking the night to think of it he felt that what it most if not absolutely first involved was his immediately again putting himself in relation with her The fact itself had met him there in his own small quarters on Christmas Eve and had not then indeed at once affected him as implying that consequence So far as he on the spot and for the next hours took its measure a process that made his night mercilessly wakeful the consequences possibly implied were numerous to distraction His spirit dealt with them in the darkness as the slow hours passed his intelligence and his imagination his soul and his sense had never on the whole been so intensely engaged It was his difficulty for the moment that he was face to face with alternatives and that it was scarce even a question of turning from one to the other They were not in a perspective in which they might be compared and considered they were by a strange effect as close as a pair of monsters of whom he might have felt on either cheek the hot breath and the huge eyes He saw them at once and but by looking straight before him he wouldn t for that matter in his cold apprehension have turned his head by an inch So it was that his agitation was still was not for the slow hours a matter of restless motion He lay long after the event on the sofa where extinguishing at a touch the white light of convenience that he hated he had thrown himself without undressing He stared at the buried day and wore out the time with the arrival of the Christmas dawn moreover late and grey he felt himself somehow determined The common wisdom had had its say to him that safety in doubt was NOT action and perhaps what most helped him was this very commonness In his case there was nothing of THAT in no case in his life had there ever been less which association from one thing to another now worked for him as a choice He acted after his bath and his breakfast in the sense of that marked element of the rare which he felt to be the sign of his crisis And that is why dressed with more state than usual and quite as if for church he went out into the soft Christmas day Action for him on coming to the point it appeared carried with it a certain complexity We should have known walking by his side that his final prime decision hadn t been to call at the door of Sir Luke Strett and yet that this step though subordinate was none the less urgent His prime decision was for another matter to which impatience once he was on the way had now added itself but he remained sufficiently aware that he must compromise with the perhaps excessive earliness This and the ferment set up within him were together a reason for not driving to say nothing of the absence of cabs in the dusky festal desert Sir Luke s great square was not near but he walked the distance without seeing a hansom He had his interval thus to turn over his view the view to which what had happened the night before had not sharply reduced itself but the complexity just mentioned was to be offered within the next few minutes another item to assimilate Before Sir Luke s house when he reached it a brougham was drawn up at the sight of which his heart had a lift that brought him for the instant to a stand This pause wasn t long but it was long enough to flash upon him a revelation in the light of which he caught his breath The carriage so possibly at such an hour and on such a day Sir Luke s own had struck him as a sign that the great doctor was back This would prove something else in turn still more intensely and it was in the act of the double apprehension that Densher felt himself turn pale His mind rebounded for the moment like a projectile that has suddenly been met by another he stared at the strange truth that what he wanted MORE than to see Kate Croy was to see the witness who had just arrived from Venice He wanted positively to be in his presence and to hear his voice which was the spasm of his consciousness that produced the flash Fortunately for him on the spot there supervened something in which the flash went out He became aware within this minute that the coachman on the box of the brougham had a face known to him whereas he had never seen before to his knowledge the great doctor s carriage The carriage as he came nearer was simply missus Lowder s the face on the box was just the face that in coming and going at Lancaster Gate he would vaguely have noticed outside in attendance With this the rest came the lady of Lancaster Gate had on a prompting not wholly remote from his own presented herself for news and news in the house she was clearly getting since her brougham had stayed Sir Luke WAS then back only missus Lowder was with him It was under the influence of this last reflexion that Densher again delayed and it was while he delayed that something else occurred to him It was all round visibly given his own new contribution a case of pressure and in a case of pressure Kate for quicker knowledge might have come out with her aunt The possibility that in this event she might be sitting in the carriage the thing most likely had had the effect before he could check it of bringing him within range of the window It wasn t there he had wished to see her yet if she WAS there he couldn t pretend not to What he had however the next moment made out was that if some one was there it wasn t Kate Croy It was with a sensible shock for him the person who had last offered him a conscious face from behind the clear plate of a cafe in Venice The great glass at Florian s was a medium less obscure even with the window down than the air of the London Christmas yet at present also none the less between the two men an exchange of recognitions could occur Densher felt his own look a gaping arrest which he disgustedly remembered his back as quickly turned appeared to repeat itself as his special privilege He mounted the steps of the house and touched the bell with a keen consciousness of being habitually looked at by Kate s friend from positions of almost insolent vantage He forgot for the time the moment when in Venice at the palace the encouraged young man had in a manner assisted at the departure of the disconcerted since Lord Mark was not looking disconcerted now any more than he had looked from his bench at his cafe Densher was thinking that HE seemed to show as vagrant while another was ensconced He was thinking of the other as in spite of the difference of situation more ensconced than ever he was thinking of him above all as the friend of the person with whom his recognition had the minute previous associated him The man was seated in the very place in which beside missus Lowder s he had looked to find Kate and that was a sufficient identity Meanwhile at any rate the door of the house had opened and missus Lowder stood before him It was something at least that SHE wasn t Kate She was herself on the spot in all her affluence with presence of mind both to decide at once that Lord Mark in the brougham didn t matter and to prevent Sir Luke s butler by a firm word thrown over her shoulder from standing there to listen to her passage with the gentleman who had rung I LL tell mister Densher you needn t wait And the passage promptly and richly took place on the steps He arrives travelling straight to morrow early I couldn t not come to learn No more said Densher simply could I On my way he added to Lancaster Gate Sweet of you She beamed on him dimly and he saw her face was attuned It made him with what she had just before said know all and he took the thing in while he met the air of portentous of almost functional sympathy that had settled itself as her medium with him and that yet had now a fresh glow So you HAVE had your message He knew so well what she meant and so equally with it what he HAD had no less than what he hadn t that with but the smallest hesitation he strained the point Yes my message Our dear dove then as Kate calls her has folded her wonderful wings Yes folded them It rather racked him but he tried to receive it as she intended and she evidently took his formal assent for self control Unless it s more true she accordingly added that she has spread them the wider He again but formally assented though strangely enough the words fitted a figure deep in his own imagination Rather yes spread them the wider For a flight I trust to some happiness greater Exactly Greater Densher broke in but now with a look he feared that did a little warn her off You were certainly she went on with more reserve entitled to direct news Ours came late last night I m not sure otherwise I shouldn t have gone to you But you re coming she asked to ME He had had a minute by this time to think further and the window of the brougham was still within range Her rich me reaching him moreover through the mild damp had the effect of a thump on his chest Squared Aunt Maud She was indeed squared and the extent of it just now perversely enough took away his breath His look from where they stood embraced the aperture at which the person sitting in the carriage might have shown and he saw his interlocutress on her side understand the question in it which he moreover then uttered Shall you be alone It was as an immediate instinctive parley with the image of his condition that now flourished in her almost hypocritical It sounded as if he wished to come and overflow to her yet this was exactly what he didn t The need to overflow had suddenly since the night before dried up in him and he had never been aware of a deeper reserve But she had meanwhile largely responded Completely alone I should otherwise never have dreamed feeling dear friend but too much Failing on her lips what she felt came out for him in the offered hand with which she had the next moment condolingly pressed his own Dear friend dear friend she was deeply with him and she wished to be still more so which was what made her immediately continue Or wouldn t you this evening for the sad Christmas it makes us dine with me tete a tete It put the thing off the question of a talk with her making the difference to his relief of several hours but it also rather mystified him This however didn t diminish his need of caution Shall you mind if I don t tell you at once Not in the least leave it open it shall be as you may feel and you needn t even send me word I only WILL mention that to day of all days I shall otherwise sit there alone Now at least he could ask Without Miss Croy Without Miss Croy Miss Croy said missus Lowder is spending her Christmas in the bosom of her more immediate family He was afraid even while he spoke of what his face might show You mean she has left you Aunt Maud s own face for that matter met the enquiry with a consciousness in which he saw a reflexion of events He was made sure by it even at the moment and as he had never been before that since he had known these two women no confessed nor commented tension no crisis of the cruder sort would really have taken form between them which was precisely a high proof of how Kate had steered her boat The situation exposed in missus Lowder s present expression lighted up by contrast that superficial smoothness which afterwards with his time to think of it was to put before him again the art the particular gift in the girl now so placed and classed so intimately familiar for him as her talent for life The peace within a day or two since his seeing her last had clearly been broken differences deep down kept there by a diplomacy on Kate s part as deep had been shaken to the surface by some exceptional jar with which in addition he felt Lord Mark s odd attendance at such an hour and season vaguely associated The talent for life indeed it at the same time struck him would probably have shown equally in the breach or whatever had occurred Aunt Maud having suffered he judged a strain rather than a stroke Of these quick thoughts at all events that lady was already abreast She went yesterday morning and not with my approval I don t mind telling you to her sister missus Condrip if you know who I mean who lives somewhere in Chelsea My other niece and her affairs that I should have to say such things to day are a constant worry so that Kate in consequence well of events has simply been called in My own idea I m bound to say was that with SUCH events she need have in her situation next to nothing to do But she differed with you She differed with me And when Kate differs with you Oh I can imagine He had reached the point in the scale of hypocrisy at which he could ask himself why a little more or less should signify Besides with the intention he had had he MUST know Kate s move if he didn t know might simply disconcert him and of being disconcerted his horror was by this time fairly superstitious I hope you don t allude to events at all calamitous No only horrid and vulgar Oh said Merton Densher missus Lowder s soreness it was still not obscure had discovered in free speech to him a momentary balm They ve the misfortune to have I suppose you know a dreadful horrible father Oh said Densher again He s too bad almost to name but he has come upon Marian and Marian has shrieked for help Densher wondered at this with intensity and his curiosity compromised for an instant with his discretion Come upon her for money Oh for that of course always But at THIS blessed season for refuge for safety for God knows what He s THERE the brute And Kate s with them And that missus Lowder wound up going down the steps is her Christmas She had stopped again at the bottom while he thought of an answer Yours then is after all rather better It s at least more decent And her hand once more came out But why do I talk of OUR troubles Come if you can He showed a faint smile Thanks If I can And now I dare say you ll go to church She had asked it with her good intention rather in the air and by way of sketching for him in the line of support something a little more to the purpose than what she had been giving him He felt it as finishing off their intensities of expression that he found himself to all appearance receiving her hint as happy Why yes I think I will after which as the door of the brougham at her approach had opened from within he was free to turn his back He heard the door behind him sharply close again and the vehicle move off in another direction than his own He had in fact for the time no direction in spite of which indeed he was at the end of ten minutes aware of having walked straight to the south That he afterwards recognised was very sufficiently because there had formed itself in his mind even while Aunt Maud finally talked an instant recognition of his necessary course Nothing was open to him but to follow Kate nor was anything more marked than the influence of the step she had taken on the emotion itself that possessed him Her complications which had fairly with everything else an awful sound what were they a thousand times over but his own His present business was to see that they didn t escape an hour longer taking their proper place in his life He accordingly would have held his course hadn t it suddenly come over him that he had just lied to missus Lowder a term it perversely eased him to keep using even more than was necessary To what church was he going to what church in such a state of his nerves COULD he go he pulled up short again as he had pulled up in sight of missus Lowder s carriage to ask it And yet the desire queerly stirred in him not to have wasted his word He was just then however by a happy chance in the Brompton Road and he bethought himself with a sudden light that the Oratory was at hand He had but to turn the other way and he should find himself soon before it At the door then in a few minutes his idea was really as it struck him consecrated he was pushing in on the edge of a splendid service the flocking crowd told of it which glittered and resounded from distant depths in the blaze of altar lights and the swell of organ and choir It didn t match his own day but it was much less of a discord than some other things actual and possible The Oratory in short to make him right would do Book Tenth Chapter four The difference was thus that the dusk of afternoon dusk thick from an early hour had gathered when he knocked at missus Condrip s door He had gone from the church to his club wishing not to present himself in Chelsea at luncheon time and also remembering that he must attempt independently to make a meal This in the event he but imperfectly achieved he dropped into a chair in the great dim void of the club library with nobody up or down to be seen and there after a while closing his eyes recovered an hour of the sleep he had lost during the night Before doing this indeed he had written it was the first thing he did a short note which in the Christmas desolation of the place he had managed only with difficulty and doubt to commit to a messenger He wished it carried by hand and he was obliged rather blindly to trust the hand as the messenger for some reason was unable to return with a gage of delivery When at four o clock he was face to face with Kate in missus Condrip s small drawing room he found to his relief that his notification had reached her She was expectant and to that extent prepared which simplified a little if a little at the present pass counted Her conditions were vaguely vivid to him from the moment of his coming in and vivid partly by their difference a difference sharp and suggestive from those in which he had hitherto constantly seen her He had seen her but in places comparatively great in her aunt s pompous house under the high trees of Kensington and the storied ceilings of Venice He had seen her in Venice on a great occasion as the centre itself of the splendid Piazza he had seen her there on a still greater one in his own poor rooms which yet had consorted with her having state and ancientry even in their poorness but missus Condrip s interior even by this best view of it and though not flagrantly mean showed itself as a setting almost grotesquely inapt Pale grave and charming she affected him at once as a distinguished stranger a stranger to the little Chelsea street who was making the best of a queer episode and a place of exile The extraordinary thing was that at the end of three minutes he felt himself less appointedly a stranger in it than she A part of the queerness this was to come to him in glimpses sprang from the air as of a general large misfit imposed on the narrow room by the scale and mass of its furniture The objects the ornaments were for the sisters clearly relics and survivals of what would in the case of missus Condrip at least have been called better days The curtains that overdraped the windows the sofas and tables that stayed circulation the chimney ornaments that reached to the ceiling and the florid chandelier that almost dropped to the floor were so many mementoes of earlier homes and so many links with their unhappy mother Whatever might have been in itself the quality of these elements Densher could feel the effect proceeding from them as they lumpishly blocked out the decline of the dim day to be ugly almost to the point of the sinister They failed to accommodate or to compromise they asserted their differences without tact and without taste It was truly having a sense of Kate s own quality thus promptly to see them in reference to it But that Densher had this sense was no new thing to him nor did he in strictness need for the hour to be reminded of it He only knew by one of the tricks his imagination so constantly played him that he was so far as her present tension went very specially sorry for her which was not the view that had determined his start in the morning yet also that he himself would have taken it all as he might say less hard HE could have lived in such a place but it wasn t given to those of his complexion so to speak to be exiled anywhere It was by their comparative grossness that they could somehow make shift His natural his inevitable his ultimate home left that is to itself wasn t at all unlikely to be as queer and impossible as what was just round them though doubtless in less ample masses As he took in moreover how Kate wouldn t have been in the least the creature she was if what was just round them hadn t mismatched her hadn t made for her a medium involving compunction in the spectator so by the same stroke that became the very fact of her relation with her companions there such a fact as filled him at once oddly both with assurance and with suspense If he himself on this brief vision felt her as alien and as ever so unwittingly ironic how must they not feel her and how above all must she not feel them Densher could ask himself that even after she had presently lighted the tall candles on the mantel shelf This was all their illumination but the fire and she had proceeded to it with a quiet dryness that yet left play visibly to her implication between them in their trouble and failing anything better of the presumably genial Christmas hearth So far as the genial went this had in strictness given their conditions to be all their geniality He had told her in his note nothing but that he must promptly see her and that he hoped she might be able to make it possible but he understood from the first look at her that his promptitude was already having for her its principal reference I was prevented this morning in the few minutes he explained asking missus Lowder if she had let you know though I rather gathered she had and it s what I ve been in fact since then assuming It was because I was so struck at the moment with your having as she did tell me so suddenly come here Yes it was sudden enough Very neat and fine in the contracted firelight with her hands in her lap Kate considered what he had said He had spoken immediately of what had happened at Sir Luke Strett s door She has let me know nothing But that doesn t matter if it s what YOU mean It s part of what I mean Densher said but what he went on with after a pause during which she waited was apparently not the rest of that She had had her telegram from missus Stringham late last night But to me the poor lady hasn t wired The event he added will have taken place yesterday and Sir Luke starting immediately one can see and travelling straight will get back tomorrow morning So that missus Stringham I judge is left to face in some solitude the situation bequeathed to her But of course he wound up Sir Luke couldn t stay Her look at him might have had in it a vague betrayal of the sense that he was gaining time Was your telegram from Sir Luke No I ve had no telegram She wondered But not a letter Not from missus Stringham no He failed again however to develop this for which her forbearance from another question gave him occasion From whom then had he heard He might at last confronted with her really have been gaining time and as if to show that she respected this impulse she made her enquiry different Should you like to go out to her to missus Stringham About that at least he was clear Not at all She s alone but she s very capable and very courageous Besides He had been going on but he dropped Besides she said there s Eugenio Yes of course one remembers Eugenio She had uttered the words as definitely to show them for not untender and he showed equally every reason to assent One remembers him indeed and with every ground for it He ll be of the highest value to her he s capable of anything What I was going to say he went on is that some of their people from America must quickly arrive On this as happened Kate was able at once to satisfy him mister Someone or other the person principally in charge of Milly s affairs her first trustee I suppose had just got there at missus Stringham s last writing Ah that then was after your aunt last spoke to me I mean the last time before this morning I m relieved to hear it So he said they ll do Oh they ll do And it came from each still as if it wasn t what each was most thinking of Kate presently got however a step nearer to that But if you had been wired to by nobody what then this morning had taken you to Sir Luke Oh something else which I ll presently tell you It s what made me instantly need to see you it s what I ve come to speak to you of But in a minute I feel too many things he went on at seeing you in this place He got up as he spoke she herself remained perfectly still His movement had been to the fire and leaning a little with his back to it to look down on her from where he stood he confined himself to his point Is it anything very bad that has brought you He had now in any case said enough to justify her wish for more so that passing this matter by she pressed her own challenge Do you mean if I may ask that SHE dying Her face wondering pressed it more than her words Certainly you may ask he after a moment said What has come to me is what as I say I came expressly to tell you I don t mind letting you know he went on that my decision to do this took for me last night and this morning a great deal of thinking of But here I am And he indulged in a smile that couldn t he was well aware but strike her as mechanical She went straighter with him she seemed to show than he really went with her You didn t want to come It would have been simple my dear and he continued to smile if it had been one way or the other only a question of wanting It took I admit it the idea of what I had best do all sorts of difficult and portentous forms It came up for me really well not at all for my happiness This word apparently puzzled her she studied him in the light of it You look upset you ve certainly been tormented You re not well Oh well enough But she continued without heeding You hate what you re doing My dear girl you simplify and he was now serious enough It isn t so simple even as that She had the air of thinking what it then might be I of course can t with no clue know what it is She remained none the less patient and still If at such a moment she could write you one s inevitably quite at sea One doesn t with the best will in the world understand And then as Densher had a pause which might have stood for all the involved explanation that to his discouragement loomed before him You HAVEN T decided what to do She had said it very gently almost sweetly and he didn t instantly say otherwise But he said so after a look at her Oh yes I have Only with this sight of you here and what I seem to see in it for you And his eyes as at suggestions that pressed turned from one part of the room to another Horrible place isn t it said Kate It brought him straight back to his enquiry Is it for anything awful you ve had to come Oh that will take as long to tell you as anything YOU may have Don t mind she continued the sight of me here nor whatever which is more than I yet know myself may be in it for me And kindly consider too that after all if you re in trouble I can a little wish to help you Perhaps I can absolutely even do it My dear child it s just because of the sense of your wish I suppose I m in trouble I suppose that s it He said this with so odd a suddenness of simplicity that she could only stare for it which he as promptly saw So he turned off as he could his vagueness And yet I oughtn t to be Which sounded indeed vaguer still She waited a moment Is it as you say for my own business anything very awful Well he slowly replied you ll tell me if you find it so I mean if you find my idea He was so slow that she took him up Awful A sound of impatience the form of a laugh at last escaped her I can t find it anything at all till I know what you re talking about It brought him then more to the point though it did so at first but by making him on the hearthrug before her with his hands in his pockets turn awhile to and fro There rose in him even with this movement a recall of another time the hour in Venice the hour of gloom and storm when Susan Shepherd had sat in his quarters there very much as Kate was sitting now and he had wondered in pain even as now what he might say and mightn t Yet the present occasion after all was somehow the easier He tried at any rate to attach that feeling to it while he stopped before his companion The communication I speak of can t possibly belong so far as its date is concerned to these last days The postmark which is legible does but it isn t thinkable for anything else that she wrote He dropped looking at her as if she d understand It was easy to understand On her deathbed But Kate took an instant s thought Aren t we agreed that there was never any one in the world like her Yes And looking over her head he spoke clearly enough There was never any one in the world like her Kate from her chair always without a movement raised her eyes to the unconscious reach of his own Then when the latter again dropped to her she added a question And won t it further depend a little on what the communication is A little perhaps but not much It s a communication said Densher Do you mean a letter Yes a letter Addressed to me in her hand in hers unmistakeably Kate thought Do you know her hand very well Oh perfectly It was as if his tone for this prompted with a slight strangeness her next demand Have you had many letters from her No Only three notes He spoke looking straight at her And very very short ones Ah said Kate the number doesn t matter Three lines would be enough if you re sure you remember I m sure I remember Besides Densher continued I ve seen her hand in other ways I seem to recall how you once before she went to Venice showed me one of her notes precisely FOR that And then she once copied me something Oh said Kate almost with a smile I don t ask you for the detail of your reasons One good one s enough To which however she added as if precisely not to speak with impatience or with anything like irony And the writing has its usual look Densher answered as if even to better that description of it It s beautiful Yes it WAS beautiful Well Kate to defer to him still further remarked it s not news to us now that she was stupendous Anything s possible Yes anything s possible he appeared oddly to catch at it That s what I say to myself It s what I ve been believing you he a trifle vaguely explained still more certain to feel She waited for him to say more but he only with his hands in his pockets turned again away going this time to the single window of the room where in the absence of lamplight the blind hadn t been drawn He looked out into the lamplit fog lost himself in the small sordid London street for sordid with his other association he felt it as he had lost himself with missus Stringham s eyes on him in the vista of the Grand Canal It was present then to his recording consciousness that when he had last been driven to such an attitude the very depth of his resistance to the opportunity to give Kate away was what had so driven him His waiting companion had on that occasion waited for him to say he WOULD and what he had meantime glowered forth at was the inanity of such a hope Kate s attention on her side during these minutes rested on the back and shoulders he thus familiarly presented rested as with a view of their expression a reference to things unimparted links still missing and that she must ever miss try to make them out as she would The result of her tension was that she again took him up You received what you spoke of last night It made him turn round Coming in from Fleet Street earlier by an hour than usual I found it with some other letters on my table But my eyes went straight to it in an extraordinary way from the door I recognised it knew what it was without touching it One can understand She listened with respect His tone however was so singular that she presently added You speak as if all this while you HADN T touched it Oh yes I ve touched it I feel as if ever since I d been touching nothing else I quite firmly he pursued as if to be plainer took hold of it Then where is it Oh I have it here And you ve brought it to show me I ve brought it to show you So he said with a distinctness that had among his other oddities almost a sound of cheer yet making no movement that matched his words She could accordingly but offer again her expectant face while his own to her impatience seemed perversely to fill with another thought But now that you ve done so you feel you don t want to I want to immensely he said Only you tell me nothing She smiled at him with this finally as if he were an unreasonable child It seems to me I tell you quite as much as you tell me You haven t yet even told me how it is that such explanations as you require don t come from your document itself Then as he answered nothing she had a flash You mean you haven t read it I haven t read it She stared Then how am I to help you with it Again leaving her while she never budged he paced five strides and again he was before her By telling me THIS It s something you know that you wouldn t tell me the other day She was vague The other day The first time after my return the Sunday I came to you What s he doing Densher went on at that hour of the morning with her What does his having been with her there mean Of whom are you talking Of that man Lord Mark of course What does it represent Oh with Aunt Maud Yes my dear and with you It comes more or less to the same thing and it s what you didn t tell me the other day when I put you the question Kate tried to remember the other day You asked me nothing about any hour I asked you when it was you last saw him previous I mean to his second descent at Venice You wouldn t say and as we were talking of a matter comparatively more important I let it pass But the fact remains you know my dear that you haven t told me Two things in this speech appeared to have reached Kate more distinctly than the others I wouldn t say and you let it pass She looked just coldly blank You really speak as if I were keeping something back Well you see Densher persisted you re not even telling me now All I want to know he nevertheless explained is whether there was a connexion between that proceeding on his part which was practically oh beyond all doubt the shock precipitating for her what has now happened and anything that had occurred with him previously for yourself How in the world did he know we re engaged Book Tenth Chapter five Kate slowly rose it was since she had lighted the candles and sat down the first movement she had made Are you trying to fix it on me that I must have told him She spoke not so much in resentment as in pale dismay which he showed he immediately took in My dear child I m not trying to fix anything but I m extremely tormented and I seem not to understand What has the brute to do with us anyway What has he indeed Kate asked She shook her head as if in recovery within the minute of some mild allowance for his unreason There was in it and for his reason really one of those half inconsequent sweetnesses by which she had often before made over some point of difference her own terms with him Practically she was making them now and essentially he was knowing it yet inevitably all the same he was accepting it She stood there close to him with something in her patience that suggested her having supposed when he spoke more appealingly that he was going to kiss her He hadn t been it appeared but his continued appeal was none the less the quieter What s he doing from ten o clock on Christmas morning with missus Lowder Kate looked surprised Didn t she tell you he s staying there At Lancaster Gate Densher s surprise met it Staying since when Since day before yesterday He was there before I came away And then she explained confessing it in fact anomalous It s an accident like Aunt Maud s having herself remained in town for Christmas but it isn t after all so monstrous WE stayed and with my having come here she s sorry now because we neither of us waiting from day to day for the news you brought seemed to want to be with a lot of people You stayed for thinking of Venice Of course we did For what else And even a little Kate wonderfully added it s true at least of Aunt Maud for thinking of you He appreciated I see Nice of you every way But whom he enquired has Lord Mark stayed for thinking of His being in London I believe is a very commonplace matter He has some rooms which he has had suddenly some rather advantageous chance to let such as with his confessed his decidedly proclaimed want of money he hasn t had it in him in spite of everything not to jump at Densher s attention was entire In spite of everything In spite of what Well I don t know In spite say of his being scarcely supposed to do that sort of thing To try to get money To try at any rate in little thrifty ways Apparently however he has had for some reason to do what he can He turned at a couple of days notice out of his place making it over to his tenant and Aunt Maud who s deeply in his confidence about all such matters said Come then to Lancaster Gate to sleep at least till like all the world you go to the country He was to have gone to the country I think to Matcham yesterday afternoon Aunt Maud that is told me he was Kate had been somehow for her companion through this statement beautifully quite soothingly suggestive Told you you mean so that you needn t leave the house Yes so far as she had taken it into her head that his being there was part of my reason And WAS it part of your reason A little if you like Yet there s plenty here as I knew there would be without it So that she said candidly doesn t matter I m glad I am here even if for all the good I do She implied however that that didn t matter either He didn t as you tell me get off then to Matcham though he may possibly if it IS possible be going this afternoon But what strikes me as most probable and it s really I m bound to say quite amiable of him is that he has declined to leave Aunt Maud as I ve been so ready to do to spend her Christmas alone If moreover he has given up Matcham for her it s a procede that won t please her less It s small wonder therefore that she insists on a dull day in driving him about I don t pretend to know she wound up what may happen between them but that s all I see in it You see in everything and you always did Densher returned something that while I m with you at least I always take from you as the truth itself She looked at him as if consciously and even carefully extracting the sting of his reservation then she spoke with a quiet gravity that seemed to show how fine she found it Thank you It had for him like everything else its effect They were still closely face to face and yielding to the impulse to which he hadn t yielded just before he laid his hands on her shoulders held her hard a minute and shook her a little far from untenderly as if in expression of more mingled things all difficult than he could speak Then bending his head he applied his lips to her cheek He fell after this away for an instant resuming his unrest while she kept the position in which all passive and as a statue she had taken his demonstration It didn t prevent her however from offering him as if what she had had was enough for the moment a further indulgence She made a quiet lucid connexion and as she made it sat down again I ve been trying to place exactly as to its date something that did happen to me while you were in Venice I mean a talk with him He spoke to me spoke out Ah there you are said Densher who had wheeled round Well if I m there as you so gracefully call it by having refused to meet him as he wanted as he pressed I plead guilty to being so Would you have liked me she went on to give him an answer that would have kept him from going It made him a little awkwardly think Did you know he was going Never for a moment but I m afraid that even if it doesn t fit your strange suppositions I should have given him just the same answer if I had known If it s a matter I haven t since your return thrust upon you that s simply because it s not a matter in the memory of which I find a particular joy I hope that if I ve satisfied you about it she continued it s not too much to ask of you to let it rest Certainly said Densher kindly I ll let it rest But the next moment he pursued He saw something He guessed If you mean she presently returned that he was unfortunately the one person we hadn t deceived I can t contradict you No of course not But WHY Densher still risked was he unfortunately the one person He s not really a bit intelligent Intelligent enough apparently to have seen a mystery a riddle in anything so unnatural as all things considered and when it came to the point my attitude So he gouged out his conviction and on his conviction he acted Densher seemed for a little to look at Lord Mark s conviction as if it were a blot on the face of nature Do you mean because you had appeared to him to have encouraged him Of course I had been decent to him Otherwise where WERE we Where You and I What I appeared to him however hadn t mattered What mattered was how I appeared to Aunt Maud Besides you must remember that he has had all along his impression of YOU You can t help it she said but you re after all well yourself As much myself as you please But when I took myself to Venice and kept myself there what Densher asked did he make of that Your being in Venice and liking to be which is never on any one s part a monstrosity was explicable for him in other ways He was quite capable moreover of seeing it as dissimulation In spite of missus Lowder No said Kate not in spite of missus Lowder now Aunt Maud before what you call his second descent hadn t convinced him all the more that my refusal of him didn t help But he came back convinced And then as her companion still showed a face at a loss I mean after he had seen Milly spoken to her and left her Milly convinced him Milly Densher again but vaguely echoed That you were sincere That it was HER you loved It came to him from her in such a way that he instantly once more turned found himself yet again at his window Aunt Maud on his return here she meanwhile continued had it from him And that s why you re now so well with Aunt Maud He only for a minute looked out in silence after which he came away And why YOU are It was almost in its extremely affirmative effect between them the note of recrimination or it would have been perhaps rather if it hadn t been so much more the note of truth It was sharp because it was true but its truth appeared to impose it as an argument so conclusive as to permit on neither side a sequel That made while they faced each other over it without speech the gravity of everything It was as if there were almost danger which the wrong word might start Densher accordingly at last acted to better purpose he drew standing there before her a pocket book from the breast of his waistcoat and he drew from the pocket book a folded letter to which her eyes attached themselves He restored then the receptacle to its place and with a movement not the less odd for being visibly instinctive and unconscious carried the hand containing his letter behind him What he thus finally spoke of was a different matter Did I understand from missus Lowder that your father s in the house If it never had taken her long in such excursions to meet him it was not to take her so now In the house yes But we needn t fear his interruption she spoke as if he had thought of that He s in bed Do you mean with illness She sadly shook her head Father s never ill He s a marvel He s only endless Densher thought Can I in any way help you with him Yes She perfectly wearily almost serenely had it all By our making your visit as little of an affair as possible for him and for Marian too I see They hate so your seeing me Yet I couldn t could I not have come No you couldn t not have come But I can only on the other hand go as soon as possible Quickly it almost upset her Ah don t to day put ugly words into my mouth I ve enough of my trouble without it I know I know He spoke in instant pleading It s all only that I m as troubled FOR you When did he come Three days ago after he hadn t been near her for more than a year after he had apparently and not regrettably ceased to remember her existence and in a state which made it impossible not to take him in Densher hesitated Do you mean in such want No not of food of necessary things not even so far as his appearance went of money He looked as wonderful as ever But he was well in terror In terror of what I don t know Of somebody of something He wants he says to be quiet But his quietness is awful She suffered but he couldn t not question What does he do It made Kate herself hesitate He cries Again for a moment he hung fire but he risked it What HAS he done It made her slowly rise and they were once more fully face to face Her eyes held his own and she was paler than she had been If you love me now don t ask me about father He waited again a moment I love you It s because I love you that I m here It s because I love you that I ve brought you this And he drew from behind him the letter that had remained in his hand But her eyes only though he held it out met the offer Why you ve not broken the seal If I had broken the seal exactly I should know what s within It s for YOU to break the seal that I bring it She looked still not touching the thing inordinately grave To break the seal of something to you from HER Ah precisely because it s from her I ll abide by whatever you think of it I don t understand said Kate What do you yourself think And then as he didn t answer It seems to me I think you know You have your instinct You don t need to read It s the proof Densher faced her words as if they had been an accusation an accusation for which he was prepared and which there was but one way to face I have indeed my instinct It came to me while I worried it out last night It came to me as an effect of the hour He held up his letter and seemed now to insist more than to confess This thing had been timed For Christmas Eve For Christmas Eve Kate had suddenly a strange smile The season of gifts After which as he said nothing she went on And had been written you mean while she could write and kept to BE so timed Only meeting her eyes while he thought he again didn t reply What do YOU mean by the proof Why of the beauty with which you ve been loved But I won t she said break your seal You positively decline Positively Never To which she added oddly I know without He had another pause And what is it you know That she announces to you she has made you rich His pause this time was longer Left me her fortune Not all of it no doubt for it s immense But money to a large amount I don t care Kate went on to know how much And her strange smile recurred I trust her Did she tell you Densher asked Never Kate visibly flushed at the thought That wouldn t on my part have been playing fair with her And I did she added play fair Densher who had believed her he couldn t help it continued holding his letter to face her He was much quieter now as if his torment had somehow passed You played fair with me Kate and that s why since we talk of proofs I want to give YOU one I ve wanted to let you see and in preference even to myself something I feel as sacred She frowned a little I don t understand I ve asked myself for a tribute for a sacrifice by which I can peculiarly recognise Peculiarly recognise what she demanded as he dropped The admirable nature of your own sacrifice You were capable in Venice of an act of splendid generosity And the privilege you offer me with that document is my reward He made a movement It s all I can do as a symbol of my attitude She looked at him long Your attitude my dear is that you re afraid of yourself You ve had to take yourself in hand You ve had to do yourself violence So it is then you meet me She bent her eyes hard a moment to the letter from which her hand still stayed itself You absolutely DESIRE me to take it I absolutely desire you to take it To do what I like with it Short of course of making known its terms It must remain pardon my making the point between you and me She had a last hesitation but she presently broke it Trust me Taking from him the sacred script she held it a little while her eyes again rested on those fine characters of Milly s that they had shortly before discussed To hold it she brought out is to know Oh I KNOW said Merton Densher Well then if we both do She had already turned to the fire nearer to which she had moved and with a quick gesture had jerked the thing into the flame He started but only half as to undo her action his arrest was as prompt as the latter had been decisive He only watched with her the paper burn after which their eyes again met You ll have it all Kate said from New York Book Tenth Chapter six It was after he had in fact two months later heard from New York that she paid him a visit one morning at his own quarters coming not as she had come in Venice under his extreme solicitation but as a need recognised in the first instance by herself even though also as the prompt result of a missive delivered to her This had consisted of a note from Densher accompanying a letter just to hand addressed him by an eminent American legal firm a firm of whose high character he had become conscious while in New York as of a thing in the air itself and whose head and front the principal executor of Milly Theale s copious will had been duly identified at Lancaster Gate as the gentleman hurrying out by the straight southern course before the girl s death to the support of missus Stringham Densher s act on receipt of the document in question an act as to which and to the bearings of which his resolve had had time to mature constituted in strictness singularly enough the first reference to Milly or to what Milly might or might not have done that had passed between our pair since they had stood together watching the destruction in the little vulgar grate at Chelsea of the undisclosed work of her hand They had at the time and in due deference now on his part to Kate s mention of her responsibility for his call immediately separated and when they met again the subject was made present to them at all events till some flare of new light only by the intensity with which it mutely expressed its absence They were not moreover in these weeks to meet often in spite of the fact that this had during January and a part of February actually become for them a comparatively easy matter Kate s stay at missus Condrip s prolonged itself under allowances from her aunt which would have been a mystery to Densher had he not been admitted at Lancaster Gate really in spite of himself to the esoteric view of them It s her idea missus Lowder had there said to him as if she really despised ideas which she didn t and I ve taken up with my own which is to give her her head till she has had enough of it She HAS had enough of it she had that soon enough but as she s as proud as the deuce she ll come back when she has found some reason having nothing in common with her disgust of which she can make a show She calls it her holiday which she s spending in her own way the holiday to which once a year or so as she says the very maids in the scullery have a right So we re taking it on that basis But we shall not soon I think take another of the same sort Besides she s quite decent she comes often whenever I make her a sign and she has been good on the whole this year or two so that to be decent myself I don t complain She has really been poor dear very much what one hoped though I needn t you know Aunt Maud wound up tell YOU after all you clever creature what that was It had been partly in truth to keep down the opportunity for this that Densher s appearances under the good lady s roof markedly after Christmas interspaced themselves The phase of his situation that on his return from Venice had made them for a short time almost frequent was at present quite obscured and with it the impulse that had then acted Another phase had taken its place which he would have been painfully at a loss as yet to name or otherwise set on its feet but of which the steadily rising tide left missus Lowder for his desire quite high and dry There had been a moment when it seemed possible that missus Stringham returning to America under convoy would pause in London on her way and be housed with her old friend in which case he was prepared for some apparent zeal of attendance But this danger passed he had felt it a danger and the person in the world whom he would just now have most valued seeing on his own terms sailed away westward from Genoa He thereby only wrote to her having broken in this respect after Milly s death the silence as to the sense of which before that event their agreement had been so deep She had answered him from Venice twice and had had time to answer him twice again from New York The last letter of her four had come by the same post as the document he sent on to Kate but he hadn t gone into the question of also enclosing that His correspondence with Milly s companion was somehow already presenting itself to him as a feature as a factor he would have said in his newspaper of the time whatever it might be long or short in store for him but one of his acutest current thoughts was apt to be devoted to his not having yet mentioned it to Kate She had put him no question no Don t you ever hear so that he hadn t been brought to the point This he described to himself as a mercy for he liked his secret It was as a secret that in the same personal privacy he described his transatlantic commerce scarce even wincing while he recognised it as the one connexion in which he wasn t straight He had in fact for this connexion a vivid mental image he saw it as a small emergent rock in the waste of waters the bottomless grey expanse of straightness The fact that he had on several recent occasions taken with Kate an out of the way walk that was each time to define itself as more remarkable for what they didn t say than for what they did this fact failed somehow to mitigate for him a strange consciousness of exposure There was something deep within him that he had absolutely shown to no one to the companion of these walks in particular not a bit more than he could help but he was none the less haunted under its shadow with a dire apprehension of publicity It was as if he had invoked that ugliness in some stupid good faith and it was queer enough that on his emergent rock clinging to it and to Susan Shepherd he should figure himself as hidden from view That represented no doubt his belief in her power or in her delicate disposition to protect him Only Kate at all events knew what Kate did know and she was also the last person interested to tell it in spite of which it was as if his ACT so deeply associated with her and never to be recalled nor recovered was abroad on the winds of the world His honesty as he viewed it with Kate was the very element of that menace to the degree that he saw at moments as to their final impulse or their final remedy the need to bury in the dark blindness of each other s arms the knowledge of each other that they couldn t undo Save indeed that the sense in which it was in these days a question of arms was limited this might have been the intimate expedient to which they were actually resorting It had its value in conditions that made everything count that thrice over in Battersea Park where missus Lowder now never drove he had adopted the usual means in sequestered alleys of holding her close to his side She could make absences on her present footing without having too inordinately to account for them at home which was exactly what gave them for the first time an appreciable margin He supposed she could always say in Chelsea though he didn t press it that she had been across the town in decency for a look at her aunt whereas there had always been reasons at Lancaster Gate for her not being able to plead the look at her other relatives It was therefore between them a freedom of a purity as yet untasted which for that matter also they made in various ways no little show of cherishing as such They made the show indeed in every way but the way of a large use an inconsequence that they almost equally gave time to helping each other to regard as natural He put it to his companion that the kind of favour he now enjoyed at Lancaster Gate the wonderful warmth of his reception there cut in a manner the ground from under their feet He was too horribly trusted they had succeeded too well He couldn t in short make appointments with her without abusing Aunt Maud and he couldn t on the other hand haunt that lady without tying his hands Kate saw what he meant just as he saw what she did when she admitted that she was herself to a degree scarce less embarrassing in the enjoyment of Aunt Maud s confidence It was special at present she was handsomely used she confessed accordingly to a scruple about misapplying her licence missus Lowder then finally had found and all unconsciously now the way to baffle them It wasn t however that they didn t meet a little none the less in the southern quarter to point for their common benefit the moral of their defeat They crossed the river they wandered in neighbourhoods sordid and safe the winter was mild so that mounting to the top of trams they could rumble together to Clapham or to Greenwich If at the same time their minutes had never been so counted it struck Densher that by a singular law their tone he scarce knew what to call it had never been so bland Not to talk of what they MIGHT have talked of drove them to other ground it was as if they used a perverse insistence to make up what they ignored They concealed their pursuit of the irrelevant by the charm of their manner they took precautions for the courtesy they had formerly left to come of itself often when he had quitted her he stopped short walking off with the aftersense of their change He would have described their change had he so far faced it as to describe it by their being so damned civil That had even with the intimate the familiar at the point to which they had brought them a touch almost of the droll What danger had there ever been of their becoming rude after each had long since made the other so tremendously tender Such were the things he asked himself when he wondered what in particular he most feared Yet all the while too the tension had its charm such being the interest of a creature who could bring one back to her by such different roads It was her talent for life again which found in her a difference for the differing time She didn t give their tradition up she but made of it something new Frankly moreover she had never been more agreeable nor in a way to put it prosaically better company he felt almost as if he were knowing her on that defined basis which he even hesitated whether to measure as reduced or as extended as if at all events he were admiring her as she was probably admired by people she met out He hadn t in fine reckoned that she would still have something fresh for him yet this was what she had that on the top of a tram in the Borough he felt as if he were next her at dinner What a person she would be if they HAD been rich with what a genius for the so called great life what a presence for the so called great house what a grace for the so called great positions He might regret at once while he was about it that they weren t princes or billionaires She had treated him on their Christmas to a softness that had struck him at the time as of the quality of fine velvet meant to fold thick but stretched a little thin at present however she gave him the impression of a contact multitudinous as only the superficial can be She had throughout never a word for what went on at home She came out of that and she returned to it but her nearest reference was the look with which each time she bade him good bye The look was her repeated prohibition It s what I HAVE to see and to know so don t touch it That but wakes up the old evil which I keep still in my way by sitting by it I go now leave me alone to sit by it again The way to pity me if that s what you want is to believe in me If we could really DO anything it would be another matter He watched her when she went her way with the vision of what she thus a little stiffly carried It was confused and obscure but how with her head high it made her hold herself He really in his own person might at these moments have been swaying a little aloft as one of the objects in her poised basket It was doubtless thanks to some such consciousness as this that he felt the lapse of the weeks before the day of Kate s mounting of his stair almost swingingly rapid They contained for him the contradiction that whereas periods of waiting are supposed in general to keep the time slow it was the wait actually that made the pace trouble him The secret of that anomaly to be plain was that he was aware of how while the days melted something rare went with them This something was only a thought but a thought precisely of such freshness and such delicacy as made the precious of whatever sort most subject to the hunger of time The thought was all his own and his intimate companion was the last person he might have shared it with He kept it back like a favourite pang left it behind him so to say when he went out but came home again the sooner for the certainty of finding it there Then he took it out of its sacred corner and its soft wrappings he undid them one by one handling them handling IT as a father baffled and tender might handle a maimed child But so it was before him in his dread of who else might see it Then he took to himself at such hours in other words that he should never never know what had been in Milly s letter The intention announced in it he should but too probably know only that would have been but for the depths of his spirit the least part of it The part of it missed for ever was the turn she would have given her act This turn had possibilities that somehow by wondering about them his imagination had extraordinarily filled out and refined It had made of them a revelation the loss of which was like the sight of a priceless pearl cast before his eyes his pledge given not to save it into the fathomless sea or rather even it was like the sacrifice of something sentient and throbbing something that for the spiritual ear might have been audible as a faint far wail This was the sound he cherished when alone in the stillness of his rooms He sought and guarded the stillness so that it might prevail there till the inevitable sounds of life once more comparatively coarse and harsh should smother and deaden it doubtless by the same process with which they would officiously heal the ache in his soul that was somehow one with it It moreover deepened the sacred hush that he couldn t complain He had given poor Kate her freedom The great and obvious thing as soon as she stood there on the occasion we have already named was that she was now in high possession of it This would have marked immediately the difference had there been nothing else to do it between their actual terms and their other terms the character of their last encounter in Venice That had been HIS idea whereas her present step was her own the few marks they had in common were from the first moment to his conscious vision almost pathetically plain She was as grave now as before she looked around her to hide it as before she pretended as before in an air in which her words at the moment itself fell flat to an interest in the place and a curiosity about his things there was a recall in the way in which after she had failed a little to push up her veil symmetrically and he had said she had better take it off altogether she had acceded to his suggestion before the glass It was just these things that were vain and what was real was that his fancy figured her after the first few minutes as literally now providing the element of reassurance which had previously been his care It was she supremely who had the presence of mind She made indeed for that matter very prompt use of it You see I ve not hesitated this time to break your seal She had laid on the table from the moment of her coming in the long envelope substantially filled which he had sent her enclosed in another of still ampler make He had however not looked at it his belief being that he wished never again to do so besides which it had happened to rest with its addressed side up So he saw nothing and it was only into her eyes that her remark made him look declining any approach to the object indicated It s not my seal my dear and my intention which my note tried to express was all to treat it to you as not mine Do you mean that it s to that extent mine then Well let us call it if we like theirs that of the good people in New York the authors of our communication If the seal is broken well and good but we MIGHT you know he presently added have sent it back to them intact and inviolate Only accompanied he smiled with his heart in his mouth by an absolutely kind letter Kate took it with the mere brave blink with which a patient of courage signifies to the exploring medical hand that the tender place is touched He saw on the spot that she was prepared and with this signal sign that she was too intelligent not to be came a flicker of possibilities She was merely to put it at that intelligent enough for anything Is it what you re proposing we SHOULD do Ah it s too late to do it well ideally Now with that sign that we KNOW But you don t know she said very gently I refer he went on without noticing it to what would have been the handsome way Its being dispatched again with no cognisance taken but one s assurance of the highest consideration and the proof of this in the state of the envelope THAT would have been really satisfying She thought an instant The state of the envelope proving refusal you mean not to be based on the insufficiency of the sum Densher smiled again as for the play however whimsical of her humour Well yes something of that sort So that if cognisance HAS been taken so far as I m concerned it spoils the beauty It makes the difference that I m disappointed in the hope which I confess I entertained that you d bring the thing back to me as you had received it You didn t express that hope in your letter I didn t want to I wanted to leave it to yourself I wanted oh yes if that s what you wish to ask me to see what you d do You wanted to measure the possibilities of my departure from delicacy He continued steady now a kind of ease from the presence as in the air of something he couldn t yet have named had come to him Well I wanted in so good a case to test you She was struck it showed in her face by his expression It IS a good case I doubt whether a better she said with her eyes on him has ever been known The better the case then the better the test How do you know she asked in reply to this what I m capable of I don t my dear Only with the seal unbroken I should have known sooner I see she took it in But I myself shouldn t have known at all And you wouldn t have known either what I do know Let me tell you at once he returned that if you ve been moved to correct my ignorance I very particularly request you not to She just hesitated Are you afraid of the effect of the corrections Can you only do it by doing it blindly He waited a moment What is it that you speak of my doing Why the only thing in the world that I take you as thinking of Not accepting what she has done Isn t there some regular name in such cases Not taking up the bequest There s something you forget in it he said after a moment My asking you to join with me in doing so Her wonder but made her softer yet at the same time didn t make her less firm How can I join in a matter with which I ve nothing to do How By a single word And what word Your consent to my giving up My consent has no meaning when I can t prevent you You can perfectly prevent me Understand that well he said She seemed to face a threat in it You mean you won t give up if I DON T consent Yes I do nothing That as I understand is accepting Densher paused I do nothing formal You won t I suppose you mean touch the money I won t touch the money It had a sound though he had been coming to it that made for gravity Who then in such an event WILL Any one who wants or who can Again a little she said nothing she might say too much But by the time she spoke he had covered ground How can I touch it but THROUGH you You can t Any more he added than I can renounce it except through you Oh ever so much less There s nothing she explained in my power I m in your power Merton Densher said In what way In the way I show and the way I ve always shown When have I shown he asked as with a sudden cold impatience anything else You surely must feel so that you needn t wish to appear to spare me in it how you have me It s very good of you my dear she nervously laughed to put me so thoroughly up to it I put you up to nothing I didn t even put you up to the chance that as I said a few moments ago I saw for you in forwarding that thing Your liberty is therefore in every way complete It had come to the point really that they showed each other pale faces and that all the unspoken between them looked out of their eyes in a dim terror of their further conflict Something even rose between them in one of their short silences something that was like an appeal from each to the other not to be too true Their necessity was somehow before them but which of them must meet it first Thank you Kate said for his word about her freedom but taking for the minute no further action on it It was blest at least that all ironies failed them and during another slow moment their very sense of it cleared the air There was an effect of this in the way he soon went on You must intensely feel that it s the thing for which we worked together She took up the remark however no more than if it were commonplace she was already again occupied with a point of her own Is it absolutely true for if it is you know it s tremendously interesting that you haven t so much as a curiosity about what she has done for you Would you like he asked my formal oath on it No but I don t understand It seems to me in your place Ah he couldn t help breaking in what do you know of my place Pardon me he at once added my preference is the one I express She had in an instant nevertheless a curious thought But won t the facts be published Published he winced I mean won t you see them in the papers Ah never I shall know how to escape that It seemed to settle the subject but she had the next minute another insistence Your desire is to escape everything Everything And do you need no more definite sense of what it is you ask me to help you to renounce My sense is sufficient without being definite I m willing to believe that the amount of money s not small Ah there you are she exclaimed If she was to leave me a remembrance he quietly pursued it would inevitably not be meagre Kate waited as for how to say it It s worthy of her It s what she was herself if you remember what we once said THAT was He hesitated as if there had been many things But he remembered one of them Stupendous Stupendous A faint smile for it ever so small had flickered in her face but had vanished before the omen of tears a little less uncertain had shown themselves in his own His eyes filled but that made her continue She continued gently I think that what it really is must be that you re afraid I mean she explained that you re afraid of ALL the truth If you re in love with her without it what indeed can you be more And you re afraid it s wonderful to be in love with her I never was in love with her said Densher She took it but after a little she met it I believe that now for the time she lived I believe it at least for the time you were there But your change came as it might well the day you last saw her she died for you then that you might understand her From that hour you DID With which Kate slowly rose And I do now She did it FOR us Densher rose to face her and she went on with her thought I used to call her in my stupidity for want of anything better a dove Well she stretched out her wings and it was to THAT they reached They cover us They cover us Densher said That s what I give you Kate gravely wound up That s what I ve done for you His look at her had a slow strangeness that had dried on the moment his tears Do I understand then That I do consent She gravely shook her head No for I see You ll marry me without the money you won t marry me with it If I don t consent YOU don t You lose me He showed though naming it frankly a sort of awe of her high grasp Well you lose nothing else I make over to you every penny Prompt was his own clearness but she had no smile this time to spare Precisely so that I must choose You must choose Strange it was for him then that she stood in his own rooms doing it while with an intensity now beyond any that had ever made his breath come slow he waited for her act There s but one thing that can save you from my choice From your choice of my surrender to you Yes and she gave a nod at the long envelope on the table your surrender of that What is it then Your word of honour that you re not in love with her memory Oh her memory Ah she made a high gesture don t speak of it as if you couldn t be I could in your place and you re one for whom it will do Her memory s your love You WANT no other He heard her out in stillness watching her face but not moving Then he only said I ll marry you mind you in an hour As we were As we were But she turned to the door and her headshake was now the end We shall never be again as we were THE END pre p img src pga australia jpg width
