none	none	How soon Half an houh mo suh I ll be back d rectly and help you off suh It s a flag station We don t stop there in winter thout we re called to suh Hotel s closed now Hotel Is there a hotel Thryng s voice betokened dismay Yes suh It s a right gay little place in summah suh He passed on and Thryng gathered his scattered effects Ill and weary he was glad to find his long journey so nearly at an end On either side of the track as far as eye could see was a snow whitened wilderness seemingly untouched by the hand of man and he felt as if he had been carried back two hundred years The only hint that these fastnesses had been invaded by human beings was an occasional rough deeply red wagon road winding off among the hills The long trestle crossed the engines labored slowly upward for a time then turning a sharp curve began to descend tearing along the narrow track with a speed that caused the coaches to rock and sway and thus they reached Carew s Crossing dropping down to it like a rushing torrent Immediately Thryng found himself deposited in the melting snow some distance from the station platform and at the same instant above the noise of the retreating train he heard a cry Oh suh help him help him It s poor little Hoyle The girl whom he had watched and about whom he had been wondering flashed by him and caught at the bridle of a fractious colt that was rearing and plunging near the corner of the station Poor little Hoyle Help him suh help him she cried clinging desperately while the frantic animal swung her off her feet close to the flying heels of the kicking mule at his side Under the heavy vehicle to which the ill assorted animals were attached a child lay unconscious and David sprang forward his weakness forgotten in the demand for action In an instant he had drawn the little chap from his perilous position and seizing the mule succeeded in backing him to his place The cause of its fright having by this time disappeared the colt became tractable and stood quivering and snorting as David took the bridle from the girl s hand I ll quiet them now he said and she ran to the boy who had recovered sufficiently to sit up and gaze in a dazed way about him As she bent over him murmuring soothing words he threw his arms around her neck and burst into wild sobbing There honey there No one is hurt You are not are you honey son I couldn t keep a holt of em he sobbed You shouldn t have done it honey You should have let me get home as best I could Her face was one which could express much passive as it had been before Where was Frale He took the othah ho se and lit out They was aftah him They S sh There hush You can stand now try Hoyle You are a man now The little fellow rose and perceiving Thryng for the first time stepped shyly behind his sister David noticed that he had a deformity which caused him to carry his head twisted stiffly to one side and also that he had great beautiful brown eyes so like those of a hunted fawn as he turned them upon the stranger with wide appeal that he seemed a veritable creature of the wilderness by which they were surrounded Then the girl stepped forward and thanked him with voice and eyes but he scarcely understood the words she said as her tones trailed lingeringly over the vowels and almost eliminated the r so lightly was it touched while her accent fell utterly strange upon his English ear She looked to the harness with practised eye and then laid her hand beside Thryng s on the bridle It was a strong shapely hand and wrist I can manage now she said Hoyle get my basket foh me But Thryng suggested that she climb in and take the reins first although the animals stood quietly enough now the mule looked even dejected with hanging head and forward drooping ears The girl spoke gently to the colt stroking him along the side and murmuring to him in a cooing voice as she mounted to the high seat and gathered up the reins Then the two beasts settled themselves to their places with a wontedness that assured Thryng they would be perfectly manageable under her hand David turned to the child relieved him of the basket which was heavy with unusual weight and would have lifted him up but Hoyle eluded his grasp and scrambling over the wheel with catlike agility slipped shyly into his place close to the girl s side Then with more than childlike thoughtfulness the boy looked up into her face and said in a low voice The general l man s things is ovah yandah by the track Cass He cyant tote em alone I reckon Whar is he goin Then Thryng remembered himself and his needs He looked at the line of track curving away up the mountain side in one direction and in the other lost in a deep cut in the hills at the steep red banks rising high on each side arched over by leafy forest growth with all the interlacing branches and smallest twigs bearing their delicate burden of white feathery snow He caught his breath as a sense of the strange untamed beauty marvellous and utterly lonely struck upon him Beyond the tracks high up on the mountain slope he thought he spied well nigh hid from sight by the pines the gambrel roof of a large building or was it a snow covered rock Is that a house up there he asked turning to the girl who sat leaning forward and looking steadily down at him That is the hotel A road must lead to it then If I could get up there I could send down for my things They is no one thar piped the boy and Thryng remembered the brakeman s words and how he had rebelled at the thought of a hotel incongruously set amid this primeval beauty but now he longed for the comfort of a warm room and tea at a hospitable table He wished he had accepted the bishop s invitation It was a predicament to be dropped in this wild spot without a store a cabin or even a thread of blue smoke to be seen as indicating a human habitation and no soul near save these two children The sun was sinking toward the western hilltops and a chillness began creeping about him as the shadows lengthened across the base of the mountain leaving only the heights in the glowing light Really you know I can t say what I am to do I m a stranger here It seemed odd to him at the moment but her face framed in the huge sunbonnet a delicate flower set in a rough calyx suddenly lost all expression She did not move nor open her lips Thryng thought he detected a look of fear in the boy s eyes as he crept closer to her In a flash came to him the realization of the difficulty His friend had told him of these people their occupations their fear of the world outside and below their fastnesses and how zealously they guarded their homes and their rights from outside intrusion yet how hospitable and generous they were to all who could not be considered their hereditary enemies He hastened to speak reassuring words and bethinking himself that she had called the boy Hoyle he explained how one Adam Hoyle had sent him The doctor is my friend you know He built a cabin somewhere within a day s walk he told me of Carew s Crossing on a mountain top Maybe you knew him A slight smile crept about the girl s lips and her eyes brightened Yes suh we all know Doctah Hoyle I am to have the cabin if I can find it live there as he did and see what your hills will do for me He laughed a little as he spoke deprecating his evident weakness and lifting his cap wiped the cold moisture from his forehead She noted his fatigue and hesitated The boy s questioning eyes were fixed on her face and she glanced down into them an answering look Her lips parted and her eyes glowed as she turned them again on David but she spoke still in the same passive monotone

none	none	My little brothah was named foh him Adam Hoyle but we only call him Hoyle It s a right long spell since the Doctah was heah His cabin is right nigh us a little highah up Theah is no place wheah you could stop nighah than ouahs Hoyle jump out and help fetch his things ovah You can put them in the back of the wagon suh and ride up with us I have a sight of room foh them The child was out and across the tracks in an instant seizing a valise much too heavy for him and Thryng cut his thanks short to go to his relief I kin tote it said the boy shrilly No no I am the biggest so I ll take the big ones You bring the bundle with the strap around it so Now we shall get on shan t we But you are pretty strong for a little chap and the child s face radiated smiles at the praise Then David tossed in valise and rug without which last no Englishman ever goes on a journey and with much effort they managed to pull the box along and hoist it also into the wagon the body of which was filled with corn fodder covered with an old patchwork quilt The wagon was of the rudest clumsiest construction the heavy box set on axles without springs but the young physician was thankful for any kind of a conveyance He had been used to life in the wild taking things as he found them bunking in a tent a board shanty or out under the open sky with men brought heterogeneously together some merely rough woodsmen in their natural environment others the scum of the cities to whom crime was become first nature decency second and others fleeing from justice and civilized law hiding ofttimes a fine nature delicately reared During this time he had seldom seen a woman other than an occasional camp follower of the most degraded sort Inured thus he did not find his ride embedded with good corn fodder much of a hardship even in a springless wagon over mountain roads Wrapped in his rug he braced himself against his box with his face toward the rear of the wagon and gazed out from under its arching canvas hood at the wild way as it slowly unrolled behind them and was pleased that he did not have to spend the night under the lee of the station The lingering sunlight made flaming banners of the snow clouds now slowly drifting across the sky above the white world and touched the highest peaks with rose and gold The shadows ever changing deepened from faintest pink mauve through heliotrope tints to the richest violet in the heart of the gorges Over and through all was the witching mystery of fairy like snow wreathed branches and twigs interwoven and arching up and up in faint perspective to the heights above and down far down to the depths of the regions below them and all the time mingled with the murmur of the voices behind him and the creaking of the vehicle in which they rode and the tramp of the animals when they came to a hard roadbed with rock foundation noises which were not loud but which seemed to be covered and subdued by the soft snow even as it covered everything could be heard a light dropping and pattering as the overladen last year s leaves and twigs dropped their white burden to the ground Sometimes the great hood of the wagon struck an overhanging bough and sent the snow down in showers as they passed Heavily they climbed up and warily made their descent of rocky steeps passing through boggy places or splashing in clear streams which issued from springs in the mountain side or fell from some distant height then climbing again only to wind about and again descend Often the way was rough with boulders that had never been blasted out sometimes steeply shelving where the gorge was deepest and the precipice sheerest Past all dangers the girl drove with skilful hand now encouraging her team with her low voice now restraining them where their load crowded upon them over slippery shelving rocks with strong pulls and sharp command David marvelled at her serenity under the strain and at her courage and deftness With the calmness of the boy nestling at her side he resigned himself to the sweet witchery of the time and place Glancing up at the high seat behind him he saw the child s feet dangling and knew they must be cold Why can t your little brother sit back here with me he said I ll cover him with my rug and we ll keep each other warm He saw the small hunched back stiffen and try to appear big and manly but she checked the team at a level dip in the road Yes sonny get ovah theah with the gentleman It ll be some coldah now the sun s gone But the little man was shyly reluctant to move Come honey Sistah d a heap rathah you would Then David reached up and gently lifted the atom of manhood of pride sensitiveness and affection over where he caused him to snuggle down in the fodder close to his side For a while the child sat stiffly aloof but gradually his little form relaxed and his head drooped sideways in the hollow of the stranger s shoulder held comfortably by Thryng s kindly encircling arm Soon with his small feet wrapped in the warm soft rug he slept soundly and sweetly rocked albeit rather roughly in the jolting wagon Thryng also dreamed but not in sleep His mind was stirred to unusual depths by his strange surroundings the silence the mystery the beauty of the night and the suggestions of grandeur and power dimly revealed by the moonlight which bathed the world in a flood of glory He was uplifted and drawn out of himself and at the same time he was thrown back to review his life and to see his most inward self and to marvel and question the wherefore of it all Why was he here away from the active practical affairs which interest other men Was he a creature of ideals only or was he also a practical man taking the wisest means of reaching and achieving results most worth while He saw himself in his childhood in his youth in his young manhood even to the present moment jogging slowly along in a far country rough and wild utterly dependent on the courtesy of a slight girl who held for the moment his life in her hands for often as he gazed into the void of darkness over narrow ledges he knew that only the skill of those two small hands kept them from sliding into eternity yet there was about her such an air of wontedness to the situation that he was stirred by no sense of anxiety for himself or for her He took out his pipe and smoked still dreaming comparing and questioning Of ancient family yet the younger son of three generations of younger sons all probability of great inheritance or title so far removed from him it behooved that he build for himself what Fortune name everything Character Ah that was his heritage all the heritage the laws of England allowed him and that not by right of English law but because fixed in the immutable eternal Will some laws there are beyond the power of man to supersede With an involuntary stiffening of his body he disturbed for an instant the slumbering child and quite as involuntarily he drew him closer and soothed him back to forgetfulness and they both dreamed on the child in his sleep and the man in his wide wakefulness and intense searching His uncle it is true would have boosted him far toward creating both name and fame for himself in either army or navy but he would none of it There was his older brother to be advanced and the younger son of this same uncle to be placed in life or married to wealth This also he might have done well married he might have been ere now and could be still for she was waiting only an ideal stood in his way Whom he would marry he would love Not merely respect or like not even both but love he must and in order to hold to this ideal he must fly the country or remain to be unduly urged to his own discomfiture and possibly to their mutual undoing As for the alternatives the army or the navy again his ideals had formed for him impassable bars He would found his career on the saving rather than the taking of life Perhaps he might yet follow in the wake of armies to mend bodies they have torn and cut and maimed and heal diseases they have engendered yes perhaps the ideals loomed big But what had he done Fled his country and deftly avoided the most heart satisfying of human delights children to call him father and wife to make him a home peace and wealth thrust aside the helping hand to power and a career considered most worthy of a strong and resourceful man and thrown personal ambition to the winds Why Because of his ideals preferring to mend rather than to mar his neighbor Surely he was right and yet and yet What had he accomplished Taken the making of his life into his own hands and lost all if health were really gone One thing remained to him the last rag and remnant of his cherished ideals to live long enough to triumph over his own disease and take up work again Why should he succumb Was it fate Was there the guidance of a higher will Might he reach out and partake of the Divine power But one thing he knew but one thing could he do As the glory of white light around him served to reveal a few feet only of the way even as the density beyond seemed impenetrable still it was but seeming There was a beyond vast mysterious which he must search out slowly painfully if need be seeing a little way only but seeing that little clearly revealed by the white light of spirit His own or God s Into the infinite he must search search and at last surely find CHAPTER II IN WHICH DAVID THRYNG EXPERIENCES THE HOSPITALITY OF THE MOUNTAIN PEOPLE Suddenly the jolting ceased The deep stillness of the night seemed only intensified by the low panting of the animals and the soft dropping of the wet snow from the trees What is it said Thryng peering from under the canvas cover Anything the matter The beasts stood with low swung heads the vapor rising white from their warm bodies wet with the melting snow His question fell unheard and the girl who was climbing down over the front wheel began to unhitch the team in silence He rolled the sleeping child in his rug and leaped out Let me help you What is the trouble Oh are you at home I can do this suh I have done it a heap of times Don t go nigh Pete suh He s mighty quick and he s mean The beast laid back his ears viciously as David approached You ought not go near him yourself he said taking a firm grip of the bridle Oh he s safe enough with me or Frale Hold him tight suh now you have him till I get round there Keep his head towa ds you He certainly is mean The colt walked off to a low stack of corn fodder as she turned him loose with a light slap on the flank and the mule impatient stamping and sidling about stretched forth his nose and let out his raucous and hideous cry While he was thus occupied the girl slipped off his harness and taking the bridle led the beast away to a small railed enclosure on the far side of the stack and David stood alone in the snow and looked about him He saw a low rambling house which although one structure appeared to be a series of houses built of logs plastered with clay in the chinks It stood in a tangle of wild growth on what seemed to be a wide ledge jutting out from the side of the mountain which loomed dark and high behind it An incessant rushing sound pervaded the place as it were a part of the silence or a breathing of the mountain itself Was it wind among the trees or the rushing of water No wind stirred now and yet the sound never ceased It must be a torrent swollen by the melting snow He saw the girl moving in and out among the shadows about the open log stable like a wraith The braying of the mule had disturbed the occupants of the house for a candle was placed in a window and its little ray streamed forth and was swallowed up in the moonlight and black shades The child awakened by the horrible noise of the beast rustled in the corn fodder where Thryng had left him Dazed and wondering he peered out at the young man for some moments too shy to descend until his sister should return Now she came and he scrambled down and stood close to her side looking up weirdly his twisted little form shivering and quaking Run in Hoyle she said looking kindly down upon him Tell mothah we re all right son A woman came to the door holding a candle which she shaded with a gnarled and bony hand That you Cass she quavered Who aire ye talkin to Yes Aunt Sally we ll be there directly Don t let mothah get cold She turned again to David I reckon you ll have to stop with us to night It s a right smart way to the cabin and it ll be cold and nothing to eat We ll bring in your things now and in the morning we can tote them up to your place with the mule and Hoyle can go with you to show you the way She turned toward the wagon as if all were settled and Thryng could not be effusive in the face of her direct and conclusive manner but he took the basket from her hand Let me no no I will bring in everything Thank you very much I can do it quite easily taking one at a time Then she left him but at the door she met him and helped to lift his heavy belongings into the house The room he entered was warm and brightly lighted by a pile of blazing logs in the great chimneyplace He walked toward it and stretched his hands to the fire a generous fire the mountain home s luxury Something was cooking in the ashes on the hearth which sent up a savory odor most pleasant and appealing to the hungry man The meagre boy stood near also warming his little body on which his coarse garments hung limply He kept his great eyes fixed on David s face in a manner disconcerting even in a child had Thryng given his attention to it but at the moment he was interested in other things Dropped thus suddenly into this utterly alien environment he was observing the girl and the old woman as intently though less openly as the boy was watching him Presently he felt himself uncannily the object of a scrutiny far different from the child s wide eyed gaze and glancing over his shoulder toward the corner from which the sensation seemed to emanate he saw in the depths of an old four posted bed set in their hollow sockets and roofed over by projecting light eyebrows a pair of keen glittering eyes Yas you see me now do ye said a high thin voice in toothless speech Who be ye His physician s feeling instantly alert he stepped to the bedside and bent over the wasted form which seemed hardly to raise the clothing from its level smoothness as if she had lain motionless since some careful hand had arranged it No ye don t know me I reckon Tain t likely Who be ye she iterated still looking unflinchingly in his eyes Hit s a gentleman who knows Doctah Hoyle mothah He sent him Don t fret you se f said the girl soothingly I m not one of the frettin kind retorted the mother never taking her eyes from his face and again speaking in a weak monotone Who be ye My name is David Thryng and I am a doctor he said quietly Where be ye from I came from Canada the country where Doctor Hoyle lives I reckon so He used to tell at his home was thar A pallid hand was reached slowly out to him I m right glad to see ye Take a cheer and set Bring a cheer Sally But the girl had already placed him a chair which he drew close to the bedside He took the feeble old hand and slipped his fingers along to rest lightly on the wrist You needn t stan watchin me Cass You n Sally set suthin fer th doctah to eat I reckon ye re all about gone fer hunger Yes mothah right soon Fry a little pork to go with the pone Aunt Sally Is any coffee left in the pot I done put in a leetle mo when I heered the mule hollah I knowed ye d want it Might throw in a mite mo now th gentleman s come The two women resumed their preparations for supper the boy continued to stand and gaze and the high voice of the frail occupant of the bed began again to talk and question When did you come down f om that thar country whar Doctah Hoyle lives at she said in her monotonous wail Four days ago I travelled slowly for I have been ill myself Hit s right quare now pears like ef I was a doctah I wouldn t low myself fer to get sick An you seed Doctah Hoyle fo days back No he has gone to England on a visit I saw his wife though and his daughter She is a young lady is to be married soon They do grow up the leetle ones Hit don t seem mo n yestahday at Cass was like leetle Hoyle yandah an hit don t seem that since Doctah Hoyle was here an leetle Hoyle came We named him fer th doctah Waal I reckon ef th doctah was here now at he could he p me some Maybe ef he d a stayed here I nevah would a got down whar I be now He was a right good doctah bettah n a yarb doctah most I reckon so David smiled I think so myself he said Are there many herb doctors here about Not rightly doctahs so to speak but they is some at knows a heap about yarbs Good Perhaps they can teach me something The old face was feebly lifted a bit from the pillow and the dark eyes grew suddenly sharp in their scrutiny Who be ye anyhow What aire ye here fer Sech as you knows a heap a ready thout makin out to larn o we uns David saw his mistake and hastened to allay the suspicion which gleamed out at him almost malignantly I am just what I said a doctor like Adam Hoyle only that I don t know as much as he not yet The wisest man in the world can learn more if he watches out to do so Your herb doctors might be able to teach me a good many things I spect ye re right thar on y a heap o folks thinks they knows it all fust There was a pause and Thryng leaned back in his stiff splint bottomed chair and glanced around him He saw that the girl although moving about setting to rights and brushing here and there with an unique home made broom was at the same time intently listening Presently the old woman spoke again her threadlike voice penetrating far What do you low to do here in ouah mountains They hain t no settlement nighabouts here an them what s sick hain t no money to pay doctahs with I reckon they ll hev to stay sick fer all o you uns David looked into her eyes a moment quietly then he smiled The way to her heart he saw was through the magic of one name What did Doctor Hoyle do when he was down here Him They hain t no one livin like he was Then David laughed outright a gay contagious laugh and after an instant she laughed also I agree with you he said But you see I am a countryman of his and he sent me here he knows me well and I mean to do as he did if I can He drew in a deep breath of utter weariness and leaned forward his elbows on his knees his head in his hands and gazed into the blazing fire The memories which had taken possession of his soul during the long ride seemed to envelop him so that in a moment the present was swept away into oblivion and his spirit was as it were suddenly withdrawn from the body and projected into the past He had been unable to touch any of the greasy cold stuff which had been offered him during the latter part of his journey and the heat brought a drowsiness on him and a faintness from lack of food Cass Cassandry Look to him called the mother shrilly but the girl had already noticed his strange abstraction and the small Adam Hoyle had drawn back in awe to his mother Get some whiskey Sally said the girl and David roused himself to see her bending over him I must have gone off in a doze he said weakly The long ride and then this warmth Seeing the anxious faces around him he laughed again It s nothing I assure you only the comfort and the smell of something good to eat he sniffed a little What is it he asked Old Sally was tossing and shaking the frying salt pork in the skillet at the fireplace and the odor aggravated his already too keen appetite Ye was more n sleepy I reckon shrilled the woman from the bed Hain t that pone done Sally No tain t liquor he needs hit s suthin to eat Then the girl hastened her slow gliding movements drew splint chairs to a table of rough pine that stood against the side of the room and stooping between him and the fire pulled something from among the hot ashes The fire made the only light in the room and David never forgot the supple grace of her as she bent thus silhouetted the perfect line of chin and throat black against the blaze contrasted with the weird witchlike old woman with roughly knotted hair who still squatted in the heat and shook the skillet of frying pork Thar now hit s done I reckon said old Sally slowly rising and straightening her bent back and the woman from the bed called her orders Not that cup she cried as Sally began pouring black coffee into a cracked white cup Git th chany one I hid hit yandah in th cornder hind that tin can to keep em f om usin hit every day I had a hull set o that when I married Farwell Give hit here She took the precious relic in her work worn hands and peered into it then wiped it out with the corner of the sheet which covered her This Thryng did not see He was watching the girl as she broke open the hot fragrant corn bread and placed it beside his plate Come she said You sure must be right hungry Sit here and eat David felt like one drunken with weariness when he rose and caught at the edge of the table to steady himself Aren t you hungry too he asked and Hoyle here Sit beside me we re going to have a feast little chap The girl placed an earthen crock on the table and took from it honey in the broken comb rich and dark Have a little of this with your pone It s right good she said Frale he found a bee tree piped the child suddenly gaining confidence as he saw the stranger engaged in the very normal act of eating with the relish of an ordinary man He edged forward and sat himself gingerly on the outer corner of the next chair and accepted a huge piece of the pone from David s hand His sister gave him honey and Sally dropped pieces of the sizzling hot pork on their plates from the skillet David sipped his coffee from the flowered chany cup contentedly Served without milk or sugar it was strong hot and reviving The girl shyly offered more of the corn bread as she saw it rapidly disappearing pleased to see him eat so eagerly yet abashed at having nothing else to offer I m sorry we can give you only such as this We don t live like you do in the no th Have a little more of the honey Ah but this is fine Good hey little chap You are doing a very beneficent thing do you know saving a man s life He glanced up at her flushed face and she smiled deprecatingly He fancied her smiles were rare But it is quite true Where would I be now but for you and Hoyle here Lying under the lee side of the station coughing my life away and all my own fault too I should have accepted the bishop s invitation You helped me when the colt was bad Her soft voice low and monotonous fell musically on his ear when she spoke Naturally but how about that anyway It s a wonder you weren t killed How came a youngster like you there alone with those beasts Thryng had an abrupt manner of springing a question which startled the child and he edged away furtively watching his sister Illustration Casabianca was it said Thryng smiling Page seventeen Did you hitch that kicking brute alone and drive all that distance Aunt Sally she he ped me to tie up she give him company n whilst I th owed on the strops an when he s oncet tied up he goes all right The atom grinned Hit s his way He s mean but he nevah works both ends to oncet Good thing to know but you re a hero do you understand that The child continued to edge away and David reached out and drew him to his side Holding him by his two sharp little elbows he gave him a playful shake I say do you know what a hero is The startled boy stopped grinning and looked wildly to his sister but receiving only a smile of reassurance from her he lifted his great eyes to Thryng s face then slowly the little form relaxed and he was drawn within the doctor s encircling arm I don t reckon was all his reply which ambiguous remark caused David in his turn to look to the sister for elucidation She held a long lighted candle in her hand and paused to look back as she was leaving the room Yes you do honey son You remembah the boy with the quare long name sistah told you about who stood there when the ship was all afiah and wouldn t leave because his fathah had told him to bide He was a hero But Hoyle was too shy to respond and David could feel his little heart thumping against his arm as he held him Tell the gentleman Hoyle He don t bite I reckon called the mother from her corner His name begun like yourn Cass but I cyan t remembah the hull of it Casabianca was it said Thryng smiling I reckon Did you uns know him When I was a small chap like you I used to read about him Then the atom yielded entirely and leaned comfortably against David and his sister left them carrying the candle with her Old Sally threw another log on the fire and the flames leaped up the cavernous chimney lighting the room with dramatic splendor Thryng took note of its unique furnishing In the corner opposite the one where the mother lay was another immense four poster bed and before it hung a coarse homespun curtain half concealing it At its foot was a huge box of dark wood well made and strong with a padlock This and the beds seemed to belong to another time and place in contrast to the other articles which were evidently mountain made rude in construction and hewn out by hand the chairs unstained and unpolished and seated with splints The walls were the roughly dressed logs of which the house was built the chinks plastered with deep red brown clay Depending from nails driven in the logs were festoons of dried apple and strips of dried pumpkin and hanging by their braided husks were bunches of Indian corn not yellow like that of the north but white or purple There were bags also containing Thryng knew not what although he was to learn later when his own larder came to be eked out by sundry gifts of dried fruit and sweet corn together with the staple of beans and peas from the widow s store Beside the window of small panes was a shelf on which were a few worn books and beneath hung an almanac at the foot of the mother s bed stood a small spinning wheel with the wool still hanging to the spindle David wondered how long since it had been used The scrupulous cleanliness of the place satisfied his fastidious nature and gave him a sense of comfort in the homely interior He liked the look of the bed in the corner made up high and round and covered with marvellous patchwork As he sat thus noting all his surroundings Hoyle still nestled at his side leaning his elbows on the doctor s knees his chin in his hands and his soft eyes fixed steadily on the doctor s face Thus they advanced rapidly toward an amicable acquaintance each questioning and being questioned What is a bee tree said David You said somebody found one Hit s a big holler tree an hit s plumb full o bees an honey Frale he found this n Tell me about it Where was it Hit war up yandah highah up th mountain They is a hole thar what wil cats live in Wil Cat Hole Frale he war a hunt n fer a cat Some men thar at th hotel they war plumb mad to hunt a wil cat with th dogs an Frale he lowed to git th cat fer em And when was that Las summah when th hotel war open They war a heap o men at th hotel And now about the bee tree Frale he nevah let on like he know d thar war a bee tree an then this fall he took me with him an we made a big fire an then we cut down th tree an we stayed thar th hull day too an eat thar an had ros n ears by th fire too I say you know There seem to be a lot of things you will have to enlighten me about After you get through with the bee tree you must tell me what ros n ears are And then what did you do Thar war a heap o honey That tree hit war nigh about plumb full o honey and th bees war that mad you couldn t let em come nigh ye thout they d sting you They stung me an I nevah hollered Frale he lowed ef you hollered you wa n t good fer nothin goin bee hunt n Is Frale your brother Yas He c n

neighbors cause maw said they wa n t no use in humans bein fool hogs like th bees war a keepin more n they could eat jes fer therselves Yas called the mother from her corner where she had been admiringly listening they is a heap like that a way but hit ain t our way here in th mountains Let th doctah tell you suthin now Hoyle ye mount larn a heap if ye d hark to him right smart thout talkin th hull time youse f I has to tell him bouts th ros n ears he said so Thar they be He pointed to a bunch of Indian corn You wrop em up in ther shucks whilst ther green an sof and kiver em up in th ashes whar hit s right hot and then when ther rosted eat em so Now what do you know Why he knows a heap son Don t ax that a way In my country away across the ocean began David Tell bout th ocean how hit look In my country we don t have Indian corn nor bee trees nor wild cat holes but we have the ocean all around us and we see the ships and Like that thar one whar th boy stood whilst hit war on fire Something like yes Then he told about the sea and the ships and the great fishes and was interrupted with the query Reckon you done seed that thar fish what swallered the man in th Bible an then th ow d him up agin Why no son you know that thar fish war dade long fore we uns war born You mustn t ax fool questions honey Old Sally sat crouched by the hearth intently listening and asking as naive questions as the child whose pallid face grew pink and animated and whose eyes grew larger as he strove to see with inward vision the things Thryng described It was a happy evening for little Hoyle Leaning confidingly against David he sighed with repletion of joy He was not eager for his sister to return not he He could lean forever against this wonderful man and listen to his tales But the doctor s weariness was growing heavier and he bethought himself that the girl had not eaten with them and feared she was taking trouble to prepare quarters for him when if she only knew how gladly he would bunk down anywhere only to sleep while this blessed and delicious drowsiness was overpowering him Where is your sister Hoyle Don t you reckon it s time you and I were abed he asked adopting the child s vernacular She s makin yer bed ready in th loom shed likely said the mother ever alert With her pale prematurely wrinkled face and uncannily bright and watchful eyes she seemed the controlling all pervading spirit of the place Run child an see what s keepin her so long Hit s dark out thar said the boy stirring himself slowly Run honey you hain t afeared kin drive a team all by you se f Dark hain t nothin I ben all ovah these heah mountains when thar wa n t one star o light Maybe you kin he p her At that moment she entered holding the candle high to light her way through what seemed to be a dark passage her still sweet face a bit flushed and stray taches of white cotton down clinging to her blue homespun dress The doctah s mos dade fer sleep Cass I am right sorry to keep you so long but we are obleeged She lifted troubled eyes to his face as Thryng interrupted her Ah no no I really beg your pardon for coming in on you this way it was not right you know It was a a predicament wasn t it It certainly wasn t right to put you about so if you will just let me go anywhere only to sleep I shall be greatly obliged I m making you a lot of trouble and I m so sorry His profusion of manner of which he was entirely unaware embarrassed her although not shy like her brother she had never encountered any one who spoke with such rapid abruptness and his swift penetrating glance and pleasant ease of the world abashed her For an instant she stood perfectly still before him slowly comprehending his thought then hastened with her inherited inborn ladyhood to relieve him from any sense that his sudden descent upon their privacy was an intrusion Her mind moved along direct lines from thought to expression from impulse to action She knew no conventional tricks of words or phrases for covering an awkward situation and her only way of avoiding a self betrayal was by silence and a masklike impassivity During this moment of stillness while she waited to regain her poise he quick and intuitive as a woman took in the situation yet he failed to comprehend the character before him To one accustomed to the conventional perfect simplicity seems to conceal something held back It is hard to believe that all is being revealed hence her slower thought in reality comprehended him the more truly What he supposed to be pride and shame over their meagre accommodations was in reality genuine concern for his comfort and embarrassment before his ease and ready phrases As in a swift breeze her thoughts were caught up and borne away upon them but after a moment they would sweep back to her a flock of innocent startled doves Still holding her candle aloft she raised her eyes to his and smiled We uns are right glad you came If you can be comfortable where we are obliged to put you to sleep you must bide awhile She did not say obleeged this time He had not pronounced it so and he must know That is so good of you And now you are very tired yourself and have eaten nothing You must have your own supper Hoyle can look after me He took the candle from her and gave it to the boy then turned his own chair back to the table and looked inquiringly at Sally squatted before the fire Not another thing shall you do for me until you are waited on Take my place here David s manner seemed like a command to her and she slid into the chair with a weary drooping movement Hoyle stood holding the candle his wry neck twisting his head to one side a smile on his face eying them sharply He turned a questioning look to his sister as he stiffened himself to his newly acquired importance as host Thryng walked over to the bedside In the morning when we are all rested I ll see what can be done for you he said taking the proffered old hand in his I am not doctor Hoyle but he has taught me a little I studied and practised with him you know Hev ye Then ye must know a heap Hit s right like th Lord sont ye You see suthin peared like to give way whilst I war a cuttin light ud th othah day an I went all er a heap crost a log an I reckon hit hurt me some I hain t ben able to move a foot sence an I lay out thar nigh on to a hull day whilst Hoyle here run clar down to Sally s place to git her He couldn t lif me hisse f he s that weak he tried to haul me in but when I hollered sufferin so I war jes bleeged to holler he kivered me up whar I lay and lit out fer Sally an she an her man they got me up here an here I ben ever since I reckon I never will leave this bed ontwell I m cyarried out in a box Oh no not that You re too much alive for that We ll see about it to morrow Good night Hoyle may show you the way said the girl rising Your bed is in the loom shed I m right sorry it s so cold I put blankets there and you can use all you like of them I would have given you Frale s place up garret only he might come in any time and Naw he won t He s too skeered at Hoyle s interruption stopped abruptly checked by a glance of his sister s eye I hope you ll sleep well Sleep I shall sleep like a log I feel as if I could sleep for a week It s awfully good of you I hope we haven t eaten all the supper Hoyle and I Come little chap Good night He took up his valise and followed the boy leaving her standing by the uncleared table gazing after him Now you eat Cassandry You are nigh about perished you are that tired said her mother Then old Sally brought more pork and hot pone from the ashes and they sat down together eating and sipping their black coffee in silence Presently Hoyle returned and began removing his clumsy shoes by the fire Did he ax ye a heap o questions Hoyle queried the old woman sharply Naw Did n ax noth n Waal look out at you don t let on nothin ef he does Talkin may hurt an hit may not He hain t no government man maw Hit s all right I reckon but them at larns young to hold ther tongues saves a heap o trouble fer therselves After they had eaten old Sally gathered the few dishes together and placed all the splint bottomed chairs back against the sides of the room and only half disrobing crawled into the far side of the bed opposite to the mother s behind the homespun curtain To morrow I reckon I kin go home to my old man now you ve come Cass Yes said the girl in a low voice you have been right kind to we all Aunt Sally Then she bent over her mother ministering to her few wants lifting her forward she shook up the pillow and gently laid her back upon it and lightly kissed her cheek The child had quickly dropped to sleep curled up like a ball in the farther side of his mother s bed undisturbed by the low murmur of conversation Cassandra drew her chair close to the fire and sat long gazing into the burning logs that were fast crumbling to a heap of glowing embers She uncoiled her heavy bronze hair and combed it slowly out until it fell a rippling mass to the floor as she sat It shone in the firelight as if it had drawn its tint from the fire itself and the cold night had so filled it with electricity that it flew out and followed the comb as if each hair were alive and made a moving aureola of warm red amber about her drooping figure in the midst of the sombre shadows of the room Her face grew sad and her hands moved listlessly and at last she slipped from her chair to her knees and wept softly and prayed her lips forming the words soundlessly Once her mother awoke lifted her head slightly from her pillow and gazed an instant at her then slowly subsided and again slept CHAPTER III IN WHICH AUNT SALLY TAKES HER DEPARTURE AND MEETS FRALE 
4841-26659-0000	train-other-500	The loom shed was one of the log cabins connected with the main building by a roofed passage
none	none	 which Thryng had noticed the evening before as being an odd fashion of house architecture 
4841-26659-0001	train-other-500	giving the appearance of a small flock of cabins all nestling under the wings of the old building in the centre The shed was dark having but one small window with glass panes near the loom the other and larger opening being tightly closed by a wooden shutter
4841-26659-0002	train-other-500	David slept late and awoke at last to find himself thousands of miles away from his dreams in this unique room all in the deepest shadow except for the one warm bar of sunlight which fell across his face
4841-26659-0003	train-other-500	He drowsed off again and his mind began piecing together fragments and scenes from the previous day and evening and immediately he was surrounded by mystery moonlit fairylike and white a little crooked being at his side looking up at him like some gnome creature of the hills
4841-26659-0004	train-other-500	revealed as a part of the enchantment Then slowly resolving and melting away after the manner of dreams the wide spaces of the mystery drew closer and warmer and a great centre of blazing logs threw grotesque dancing lights among them
4841-26659-0005	train-other-500	and an old face peered out with bright keen eyes now seen now lost in the fitful shadows now pale and appealing or cautiously withdrawn but always watching watching while the little crooked being came and watched also
4841-26659-0006	train-other-500	Then between him and the blazing light came a dark figure silhouetted blackly against it moving stooping rising going and coming a sweet girl s head with heavily coiled hair through which the firelight played with flashes of its own color
4841-26659-0007	train-other-500	and a delicate profile cut in pure clean lines melting into throat and gently rounded breast like a spirit now here now gone again near and bending over him a ministering spirit bringing him food
4841-26659-0008	train-other-500	until gradually this half wake dreaming reminiscence concentrated upon her and again he saw her standing holding the candle high and looking up at him a wondering questioning spirit then drooping wearily into the chair by the uncleared table
4841-26659-0009	train-other-500	and again waiting with almost a smile on her parted lips as he said good night Good night Ah yes It was morning
4841-26659-0010	train-other-500	Again he heard the continuous rushing noise to which he had listened in the white mystery that had soothed him to slumber the night before rising and falling never ceasing He roused himself with sudden energy and bounded from his couch He would go out and investigate
none	none	 His sleep had been sound and he felt a rejuvenation he had not experienced in many months 
4841-26659-0011	train-other-500	When he threw open the shutter of the large unglazed window space and looked out on his strange surroundings he found himself in a new world sparkling fresh clear shining with sunlight and glistening with wetness
4841-26659-0012	train-other-500	as though the whole earth had been newly washed and varnished
none	none	 The sunshine streamed in and warmed him and the air filled with winelike fragrance stirred his blood and set his pulses leaping 
4841-26659-0013	train-other-500	He had been too exhausted the previous evening to do more than fall into the bed which had been provided him and sleep his long uninterrupted sleep
none	none	 Now he saw why they had called this part of the home 
4841-26659-0014	train-other-500	the loom shed for between the two windows stood a cloth loom left just as it had been used the warp like a tightly stretched veil of white threads and the web of cloth begun In one corner were a few bundles of cotton
4841-26659-0015	train-other-500	one of which had been torn open and the contents placed in a thick layer over the long bench on which he had slept and covered with a blue and white homespun counterpane The head had been built high with it and sheets spread over all
4841-26659-0016	train-other-500	He noticed the blankets which had covered him and saw that they were evidently of home manufacture and that the white spread which covered them was also of coarse clean homespun ornamented in squares with rude primitive needlework He marvelled at the industry here represented
4841-26659-0017	train-other-500	As for his toilet the preparation had been most simple A shelf placed on pegs driven between the logs supported a piece of looking glass
none	none	 a splint chair set against the wall served as wash stand and towel rack the homespun cotton towels neatly folded and hung over the back a wooden pail at one side was filled with clear water 
4841-26659-0018	train-other-500	over which hung a dipper of gourd a white porcelain basin was placed on the chair over which a clean towel had been spread and to complete all a square cut from the end of a bar of yellow soap lay beside the basin
4841-26659-0019	train-other-500	David smiled as he bent himself to the refreshing task of bathing in water so cold as to be really icy Indeed ice had formed over still pools without during the night although now fast disappearing under the glowing morning sun
4841-26659-0020	train-other-500	Above his head laid upon cross beams were bundles of wool uncarded and carding boards hung from nails in the logs In one corner was a rudely constructed reel and from the loom dangled the idle shuttle filled with fine blue yarn of wool
4841-26659-0021	train-other-500	Thryng thought of the worn old hands which had so often thrown it
none	none	 and thinking of them he hastened his toilet 
4841-26659-0022	train-other-500	that he might go in and do what he could to help the patient It was small enough return for the kindness shown him He feared to offer money for his lodgment at least until he could find a way At last full of new vigor and very hungry
4841-26659-0023	train-other-500	he issued from his sleeping room sadly in need of a shave but biding his time satisfied if only breakfast might be forthcoming He had no need to knock for the house door stood open flooding the place with sunlight and frosty air
4841-26659-0024	train-other-500	The huge pile of logs was blazing on the hearth as if it had never ceased since the night before and the flames leaped hot and red up the great chimney Old Sally no longer presided at the cookery
4841-26659-0025	train-other-500	With a large cup of black coffee before her she now sat at the table eating corn bread and bacon A drooping black sunbonnet on her head covered her unkempt grizzly hair and a cob pipe and bag of tobacco lay at her hand She was ready for departure
4841-26659-0026	train-other-500	Cassandra had returned and her gratuitous neighborly offices were at an end The girl was stooping before the fire arranging a cake of corn bread to cook in the ashes A crane swung over the flames on which a fat iron kettle was hung
4841-26659-0027	train-other-500	and the large coffee pot stood on the hearth The odor of breakfast was savory and appetizing As David s tall form cast a shadow across the sunlit space on the floor the old mother s voice called to him from the corner
none	none	 Come right in Doctah 
4841-26659-0028	train-other-500	take a cheer and set Your breakfast s ready I reckon How have you slept suh The girl at the fire rose and greeted him but he missed the boy Where s the little chap he asked
4841-26659-0029	train-other-500	Cassandry sont him out to wash up
none	none	 F ust thing she do when she gets home is to begin on Hoyle and wash him up He do get that dirty poor little son said the girl 
4841-26659-0030	train-other-500	It s like I have to torment him some Will you have breakfast now suh Just take your chair to the table and I ll fetch it directly Won t I though What air you have up here It makes me hungry merely to breathe Is it this way all the time
none	none	 Hit s this a way a good deal said Sally from under her sunbonnet Oh the is days hit s some colder like to make water freeze right hard but most days hit s a heap warmer than this 
4841-26659-0031	train-other-500	That s so said the invalid I hev seen it so warm a heap o winters at the trees gits fooled into thinkin hit s spring an blossoms all out an then come along a late freez n spell an gits their fruit all killed Hit s quare how they does do that a way
none	none	 We all hates it when the days come warm in Feb uary 
4841-26659-0032	train-other-500	Then you must have been glad to have snow yesterday I was disappointed I was running away from that sort of thing you know Thryng s breakfast was served to him as had been his supper of the evening before directly from the fire
4841-26659-0033	train-other-500	As he ate he looked out upon the usual litter of corn fodder scattered about near the house and a few implements of the simplest character for cultivating the small pocket of rich soil below but beyond this and surrounding it was a scene of the wildest beauty
4841-26659-0034	train-other-500	Giant forest trees intertwined and almost overgrown by a tangle of wild grapevines hid the fall from sight and behind them the mountain rose abruptly A continuous stream of clearest water icy cold
4841-26659-0035	train-other-500	fell from high above into a long trough made of a hollow log There at the running water stood little Hoyle
none	none	 his coarse cotton towel hung on an azalia shrub giving himself a thorough scrubbing 
4841-26659-0036	train-other-500	In a moment he came in panting shivering and shining and still wet about the hair and ears
none	none	 Why you are not half dry son said his sister 
4841-26659-0037	train-other-500	She took the towel from him and gave his head a vigorous rubbing
none	none	 Go and get warm honey and sister ll give you breakfast by the fire 
4841-26659-0038	train-other-500	She turned to David Likely you take milk in your coffee I never thought to ask you She left the room and returned with a cup of new milk warm and sweet He was glad to get it finding his black coffee sweetened only with molasses unpalatable
4841-26659-0039	train-other-500	Don t you take milk in your coffee How came you to think of it for me I knew a lady at the hotel last summer
none	none	 She said that up no th most everybody does take milk or cream one in their coffee I never seed sech 
4841-26659-0040	train-other-500	Hit s clar waste to my thinkin Cassandra smiled That s because you never could abide milk Mothah thinks it s only fit to make buttah and raise pigs on Old Sally s horse a thin wiry beast gray and speckled
none	none	 stood ready saddled near the door 
4841-26659-0041	train-other-500	his bridle hanging from his neck the bit dangling while he also made his repast When he had finished his corn and she had finished her elaborate farewells at the bedside and little Hoyle had with much effort succeeded in bridling her steed
4841-26659-0042	train-other-500	she stepped quickly out and gained her seat on the high narrow saddle with the ease of a young girl Meagre as a willow withe in her scant black cotton gown perched on her bony gray beast
4841-26659-0043	train-other-500	and only the bowl of her cob pipe projecting beyond the rim of her sunbonnet as indication that a face might be hidden in its depths with a meal sack containing in either end sundry gifts salt pork chicken corn bread and meal
4841-26659-0044	train-other-500	slung over the horse s back behind her and with contentment in her heart
none	none	 Aunt Sally rode slowly over the hills to rejoin her old man Soon she left the main road and struck out into a steep narrow trail 
4841-26659-0045	train-other-500	merely a mule track arched with hornbeam and dogwood and mulberry trees and towered over by giant chestnuts and oaks and great white pines and deep green hemlocks Through myriad leafless branches the wind soughed pleasantly overhead
4841-26659-0046	train-other-500	unfelt by her so completely was she protected by the thickly growing laurel and rhododendron on either side of her path The snow of the day before was gone leaving only the glistening wetness of it on stones and fallen leaves and twigs underfoot
4841-26659-0047	train-other-500	while in open spaces the sun beat warmly down upon her The trail led by many steep scrambles and sharp descents more directly to her home than the road which wound and turned so frequently as to more than double the distance
none	none	 At intervals it cut across the road or followed it a little way only to diverge again Here and there other trails crossed it or branched from it leading higher up the mountain or off into some gorge following the course of a stream so that except to one accustomed to its intricacies the path might easily be lost Old Sally paid no heed to her course apparently leaving the choice of trails to her horse She sat easily on the beast and smoked her pipe until it was quite out when she stowed it away in the black cloth bag which dangled from her elbow by its strings Spying a small sassafras shrub leaning toward her from the bank above her head she gave it a vigorous pull as she passed and drew it root and all from its hold in the soil beat it against the mossy bank and swished it upon her skirt to remove the earth clinging to it 
4841-26659-0048	train-other-500	Then breaking off a bit of the root she chewed it while she thrust the rest in her bag and used the top for a switch with which to hasten the pace of her nag The small stones loosened when she tore the shrub from the bank rattled down where the soil had been washed away
4841-26659-0049	train-other-500	leaving the steep shelving rock side of the mountain bare and she heard them leap the smooth space and fall softly on the moss among the ferns and lodged leaves below There crouched in the sun lay a man with a black felt hat covering his face
4841-26659-0050	train-other-500	The stones falling about him caused him to raise himself stealthily and peer upward Descrying only the lone woman and the gray horse he gave a low peculiar cry almost like that of an animal in distress She drew rein sharply and listened
4841-26659-0051	train-other-500	The cry was repeated a little louder
none	none	 Come on up hyar Frale Hit s on y me Hu come you thar 
4841-26659-0052	train-other-500	He climbed rapidly up through the dense undergrowth and stood at her side breathing quickly For a moment they waited thus regarding each other neither speaking The boy he seemed little more than a youth
4841-26659-0053	train-other-500	looked up at her with a singularly innocent and appealing expression but gradually as he saw her impassive and unrelenting face his own resumed a hard and sullen look which made him appear years older His forehead was damp and cold
4841-26659-0054	train-other-500	and a lock of silken black hair slightly curling over it increased its whiteness Dark heavy rings were under his eyes which gleamed blue as the sky between long dark lashes His arms dropped listlessly at his side
4841-26659-0055	train-other-500	and he stood before her as before a dread judge bareheaded and silent He bore her look only for a minute then dropped his eyes and his hand clinched more tightly the rim of his old felt hat When he ceased looking at her her eyes softened
none	none	 I low ye mus hev suthin to say fer yourse f she said 
4841-26659-0056	train-other-500	I reckon The corners of his mouth drooped and he did not look up He made as if to speak further but only swallowed and was silent Ye reckon

4841-26659-0058	train-other-500	an they done had the buryin Her voice was monotonous and plaintive
none	none	 A pallor swept over his face and he drew the back of his hand across his mouth 
4841-26659-0059	train-other-500	He knowed he hadn t ought to rile me like he done I be n tryin to make his hoss go home

4841-26659-0061	train-other-500	Ye war both on ye full o mean corn whiskey an ye war quarrellin bouts Cass A faint red stole into the boy s cheeks and the blue gleam of his eyes between the dark lashes narrowed to a mere line as he looked an instant in her face and then off up the trail
4841-26659-0062	train-other-500	Hain t ye seed nobody he asked You knows I hain t seed nobody to hurt you uns thout I d tell ye Look a hyar son

4841-26659-0068	train-other-500	You eat an I ll talk she replied He broke a large piece from the corn cake and crowded the rest into his pocket Then he drew forth a huge clasp knife and cut a thick slice from the raw salt pork
4841-26659-0069	train-other-500	and pulling a red cotton handkerchief from his belt he wrapped it around the remainder and held it under his arm as he ate

4841-26659-0078	train-other-500	His face settled into its harder lines as she talked but he made no reply and she continued querulously Why n t you pay heed to me long ago when I tol ye not to open that thar still again You are a heap too young to go that a way

4841-26659-0084	train-other-500	She leaned down to him and held him by the coat an instant Son leave whiskey alone Hit s the only way you kin do to get her Yas Aunt Sally he murmured His eyes thanked her with one look for the tone
4841-26659-0085	train-other-500	or the hope her words held out Again the laugh nearer this time and again the wild look of haunting fear in his face He dropped where he stood and slipped stealthily as a cat back to the place where he had lain
none	none	 and crawling on his belly toward a heap of dead leaves caught by the brush of an old fallen pine 
4841-26659-0086	train-other-500	he crept beneath them and lay still
none	none	 His aunt did not stir Patting her horse s neck she sat and waited until the voices drew nearer came close beneath her as the road wound and passed on Then she once more moved along toward her cabin CHAPTER IV DAVID SPENDS HIS FIRST DAY AT HIS CABIN AND FRALE MAKES HIS CONFESSION Doctor Hoyle had built his cabin on one of the pinnacles of the earth and David looking down on blue billowing mountain tops with only the spaces of the air between him and heaven between him and the ocean between him and his fair English home felt that he knew why the old doctor had chosen it Seated on a splint bottomed chair in the doorway pondering he thought first of his mother with a little secret sorrow that he could not have taken to his heart the bride she had selected for him and settled in his own home to the comfortable ease the wife s wealth would have secured for him 
4841-26660-0000	train-other-500	It was not that the money had been made in commerce he was neither a snob nor a cad Although his own connections entitled him to honor what more could he expect than to marry wealth and be happy if if happiness could come to either of them in that way
4841-26660-0001	train-other-500	No his heart did not lean toward her it was better that he should bend to his profession in a strange land But not this to live a hermit s life in a cabin on a wild hilltop How long must it be how long
4841-26660-0002	train-other-500	Brooding thus he gazed at the distance of ever paling blue and mechanically counted the ranges and peaks below him An inaccessible tangle of laurel and rhododendron clothed the rough and precipitous wall of the mountain side
4841-26660-0003	train-other-500	which fell sheer down until lost in purple shadow with a mantle of green deep and rich varied by the gray of the lichen covered rocks the browns and reds of the bare branches of deciduous trees
4841-26660-0004	train-other-500	and the paler tints of feathery pines Here and there from damp springy places dark hemlocks rose out of the mass
none	none	 tall and majestic waving their plumy tops 
4841-26660-0005	train-other-500	giant sentinels of the wilderness Gradually his mood of brooding retrospect changed and he knew himself to be glad to his heart s core He could understand why out of the turmoil of the Middle Ages
4841-26660-0006	train-other-500	men chose to go to sequestered places and become hermits No tragedies could be in this primeval spot and here he would rest and build again for the future He was pleased to sit thus musing
4841-26660-0007	train-other-500	for the climb had taken more strength than he could well spare His cabin was not yet habitable for the simple things Doctor Hoyle had accumulated to serve his needs were still locked in well built cupboards as he had left them
4841-26660-0008	train-other-500	Thryng meant soon to go to work to take out the bed covers and air them and to find the canvas and nail it over the framework beside the cabin which was to serve as a sleeping apartment All should be done in time
4841-26660-0009	train-other-500	That was a good framework strongly built with the corner posts set deep in the ground to keep it firm on this windswept height and with a door in the side of the cabin opening into the canvas room Ah yes
4841-26660-0010	train-other-500	all that the old doctor did was well and thoroughly done His appetite sharpened by the climb and the bracing air David investigated the contents of one of those melon shaped baskets which Cassandra had given him when he started for his new home that morning
4841-26660-0011	train-other-500	with little Hoyle as his guide Ah what hospitable kindness they had shown to him a stranger Here were delicate bits of fried chicken
none	none	 sweet and white corn bread a glass of honey 
4841-26660-0012	train-other-500	and a bottle of milk Nothing better need a man ask and what animals men are after all he thought taking delight in the mere acts of eating and breathing and sleeping Utterly weary he would not trouble to open the cot which lay in the cabin
4841-26660-0013	train-other-500	but rolled himself in his blanket on the wide flat rock at the verge of the mountain Here warmed by the sun he lay with his face toward the blue distance and slept dreamlessly and soundly very soundly
4841-26660-0014	train-other-500	for he was not awakened by a crackling of the brush and scrambling of feet struggling up the mountain wall below his hard resting place Yet the sound kept on and soon a head appeared above the rock and two hands were placed upon it
none	none	 then a strong catlike spring landed the lithe young owner of the head 
4841-26660-0015	train-other-500	only a few feet away from the sleeper It was Frale his soft felt hat on the back of his head and the curl of dark hair falling upon his forehead For an instant as he gazed on the sleeping figure
4841-26660-0016	train-other-500	the wild look of fear was in his eyes then as he bethought himself of the words of Aunt Sally They is a man thar the expression changed to one more malevolent and repulsive transforming and aging the boyish face
4841-26660-0017	train-other-500	Cautiously he crept nearer and peered into the face of the unconscious Englishman His hands clinched and his lips tightened
none	none	 and he made a movement with his foot as if he would spurn him over the cliff As suddenly the moment passed 
4841-26660-0018	train-other-500	he drew back in shame and looked down at his hands blood guilty hands as he knew them to be
none	none	 and with lowered head 
4841-26660-0019	train-other-500	he moved swiftly away He was a youth again hungry and sad stumbling along the untrodden way avoiding the beaten path yet unerringly taking his course toward the cleft rock at the head of the fall behind the great holly tree
4841-26660-0020	train-other-500	It was not the food Cassandra had promised him that he wanted now but to look into the eyes of one who would pity and love him Heartsick and weary as he never had been in all his young life lonely beyond bearing he hurried along
4841-26660-0021	train-other-500	As he forced a path through the undergrowth he heard the sound of a mountain stream and seeking it he followed along its rocky bed leaping from one huge block of stone to another and swinging himself across by great overhanging sycamore boughs
4841-26660-0022	train-other-500	drawing by its many windings nearer and nearer to the spot
none	none	 where it precipitated itself over the mountain wall Ever the noise of the water grew louder 
4841-26660-0023	train-other-500	until at last making a slight detour he came upon the very edge of the descent where he could look down and see his home nestled in the cove at the foot of the fall the blue smoke curling upward from its great chimney
4841-26660-0024	train-other-500	He seated himself upon a jutting rock well screened by laurel shrubs on all sides but the one toward the fall There his knees clasped about with his arms and his chin resting upon them he sat and watched
4841-26660-0025	train-other-500	Behind the leafage and tangle of bare stems and twigs
none	none	 he was so far above and so directly over the spot on which his gaze was fixed as to be out of the usual range of sight from below 
4841-26660-0026	train-other-500	thus enabling him to see plainly what was transpiring about the house and sheds without himself being seen Long and patiently he waited Once a dog barked his own dog Nig Some one must be approaching
4841-26660-0027	train-other-500	What if the little creature should seek him out and betray him He quivered with the thought The day before he had driven him down the mountain beating him off whenever he returned Should the animal persist in tracking him he would kill him
4841-26660-0028	train-other-500	He peered more eagerly down and saw little Hoyle run out of the cow shed and twist himself this way and that to see up and down the road Both the child and the dog seemed excited Yes there they were three horsemen coming along the highway
4841-26660-0029	train-other-500	Now they were dismounting and questioning the boy Now they disappeared in the house He did not move Why were they so long within Hours it seemed to Frale but in reality it was only a short search they were making there They were longer looking about the sheds and yard
4841-26660-0030	train-other-500	Hoyle accompanied them everywhere his hands in his pockets standing about shivering with excitement All around they went peering and searching thrusting their arms as far as they could reach into the stacks of fodder looking into troughs and corn sacks
4841-26660-0031	train-other-500	setting the fowls to cackling wildly even hauling out the long corn stalks from the wagon which had served to make Thryng s ride the night before comfortable No spot was overlooked Frequently they stood and parleyed Then Frale s heart would sink within him
4841-26660-0032	train-other-500	What if they should set Nig to track him Ah he would strangle the beast and pitch him over the fall He would spring over after him before he would let himself be taken and hanged Oh he could feel the strangling rope around his neck already He could not bear it
4841-26660-0033	train-other-500	he could not Thus cowering he waited starting at every sound from below as if to run then sinking back in fear breathless with the pounding of his heart in his breast Now the voices came up to him painfully clear
4841-26660-0034	train-other-500	They were talking to little Hoyle angrily What they were saying he could not make out but he again cautiously lifted his head and looked below Suddenly the child drew back and lifted his arm as if to ward off a blow but the blow came
4841-26660-0035	train-other-500	Frale saw one of the men turn as he mounted his horse to ride away and cut the boy cruelly across his face and arm with his rawhide whip The little one s shriek of fright and pain pierced his big brother to the heart and caused him to forget for the moment his own abject fear
4841-26660-0036	train-other-500	He made as if he would leap the intervening space to punish the brute but a cry of anger died in his throat as he realized his situation The selfishness of his fear however was dispelled
4841-26660-0037	train-other-500	and he no longer cringed as before but had the courage again to watch awake and alert to all that passed beneath him Hoyle s cry brought Cassandra out of the house flying
none	none	 She walked up to the man like an angry tigress 
4841-26660-0038	train-other-500	Frale rose to his knees and strained eagerly forward If you are such a coward you must hit something small and weak you can strike a woman Hit me she panted putting the child behind her Muttering the man rode sullenly away
none	none	 He no business hangin roun we uns 
4841-26660-0039	train-other-500	list nin to all we say Frale could not make out the words but his face burned red with rage Had he been in hiding down below he would have wreaked vengeance on the man as it was
4841-26660-0040	train-other-500	he stood up and boldly watched them ride away in the opposite direction from which they had come He sank back and waited and again the hours passed All was still but the rushing water and the gentle soughing of the wind in the tops of the towering pines
4841-26660-0041	train-other-500	At last he heard a rustling and sniffing here and there His heart stood still then pounded again in terror They had they had set Nig to track him Of course the dog would seek for his old friend and comrade and they
4841-26660-0042	train-other-500	they would wait until they heard his bark of joy and then they would seize him He crept close to the rock where the water rushed not a foot away and clinging to the tough laurel behind him leaned far over
4841-26660-0043	train-other-500	To drop down there would mean instant death on the rocks below It would be terrible almost as horrible as the strangling rope He would wait until they were on him and then
none	none	 nearer and nearer came the erratic trotting and scratching of the dog among the leaves and then if only he could grapple with the man who had struck his little brother he would drag him over with him A look of fierce joy leaped in his eyes 
4841-26660-0044	train-other-500	which were drawn to a narrow blue gleam as he waited
none	none	 Suddenly Nig burst through the undergrowth and sprang to his side but before the dog could give his first bark of delight the yelp was crushed in his throat and he was hurled with the mighty force of frenzy a black writhing streak of animate nature into the rushing water and there swept down tossed on the rocks taken up and swirled about and thrown again upon the rocks no longer animate but a part of nature s own to return to his primal elements It was done and Frale looked at his hands helplessly feeling himself a second time a murderer Yet he was in no way more to blame for the first than for this As yet a boy untaught by life he had not learned what to do with the forces within him They rose up madly and mastered him With a man s power to love and hate a man s instincts his untamed nature ready to assert itself for tenderness or cruelty without a man s knowledge of the necessity for self control where some of his kind would have been inert and listless his inheritance had made him intense and fierce Loving and gentle and kind he could be yet when stirred by liquor or anger or fear most terrible His deed had been accomplished with such savage deftness that none pursuing could have guessed the tragedy They might have waited long in the open spaces for the dog s return or the sound of his joyous yelp of recognition but the sacrifice was needless The affectionate creature had been searching on his own behalf careless of the blows with which his master had driven him from his side the day before Trembling Frale crouched again The silence was filled with pain for him The moments swept on even as the water rushed on and the sun began to drop behind the hills leaving the hollows in deepening purple gloom At last deeming that the search for the time must have been given up he crept cautiously toward the great holly tree not for food but for hope There back in the shadow he sat on a huge log his head bowed between his hands and listened Presently the silence was broken by a gentle stirring of the fallen leaves not erratically this time only a steady moving forward of human feet Again Frale s heart bounded and the red sought his cheek but now with a new emotion He knew of but one footstep which would advance toward his ambush in that way Peering out from among the deepest shadows he watched the spot where Cassandra had promised food should be placed for him his eyes no longer a narrow slit of blue but wide and glad his face transformed from the strain of fear with eager joy Soon she emerged walking wearily She carried a bundle of food tied in a cloth and an old overcoat of rough material trailed over one arm These she deposited on the flat stone then stood a moment leaning against the smooth gray hole of the holly tree breathing quickly from the exertion of the steep climb Her eyes followed the undulating line of the mountain above them rising tree fringed against the sky to where the highest peak cut across the setting sun haloed by its long rays of gold No cloud was there but sweeping down the mountain side were the earth mists glowing with iridescent tints draping the crags and floating over the purple hollows the verdure of the pines showing through it all gilded and glorified Cassandra waiting there might have been the dryad of the tree come out to worship in the evening light and grow beautiful So Thryng would have thought could he have seen her with the glow on her face and in her eyes and lighting up the fires in her hair but no such classic dream came to the youth lingering among the shadows ashamed to appear before her bestowing on her a dumb adoration unformed and wordless Because his friend had maudlinly boasted that he was the better man in her eyes and could any day win her for himself he had killed him Despite all the anguish the deed had wrought in his soul he felt unrepentant now as his eyes rested on her He would do it again and yet it was that very boast that had first awakened in his heart such thought of her For years Cassandra had been as his sister although no tie of blood existed between them but suddenly the idea of possession had sprung to life in him when another had assumed the right as his Frale had not looked on her since that moment of revelation of which she was so ignorant and so innocent Now filled with the shame of his deed and his desires he stood in a torment of longing not daring to move His knees shook and his arms ached at his sides and his eyes filled with hot tears Quickly the sun dropped below the edge of the mountain Cassandra drew a long sigh and the glow left her face She looked an instant lingeringly at the articles she had brought and turned sadly away Then he took a step toward her with hands outstretched forgetful of his shame and all except that she was slipping away from him Arrested by the sound of his feet among the leaves she spoke Frale are you there Her voice was low as if she feared other ears than his might hear He did not move again and speak he could not for remembrance rushed back stiflingly and overwhelmed him Descrying his white face in the shadow a pity as deep as his shame filled her heart and drew her nearer Why Frale come out here No one can see you only me Still tongue tied by his emotion he came into the light and stood near her In dismay she looked up in his face The big boy brother who had taken her to the little Carew Crossing station only two months before rough and prankish as the colt he drove but gentle withal was gone He who stood at her side was older Anger had left its mark about his mouth and fear had put a strange wildness in his eyes but there was something else in his reckless set lips that hurt her She shrank from him and he took a step closer Then she placed a soothing hand on his arm and perceived he was quivering She thought she understood and the soft pity moistened her eyes and deepened in her heart Don t be afraid Frale they re gone long ago and won t come back not for a while I reckon He smiled faintly never taking his eyes from her face I hain t afeared o them I hev been but He shook her hand from his arm and made as if he would push her away then suddenly he leaned toward her and caught her in his arms clasping her so closely that she could feel his wildly beating heart Frale Frale Don t Frale You never used to do me this way No I never done you this a way I wisht I had I be n a big fool He kissed her the first kisses of his young manhood on brow and cheeks and lips in spite of her useless writhings He continued muttering as he held her I sinned fer you I killed a man He said he d hev you He lowed he d go down yander to the school whar you war at an marry you an fetch you back I war a fool to low you to go thar fer him to foller an get you I killed him He s dade The short interrupted sentences fell on her ears like blows She ceased struggling and drooping upon his bosom wept sobbing heart brokenly Oh Frale she moaned if you had only told me I could have given you my promise and you would have known he was lying and spared him and saved your own soul He little knew the strength of his arms as he held her Frale I am like to perish you are hurting me so He loosed her and she sank a weary frightened heap at his feet Then very tenderly he gathered her in his arms and carried her to the great flat rock and placed her on the old coat she had brought him You know I wouldn t hurt you fer the hull world Cass He knelt beside her and throwing his arms across her lap buried his face in her dress still trembling with his unmastered emotion She thought him sobbing Can you give me your promise now Cass Now Now Frale your hands are blood guilty she said slowly and hopelessly He grew cold and still waiting in the silence His hands clutched her clothing but he did not lift his head He had shed blood and had lost her They might take him and hang him At last he told her so brokenly and she knew not what to do Gently she placed her hand on his head and drew the thick silken hair through her fingers and the touch to his stricken soul was a benediction The pity of her cooled the fever in his blood and swept over his spirit the breath of healing For the first time after the sin and the horror of it after the passion and its anguish came tears He wept and wiped his tears with her dress Then she told him how her mother had been hurt How Hoyle had driven the half broken colt and the mule all the way to Carew s alone to bring her home and how he had come nigh being killed How a gentleman had helped her when the colt tried to run and the mule was mean and how she had brought him home with her Then he lifted his head and looked at her his haggard face drawn with suffering and the calmness of her eyes still further soothed and comforted him They were filled with big tears and he knew the tears were for him for the change which had come upon him lonely and wretched doomed to hide out on the mountain his clothes torn by the brambles and soiled by the red clay of the holes into which he had crawled to hide himself He rose and sat at her side and held her head on his shoulder with gentle hand Pore little sister pore little Cass I been awful mean an bad he murmured Hit s a badness I cyan t count fer no ways When I seed that thar doctah man I reckon hit war him I seed lyin asleep up yander on Hangin Rock a big tall man right thin an white in the face he paused and swallowed as if loath to continue Frale she cried and would have drawn away but that he held her I didn t hurt him Cass I mount hev I lef him lie thar an never woke him nor teched him but I felt hit here the badness He struck his chest with his fist I lef thar fast an come here Ever sence I killed Ferd hit s be n follerin me

promise now Cass Hit ll save me Then why didn t it save you from killing Ferd she asked O Gawd he moaned and was silent Listen Frale she said at last Can t you see it s sin for you and me to sit here like this like we dared to be sweethearts when you have shed blood for this Take your hands off me and let me go down to mothah Slowly his hold relaxed and his head drooped but he did not move his arms She pushed them gently from her and stood a moment looking down at him His arms dropped upon the stone at his side listless and empty and again her pitying soul reached out to him and enveloped him Frale there is just one way that I can give you my promise she said He held out his arms to her No I can t sit that way you can see that The good book says Ye must repent and be born again He groaned and covered his face with his hands Then you would be a new man without sin I reckon you have suffered a heap and repented a heap since you did that Frale I m feared I m feared ef he war here an riled me agin like he done that time I m feared I d do hit agin like he war talkin bouts you Cass He rose and stood close to her The soft dusk was wrapping them about and she began to fear lest she lose her control over him She took up the bundle of food and placed it in his hand Here take this and the coat too Frale Come down and have suppah with mothah and me to night and sleep in your own bed They won t search here for one while I reckon and you ll be safah than hiding in Wild Cat Hole Hoyle heard them say they reckoned you d lit off down the mountain and were hiding in some near by town They ll hunt you there first come She walked on and he obediently followed When we get nigh the house I ll go first and see if the way is clear You wait back If I want you to run I ll call twice quick and sharp but if I want you to come right in I ll call once low and long After that no word was spoken They clambered down the steep winding path and not far from the house she left him She wondered Nig did not bound out to greet her but supposed he must be curled up near the hearth in comfort Frale also thought of the dog as he sat cowering under the laurel shrubs and set his teeth in anguish and sorrow Cass ll hate hit when she finds out he muttered After a moment waiting and listening he heard her long low call float out to him Falling on his hurt spirit it sounded heavenly sweet CHAPTER V IN WHICH CASSANDRA GOES TO DAVID WITH HER TROUBLE AND GIVES FRALE HER PROMISE After his sleep on Hanging Rock David allured by the sunset remained long in his doorway idly smoking his pipe and ruminating until a normal and delightful hunger sent him striding down the winding path toward the blazing hearth where he had found such kindly welcome the evening before There seated tilted back against the chimney side he found a huge youth innocent of face and gentle of mien who rose as he entered and offered him his chair and smiled and tossed back a falling lock from his forehead as he gave him greeting This hyar is Doctah Thryng Frale who done me up this a way He lows he s goin to git me well so s I can walk again How air you suh You certainly do look a heap better n when you come las evenin So I am indeed And you David s voice rang out gladly He went to the bed and bent above the old woman looking her over carefully Are you comfortable Do the weights hurt you he asked I cyan t say as they air right comfortable but ef they ll help me to git round agin I reckon I can bar hit Early that morning with but the simplest means David had arranged bandages and weights of wood to hold her in position She was so slight he hoped the broken hip might right itself with patience and care more especially as he learned that her age was not so advanced as her appearance had led him to suppose Now all suspicion of him seemed to have vanished from the household Hoyle happy when the fascinating doctor noticed him leaned against his chair drinking in his words eagerly But when Thryng drew him to his knee and discovered the cruel mark across his face and asked how it had happened a curious change crept over them all Every face became as expressionless as a mask only the boy s eyes sought his brother s then turned with a frightened look toward Cassandra as if seeking help Thryng persisted in his examination and lifted the boy s face toward the light If the big brother had done this deed he should be made to feel shame for it The welt barely escaped the eye which was swollen and discolored and altogether the face presented a pitiable appearance As David talked the hard look which had been exorcised for a time by the gentle influence of that home and more than all by the sight of Cassandra performing the gracious services of the household settled again upon the youth s face His lips were drawn and his eyes ceased following Cassandra and became fixed and narrowed on one spot You have come near losing that splendid eye of yours do you know that little chap Hoyle grinned It s a shame you know I have something up at the cabin would help to heal this but he glanced about the room What are those dried herbs up there Thar is witch hazel yandah in the cupboard Cass ye mount bile some up fer th doctah said the mother Tell th doctah hu come hit happened son you hain t afeared of him be ye A trampling of horse s hoofs was heard outside Go up garret to your own place Frale What ye bid n here fer she added in a hushed voice but the youth sat doggedly still Cassandra went out and quickly returned It s your own horse Frale Poor beast He s limping like he s been hurt He s loose out there You better look to him Uncle Carew rode him down an lef him I reckon Frale rose and went out and David continued his care of the child How was it Did your brother hurt you Naw He nevah hurted me all his life Hit war my own se f Cassandra patted the child on his shoulder He can t beah to tell hu come he is hurted this way he is that proud It was a mean bad coward man fetched him such a blow across the face He asked little son something and when Hoyle nevah said a word he just lifted his arm and hit him and then rode off like he had pleased himself A flush of anger kindled in her cheeks Nevah mind son Doctah can fix you up all right A sigh of relief trembled through the boy s lips and David asked no more questions You hain t goin to tie me up that a way be you He pointed to the bed whereon his mother lay and they all laughed relieving the tension Naw shrilled the mother s voice but I reckon doctah mount take off your hade an set hit on straight agin I wisht he could cried the child no whit troubled by the suggestion I d bar a heap fer to git my hade straight like Frale s Just then his brother entered the room You reckon doctah kin take off my hade an set hit straight like you carry yours Frale Again they all laughed and the big youth smiled such a sweet infantile smile as he looked down on his little brother that David s heart warmed toward him He tousled the boy s hair as he passed and drew him along to the chimney side away from the doctor Hit s a right good hade I m thinkin ef hit be set too fer round They is a heap in hit too more n they is in mine I reckon He s gettin too big to set that a way on your knee Frale Ye make a baby of him said the mother The child made an effort to slip down but Frale s arm closed more tightly about him and he nestled back contentedly So the evening passed and Thryng retired early to the bed in the loom shed He knew something serious was amiss but of what nature he could not conjecture unless it were that Frale had been making illicit whiskey Whatever it was he chose to manifest no curiosity In the morning he saw nothing of the young man and as a warm rain was steadily falling he was glad to get the use of the horse and rode away happily in the rain with food provided for both himself and the beast sufficient for the day slung in a sack behind him Reckon ye ll come back hyar this evenin queried the old mother as he adjusted her bandages before leaving I ll see how the cabin feels after I have had a fire in the chimney all day As he left he paused by Cassandra s side She was standing by the spout of running water waiting for her pail to fill If it happens that you need me for anything at all send Hoyle and I ll come immediately Will you She lifted her eyes to his gratefully Thank you was all she said but his look impelled more You are right kind she added Hardly satisfied he departed but turned in his saddle to glance back at her She was swaying sidewise with the weight of the full pail straining one slender arm as she bore it into the house Who did all the work there he wondered That great youth ought to relieve her of such tasks Where was he Little did he dream that the eyes of the great youth were at that moment fixed darkly upon him from the small pane of glass set in under the cabin roof which lighted Frale s garret room David stabled the horse in the log shed built by Doctor Hoyle for his own beast for what is life in the mountains without a horse then lingered awhile in his doorway looking out over the billows of ranges seen dimly through the fine veil of the falling rain Ah wonderful perfect world it seemed to him seen through the veil of the rain The fireplace in the cabin was built of rough stone wide and high and there he made him a brisk fire with fat pine and brushwood He drew in great logs which he heaped on the broad stone hearth to dry He piled them on the fire until the flames leaped and roared up the chimney so long unused He sat before it delighting in it like a boy with a bonfire and blessed his friend for sending him there smoking a pipe in his honor Among the doctor s few cooking utensils he found a stout iron tea kettle and sallied out again in the wet to rinse it and fill it with fresh water from the spring He had had only coffee since leaving Canada now he would have a good cup of decent tea so he hung the kettle on the crane and swung it over the fire In his search for his tea most of his belongings were unpacked and tossed about the room in wild disorder and a copy of Marius the Epicurean was brought to light His kettle boiled over into the fire and immediately the small articles on his pine table were shoved back in confusion to make room for his tea things his bottle of milk his corn pone and his book Being by this time weary he threw himself on his couch and contentment began his hot tea within reach his door wide open to the sweetness of the day his fire dancing and crackling with good cheer and his book in his hand Ah The delicious idleness and rest No disorders to heal no bones to mend no problems to solve a little sipping of his tea a little reading of his book a little luxuriating in the warmth and the pleasant odor of pine boughs burning a little dreamy revery watching through the open door the changing lights on the hills and listening to an occasional bird note liquid and sweet The hour drew near to noon and the sky lightened and a rift of deep blue stretched across the open space before him Lazily he speculated as to how he was to get his provisions brought up to him and when and how he might get his mail but laughed to think how little he cared for a hundred and one things which had filled his life and dogged his days ere this Had he reached Nirvana Nay he could still hunger and thirst A footstep was heard without and a figure appeared in his doorway quietly standing making no move to enter It was Cassandra and he was pleased My first visitor he exclaimed Come in come in I ll make a place for you to sit in a minute He shoved the couch away from before the fire and removing a pair of trousers and a heap of hose from one of his splint bottomed chairs he threw them in a corner and placed it before the hearth You walked didn t you And your feet are wet of course Sit here and dry them She pushed back her sunbonnet and held out to him a quaint little basket made of willow withes which she carried but she took no step forward Although her lips smiled a fleeting wraith of a smile that came and went in an instant he thought her eyes looked troubled as she lifted them to his face He took the basket and lifted the cover I brought you some pa triges she said simply There lay three quail and a large sweet potato roasted in the ashes on their hearth as he had seen the corn pone baked the evening before and a few round white cakes which he afterwards learned were beaten biscuit all warm from the fire How am I ever to repay you people for your kindness to me he said Come in and dry your feet Never mind the mud see how I ve tracked it in all the morning Come He led her to the fire and replenished it while she sat passively looking down on the hearth as if she scarcely heeded him Not knowing how to talk to her or what to do with her he busied himself trying to bring a semblance of order to the cabin occasionally dropping a remark to which she made no response Then he also relapsed into silence and the minutes dragged age long minutes they seemed to him In his efforts at order he spread his rug over the couch tossed a crimson cushion on it and sundry articles beneath it to get them out of his way then occupied himself with his book while vainly trying to solve the riddle which his enigmatical caller presented to his imagination All at once she rose sought out a few dishes from the cupboard and taking a neatly smoothed coarse cloth from the basket spread it over one end of the table and arranged thereon his dinner Quietly David watched her following her example of silence until forced to speak Finally he decided to question her if only he could think of questions which would not trespass on her private affairs when at last she broke the stillness I can t find any coffee I ought to have brought some I ll go fetch some if you ll eat now Your dinner ll get cold He showed her how he had made tea and was in no need of coffee We ll throw this out and make fresh he said gayly Then you must have a cup with me Why you have enough to eat here for three people She seemed weary and sad and he determined to probe far enough to elicit some confidence but the more fluent he became the more effectively she withdrew from him See here he said at last sit by the table with me and I will eat to your heart s content I ll prepare you a cup of tea as I do my own and then I want you to drink it Come She yielded His way of saying Come seemed like a command to be obeyed Now that is more like He began his dinner with a relish Won t you share this game with me It is fine you know He could not think her silent from embarrassment for her poise seemed undisturbed except for the anxious look in her eyes He determined to fathom the cause and since no finesse availed there remained but one way the direct question What is it he said kindly Tell me the trouble and let me help you She looked full into his eyes then and her lips quivered Something rose in her throat and she swallowed helplessly It was so hard for her to speak The trouble had struck deeper than he dreamed It is a trouble isn t it Can t you tell it to me Yes I reckon there isn t any trouble worse than ours no I reckon there is nothing worse Why Miss Cassandra Because it s sin and and the wages of sin is death Her tone was hopeless and the sadness of it went to his heart Is it whiskey he asked Yes it s whiskey stilling and worse it s She turned deathly white Too sad to weep she still held control of her voice It s a heap worse Don t try to tell me what it is he cried Only tell me how I may help you It s not your sin surely so you don t have to bear it It s not mine but I do have to bear it I wish my bearing it was all Tell me if if a man has done such a sin is it right to help him get away If it is that big brother of yours whom I saw last night I can t believe he has done anything so very wicked You say it is not the whiskey Maybe it was the whiskey first then I don t know exactly how came it I reckon he doesn t himself I he s not my brothah not rightly but he has been the same as such They telegraphed me to come home quick Bishop Towahs told me a little all he knew but he didn t know what all was it only some wrong to call the officahs and set them aftah Frale poor Frale He he told me himself last evening She paused again and the pallor slowly left her face and the red surged into her cheeks and mounted to the waves of her heavy hair It is Frale then who is in trouble And you wish me to help him get away She looked down and was silent But I am a stranger and know nothing about the country He pushed his chair away from the table and leaned back regarding her intently Oh I am afraid for him She put her hand to her throat and turned away her face from his searching eyes in shame I prefer not to know what he has done Just explain to me your plan and how I can help You know better than I I can t understand how comes it I can tell you you are a strangah to all of us and yet it seems like it is right If I could get some clothes nobody has evah seen Frale weah if I could make him look different from a mountain boy maybe he could get to some town down the mountain and find work but now they would meet up with him before he was halfway there Thryng rose and began pacing the room Is there any hurry he demanded stopping suddenly before her Yes Then why have you waited all this time to tell me She lifted her eyes to his in silence and he knew well that she had not spoken because she could not and that had he not ventured with his direct questions she would have left him carrying her burden with her as hopelessly silent as when she came He sat beside her again and gently urged her to tell him without further delay all she had in her mind You feel quite sure that if he could get down the mountain side without being seen he would be safe where do you mean to send him You don t think he would try to return Why no I reckon not if I Her face flamed and she drew on her bonnet hiding the crimson flush in its deep shadow She knew that without the promise he had asked the boy would as surely return as that the sun would continue to rise and set He must stay she spoke desperately and hurriedly If he can just make out to stay long enough to learn a little how to live and will keep away from bad men if I he only knows enough to make mean corn liquor now but he nevah was bad He has always been different and he is awful smart I can t think how came he to change so Taking the empty basket with her she walked toward the door and David followed her Thank you for that good dinner he said Aunt Sally fetched the pa triges Her old man got them for mothah and she said you sure ought to have half Sally said the sheriff had gone back up the mountain and I m afraid he ll come to our place again this evening Likely they re breaking up Frale s still now Well that will be a good deed won t it The huge bonnet had hid her face from him but now she lifted her eyes frankly to his with a flash of radiance through her tears I reckon was all she said Are they likely to come up here do you think those men Not hardly They would have to search on foot here It s out of their way only no place on the mountain is safe for Frale now Send him to me quickly then I have cast my lot with you mountain people for some time to come and your cause shall be mine She paused at the door with grateful words on her lips unuttered Don t stop for thanks Miss Cassandra they are wasted between us You have opened your doors to me a stranger and that is enough Hurry don t grieve and see here I may not be able to do anything but I ll try and if I can t get down to night won t you come again in the morning and tell me all about it Instantly he thought better of his request yet who was here to criticise He laughed as he thought how firmly the world and its conventions held him Sweet simple hearted child that she was why indeed should she not come Still he called after her If you are too busy send Hoyle I may be down to see your mother anyway She paused an instant in her hurried walk I ll be right glad to come if I can help you any way He stood watching her until she passed below his view as her long easy steps took her rapidly on although she seemed to move slowly Then he went back to his fire and her words repeated themselves insistently in his mind I ll be right glad to come if I can help you any way Aunt Sally was seated in the chimney corner smoking when Cassandra returned Where is he she cried He couldn t set a minute he was that restless He lowed he d go up to the rock whar you found him las evenin Without a word Cassandra turned and fled up the steep toward the head of the fall Every moment she knew was precious Frale met her halfway down and took her hand leading her as he had been used to do when she was his little sister and listened to her plans docilely enough I mean you to go down to Farington to Bishop Towahs He will give you work She had not mentioned Thryng Frale laughed Don t Frale How can you laugh I ra ly hain t laughin Cass Seems like you fo get how can I get down the mountain but I reckon I ll try if you say so Then she explained how the doctor had sent for him to come up there quickly and how he would help him You must go now Frale you hear Now Again he laughed bitterly this time Yas I reckon he ll be right glad to help me get away from you I ll go myse f in my own way Under the holly tree they had paused and suddenly she feared lest the boy at her side return to his mood of the evening before She seized his hand again and hurried him farther up the steep Come come she cried I ll go with you Frale Naw you won t go with me neithah he said stubbornly drawing back Frale she pleaded Hear to me I m a listenin Frale I m afraid They may be on their way now For all we know they may be right nigh I ve done got used to fearin now Hit don t hurt none On y one thing hurts now I ve been up to see Doctor Thryng and he s promised he ll fix you up some way so that if anybody does see you they they ll think you belong somewhere else and nevah guess who you be Frale go He held her with his arm about her waist half carrying her with him instead of allowing her to move her own free gait and she tried vainly with her fingers to pull his hands away but his muscles were like iron under her touch He felt her helplessness and liked it Her voice shook as she pleaded with him Oh Frale Hear to me she wailed I ll hear to you ef you ll hear to me Seems like I ve lost my fear now I hain t carin no more Ef I should see the sheriff this minute an he war a puttin his rope round my neck right now I wouldn t care thout one thing jes one thing I d walk straight down to hell fer hit I reckon I hev done that but I d walk till I drapped an work till I died for hit He stood still a moment and again she essayed to move his hands but he only held her closer Oh hurry Frale I m afraid Oh Frale don t Be ye feared fer me Cass You know that Frale Leave go and hear to me Be ye feared nough to give me your promise Cass Take your hand off me Frale We ll go back I low they mount es well take me first as last I hain t no heart lef in me I don t care fer that thar doctah man he pin me nohow he choked Leave me go and I ll give you promise for promise Frale I can t make out is it sin or not but if God can forgive and love when you turn and seek Him the Bible do say so Frale but but seem like you don t repent your deed whilst you look at me like that way She paused trembling If you could be sorry like you ought to be Frale and turn your heart I could die for that He still held her but lifted one shaking hand above his head Before God I promise What Frale Say what you promise He still held his hand high All you ask of me Cass Tell me word by word an I ll promise fair You will repent Frale Yas You will not drink I will not drink You will heed when your own heart tells you the right way I will heed when my heart tells me the way hit will be the way to you Cass Oh don t say it that way Frale Now say So help me God and don t think of me whilst you say it Put your hand on mine Cass Lift hit up an say with me that word She placed her palm on his uplifted palm So help me God they said together Then with streaming tears she put her arms about his neck and gently drew his face down to her own I ll go back now Frale and you do all I ve said Go quick I ll write Bishop Towahs and he ll watch out for you and find you work Let Doctah Thryng help you He sure is a good man Oh if you only could write I ll larn You ll have a heap more to learn than you guess I ve been there and I know Don t give up Frale and and stay I hain t going to give up with your promise here Cass kiss me She did so and he slowly released her looking back as he walked away Oh hurry Frale Don t look back It s a bad omen She turned and without one backward glance descended the mountain CHAPTER VI IN WHICH DAVID AIDS FRALE TO MAKE HIS ESCAPE Elated by his talk with Cassandra Frale walked eagerly forward but as he neared Thryng s cabin he moved more slowly Why should he let that doctor help him He could reach Farington some way travelling by night and hiding in the daytime But David was watching for him and strolled down to meet him Good morning Your sister says there is no time to lose Come in here and we ll see if we can find a way out of this trouble Having learned not to expect any response to remarks not absolutely demanding one and not wishing the silence to dominate David talked on as he led Frale into the cabin and carefully closed the door behind them Thryng s intuition was subtle and his nature intense and strong He had been used to dealing with men and knew that when he wished to he usually gained his point Feeling the antagonism in Frale s heart toward himself he determined to overcome it Be it pride jealousy or what not it must give way He had learned only that morning that circumlocution or pretence of any sort would only drive the youth further into his fortress of silence and close his nature a sealed well of turbid feeling against him therefore he chose a manner pleasantly frank taking much for granted and giving the boy no chance to refuse his help by assuming it to have been already accepted We are about the same size I think Yes Here are some things I laid out for you You must look as much like me as possible and as unlike yourself you know Sit here and we ll see what can be done for your head You re right fair an I m dark Oh that makes very little difference It s the general appearance we must get at Suppose I try to trim your hair a little so that lock on your forehead won t give you away I reckon I can do it Hit s makin you a heap o trouble David was pleased to note the boy s mood softening and helped him on I m no hand as a barber but I ll try it a little it s easier for me to get at than for you He quickly and deftly cut away the falling curl and even shaved the corners of the forehead a bit and clipped the eyebrows to give them a different angle All this will grow again you know You only want it to last until the storm blows over The youth surveyed himself in the mirror and smiled but grimly I do look a heap different That s right we want you to look like quite another man And now for your chin You can use a razor here is warm water and soap This suit of clothes is such as we tramp about in at home different from anything you see up here you know I ll take my pipe and book and sit there on the rock and keep an eye out lest any one climb up here to look around and you can have the cabin all to yourself You see what to do make yourself look as if you came from my part of the world Thryng glanced at his watch Work fast but take time enough to do it well Say half an hour will that do Yas I reckon Then David left him and the moments passed until an hour had slipped away but still the youth did not appear and he was on the point of calling out to him when he saw the twisted form of little Hoyle scrambling up through the underbrush They re comin he panted with wild and frightened eyes fixed on David s face I see em up the road an I heered em say they was goin to hunt round the house good an then s arch the cabin ovah Hanging Rock The poor child burst into tears Do you low they ll shoot Frale suh They d not reached the house when you saw them They ll be thar by now suh sobbed the boy Then run and hide yourself Crawl under the rock into the smallest hole you can They mustn t see that you have been here and don t be frightened little man We ll look after Frale The child disappeared like a squirrel in a hole and Thryng went to the cabin door and knocked imperatively It was opened instantly and Frale stood transformed his old soiled garments lying in a heap at his side as if he had crept out of his chrysalis A full half hour he had been lingering abashed at himself and dreading to appear The slight growth of adolescence was gone from lip and chin and Thryng was amazed and satisfied Good he cried You ve done well The youth smiled shamefacedly yet held his head high With the heavy golf stockings knee breeches and belted jacket even to himself he seemed another man and an older man he looked by five years Now keep your nerve and square your shoulders and face the world with a straight look in the eye You ve thrown off the old man with these David touched the heap of clothing on the floor with his foot Hoyle is here He says the men are on their way here and have stopped at the house Instead of turning pale as Thryng had expected a dark flush came into Frale s face and his hand clinched It was the ferocity of fear and not the deadliness of it which seized him with a sort of terrible anger that David felt through his silence Don t lose control of yourself boy he said placing his hand gently on his shoulder and making his touch felt by the intimate closing of his slender fingers upon the firmly rounded lean muscles beneath them Follow my directions and be quick Put your own clothes in this bag He hastily tossed a few things out of his pigskin valise Cram them in that s right Don t leave a trace of yourself here for them to find Pull this cap over your eyes and walk straight down that path and pass them by as if they were nothing to you If they speak to you of course nod to them and pass on But if they ask you a question say politely Beg pardon just like that as though you did not understand and wait Don t hurry away from them as if you were afraid of them They won t recognize you unless you give yourself away by your manner See Now say it over after me Good Take these cigars He placed his own case in the boy s vest pocket Better leave em free suh I don t like to take all your things this a way He handed back the case and put them loose in his pocket Very well If you smoke just light this and walk on and if they ask you anything about yourself if you have seen a chap of the sort understand offer them each a cigar and tell them no Don t say I reckon not for that will give you away and don t lift your cap or they will see how roughly your hair is cut Touch it as if you were going to lift it only so I would take care not to arrive at the house while they are there it will be easier for you to meet them on the path It will be the sooner over Thryng held out his hand and Frale took it awkwardly then turned away swallowing the thanks he did not know how to utter For the time being David had conquered The lad took a few steps and then turned back I d like to thank you suh an I d like to pay fer these here I low to get work an send the money fer em Don t be troubled about that we ll see later Only remember one thing I don t know what you ve done nor why you must run away like this I haven t asked I may be breaking the laws of the land as much as you in helping you off I am doing it because until I know of some downright evil in you I m bound to help you and the best way to repay me will be for you to you know do right Are you doin this fer her He looked off at the hills as he spoke and not at the doctor Yes for her and for you Don t linger now and don t forget my directions The youth turned on the doctor a quick look Thryng could not determine as he thought it over afterward if there was in it a trace of malevolence It was like a flash of steel between them even as they smiled and again bade each other good by For a time all was silent around Hanging Rock Thryng sat reading and pondering expecting each moment to hear voices from the direction Frale had taken He could not help smiling as he thought over his attempt to make this mountain boy into the typical English tourist and how unique an imitation was the result He called out to comfort Hoyle s fearful little heart Your brother s all safe now Come out here until we hear men s voices I better stay whar I be I reckon They won t talk none when they get nigh hyar Are you comfortable down there Yas suh Hoyle was right The two men detailed for this climb walked in silence to give no warning of their approach until they appeared in the rear of the cabin and entered the shed where Frale s horse was stabled Sure were they then that its owner was trapped at last They were greatly surprised at finding the premises occupied David continued his reading unconcerned until addressed Good evenin suh He greeted them genially and invited them into his cabin determined to treat them with as royal hospitality as was in his power To offer them tea was hardly the thing he reasoned so he stirred up the fire while descanting on the beauty of the location and the health giving quality of the air and when his kettle was boiling he brought out from his limited stores whiskey lemons and sugar and proceeded to brew them so fine a quality of English toddy as to warm the cockles of their hearts Questioning them on his own account he learned how best to get his supplies brought up the mountains and many things about the region interesting to him At last one of them ventured a remark about the horse and how he came by him at which he explained very frankly that the widow down below had allowed him the use of the animal for his keep until her son returned They lowed he wa n t comin back to these parts very soon and David expressed satisfaction His evident ignorance of mountain affairs convinced them that nothing was to be gained from him and they asked no direct questions and finally took their departure with a high opinion of their host and quite content Then David called his little accomplice from his hiding place took him into his cabin and taught him to drink tea with milk and sugar in it gave him crisp biscuits from his small remainder in store and still further to comfort his heart searched out a card on which was a picture of an ocean liner on an open sea with flags flying great rolls of vapor and smoke trailing across the sky with white capped waves beneath and white clouds above The boy s eyes shone with delight He twisted himself about to look up in Thryng s face as he questioned him concerning it and almost forgot Frale in his happiness as he trudged home hugging the precious card to his bosom Contentedly Thryng proceeded to set his abode in order after the disarray of the morning undisturbed by any question as to the equity of his deed His mind was in a state of rebellion against the usual workings of the criminal courts and biassed by his observation of the youth he felt that his act might lead as surely toward absolute justice perhaps more surely than the opposite course would have done Erelong he found a few tools carefully packed away as was the habit of his old friend and the labor of preparing his canvas room began But first a ladder hanging under the eaves of the cabin must be repaired and long before the slant rays of the setting sun fell across his hilltop he found himself too weary to descend to the Fall Place even with the aid of his horse With a measure of discouragement at his undeniable weakness he led the animal to water where a spring bubbled sweet and clear in an embowered hollow quite near his cabin then stretched himself on the couch before the fire with no other light than its cheerful blaze too exhausted for his book and disinclined even to prepare his supper After a time David s weariness gave place to a pleasant drowsiness and he rose arranged his bed and replenished the fire drank a little hot milk and dropped into a wholesome slumber as dreamless and sweet as that of a tired child Such a sense of peace and retirement closed around him there alone on his mountain that he slept with his cabin door open to the sweet air crisp and cold lulled by the murmuring of the swaying pine tops without and the crackling and crumbling of burning logs within Rolled in his warm Scotch rug he did not feel the chill that came as his fire burned lower but slept until daybreak when the clear note of a Carolina wren thrice repeated close to his open door sounded his reveille Deeply inhaling the cold air he lay and mused over the events of the previous day How quickly and naturally he had been drawn into the interests of his neighbors below him and had absorbed the peculiar atmosphere of their isolation making a place for himself shutting out almost as if they had never existed the harassments and questionings of his previous life Was it a buoyancy he had received from his mountain height and the morning air Whatever the cause he seemed to have settled with them all and arrived at last where his spirit needed but to rest open and receptive before its Creator to be swept clear of the dross of the world s estimates of values and exalted with aspiration Every long breath he drew seemed to make his mental vision clearer God and his own soul was that all Not quite God and the souls of men and of women of all who came within his environment a world made beautiful made sweet and health giving for these and with them to know God to feel Him near So Christ came to be close to humanity A mist of scepticism that had hung over him and clouded the later years of his young manhood suddenly rolled away dispelled by the splendor of this triumphant thought even as the rays of the rising sun came at the same moment to dispel the earth mists and flood the hills with light Light that was it In Him is no darkness at all Joyously he set himself to the preparation for the day The true meaning of life was revealed to him The discouragement of the evening before was gone Yet now should he sit down in ecstatic dreaming It must be joy in life movement in whatever was to be done whether in satisfying a wholesome hunger in creating warmth for his body or in conquering the seeds of decay and disease therein and keeping it strong and full of reactive power for his soul s sake It was a revelation to him of the eternal God wonder working and all pervading Now no longer with a haunting sense of fear would he search and learn but with a glad perception of the beautiful orderliness of the universe so planned and arranged for the souls of men when only they should learn how to use their own lives and attune themselves to give forth music to the touch of the God of Love A cold bath the pure air and his abstemiousness of the previous evening gave him a compelling hunger and it was with satisfaction he discovered so large a portion of his dinner of yesterday remaining to be warmed for his morning meal What he should do later when dinner time arrived he knew not and he laughed to think how he was living from hour to hour content as the small wren fluting beside his door his care free note Ah yes God s in His heaven all s right with the world The wren s note reminded him of a slender box which always accompanied his wanderings and which had come to light rolled in the jacket which he had given Frale as part of his disguise He opened it and took therefrom the joints of a silver flute How long it had lain untouched He fitted the parts and strolled out to the rock and there as he gazed at the shifting subtle beauty spread all before him and around him he lifted the wandlike instrument to his lips and began to play At first he only imitated the wren a few short notes joyously uttered then as the springs of his own happiness welled up within him he poured forth a tumultuous flood of trills a dancing staccato of mounting notes shifting and falling rising floating away and then returning in silvery echoes bringing their own gladness with them The paean of praise ended the work of the day began and he set himself with all the nervous energy of his nature to the finishing of his canvas room Again ere the completion of the task he found he had been expending his strength too lavishly but this time he accepted his weariness more philosophically glad if only he might labor and rest as the need came Nearly the whole of the glorious day was still left him In moving his couch nearer the door he found his efforts impeded by some heavy object underneath it and discovered to his surprise and almost dismay the identical pigskin valise which Frale had taken away with him the day before How came it there No one he was certain had been near his cabin since Hoyle had trotted home yesterday hugging his picture to his breast David drew it out into the light and opened it There on the top lay the cigars he had placed in the youth s pocket and there also every article of wearing apparel he had seen disappear down the laurel grown path on Frale s lithe body twelve hours or more ago He cast the articles out upon the floor and turned them over wonderingly then shoved them aside and lay down for his quiet siesta He would learn from Cassandra the meaning of this He hoped the young man had got off safely yet the fact of finding his kindly efforts thus thrust back upon him disturbed him Why had it been done As he pondered thereon he saw again the steel blue flash in the young man s eyes as he turned away and resolved to ask no questions even of Cassandra CHAPTER VII IN WHICH FRALE GOES DOWN TO FARINGTON IN HIS OWN WAY Frale felt himself exalted by the oath he had sworn to Cassandra as if those words had lifted the burden from his heart and taken away the stain As he walked away in his disguise it seemed to him that he had acted under an irresistible spell cast upon him by this Englishman who was to bide so near Cassandra to be seen by her every day to be admired by her while he who had the first right must hide himself away from her shielding himself in that man s clothes Fine as they seemed to him they only abashed him and filled him with a sense of obligation to a man he dreaded Like a child realizing his danger only when it was close upon him his old recklessness returned and he moved down the path with his head held high looking neither to the right nor to the left planning how he might be rid of these clothes and evade his pursuers unaided The men climbing toward him as he descended hearing his footsteps above them parted and stood watching only half screened by the thick leaved shrubs not ten feet from him on either side but so elated was he and eager in his plans that he passed them by unseeing and thus Thryng s efforts saved him in spite of himself for so amazed were they at the presence of such a traveller in such a place that they allowed him to pass unchallenged until he was too far below them to make speech possible Later when they found David seated on his rock they assumed the young man to be a friend and thought no further of it Frale soon left the path and followed the stream to the head of the fall where he lingered tormented by his own thoughts and filled with conflicting emotions in sight of his home To go down to the settlement and see the world had its allurements but to go in this way never to return never to feel again the excitement of his mountain life evading the law and conquering its harassments was bitter It had been his joy and delight in life to feel himself masterfully triumphant over those set to take him too cunning to be found too daring and strong to be overcome to take desperate chances and win out all these he considered his right and part of the game of life But to slink away like a hunted fox followed by the dogs of the law because in a blind frenzy he had slain his own friend What if he had promised to repent there was the law after him still If only his fate were a tangible thing to be grappled with To meet a foe and fight hand to hand to the death was not so hard as to yield himself to the inevitable Sullenly he sat with his head in his hands and life seemed to stretch before him leading to a black chasm But one ray of light was there to follow Cass Cass If only he would accept the help offered him and go to the station take his seat in the train and find himself in Farington while still his pursuers were scouring the mountains for him he might he might win out Moodily and stubbornly he resisted the thought At last screened by the darkness he turned out his soiled and torn garments and divesting himself of every article Thryng had given him he placed them carefully in the valise Then relieved of one humiliation he set himself again on the path toward Hanging Rock cabin As he passed the great holly tree where Cassandra had sat beside him he placed his hand on the stone and paused His heart leaned toward her He wanted her Should he go down to her now and refuse to leave her But no He had promised Something warm splashed down upon his hand as he bent over the rock He sprang up ashamed to weep and seizing the doctor s valise plunged on through the shadows up the steep ascent He had no definite idea of how he would explain his act for he did not comprehend his own motives It was only a wordless repugnance that possessed him vague and sullen against this man s offered friendship and his relief was great when he found David asleep before his open door Stealthily he entered and placed his burden beneath the couch gazed a moment at the sleeping face whereon the firelight still played and softly crept away Cassandra should know that she had no need to thank the Englishman for his freedom Then came the weary tramp down the mountain skulking and hiding by day and struggling on again by night taking by paths and unused trails finding his uncertain way by moonlight and starlight barked at by dogs and followed by hounds baying loudly whenever he came near a human habitation wading icy streams and plunging through gorges to avoid cabins or settlements keeping life in him by gnawing raw turnips which had been left in the fields ungathered until at last pallid weary dirty and utterly forlorn he found himself in the half light of the dawn of the fourth day near Farington Shivering with cold he stole along the village street and hid himself in the bishop s grounds until he should see some one astir in the house The bishop had sat late the night before half expecting him for he had received Cassandra s letter also one from Thryng Neither letter threw light on Frale s deed although Cassandra s gave him to understand that something more serious than illicit distilling had necessitated his flight David s was a joyous letter craving his companionship whenever his affairs might bring him near but expressing the greatest contentment When Black Carrie went out to unlock the chicken house door and fetch wood for her morning fire she screamed with fright as the young man in his wretched plight stepped before her G long yo pore white trash she cried I m no poor white trash he murmured Be Bishop Towah in the house company se he in de haouse Whar yo s poses he be dis time de mawnin She made with all haste toward her kitchen bearing her armful of wood muttering as she went I reckon I ll set hyar ontwell he kin see me he said dropping to the doorstep in sheer exhaustion And there he was allowed to sit while she prepared breakfast in her own leisurely way having no intention of disturbing her white folkses fer no sech trash The odor of coffee and hot cakes was maddening to the starving boy as he watched her through the open door yet he passively sat withdrawn into himself seeking in no way either to secure a portion of the food or to make himself known After a time he heard faintly voices beyond the kitchen and knew the family must be there at breakfast but still he sat saying nothing At last the door of the inner room was burst open and a child ran out demanding scraps for her puppy I may I may too feed him in the dining room Mamma says I may after we re through Go off honey chile mussin de flo like dat a way fer me to clean up agin Naw honey Go out on de stoop wif yer fool houn dog And the tiny fair girl with her plate of scraps and her small black dog leaping and dancing at her heels tumbled themselves out where Frale sat Scattering her crusts as she ran she darted back calling Papa papa A man s come He s here The small dog further emphasized the fact by barking fiercely at the intruder albeit from a safe distance Yas said Carrie as the bishop came out led by his little daughter he b en hyar sence long fo sun up Why didn t you call me he said sternly Sho how I know anybody wan see yo hangin roun de back do He ain say nuthin jes set dar She continued muttering her crusty dislike of tramps as the bishop led his caller through her kitchen and sent his little daughter to look after her puppy He took Frale into his private study and presently returned and himself carried him food placing it before him on a small table where many a hungry caller had been fed before Then he occupied himself at his desk while he quietly observed the boy He saw that the youth was too worn and weak to be dealt with rationally at first and he felt it difficult to affix the thought of a desperate crime upon one so gentle of mien and innocent of face but he knew his people well and what masterful passions often slept beneath a mild and harmless exterior Nor was it the first time he had been called upon to adjust a conflict between his own conscience and the law Often in his office of priest he had been the recipient of confidences which no human pressure of law could ever wrest from him So now he proceeded to draw from Frale his full and free confession Very carefully and lovingly he trespassed in the secret chambers of this troubled soul until at last the boy laid bare his heart He told of the cause of his anger and his drunken quarrel of his evasion of his pursuers and his vow with Cassandra before God of his rejection of Doctor Thryng s help and his flight by night of his suffering and hunger All was told without fervor a simple passive narration of events No one could believe while listening to him that storms of passion and hatred and fear had torn him or the overwhelming longing he had suffered at the thought of Cassandra But when the bishop touched on the subject of repentance the hidden force was revealed It was as if the tormenting spirit within him had cried out loudly instead of the low monotonous tone in which he said Yas I kin repent now he s dade but ef he war livin an riled me agin that a way like he done I reckon I reckon God don t want no repentin like I repents It was steel against flint the spark in the narrow blue line of his eyes as he said the words and the bishop understood But what to do with this man of the mountains this force of nature in the wild how guard him from a far more pernicious element in the civilized town life than any he would find in his rugged solitudes And Cassandra The bishop bowed his head and sat with the tips of his fingers pressed together The thought of Cassandra weighed heavily upon him She had given her promise with the devotion of her kind to save had truly offered herself a living sacrifice All hopes for her growth into the gracious womanhood her inheritance impelled her toward her sweet ambitions for study gone to the winds scattered like the fragrant wild rose petals on her own hillside doomed by that promise to live as her mother had lived and like other women of her kin to age before her time with the bearing of children in the midst of toil too heavy for her dispirited by privation and the sorrow of relinquished hopes Oh well the bishop knew He dreaded most to see the beautiful light of aspiration die out of her eyes and her spirit grow sordid in the life to which this untamed savage would inevitably bring her What a waste And again he repeated the words What a waste The youth looked up thinking himself addressed but the bishop saw only the girl It was as if she rose and stood there dominant in the sweet power of her girlish self sacrifice appealing to him to help save this soul Somehow at the moment he failed to appreciate the beauty of such giving Almost it seemed to him a pity Frale had thus far succeeded in evading his pursuers It would have saved her in spite of herself had he been taken But now the situation was forced upon the bishop either to give him up which seemed an arbitrary taking into his own hands of power which belonged only to the Almighty or to shield him as best he might giving heed to the thought that even if in his eyes the value of the girl was immeasurably the greater yet the youth also was valued or why was he here He lifted his head and saw Frale s eyes fixed upon him sadly almost as if he knew the bishop s thoughts Yes here was a soul worth while Plainly there was but one course to pursue and but one thread left to hold the young man to steadfast purpose Using that thread he would try If he could be made to sacrifice for Cassandra some of his physical joy of life seeking to give more than to appropriate to himself for his own satisfaction if he could teach him the value of what she had done could he rise to such a height and learn self control The argument for repentance having come back to him void the bishop began again You tell me Cassandra has given you her promise What are you going to do about it Hit s twixt her an me said the youth proudly No thundered the bishop all the man in him roused to beat into this crude triumphant animal some sense of what Cassandra had really done No It s betwixt you and the God who made you You have to answer to God for what you do He towered above him and bending down looked into Frale s eyes until the boy cowered and looked down with lowered head and there was silence Then the bishop straightened himself and began pacing the room At last he came to a stand and spoke quietly You have Cassandra s promise what are you going to do about it Frale did not move or speak and the bishop felt baffled What was going on under that passive mask he dared not think To talk seemed futile like hammering upon a flint wall but hammer he must and again he tried You have taken a man s life do you know what that means Hangin I reckon If it were only to hang boy it might be better for Cassandra Think about it If I help you and shield you here what are you going to do What do you care most for in all this world You who can kill a man and then not repent He hadn t ought to have riled me like he done I keer fer her More than for Frale Farwell The boy looked vaguely before him I reckon was all he said Again the bishop paced the floor and waited I hain t afeared to work right hard Good what kind of work can you do Frale flushed a dark red and was silent Yes I know you can make corn whiskey but that is the devil s work You re not to work for him any more Again silence At last in a low voice he ventured I ll do any kind o work you all gin me to do ef ef only the officers will leave me be an I tol Cass I d larn writin Good very good Can you drive a horse Yes of course Frale s eyes shone I reckon The bishop grew more hopeful The holy greed for souls fell upon him The young man must be guarded and watched he must be washed and clothed as well as fed and right here the little wife must be consulted He went out leaving the youth to himself and sought his brown eyed sweet faced little wisp of a woman where she sat writing his most pressing business letters for him Dearest may I interrupt you In a minute James in a minute I ll just address these He dropped into a deep chair and waited with troubled eyes regarding her There She rubbed vigorously down on the blotter These are all done every blessed one James Now what In an instant she was curled up feet and all like a kitten in his lap her small brown head its wisps of fine straight hair straying over temples and rounded cheeks tucked comfortably under his chin and thus every point was carefully talked over With many exclamations of anxiety and doubt and much discreet suggestion from the small adviser it was at last settled Frale was to be properly clothed from the missionary boxes sent every year from the North He should stay with them for a while until a suitable place could be found for him Above all things he must be kept out of bad company Oh dear Poor Cassandra After all her hopes and she might have done so much for her people if only Tears stood in the brown eyes and even ran over and dropped upon the bishop s coat and had to be carefully wiped off for as he feelingly remarked I can t go about wearing my wife s tears in plain view now can I And then Doctor Hoyle s young friend she must hear his letter How interesting he must be Couldn t they have him down And when the bishop next went up the mountain might she accompany him Oh no The trip was not too rough It was quite possible for her She would go to see Cassandra and the old mother Poor Cassandra But the self respecting old stepmother and her daughter did not allow these kind friends to trespass on any missionary supplies for Uncle Jerry was despatched down the mountain with a bundle on the back of his saddle which was quietly left at the bishop s door and Frale next appeared in a neat suit of homespun home woven and dyed and home made clothing CHAPTER VIII IN WHICH DAVID THRYNG MAKES A DISCOVERY Standing on the great hanging rock before his cabin Thryng imagined himself absolutely solitary in the centre of a wide wilderness Even the Fall Place where lived the Widow Farwell although so near was not visible from this point but when he began exploring the region about him now on foot and now on horseback he discovered it to be really a country of homes Every mule path branching off into what seemed an inaccessible wild led to some cabin often set in a hollow on a few acres of rich soil watered by a never failing spring where the forest growth had been cut away to make cultivation possible Sometimes the little log house would be perched like a lonely eagle s nest on a mere shelflike ledge jutting out from the mountain wall but always below it or above it or off at one side he found the inevitable pocket of rich soil accumulated by the wash of years where enough corn and cow peas could be raised for cattle and cotton and a few sheep to provide material for clothing the family with a few fowls and pigs to provide their food Here they lived those isolated people in quiet independence and contented poverty craving little and often having less caring nothing for the great world outside their own environment looking after each other in times of sickness and trouble keeping alive the traditions of their forefathers and clinging to the ancient family feuds and friendships from generation to generation David soon learned that they had among themselves their class distinctions certain among them holding their heads high in the knowledge of having a self respecting ancestry and training their children to reckon themselves no common trash however much they deprecated showing the pride that was in them Many days passed after Frale s departure before David learned more of the young man s unhappy deed He had gone down to give the old mother some necessary care and finding her alone remained to talk with her Pleased with her quaint expressions and virile intellect he led her on to speak of her youth and one morning weary of the solitude and silence she poured out tales of Cassandra s father and how after his death she came to marry Farwell She told of her own mother and the hard times that fell upon them during the bitter days of the Civil War The traditions of her family were dear to her and she was well pleased to show this young doctor who had found the key to her warm yet reserved heart that she wa n t no common trash and her chillen wa n t like the run o chillen Seems like I m talkin a heap too much o we uns she said at last No no Go on You say you had no school how did you learn You were reading your Bible when I came in No Thar wa n t no schools in my day not nigh enough fer me to go to Maw she could read an write too but aftah paw jined the ahmy she had to work right ha d and had nothin to do with Paw he had to jine one side or t othah Some went with the North and some went with the South they didn t keer much The wa n t no niggahs up here to fight ovah But them war cruel times when the bushwackers come searchin round an raidin our homes They were a bad lot most of em war desertahs from both ahmies We uns war obleeged to hide in the bresh or up the branch anywhar we could find a place to creep into Them were bad times fer the women an chillen left at home Maw used to save ev y scrap of papah she could find with printin on hit to larn we uns our lettahs off n One time come long a right decent captain and axed maw could she get he an his men suthin to eat He had nigh about a dozen sogers with him an maw she done the bes she could cooked corn bread an chick n an sich I c n remember how he sot right on the hearth where you re settin now an tossed flapjacks fer th hull crowd He war right civil when he lef an said he d like to give maw suthin but they hadn t nothin but Confed rate money an hit wa n t worth nothin up here an maw said would he give her the newspapah he had She seed the end of hit standin out of his pocket an he laughed and give hit out quick an axed her what did she want with hit and she lowed she could teach me a heap o readin out o that papah an he laughed again an said likely fer that hit war worth more n the money All the schoolin I had war just that thar papah an that old spellin book you see on the shelf I c n remembah how maw come by that too Tell me how she came by the spelling book will you Hit war about that time Paw he nevah come home again I cyan t remembah much bouts my paw Maw used to say a heap o times if she only had a spellin book like she used to larn out n at she could larn we uns right smart Well one day one o the neighbors told her at he d seed one at Gerret s ovah t othah side Lone Pine Creek nigh about eight mile I reckon an she lowed she d get hit So she sont we uns ovah to Teasley s mill she war that scared o the Gorillas she didn t like leavin we uns home alone an she walked thar an axed could she do suthin to earn that thar book an ol Miz Gerret she lowed if maw d come Monday follerin an wash fer her at she mount have hit Them days we uns an the Teasleys war right friendly The wa n t no feud twixt we uns an Teasleys then but now I reckon thar s bound to be blood feud She spoke very sadly and waited leaving the tale of the spelling book half told Why must there be blood feud now Why can t you go on in the old way Hit s Frale done hit He an Ferd nan Teasley they set up stillin ovah in Dark Cornder yandah Hit do work a heap o trouble that thar I reckon you uns don t have nothin sich whar you come from We have things quite as bad So they quarrelled did they Yaas they quarrelled an they fit No doubt they had been drinking Yas I reckon But just a drunken quarrel between those two ought not to affect all the rest Couldn t you patch it up among you and keep the boy at home You must need his help on the place We need him bad here but the is no way fer to make up an right a blood feud Frale done them mean He lifted his hand an killed his friend Hit war Sunday evenin he done hit They had been havin a singin thar at the mill an preachah he war thar too an all war kind an peaceable an Ferd an Frale they sot out fer thar still Ferd on foot an Frale rid n his horse the one you have now they used to go that a way rid n turn about one horse with them an one horse kep alluz hid nigh the still lest the gov nment men come on em suddent like Frale he war right cute he nevah war come up with Pears like they stopped fore they d gone fer disputin bouts somethin Ol Miz Teasley say she heered ther voices high an loud an then she heered a shot right quick that a way an nothin more an she sont ol man Teasley an the preachah out an the hull houseful follered an thar they found Ferd lyin shot dade an Frale he an the horse war gone Ferd he still held his own gun in his hand tight like he war goin to shoot with the triggah open an his fingah on hit but he nevah got the chance Likely if he had hit would have been him a hidin now an Frale dade I reckon so Thryng listened in silence It made him think of the old tales of the Scottish border So in plain words the young man was a murderer With deep pity he recalled the haunted look in Frale s eyes and the sadness that trembled around Cassandra s lips as she said I reckon there is no trouble worse than ours A thought struck him and he asked Do you know what they quarrelled about He nevah let on what all was the fuss Likely he told Cass but she is that still Hit s right hard to raise a blood feud thar when we uns an the Teasleys alluz war friends She took keer o me when my chillen come an I took keer o her with hern Ferd nan too he war like my own fer I nursed him when she had the fever an her milk lef her Cass war only three weeks old then an he war nigh on a year but that little an sickly he like to a died if I hadn t took him She paused and wiped away a tear that trickled down the furrow of her thin cheek If hit war lef to us women fer to stir em up I reckon thar wouldn t be no feuds fer hit s hard on we uns when we re friendly an Ferd like my own boy that a way But perhaps David spoke musingly perhaps it was a woman who stirred up the trouble between them The widow looked a moment with startled glance into his face then turned her gaze away I reckon not The is no woman far or near as I evah heern o Frale goin with Still pondering David rose to go but quickly resumed his seat and turned her thoughts again to the past He would not leave her thus sad at heart Won t you finish telling me about the spelling book I forget how come hit but maw didn t leave we chillen to Teasleys that day she went to do the washin Likely Miz Teasley war sick anyway she lef us here She baked corn bread hit war all we had in the house to eat them days an she fotched water fer the day an kivered up the fire Then she locked the door an took the key with her an tol we uns did we hear a noise like anybody tryin to get in to go up garret an make out like thar wa n t nobody to home The war three o us chillen I war the oldest We war Caswells my fam ly My little brothah Whitson he war sca cely more n a baby runnin round pullin things down on his hade whar he could reach an Cotton war mos as much keer that reckless She paused and smiled as she recalled the cares of her childhood then wandered on in her slow narration They done a heap o things that day to about drive me plumb crazy an all the time we was thinkin we heered men talkin or horses trompin outside an kep ourselves right busy runnin up garret to hide Along towa ds night hit come on to snow an then turned to rain a right cold hard rain an we war that cold an hungry an Whit he cried fer maw an hit come dark an we had et all the war to eat long before so we had no suppah an the poor leetle fellers war that cold an shiverin thar in the dark I made em climb into bed like they war an kivered em up good an thar I lay tryin to make out like I war maw gettin my arms round both of em to oncet Whit cried hisself to sleep but Cotton he kep sayin he heered men knockin round outside an at last he fell asleep too He alluz war a natch ly skeered kind o child Then I lay thar still list nin to the rain beat on the roof an thinkin would maw ever get back again an list nin to hear her workin with the lock hit war a padlock on the outside an thar I must o drapped off to sleep that a way fer I didn t hear nothin no more until I woke up with a soft murmurin sound in my ears an thar I seed maw The rain had stopped an hit war mos day I reckon with a mornin moon shinin in an fallin on her whar she knelt by the bed clost nigh to me I can see hit now that long line o white light streamin acrost the floor an fallin on her makin her look like a white ghost spirit an her two hands held up with that thar book twixt em I knew hit war maw fer I d seed her pray before but I war skeered fer all that I lay right still an held my breath an heered her thank the Lord fer keerin fer we uns whilst she war gone an fer lowin her to get that thar book I don t guess she knew I seed her fer she got up right still an soft like not to wake we uns an began to light the fire an make some yarb tea She war that wet an cold I could see her hand shake whilst she held the match to the light ud stick Them days maw made coffee out n burnt corn bread an tea out n dried blackberry leaves an sassafrax root She paused and turned her face toward the open door David thought she had lost somewhat the appearance of age certainly what with the long rest and Cassandra s loving care she had no longer the weary haggard look that had struck him when he saw her first Following the direction of her gaze he went to the shelf and took down the old spelling book and turned the leaves now limp and worn So this was Cassandra s inheritance part of it the inward impulse that would urge to toil all day then walk miles in rain and darkness through a wilderness and thank the Lord for the privilege to own this book not for herself but for the generations to come David touched it reverently glad to know so much of her past and turned to the old mother for more Have you anything else like this Her sharp eyes sparkled as she looked narrowly at him I have suthin at I hain t nevah told anybody livin a word of not even Doctah Hoyle only he war some differ nt from you But I m gettin old an I may as well tell you Likely with all your larnin you can tell me is it any good to Cass She be that sot on all sech She fumbled at her throat a moment and drew from the bosom of her gown a leather shoe lacing from which dangled an iron key Slowly she undid the knot and handed it toward him I nevah low nobody on earth to touch that thar box an the ain t a soul livin knows what s in hit I been gyardin them like they war gold fer they belonged to my ol man the first one Cassandra s fathah but I reckon if I die the won t nobody see any good in them things If you ll onlock that thar padlock on that box yander you ll find it wropped in a piece o gingham My paw s mothah spun an wove that gingham ol Miz Caswell They don t many do work like that nowadays They lived right whar we a livin now David unlocked the chest and lifted the heavy lid Hit s down in the further cornder that s hit I reckon Just step to the door will you an see is they anybody nigh He went to the door but saw no one only from the shed came an intermittent rat tat tat I don t see any one but I hear some one pounding Hit s only Hoyle makin his traps She sighed then slowly and tenderly untied the parcel and placed in his hands two small leather bound books Tied to one by a faded silk cord which marked the pages was a thin worn ring of gold That ring war his maw s an when we war married I wore hit but when I took Farwell fer my ol man I nevah wore hit any more fer he lowed bein hit war gold that a way we d ought to sell hit That time I took the lock off n the door an put hit on that thar box Hit war my gran maw s box an I done wore the key hyar evah since Can you tell what they be Hit s the quarest kind of print I evah see He used to make out like he could read hit Likely he did fer whatevah he said he done It seemed to her little short of a miracle that any one could read it but David soon learned that her confidence in her first old man was unlimited What all s in hit She grew restless while he carefully and silently examined her treasure the true significance of which she so little knew Filled with amazement and with a keen pleasure he took the books to the light The print was fine even and clear What all be they she reiterated Reckon the re no good David smiled In one way they re all the good in the world but not for money you know No I don t guess Can you read that thar quare printin Yes The letters are Greek and these books are about a hundred years old Be they Then they won t be much good to Cass I reckon He sot a heap by them but I war feared they mount be heathen Greek that thar be heathen Hain t hit David continued speaking more to himself than to her They were published in London in eighteen twelve They have been read by some one who knew them well I can see by these marginal notes What be they Her curiosity was eager and intent They are explanations and comments written here on the margin see with a fine pen His grandpaw done that thar What be they about anyhow They are very old poems written long before this country was discovered An that must a been before the Revolution His grandpaw fit in that The is somethin more in thar I kept hit hid fer Farwell he war bound to melt hit up fer silver bullets He lowed them bullets war plumb sure to kill Reckon you can find hit Thar tis Her eyes shone as Thryng drew out another object also wrapped in gingham Hit s a teapot I guess but Farwell he got a hold of hit an melted off the spout to make his silvah bullets That time I hid all in the box an put on the bolt an lock whilst he war away stillin The is one bullet left but I reckon Frale has hit David took it from her hand and turned it about Surely This is a treasure Here is a coat of arms but it is so worn I can t make out the emblem Was this your husband s also Is there anything else That s all Yes they war hisn I war plumb mad at Farwell I nevah could get ovah what he done all so t he mount sure kill somebody Likely he meant them bullets fer the revenue officers should they come up with him It would have been a great pity if he had destroyed this mark I think I m not sure but if it s what I imagine it is from an old family in Wales I reckon you re right fer they were Welsh his paw s folks way back He used to say the wa n t no name older n hisn since the Bible I told him twar time he got a new one if twere that old but he said he reckoned a name war like whiskey hit needed a right smart o age to make hit worth anything Thryng laid the antique silver pot on the bed beside the old mother s hand and again took up the small volumes As he held them a thought flashed through his mind yet hardly a thought it was more of an illumination like a vista suddenly opened through what had seemed an impenetrable impalpable wall beyond which lay a joy yet to be but before unseen In that instant of time a vision appeared to him of what life might bring glorified by a tender light as of red fire seen through a sweet blue obscuring mist and making thus a halo about the one figure of the vision outlined against it clear and fine Pears like you find somethin right interestin in that book be you readin hit I find a glorious prophecy Was your first husband born and raised here as you were Not on this spot but he was born an raised like we uns here in the mountains ovah th other side Pisgah I seed him first when I

want to She won t keer I reckon She hain t had a mite o time since she come home to look at em But David thought better of it He would not look in her basket and pry among her treasures without her permission When is she coming back he asked awakened to desire further knowledge of the silent girl s aspirations Soon I reckon She s been a right smart spell longah now n she lowed she d be Hit s old man Irwin He s been hurted some way She went ovah to see could Aunt Sally Carew go an help Miz Irwin keer fer him she s a fool thing don t know nothin They sont down fer me but here I be so she rode the colt ovah fer Sally David wrapped and tied the piece of silver as he had found it As he replaced it in the box he discovered the pieces of the broken fiddle loosely tied in a sack precious relics of a joy that was past Carefully he locked the box and returned the key but the books he folded in the strip of gingham and carried away with him I ll be back to night or in the morning If she doesn t return send Hoyle for me You mustn t be too long alone Shall I mend the fire He threw on another log then lifted her a little and brought her a glass of cool water and climbed back to his cabin walking lightly and swiftly CHAPTER IX IN WHICH DAVID ACCOMPANIES CASSANDRA ON AN ERRAND OF MERCY Filled with the enthusiasm of his thoughts David climbed too rapidly and now he found he must take the more gradual rise of the mule trail without haste His cap thrust in his pocket the breeze lifted his hair and dried the perspiration which would still come with any too eager exertion But why should he care Even to be alive these days was joy This was continually the refrain of his heart nor had he begun to exhaust his resources for entertainment in his solitary life Never were the days too long Each was filled with such new and lively interest as to preclude the thought of ennui To provide against it he had sent for books more than he had had time to read in all the busy days of the last three years These and his microscope and his surgical instruments had been brought him on a mule team by Jerry Carew who did his toting for him fetching all he needed for work or comfort in this way from the nearest station where goods could be sent until the hotel opened in the early summer Not that he needed them but that as an artist loves to keep a supply of paints and canvas or a writer even when idle is happier to know that he has at hand plenty of pens and blank paper he liked to have them Thus far he had felt no more need of his books than he had for his surgical instruments but now he was glad he had them for the sake of the girl who was that sot on all such He would open the box the moment he had eaten and look them over The little brother should take them down to her one at a time or better he would take them himself and watch the smile which came so rarely and sweetly to play about her lips and in her eyes and vanish Surely he had a right to that for his pains He heard the sound of rapid hoof beats approaching across the level space from the cabin above him and looking up as if conjured from his innermost thought he saw her coming allowing the colt to swing along as he would Her bonnet hung by the strings from her arm her hair blew in crinkling wisps across her face and the rapid exercise had brought roses into the creamy whiteness of her skin She kept to the brow of the ridge and would have passed him unseeing her eyes fixed on the distant hills had he not called to her in his clear Alpine jodel She reined in sharply and slipping from the saddle walked quickly to him leading the colt which was warm and panting as if he had carried her a good distance at that pace Oh Doctor Thryng we need you right bad That s why I took this way home Have you been to the house Yes I have just come from there Is mother all right Doing splendidly He waited and she lifted her face to him anxiously We need you bad Doctor Yes but not you you re not he began stupidly It s mister Irwin I went there to see could I help any and seemed like I couldn t get here soon enough When I found you were not at home I was that troubled Can can you go up there and see why I can t rest for thinking he s a heap worse than he reckons He thinks he s better but but Come in and rest and tell me about it Mistress Irwin isn t quite well and I must go back as soon as I can get everything done at home I must get dinner for mother and Hoyle You have been that kind to mother I thought I thought if you could only see him they can t spare him to die Indeed I ll go gladly But you must tell me more so that I may know what to take with me What is the matter with the man Is he ill or hurt Let me oh you are an independent young woman She had turned from him to mount and he stepped forward with outstretched hand to aid her but in a breath not seeing his offer she placed her two hands on the horn of the saddle and from the slight rise of ground whereon she stood with one agile spring landed easily in the saddle and wheeled about He s been cutting trees to clear a patch for corn and some way he hurt his foot and he s been lying there nigh a week with the misery Last evening she sent one of the children for mother not knowing she was bad herself so I went for Aunt Sally but she was gone so I rode on to the Irwins to see could I help He said he wasn t suffering so much to day and it made my heart just stop to hear that when he couldn t lift himself You see my stepfather he he was shot in the arm and right soon when the misery left him he died so I didn t say much but on the way home I thought of you and I came here fast We know so little here on the mountains she added sadly as she looked earnestly down at him You have acted wisely Just ride on Miss Cassandra and I will follow as soon as Come down with me now and have dinnah at our place Then we can start togethah Thank you I will You are more expert in the art of dinner getting than I am so we will lose less time He laughed and was rewarded with the flash of a grateful smile as she started on without another word It took David but a few minutes to select what articles he suspected from her account might be required He hurried his preparations and being his own groom stable boy and man of all work he was very busy about it As a strain of music or a floating melody will linger in the background with insistent repetition while the brain is at the same time busily occupied with surface affairs so he found himself repeating some of her quaint phrases and seeing her eyes the wisps of wind blown hair and the smile on her lips as she turned away like an accompaniment to all he was thinking and doing Soon equipped for whatever the emergency might demand he was at the widow s door His horse nickered and stretched out his nose toward Cassandra s colt as if glad to have once more a little horse companionship Side by side they stood with bridles slipped back and hung to their saddles while they crunched contentedly at the corn on the ear which Hoyle had brought them While at dinner Cassandra showed David her books pleased that he asked to see them I brought them to study should I get time It s right hard to give up hope she glanced at her mother and lowered her voice To stop anyhow I thought I might teach Hoyle a little Ah these are mostly school books he said glancing them over Yes I was at school this time near Farington it was Once I stayed with Bishop Towahs and helped do housework I could learn a heap there between times They let me have all the books I wanted to read She looked lovingly at her few precious school books I haven t touched these since I got back we re that busy Then she resumed her work about the house cooking at the fireplace waiting upon David and serving her mother while directing Hoyle what to do should she be detained that night He demurred and hung about her begging her not to stay I won t son without I can t help it You won t care so much now mother s not bad like she was Yas I will he mourned I reckon I ll have to call you baby again said his mother You re gettin that babyfied since Cass come back doin all fer ye You has a heap o company Thar s the cow to keer fer n ol Pete hollerin at ye an the chickens tellin how many aigs they ve laid fer ye Run now Thar s ol Frizzle cacklin Get the aig an we ll send hit to the pore sick man Thar Cass she added as Hoyle ran out half ashamed to do her bidding hit s your own fault fer makin such a baby of him I low you betteh take long a few fresh aigs likely they ll need em so triflin they be I don t guess you ll find a thing in the house fer him to eat Cassandra packed one of her oddly shaped little baskets as her mother suggested for the sadly demoralized and distracted family to which they were going and tucked in with the rest the warm newly laid egg Hoyle brought her smiling indulgently and kissing his upturned face as she took it from him Toward David she was always entirely simple and natural except when abashed by his speech which seemed to her most elaborate and sometimes mystifying She would pause and gaze on him an instant when he extended to her a courtesy as if to give it its exact value Not that she in the least distrusted him quite the contrary but that she was wholly unused to hearing phrased courtesies or enthusiasms expressed in the form of words She had seen something of it in the bishop s pretty complimentary pleasantries with his wife but David s manner of handing her a chair offering her a suggestion with a May I be allowed was foreign to her and she accepted such remarks with a moment s hesitation and a certain aloofness hardly understood by him He found himself treating her with a measure of freedom from the constraint which men often place upon themselves because of the recognition of the personal element which will obtrude between them and femininity in general He recognized the reason for this in her absolute lack of coquetry toward him but analyze the phenomenon as yet he could not To her he was a being from another world strange and delightful but set as far from her as if the sea divided them She turned toward him sweet expectant eyes She listened attentively gropingly sometimes She would understand him if she could would learn from him and trust him implicitly but her femininity never obtruded itself Her personality seemed to be enclosed within herself and never to lean toward him with the subtile flattery men feel and like to awaken but which they often fear to arouse when they wish to remain themselves unstirred Her dignified poise and perfect freedom from all arts to attract his favor and attention pleased him but while it gave him the safe and unconstrained feeling when with her it still piqued his man s nature a little to see her so capable of showing tenderness to her own yet so unstirred by himself Cassandra had never been up to his cabin when he was there until to day since the morning she came to consult him about Frale nor had that young man s name been uttered between them David had said nothing to her of the return of the valise not wishing to touch on the subject unless she gave the opportunity for him to ask what she knew about it Now since his morning s talk with her mother had envisioned an ideal and shown a glory beyond he was glad to have this opportunity of being alone with her and of sounding her depths For a long time they rode in silence and he remembered her mother s words He may have told Cass but she is that still She carried her basket carefully before her on the pommel of her saddle Gradually the large sunbonnet which quite hid her face slipped back and the sun lighted the bronze tints of her hair As he rode at her side he studied her watchfully so simply dressed in homespun material which had faded from its original color to a sort of turquoise green The stuff was heavy and clung closely to her figure and she rode easily perched on her small old fashioned side saddle swaying with lithe movement to the motion of her horse She wore no wrap only a soft silk kerchief knotted about her neck the fluttering ends of which caressed her chin Her cheeks became rosy with the exercise and her gray eyes under the green pines and among the dense laurel thickets took on a warm luminous green tint like the hue of her dress David at last found it difficult to keep his eyes from her this veritable flower of the wilderness and all this time no word had been spoken between them How impersonal and far away from him she seemed While he was filled with interest in her and eager to learn the secret springs of her life she was riding on and on swaying to her horse as a flower on its slender stem sways in a breeze as undisturbed by him as if she were not a human breathing girl subject to man s dominating power Was she then so utterly untouched by his masculine presence he wondered If he did not speak first would she keep silent forever Should he wait and see Should he will her to speak and of herself unfold to him Suddenly she turned and looked clearly and pleasantly in his eyes We ll be on a straight road for a piece after this hill shall we hurry a little then Certainly if you think best You set the pace and I ll follow Again silence fell Do you feel in a hurry he asked at length I would like to get there soon We can t tell what might be She pressed her hand an instant to her throat and drew in her breath as if something hurt her What is it he asked drawing his horse nearer Nothing Only I wish we were there now You are suffering in anticipation and it isn t necessary Better not indeed Think of something else Yes suh The two little words sounded humbly submissive He had never been so baffled in an endeavor to bring another soul into a mood responsive to his own This gentle acquiescence was not what he wished but that she should reveal herself and betray to him even a hint a gleam of the deep undercurrent of her life Suddenly they emerged on the crest of a narrow ridge from which they could see off over range after range of mountain peaks on one side growing dimmer bluer and more evanescent until lost in a heavenly distance and on the other side a valley dropping down and down into a deep and purple gloom richly wooded and dense surrounded by precipices topped with scrubby wind blown pines and oaks a wild and rocky descent into mystery and seclusion Here and there a slender thread of smoke intensely blue rose circling and filtering through the purple density against a black green background of hemlocks Contrasted with the view on the other side so celestially fair this seemed to present something sinister yet weirdly beautiful a baffling untamed wilderness Along this ridge the road ran straight before them for a distance stony and bleak and the air swept over it sweet and strong from the sea far away Wait wait a moment he called as his panting horse rounded the last curve of the climb and she had already put her own to a gallop She reined in sharply and came back to him a glowing vision Stand a moment near me We ll let our horses rest a bit and ourselves too There is strength and vitality in this air breathe it in deeply What joy to be alive She came near and their horses held quiet communion putting their noses together contentedly Cassandra lifted her head high and turned her face toward the billowed mountains and did what Thryng had not known her to do what he had wondered if she ever did She laughed laughed aloud and joyously Why do you laugh he asked and laughed with her I m that glad all at once I don t know why If the mountains could feel and be glad seems like they d be laughing now away off there by the sea I wonder will I ever see the ocean Of course you will You are not going to live always shut up in these mountains Laugh again Let me hear you But she turned on him startled eyes I clean forgot that poor man down below so like to die I am most afraid to get back there Look down It must have been in a place like that where Christian slew Apollyon in the dark valley like I was reading to Hoyle last night Does he live down in there I mean the man Irwin not Apollyon He s dead for Christian slew him Yes the Irwins live there See yonder that spot of cleared red ground There s their place The house is hid by the dark trees nigh the red spot Can you make it out Yes but I call that far It s easy riding Shall we go on I m that frightened we d better hurry Is that your way when you are afraid to do a thing you hurry to do it all the more Seems like we have to a heap of times Seems like if I were only a man I could be brave but being a girl so it is right hard She started her horse to a gallop and side by side they hurried over the level top of the ridge to Thryng an exhilarating moment to her a speeding toward some terrible unknown trial CHAPTER X IN WHICH CASSANDRA AND DAVID VISIT THE HOME OF DECATUR IRWIN Soon the way became steep and difficult and the path so narrow they were forced to go single file Then Cassandra led and David followed They passed no dwellings and even the little home to which they were going was lost to view He wondered if she were not weary remembering that she had been over the distance twice before that day and begged her as he had done when they set out to allow him to carry the basket but still she would not I never think of it I often carry things this way We have to here in the mountains She glanced back at him and smiled I reckon you find it hard because you are not used to living like we do we re soon there now see yonder A turn in the path brought them in sight of the cabin set in its bare desolate patch of red soil About the door swarmed unkempt children of all sizes as bees hang out of an over filled hive the largest not more than twelve years old and the youngest carried on the mother s arm It was David s first visit to one of the poorest of the mountain homes and he surveyed the scene before him with dismay Below the house was a spring and there suspended from the long reaching branch of a huge beech tree now leafless and bare a great black iron pot swung by a chain over a fire built on the ground among a heap of stones On a board at one side lay wet gray garments twisted in knots as they had been wrung out of the soapy water The woman had been washing and the vapor was rising from the black pot of boiling suds but seeing their approach she had gone to her door her babe on her arm and the other children trooping at her heels and clinging to her skirts They peered up from under frowzy overhanging locks of hair like a group of ragged bedraggled Scotch terriers The mother herself seemed scarcely older than the oldest and Thryng regarded her with amazement when he noticed her infantile undeveloped face and learned that she had brought into the world all those who clustered about her His amazement grew as he entered the dark little cabin and saw that they must all eat and sleep in its one small room which they seemed to fill to overflowing as they crowded in after him accompanied by three lean hounds who sniffed suspiciously at his leggings Far in the darkest corner lay the father on a pallet of corn husks covered with soiled bedclothing The windows were mere holes in the walls unglazed unframed and closed at night or in bad weather by wooden shutters when the room was lighted only by the flames from the now black and empty fireplace Here while mother and children were out by the branch washing the injured man lay alone stoically patient declaring that his laig was some better that he did not feel so much misery in hit as yesterday Thryng had seen much squalor and wretchedness but never before in a home in the country where women and children were to be found For a moment he looked helplessly at the silent staring group and at the man who feebly tried to indicate to his wife the extending of some courtesy to the stranger Set a cheer Polly he said weakly offering his great hand You are right welcome suh Are you visitin these parts This is the doctor I was telling you about Cate Doctor Thryng I begged him to come up and see could he do anything for you said Cassandra Then she urged the woman to go back to her work and take the children with her Doctor and I will look after your old man awhile She succeeded in clearing the place of all but one lean hound who continued to stand by his master and lick his hand whining presciently and one or two of the children who lingered around the door to peer in curiously at the doctor A shutter near the bed was tightly closed and in struggling to open it Cassandra discovered it was broken at the hinges and had been nailed in place David flew to her assistance and wrenching out the nails tore it free letting in a flood of light upon the wretchedness around them Then he turned his attention to the patient a man of powerful frame but lean almost to emaciation who watched the young physician s face silently with widely opened blue eyes their pale color intensified by the surrounding shock of matted curling vividly red hair and beard It required but a few moments to ascertain that the man s condition was indeed critical Cassandra had gone out and now returned with her hands full of dry pine sticks Bending on one knee before the empty fireplace she arranged them and hung a kettle over them full of fresh water David turned and watched her light the fire Good We shall need hot water immediately How long since you have eaten he asked the man He hain t eat nothing all day said the wife who had returned and again stood in the door with all her flock gazing at him Then the woman grew plaintively garrulous about the trouble she had had doin fer him and begged David to tell her could he he p im At last Thryng put a hurried end to her talk by saying he could do nothing nothing at all for her old man unless she took herself and the children all away She looked terror stricken and her mouth drew together in a stubborn resentful line as if in some way he had precipitated ill luck upon them by his coming Cassandra at once took her basket and walked out toward the stream and they all followed leaving David and the father in sole possession of the place Then he turned to the bed and began a kindly explanation He found the man more intelligent and much more tractable than the woman but it was hard to make him believe that he must inevitably lose either his life or his foot and that they had not an hour not a half hour to spare but must decide at once David s manner gentle but firmly urgent at last succeeded The big man broke down and wept weakly but yielded only he stipulated that his wife must not be told No no She and the children must be kept away but I need help Is there no one no man whom we can get to come here quickly They is nobody naw I reckon not David was distressed but he searched about until he found an old battered pail in which to prepare his antiseptic and busied himself in replenishing the fire and boiling the water all the time his every move was watched by the hound and the pathetic blue eyes of his master Soon Cassandra returned to David s great relief alone She smiled as she looked in his face and spoke quietly I told her to take the children and gather dock and mullein leaves and such like to make tea for her old man and if she d stay awhile I d look after him and have supper for them when they got back Is there anything I can do now David was troubled indeed but what could he do He explained his need of her quickly in low tones outside the door I believe you are strong and brave and can do it as well as a man but I hate to ask it of you There is not time to wait It must be done to day now I ll help you she said simply and walked into the hut She had become deadly pale and he followed her and placed his fingers on her pulse holding her hand and looking down in her eyes You trust me he asked Oh yes I must Yes you must dear child You are all right Don t be troubled but just think we are trying to save his life Look at me now and take in all I say Then he placed her with her back to his work taught her how to count the man s pulse and to give the ether but the patient demurred He would not take it Naw I kin stand hit Go ahead Doctor See here Cate Irwin You are bound to do as Doctor Thryng says or die she said bending over him Take this and I ll sit by you every minute and never take my hand off yours Stop tossing There He obeyed her and she sat rigidly still and waited The moments passed in absolute silence Her heart pounded in her breast and she grew cold but never took her eyes from the still deathlike face before her In her heart she was praying praying to be strong enough to endure the horror of it not to faint nor fall until at last it seemed to her that she had turned to stone in her place but all the time she could feel the faintly beating pulse beneath her fingers and kept repeating David s words We are trying to save his life we are trying to save his life David finished Moving rapidly about he washed covered and carried away and set all in order so that nothing betrayed his grewsome task Then he came to her and took both her cold hands in his warm ones and led her to the door She swayed and walked weakly He supported her with his arm and once out in the sweet air she quickly recovered He praised her warmly eagerly taking her hands in his and for the first time as the faint rose crept into her cheeks he felt her to be moved by his words but she only smiled as she drew her hands away and turned toward the house They ll be back directly and I promised to have something for them to eat Then I ll help you for our man is coming out all right now and I feel if he can have any kind of care he will live The sky had become overcast with heavy clouds and the wind had risen blowing cold from the north David replaced the shutter he had torn off and mended the fire with fuel he found scattered about the yard while Cassandra swept and set the place in order and the resuscitated patient looked about a room neater and more homelike than he had ever slept in before Cassandra searched out a few articles with which to prepare a meal the usual food of the mountain poor salt pork and corn meal mixed with water and salt and baked in the ashes David watched her as she moved about the dark cabin lighted only by the fitful flames of the fireplace to perform those gracious homely tasks and would have helped her but he could not At last the woman and her brood came streaming in and Cassandra and the doctor were glad to escape into the outer air He tried to make the mother understand his directions as to the care of her husband but her passive Yas suh did not reassure him that his wishes would be carried out and his hopes for the man s recovery grew less as he realized the conditions of the home After riding a short distance he turned to Cassandra Won t you go back and make her understand that he is to be left absolutely alone Scare her into making the children keep away from his bed and not climb into it You made him do as I wished with only a word and maybe you can do something with her I can t She turned back and David watched her at the door talking with the woman who came out to her and handed her a bundle of something tied in a meal sack He wondered what it might be and Cassandra explained These are the yarbs I sent her and the children aftah I didn t know how to rid the cabin of them without I sent for something and now I don t know what to do with these We we re obliged to use them some way She hesitated I reckon I didn t do right telling her that do you guess I had to make out like you needed them and had sent back for them it it wouldn t do to mad her not one of her sort Her head drooped with shame and she added pleadingly Mother has used these plants for making tea for sick folks but He rode to her side and lifted the unwieldy load to his own horse Be ye wise as a serpent and harmless as a dove he said laughing How do you mean You were wise You did right where I would only have done harm and been brutal Can t you see these have already served their purpose I don t understand You told her to get them because you wished to make her think she was doing something for her husband didn t you And you couldn t say to her that she would help most by taking herself out of the way could you She could not understand and so they have served their purpose as a means of getting her quietly and harmlessly away so we could properly do our work But I didn t say so not rightly I made her think Never mind what you said or made her think You did right God knows We are all made to work out good often when we think erroneously just as you made her uncomprehendingly do what she ought If ever she grows wise enough to understand well and good if not no harm is done Cassandra listened but doubtingly At last she stopped her horse If you can t use them I feel like I ought to go back and explain she said Her face gleamed whitely out of the gathering dusk and he saw her shiver in the cold and bitter wind He was more warmly dressed than she and still he felt it cut through him icily No You shall not go back one step It would be a useless waste of your time and strength Later if you still feel that you must you can explain Come She yielded touched her horse lightly with her whip and they hurried on The night was rapidly closing in the thick dark shadows creeping up from the gorges below as they climbed the rugged steep they had descended three hours earlier They picked their way in silence she ahead and he following closely He wondered what might be her thoughts and if she had inherited along with much else that he could perceive the Puritan conscience which had possibly driven some ancestor here to live undisturbed of his precious scruples When they emerged at last on the level ridge where she had so joyously laughed out Thryng hurried forward and again rode at her side She sat wearily now holding the reins with chilled hands Had she forgotten the happy moment He had not The wind blew more shrewdly past them and a few drops of rain large and icy cold struck their faces Put these on your hands please he begged pulling off his thick gloves but she would not He reached for the bridle of her horse and drew him nearer then caught her cold hands and began chafing them first one and then the other Then he slipped the warm gloves over them Wear them a little while to please me he urged You have no coat and mine is thick and warm Suddenly he became aware that she was and had been silently weeping and he was filled with anxiety for her so brave she had been so tired she must be worn out poor little heart Are you so tired he asked Oh no no Won t you tell me what troubles you Let me put this over your shoulders to keep off the rain Oh no no she cried as he began to remove his coat You need it a heap more than I You have been sick and I am well Please wear it I will walk a little to keep warm Oh I can t I m not cold Doctor Thryng It isn t that He became imperative through anxiety Then tell me what it is he said I can t stop thinking of Decatur Irwin I can feel you working there yet and seems like I never will forget I keep going over it and over it and can t stop Doctor are you sure sure it was right for us to do what we did Poor child It was terrible for you and you were fine you know fine you are a heroine you are I don t care for me It isn t me Was it right Doctor Was there no other way she wailed As far as human knowledge goes there was no other way Listen Miss Cassandra I have been where such accidents were frequent Many a man s leg have I taken off Surgery is my work in life don t be horrified I chose it because I wished to be a saver of life and a helper of my fellows She was shivering more from the nervous reaction than from the cold and to David it seemed as if she were trying to draw farther away from him Don t shrink from me There are so many in the world to kill and wound some there must be to mend where it is possible I saw in a moment that your intuition had led you rightly and soon I knew what must be done I only hope we were not too late Don t cry Miss Cassandra It makes me feel such a brute to have put you through it No no You were right kind and good I m only crying now because I can t stop There there child We ll ride a little faster I must get you home and do something for you He spoke out of the tenderness of his heart toward her But soon they were again descending and the horses careful for their own safety if not for their riders continued slowly and stumblingly to pick their footing in the darkness Now the rain began to beat more fiercely and before they reached the Fall Place they were wet to the skin David feared neither the wetting nor the cold for himself only for her in her utter weariness was he anxious She would help him stable the horses and led away one while he led the other but once in the house he took matters in his own hands peremptorily He rebuilt the fire and himself removed her wet garments and her shoes She was too exhausted to resist Following the old mother s directions he found woollen blankets and wrapping her about he took her up like a baby and laid her on her bed Then he brewed her a hot milk punch and made her take it You need this more than I Doctah If you ll just take some yourself as soon as I can I ll make your bed in the loom shed again and Drink it drink it and go to sleep Yes yes I ll have some too Cass you lie still and do as doctah says You nigh about dade child If only I could get off n this bed an walk a leetle I d a had your place all ready fer ye Doctah The is a featheh bade up garret if ye could tote hit down an drap on the floor here fer David laughed cheerily Why this is nothing for me He stood turning himself about to dry his clothing on all sides before the blaze As soon as Miss Cassandra closes her eyes and sleeps I will look after myself It s a shame to bring all these wet things in here I say You are a steamin like you are a steam engine piped little Hoyle peering at him over his mother s shoulder from the far corner of her bed You lie down and go to sleep again youngster said David And gradually they all fell asleep while Thryng sat long before the fire and pondered until Cassandra slept Once and again a deep quivering sigh trembled through her parted lips as he watched beside her A warm rose hue played over her still features cast by the dancing red flames and her hair in a dishevelled mass swept across the pillow and down to the floor At last the rain ceased warmed and dried Thryng stole away from the silent house and rode back to his own cabin CHAPTER XI IN WHICH SPRING COMES TO THE MOUNTAINS AND CASSANDRA TELLS DAVID OF HER FATHER Ere long such a spring as David had never dreamed of swept up the mountain with a charm so surpassing and transcending any imagined beauty that he was filled with a sort of ecstasy He was constantly out upon the hills revelling in the lavish bounty of earth and sky of rushing waters and all the subtile changes in growing things as if at last he had been clasped to the heart of nature He visited the cabins wherever he was called and when there was need for Cassandra s ministrations he often took her with him thus they fell naturally into good camaraderie Thus also quite as naturally Cassandra s speech became more correct and fluent even while it lost none of its lingering delicacy of intonation David provided her with books as he had promised himself Sometimes he brought them down to her and they read together sometimes he left them with her and she read them by herself eagerly and happily but so busy was she that she found very little time to be with him Not only did all the work of the household fall on her but the weaving which her mother had done heretofore and the care of the animals which had been done by Frale The life she had hoped to lead and the good she had longed to do when she left home for school encouraged by the bishop and his wife she now resolutely put away from her determined to lead in the best way the life that she knew must henceforth be hers She hoped at least she might be able to bring the home place back to what it used to be in her Grandfather Caswell s time and to this end she labored patiently albeit sadly David was ever aware of a barrier past which he might never step no matter how merry or how intimate they might seem to be and always about her a silent air of waiting which deterred him in his efforts to draw her into more confidential relations Yet as the days passed he became more interested in her influenced by her nearness to him and still more by her remoteness Allured and baffled often in the early morning or late evening he would sit in the doorway of his cabin or out on his rock with his flute when his thoughts were full of her Simple maidenly and strong his heart yearned toward her while instinctively she held herself aloof in quiet dignity Never had she presented herself at his door unless impelled by necessity Never had she sat with him in his cabin since that first time when she came to him so heavy hearted for Frale Only when she knew him to be absent had she gone to his cabin and set all its disorder to rights Then he would return to find it swept and cleaned and sweet with wild flowers and pine greenery and vines his cooking utensils washed and scoured the floor whitened with scrubbing in his larder newly baked corn bread and white beaten biscuits his honey jar refilled and fresh butter pats in the spring Sometimes a brown earthen jug of cool refreshing buttermilk stood on his table but always his thanks would be swept aside with the words Mother sent me up to see could I do anything for you You are always that kind and we can t do much And you never come up when I am at home It isn t every time I can get to go up I m that busy here most days Only the days when I am absent can you get to go up he would say teasingly Don t I ever deserve a visit Cass don t get time fer visitin these days Since Frale lef she have all his work an hern too on her an mine too only the leetle help she gets out n Hoyle an hit hain t much said the mother Doctah don t ye guess I can get up an try walkin a leetle If you will promise me you will only try it when I am here to help you I will take off the weight and we ll see what you can do to day Cassandra loved to watch David attend on her mother so tender was he and he adopted a playful manner that always dispelled her pessimism and left her smiling and talkative Ere he was aware also he made a place for himself In Cassandra s heart when he became interested in the case of her little brother and attempted gradually to overcome his deformity Every morning when the child climbed to his eyrie and brought his supply of milk David took him in and gently out of his knowledge and skill gave him systematic care and taught him how to help himself but he soon saw that a more strenuous course would be the only way to bring permanent relief or surely the trouble would increase What did Doctor Hoyle say about it he asked one day He wa n t that a way when doctah war here last Hit war nigh on five year ago that come on him He had fevah an a right smart o times when we thought he war a gettin bettah he jes went back ontwell he began to kind o draw sideways this a way an he hain t nevah been straight sence an he has been that sickly too When doctah saw him last he war nigh three year old an straight as they make em an fat you couldn t see a bone in him David pondered a moment Suppose you give him to me awhile he said Let him live with me in my cabin eat there sleep there everything and we ll see what can be done for him I m willin more n willin when only I can get to help Cass some Hoyle he s a heap o help with me not able to do a lick He can milk nigh as well as she can an tote in water an feed the chick ns an th pig an rid n to mill fer meal yas he s a heap o help Cass she got to get on with th weavin We promised bed kivers an such fer Miss Mayhew She sells em fer ladies at comes to the hotel in summah We nevah would have a cent o money in hand these days thout that only what chick ns nd aigs she can raise fer the hotel too Hit s only in summah I don t rightly see how we can spare Hoyle Where s Miss Cassandra now he asked only more determined on his course the more he was hampered by circumstances She s in the loom shed weavin I throwed on the warp fer a blue and white bed kiver fore I war hurt an she hain t had time to more n half finish hit I war helpin to get the weavin done whilst she war at school this winter an come spring she war lowin to come back an help Frale with the plantin an makin crap fer next year Here in the mountains we uns have to be forehanded an here I be an can t crawl scarcely yet After the thrifty soul had taken a few steps instead of realizing her good fortune in being able to take any she was bitterly disappointed to find that weeks must still pass ere she could walk by herself She was seated on her little porch where David had helped her looking out on the growing things and the blossoming spring all about a sight to make the heart glad but she saw only that the time was passing and it would soon be too late to make a crop that year She was such a neat self respecting old woman as she sat there Her work worn old hands were not idle for she turned and mended Hoyle s funny little trousers home made with suspenders attached I don t know what all we can do ef we can t make a crap We won t have no corn nor nothin an nothin to feed stock let alone we uns We ll be in a fix just like all the poor white trash me not able to do a lick David came and sat beside her a few moments and said a great many comforting things and when he rose to go the world had taken on a new aspect for her eyes bright dark eyes looking up at him with a gleam of hope I believe ye she said We ll do anything you say Doctah Thryng walked out past the loom shed and paused to look in on the young girl as she sat swaying rhythmically throwing the shuttles with a sweep of her arm and drawing the great beam toward her with steady beat driving the threads in place and shifting the veil of warp stretched before her with a sure touch of her feet upon the treadles all her lithe body intent and atune It seemed to him as he sat himself on the step to watch that music must come from the flow of her action The noise of the loom prevented her hearing his approach and silently he watched and waited fascinated in seeing the fabric grow under her hand As silently she worked on and slowly even as the pattern took shape and became plain before her his thoughts grew and took definite shape also until he became filled with a set purpose He would not disturb her now nor make her look around It was enough just to watch her in her sweet serious unconsciousness with the flush of exercise on her cheeks as he could see when she slightly turned her head with every throw of the shuttle When at last she rose he saw a look of care and weariness on her face that disturbed him He sprang up and came to her She little dreamed how long he had been there Please don t go Stay here and talk to me a moment Your mother is all right I have just been with her May I examine what you have been doing It is very interesting to me you know He made her show him all the manner of her work and drew her on to tell him of the different patterns her mother had learned from her grandmother and had taught her They don t do much on the hand looms now in the mountains but Miss Mayhew at the hotel last summer I told you about her sold some of mother s work up North and I promised more but I m afraid I don t guess I can get it all done now You are tired Sit here on the step awhile with me and rest I want to talk to you a little and I want you alone She looked hesitatingly toward the declining sun He took her hand and led her to the door Can t you give me a few a very few moments You hold me off and won t let me say what I often have in mind to ask you She sat beside him where he placed her and looked wonderingly into his face but not in the least as if she feared what his question might be or as if she suspected anything personal You know it s not right that this sort of thing should go on indefinitely I don t know what sort of thing you mean She lifted grave wide eyes to his those clear gray eyes and his heart admonished him that he had begun to love to look into their blue and green depths but heed the admonishment he would not I mean working day in and day out as you do You have grown much thinner since I saw you first and look at your hands He took one of them in his and gently stroked it See how thin they are and here are callous places And you are stooping over with weariness and except when you have been exercising your face is far too white She looked off toward the mountain top and slowly drew her hand from his I must do it There is no one else she said in a low voice But it can t go on always this way I reckon so Once I thought it might be some different but now She waited an instant in silence But now what It seems as if it must go on like this way always as if I were chained here with iron But why Won t you tell me so I may help you I can t she said sadly and with finality It must be He brooded a moment clasping his hands about one knee and gazing at her Maybe he said at last maybe I can help you even if you can t tell me what is holding you She smiled a faintly fleeting smile Thank you but I reckon not Miss Cassandra when you know I am at your service and will do anything you ask of me why do you hold something back from me I can understand and I may have ways It s just that suh Even if I could tell you I don t guess you could understand Even if I went yonder on the mountain and cried to heaven to set me free I d have to bide here and do the work that is mine to do as mother has done hers and her mother before her But they did it contentedly and happily because they wished it Your mother married your father because she loved him and was glad Yes I reckon she did but he was different She could do it for him He lived alone alone Mother knew he did she could understand It was like he had a room to himself high up on the mountain where she never could climb nor open the door David leaned toward her What do you see when you look off at the mountain like that It s like I could see him He would take his little books up there and walk the high path I never have showed you his path It was his and he would walk in it up and down up and down and read words I couldn t understand reading like he was singing Sometimes I would climb up to him and he d take me in his arms and carry me like I was a baby and read Sometimes he would sit on a bank of moss under those trees see near the top by that open spot of sky a right dark place There are no other trees like them They are his trees He would sit with me there and tell me the stories of the strange words but we never told mother for she said they were heathen and I mustn t give heed to him When deeply absorbed she often lapsed into her old speech David liked it He almost wished she would never change it for his After father died I hunted and hunted for those little books but I never could find them You remember him so well won t you tell me how he looked She slowly brought her eyes down from the mountain top and fixed them on his face Sometimes just for a minute you make me think of him but you don t look like him I never heard any one laugh like he could laugh and with his eyes too He was tall like you and he carried his shoulders high like you do when you hurry but he was a dark man When he stood here in the door of the loom shed his head touched the top I thought of it when you stood here a bit ago and had to stoop He always did that She lifted her gaze again to the mountain and was silent Tell me a little more Just a little Don t you remember anything he said He used to preach but I was too little to remember what he said They used to have preaching in the schoolhouse and in winter he used to teach there when he could get the children to come They had no books but he marked with charcoal where they could all see and showed them writing and figures but somehow they got the idea he didn t know religion right and they wouldn t go to hear him any more Mother says it nigh broke his heart for he fell to ailing and grew that thin and white he couldn t climb to his path any more She stopped and put her hand to her throat as her way was She too had grown white with the ache of sorrowful remembrance He thought it cruel to urge her but felt impelled to ask for more And then Yes One day we were all alone sitting right here in the loom shed door He put one hand on my head and then he put the other hand under my chin and turned my face to look in his eyes so great and far like they could see through your heart Seems like I can feel the touch of his hand here yet and hear him say Little daughter never be like the rest Be separate and God will send for you some day here on the mountain He will send for you on the mountain top He will compass you about and lift you up and you shall be blessed Then he kissed me and went into the house I could hear him still saying it as he walked On the mountain top one will come for you on the mountain top He went in and lay down and I sat here and waited It seemed like my heart stood still waiting for him to come back to me and it must have been more than an hour I sat and mother came home and went in and found him gone He never spoke again He lay there dead She paused and drew in a long sighing breath I have never said those words aloud until now to you but hundreds of times when I look up on the mountain I have said them in my heart I reckon he meant I was to bide here until my time was come and do all like I ought to do it I did think I could go to school and learn and come back and teach like he used to and so keep myself separate like he did but the Lord called me back and laid a hard thing on me and I must do it But in my heart I can keep separate like father did She rose and stood calmly her eyes fixed on the mountain David stood near and longed to touch her passive hand to lift it to his lips but forebore to startle her soul by so unusual an act For all she had given him a confidence she had never bestowed on another he felt himself held aloof her spirit withdrawn from him and lifted to the mountain top CHAPTER XII IN WHICH CASSANDRA HEARS THE VOICES AND DAVID LEASES A FARM That evening David sat long on his rock holding his flute and watching the thin golden crescent of the new moon floating through a pale amber sky and one star near its tip slowly sliding down with it toward the deepening horizon The glowing sky bending to the purple hilltops the crescent moon and the lone shining star the evening breeze singing in the pines above him the delicate arbutus blossoms hiding near his feet the call of a bird to its mate and the faint answering call from some distant shade the call in his own heart that as yet returned to him unanswered but with its quiet surety of ultimate response the joy of these moments perfect in beauty and a more abundant assurance of gladness near at hand filled him and lifted his soul to follow the star Guided by the unseen hand that held the earth the crescent moon and the star to their orbits would he find the great happiness that should be not his alone but also for the eyes uplifted to the mountain top and the heart waiting in the shadows for the one to be sent Ah surely surely for this had he come He stooped to the arbutus blossoms to inhale their fragrance He rose and lifting his flute to his lips played to solace his own waiting inventing new caprices and tossing forth the notes daringly delicately rapturously now penetrating and strong now faintly following and scarcely heard uttering a wordless gladness Under the great holly tree in the shadows Cassandra sat watching as he watched the crescent moon and the lone star sailing in the pale amber light with the deepening purple mountain hiding the dim distance below them Often in the early evening when her mother and Hoyle were sleeping she would climb up here to pray for Frale that he might truly repent and for herself that she might be strong in her purpose to give up all her cherished hopes and plans if thereby she might save him from his own wild reckless self It was here his boy s passion had been revealed to her and here she had seen him changed from boy to man filled with a man s hunger for her which had led him to crime and held him unrepentant and glad could he thus hold her his own She must give up the life she had hoped to lead and take upon her the life of the wife of Cain to help him expiate his deed For this must she bow her head to the yoke her mother had borne before her In the sadness of her heart she said again and again Christ will understand He was a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief He will understand Again came to her as they had often come of late dropping down through the still air down through the leafless boughs like joyful hopes yet to be realized the flute notes What were they those sweet sounds She held her breath and lifted her face toward the sky Once long ago in France the peasant girl had heard the Voices Were they heavenly sweet like these sounds Did they drop from the sky and fill the air like these Oh why should they seem like hopes to her who had put away from her all hope Were they bringing hope to her who must rise to toil and lie down in weariness for labor never done who must hold always with sorrowing heart and clinging hands to the soul of a murderer hold and cling if haply she might save and weep for that which for her might never be Were they bringing hope that she might yet live gladly as the birds live that she might go beyond that and live like those who have no sin imposed on them to walk with the gods she knew not how but to rise to things beyond her ken Down came the notes sweet shrill white notes hurrying drifting lingering calling her to follow down on her heart with healing and comfort they fell lightly as dew on flowers sparkling with life joy giving and pure Slowly she began climbing listening waiting one step upward after another following the sound As if in a trance she moved Below her the noise of falling water made a murmuring accompaniment to the music dropping from above an earth made accompaniment to heaven sent melody meeting and forming a perfect harmony in her heart as she climbed Gradually the horror and the sorrow fell away from her even as the soul shall one day shed its garment of earth until at last she stood alone and silent near David etherealized in the faint light to a spirit like semblance of a woman With a glad pounding of his heart he sprang towards her Scarcely conscious of the act he held out both his arms but she did not move She stood silently regarding him her hands dropped at her side then with drooping head she turned and began wearily to descend the way she had come He followed her and took her hand She let it lie passively in his and walked on He wished he might feel her fingers close warmly about his own but no they were cold She seemed wholly withdrawn from him and her face bore the look of one who was walking in her sleep yet he knew her to be awake Miss Cassandra speak to me he begged in quiet tones Don t walk away until you tell me why you came She seemed then to become aware that he was holding her by the hand and withdrew it and in the faint light he thought she smiled It was just foolishness You will laugh at me I heard the music and I thought it might be you made it I reckon but down there it sounded like it might be the Voices You remember how they came to Joan of Arc like we were reading last week She began to walk on more hurriedly I will go down with you he said you thought it might be the voices What did they say to you Oh don t go with me I never heed the dark Won t you let me go with you What did the flute say to you Can t you tell me She laughed a little then It was only foolishness I reckon the Voices never come these days I have heard it before but didn t know where it came from It just seemed to drop down from heaven like and this time it seemed some different as if it might be the Voices calling It was pretty suh far away and soft like part of everything My father s playing sounded sad most times like sweet crying but this was more like sweet laughing I never heard anything so glad like this was so I tried to find it Now I know it is you who make it I won t disturb you again suh Good evening She hastened away and was soon lost in the gloom David stood until he heard her footsteps no more then turned and entered his cabin his mind and heart full of her Surely he had called her and the sound of his call was to her like sweet laughing Her face and her quaint expressions went with him into his dreams When he hurried down to the widow s place next morning his mind filled with plans which he meant to carry out and was sure with the boyish certainty of his nature he could compass he heard the voice of little Hoyle shrilly calling to old Pete Whoa mule Haw there Haw there mule What ye goin that side fer come round here Below the widow s house the stream after its riotous descent from the fall meandered quietly through the rich bit of meadow and field her inheritance for over a hundred years establishing her claim to distinction among her neighbors Here Martha Caswell had lived with her mother and her two brothers until she married and went with her young husband over t other side Pisgah then her mother sent for them to return begging her son in law to come and care for the place Her two sons reckless and wild were allowing the land to run to waste and the buildings to fall in pieces through neglect The daughter Martha true to her name was thrifty and careful and under her influence her gentle dreamer of a husband who cared more for his fiddle his books and his sermons gradually redeemed the soil from weeds and the buildings from dilapidation until at last with the proceeds of her weaving and his own hard labor they saved enough to buy out the brothers interests By that time the younger son had fallen a victim to his wild life and the other moved down into the low country among his wife s people Thus were the Merlins left alone on their primitive estate Here they lived contentedly with Cassandra their only child and her father s constant companion until the tragedy which she had so simply related to David Her father s learning had been peculiar Only a little classic lore treasured where schools were none and books were few handed down from grandfather to grandson His Greek he had learned from the two small books the widow had so carefully preserved their marginal notes his only lexicon They and his Bible and a copy of Bunyan s Pilgrim s Progress were all that were left of his treasures A teething puppy had torn his Dialogues of Plato to shreds and when his successor had come into the home he had used the Marcus Aurelius for gun wadding ere his wife s precaution of placing the padlock from the door on her mother s old linen chest To day as David passed the house the old mother sat on her little porch churning butter in a small dasher churn She was glad as he could see because she could do something once more Now are you happy he called laughingly as he paused beside her Well I be Hit s been a right smart o while since I been able to do a lick o work We sure do have a heap to thank you fer Be Decatur Irwin as glad to lose his foot as I be to git my laig back she queried whimsically I reckon not I reckon not too but with him it was a case of losing his life or his foot while with you it was only a question of walking about or being bedridden for the next twenty years They be ignorant them Irwins an she s more n that fer she s a fool She come round yest day wantin to borry a hoe to fix up her gyarden patch an she lowed ef you n Cass had only lef him be he d a come through all right fer hit war a gettin better the day you uns took hit off I told her yas he d a come cl ar through to the nex world like Farwell done When the misery left him he up an died an Lord knows whar he went I ll get him an artificial foot as soon as he is able to wear one He ll get on very well with a peg under his knee until then What s Hoyle doing with the mule He s rid n him fer Cass She s tryin to get the ground ready fer a crap Hit s all we can do Our women nevah war used to do such work neither but she would try What s that Is she ploughing he asked sharply and strode away I reckon she don t want ye there Doctah the widow called after him but he walked on The land lay in a warm hollow completely surrounded by hills It had been many years cleared and the mellow soil was free from stumps and roots When Thryng arrived three furrows had been run rather crookedly the length of the patch and Cassandra stood surveying them ruefully flushed and troubled holding to the handles of the small plough and struggling to set it straight for the next furrow The noise of the fall behind them covered his approach and ere she was aware he was at her side Placing his two hands over hers which clung stubbornly to the handles of the plough he possessed himself of them Laughingly he turned her about after the short tussle and looked down into her warm flushed face Still holding her hands he pulled her away from the plough to the grassy edge of the field leaving Hoyle waiting astride the mule Whoa mule Stand still thar he shrilled as the beast sought to cross the bit of ploughed ground to reach the grass beyond Let him eat a minute Hoyle said David Let him eat until I come Now Miss Cassandra what does this mean Do you think you can plough all that land Is that it I must You must not There is no one else now I must He could feel her hands quiver in his as he forcibly held them and knew from her panting breath how her heart was beating She held her head high nevertheless and looked bravely back into his eyes You must let me he paused Intuitively he knew he must not say as yet what he would Let me direct you a little You have been most kind to me and it is my place I am a doctor you know If I were sick or hurt I would give heed to you I would do anything you say but I m not and this is laid on me to do Leave go my hands Doctor Thryng If you ll sit down here a moment and talk this thing out with me I will Now tell me first of all why is this laid on you Frale is gone and it must be done or we will have no crop and then we must sell the animals and then go down and live like poor white trash Her low passive monotone sounded like a moan of sorrow You must hire some one to do this heavy work Every one is working his own patch now and no I have no money to hire with I reckon I ve thought it all over every way Doctor She looked sadly down at her hands and then up at the mountain top I know you think this is no work for a girl to do and you are right Our women never have done such Only in the war times my Grandmother Caswell did it and I can now A girl can do what she must I have no way to turn but to live as my people have lived before me I thought once I might do different go to school and keep separate but She spread out her hands with a hopeless gesture and rose to resume her work Give me a moment longer I m not through yet That s right now listen I see the truth of what you say and I came down this morning to make a proposition to your mother not for your sake only don t be afraid for my own as well but I didn t make it because I hadn t time She told me what you were doing and I hurried off to stop you Don t speak yet let me finish I feel I have the right because I know I know I was sent here just now for a purpose guided to come here He paused to allow his words to have their full weight Whether she would perceive his meaning remained to be seen I understand She spoke quietly Doctor Hoyle sent you to be helped like he was and you have been right kind to more than us You ve helped that many it seems like you were sent here for we all as well as for your own sake but that can t help me now Doctor it Ah yes it can I m far from well yet I shall be but I must stay on for a long time and I want some interest here I want to see things of my own growing The ground up around my little cabin is stony and very poor and I want to rent this little farm of yours Listen I ll pay enough so you need not sell your cattle and you you can go on with your weaving You can work in the house again as you have always done Sometime when your mother is stronger you can take up your life again and go to school as you meant to live can t you That can never be now If you take the farm or not I must bide on here in the old way I must take up the life my mother lived and my grandmother and hers before her It is mine forever to live it that way or die Why do you talk so God knows but I can t tell you Thank you suh I will be right glad to rent you the farm I d a heap rather you had it than any one else I ever knew for we care more for it than you would guess but for the rest no I must bide and work till I die only maybe I can save little Hoyle and give him a chance to learn something for he never could work being like he is Thryng s eyes danced with joy as he regarded her Hoyle is not going to be always as he is and he shall have the chance to learn something also Look up Miss Cassandra look squarely into my eyes and laugh Be happy Miss Cassandra and laugh I say it She laughed softly then She could not help it Wasn t that what the Voices were saying last night when you followed Yes yes They seemed like they were calling Hope hope but they were not the real Voices You made it Yes I made it and I was truly calling that to you And you replied you came to me Ah but that is different from the Voices she heard But if they called the truth to you what then Doctah there is no longer any hope for me God called me and let me cut off all hope once I did it and now only death can change it If I believe you you must believe me We won t talk of it any more I m hungry Your mother was churning up there let s go and get some buttermilk and settle the business of the rent You ve run three good furrows and I ll run three more beside them my first remember in all my life Then we ll plant that strip to sunflowers Come Hoyle tie the mule and follow us So David carried his way They walked merrily back to the house chattering of his plans and what he would raise He knew nothing whatever of the sort of crops to be raised and she was naively gay at his expense a mood he was overjoyed to awaken in her He vowed that merely to walk over ploughed ground made a man stronger On the porch he sat and drank his buttermilk and placing his paper on the step drew up a contract for rent Then Cassandra went to her weaving and he and Hoyle returned to the field where with much labor he succeeded in turning three furrows beside Cassandra s rather crooked and uncertain ones it is true but quite as good as hers as Hoyle reluctantly admitted which served to give David a higher respect for farmers in general and ploughmen especially CHAPTER XIII IN WHICH DAVID DISCOVERS CASSANDRA S TROUBLE After turning his furrows David told Hoyle to ride the mule to the stable then he sat himself on the fence and meditated He bethought him that in the paper he had drawn up he had made no provision for the use of the mule He wiped his forehead and rubbed the perspiration from his hair and coughed a little after his exertion glad at heart to find himself so well off He would come and plough a little every day Then he began to calculate the number of days it would take him to finish the patch measuring the distance covered by the six furrows with his eye and comparing it with the whole He laughed to find that at the rate of six furrows a day the task would take him well on into the summer Plainly he must find a ploughman Then the laying out of the ground Why should he not have a vineyard up on the farther hill slope He never could have any fruit from it but what of that Even if he went away and never returned he would know it to be adding its beauty to this wonderful dream Who could know what the future held for him what this little spot might mean to him in the days to come That he would go out fully recovered and strong to play his part in life he never doubted Might not this idyl be a part of it He thought of the girl sitting at her loom swaying as she threw her shuttle with the rhythm of a poem and weaving weaving his life and his heart into her web unknown to herself weaving a thread of joy through it all which as yet she could not see He knocked the ashes from his pipe and stood a moment gazing about him Yes he really must have a vineyard and a bit of pasture somewhere and a field of clover What grew best there he little knew so he decided to go up and consult the widow There were other things also to claim his thoughts Over toward Wild Cat Hole there was a woman who needed his care and he must not become so absorbed in his pastoral romance as to forget Hoyle He was looking actually haggard these last few days and his mother said he would not eat It might be that he needed more than the casual care he was giving him Possibly he could take him to Doctor Hoyle s hospital for radical treatment later in the season when his crops were well started He smiled as he thought of his crops then laughed outright and strolled back to the house weary and hungry and happy as a boy Well now I like the look of ye called the old mother from the porch where she still sat Pears like it s done ye good a ready to turn planter The hain t nothin better n the smell o new sile fer them at s consumpted Mother cried Cassandra from within don t call the doctor that Come up and have dinner with us Doctor She set a chair for him as she spoke but he would not As he stood below them looking up and exchanging merry banter with her mother he laughed his contagious laugh I bet he s tired shrilled Hoyle from his perch on the porch roof He be n settin on the fence smokin an rubbin his hade with his handkercher like he d had enough with his ploughin You can nigh about beat him Cass Hisn didn t look no better n what yourn looked Here you young rascal you come down from there cried David Catching him by the foot which hung far enough over to be within reach of his long arm he pulled him headlong from his high position and caught him in mid air Now how shall I punish you Ye bettah whollop him He hain t nevah been switched good in his hull life Maybe that s what ails him The child grinned I hain t afeared Get me down on the ground oncet an I c n run faster n he can Suppose I duck him in the water trough yonder I reckon he needs it He generally do smiled Cassandra from the doorway Come son go wash up David allowed the child to slip to the ground Seems like Hoyle is right enough about you though Don t go away up the hill bide here and have dinner first David dropped on the step for a moment s rest I see I must make a way up to my cabin that will not pass your door How about that Was dinner included in the rent and the mule and the mule s dinner And what is Hoyle going to pay me for allowing him to ride Pete up and down while I plough Yas an what are ye goin to give him fer lowin ye to set his hade round straight an what are ye goin to give me fer lowin ye to set me on my laigs again Ef ye go a countin that a way I m feared ye re layin up a right smart o debt to we uns I reckon you ll use that mule all ye want to an ye ll

in I ll do it he said laughing and took his solitary path up the steep Halfway to his cabin he heard quick scrambling steps behind him and turning saw little Hoyle bringing Cassandra s small melon shaped basket covered with a white cloth I said I could run faster n you could Cass she sont some th chick n fry He thrust the basket at Thryng and turned to run home Here here David called after the twisted hunched little figure You tell your sister thank you very much for me Will you Yas suh and the queer little gnome disappeared among the laurel below In the morning David found the place of the Widow Timms and her son agreed to come down the next day and accept wages for work A weary spiritless young man he was and the home as poverty stricken as was that of Decatur Irwin and with almost as many children It was with a feeling of depression that David rode on after his call leaving the grandmother seated in the doorway snuff stick between her yellow teeth the grandchildren clustering about her knees or squatting in the dirt like young savages Their father lounged in the wretched cabin hardly to be seen in the windowless smoke blackened space nearly filled with beds heaped with ragged bedclothes and broken splint bottomed chairs hung about with torn and soiled garments The dirt and disorder irritated David and he felt angered at the clay faced son for not being out preparing his little patch of ground Fortunately he had been able to conceal his annoyance enough to secure the man s promise to begin work next day or he would have gained nothing but the family s resentment for his pains Already David had learned that a sort of resentful pride was the last shred of respectability to which the poorest and most thriftless of the mountain people clung pride of he knew not what and resentfulness toward any who by thrift and labor were better off than themselves He reasoned that as the young man had been Frale s helper at the still no doubt corn whiskey was at the bottom of their misery This brought his mind to the thought of Frale himself The young man had not been mentioned between him and Cassandra since the day she sought his help He thought he could not be far from the still as he forded Lone Pine Creek on his way to the home of Hoke Belew whose wife he was going to see David was interested in this young family they seemed to him to be quite of the better sort and as he put space between himself and the Widow Timms deplorable state his irritation gradually passed and he was able to take note of the changes a week had wrought in the growing things about him More than once he diverged to investigate blossoming shrubs which were new to him attracted now by a sweet odor where no flowers appeared until closer inspection revealed them and now by a blaze of color against the dark background of laurel leaves and gray rocks Ah the flaming azalea had made its appearance at last huge clusters of brilliant bloom on leafless shrubs How dazzlingly gay In the midst of his observance of things about him and underneath his surface thoughts he carried with him a continual feeling of satisfaction in the remembrance of the little farm below the Fall Place and in an amused way planned about it and built idly his Castles in Spain A bit of stone wall whose lower end was overgrown with vines pleased him especially and a few enormous trees which had been left standing when the spot had been originally cleared and the vine entangled drooping trees along the banks of the small river that coursed crookedly through it what possibilities it all presented to his imagination If only he could find the right man to carry out his ideas for him he would lease the place for fifty years for the privilege of doing as he would with it After a time he came out upon the cleared farm of Hoke Belew who was industriously ploughing his field for cotton and called out to him How s the wife She hain t not to say right smart an the baby don t act like he s well neither suh Ride on to th house an light She s thar an I ll be up d rectly Thryng rode on and dismounted tying his horse to a sapling near the door The place was an old one A rose vine very ancient covered the small porch and the black old moss grown roof The small green foliage had come out all over it in the week since he was last there The glazed windows were open and white homespun curtains were swaying in the light breeze A small fire blazed on the hearth and before it in a huge splint bottomed rocking chair the pale young mother reclined languidly wrapped in a patchwork quilt The hearth was swept and all was neat but very bare Close to the black fireplace on a low chair with the month old baby on her knees sat Cassandra She was warming something at the fire which she reached over to stir now and then while the red light played brightly over her sweet grave face Very intent she was and lovely to see She wore a creamy white homespun gown coarse in texture such as she had begun to wear about the house since the warm days had come Thryng had seen her in such a dress but once before and he liked it With one arm guarding the little bundle in her lap dividing her attention between it and the porridge she was making she sat a living embodiment of David s vision silhouetted against and haloed by the red fire softened by the blue obscuring smoke wreaths that slowly circled in great rings and then swept up the wide overarching chimney He heard her low voice speaking and his heart leaped toward her as he stood an instant unheeded by them ere he rapped lightly They both turned with a slight start Cassandra rose holding the sleeping babe in the hollow of her arm and set a chair for him before the fire Then she laid the child carefully in the mother s arms and removed the porridge from the fire Shall I call Hoke she asked moving toward the door David did not want her to leave them loving the sight of her Don t go I saw him as I came along he said But she went on and sat herself on a seat under a huge locust tree Tardiest of all the trees it had not yet leaved out Later it would be covered with a wealth of sweet white blossoms swarming with honey bees and the air all about it would be filled with its lavish fragrance and the noise of humming wings Presently Hoke came plodding up from the field and smiled as he passed her Doc inside he asked She nodded When David came out he found her still seated there her head resting wearily against the rough tree She rose and came toward him I thought I wouldn t leave until I knew if there was anything more I could do she said simply No you ve done all you can She ll be all right Where s your horse I walked Why did you do that You ought not you know Hoyle rode the colt down to see could Aunt Sally come here for a day or two until Miz Belew can do for herself better She turned back to the house Come home now with me Ride my horse and I ll walk I d like to walk urged David Oh no Thank you Doctor I must speak to Azalie first Don t wait She went in and David mounted and rode slowly on but not far Where the trail led through a small stream which he knew she must cross he dismounted and allowed the horse to drink while he stood looking back along the way for her to come to him Soon he saw her white dress among the glossy rhododendron leaves as she moved swiftly along and he walked back to meet her I have waited for you You are not used to this kind of a saddle I know but what s the difference You can ride cross saddle as the young ladies do in the North can t you I reckon I could She laughed a little Do they ride that way where you come from It must look right funny I don t guess I d like it But just try to please me Why not If you don t mind I d rather walk please suh Don t wait Then I will walk with you I may do that may I not He caught the bridle rein on the saddle leaving the horse to browse along behind as he would and walked at her side She made no further protest but was silent You don t object to this do you he insisted It s pleasanter than being alone but it s right far to walk seems like for you Then why not for you She smiled her mysterious quiet smile You must know that I am stronger than you he persisted I ought to think so since that day we rode over to Cate Irwin s but I was right afraid for you that time lest you get cold and then it was me she paused and looked squarely in his eyes and laughed You wouldn t say it was me would you He joined merrily in her laughter I never corrected you on that You never did but you didn t need to I often know after I ve said something not right as you would say it Do you indeed he walked nearer boyishly happy because she was close beside him He wanted to touch her to take her hand and walk as children do but could not because of the subtile barrier he felt between them He determined to break it down Finish what you were saying And then it was me what And then it was I who gave out not you But you were a heroine a heroine from the ground up and I love you He spoke with such boyish impulsiveness that she took the remark as one of his extravagances and merely smiled indulgently as if amused at it She did not even flush but accepted it as she would an outburst from Hoyle David was amazed It only served to show him how completely outside that charmed circle within which she lived he still was He was maddened by it He came nearer and bent to look in her face until she lifted her eyes to look fairly in his That s right Look at me and understand me I waited there only that I might tell you Why do you put a wall between us I tell you I love you I love you Cassandra do you understand She stood quite still and gazed at him in amazement almost as if in terror Her face grew white and she pressed her two hands on her heart then slowly slid them up to her round white throat as if it hurt her a movement he had seen in her twice before when suffering emotion Why Cassandra does it hurt you for me to tell you that I love you Beautiful girl does it Yes suh she said huskily He would have taken her in his arms but refrained for very love of her She should be sacred even from his touch if she so wished and the barrier whatever it might be should halo her He had spoken so tenderly he had no need to tell her The love was in his eyes and his voice but he went on Then I must be cruel and hurt you I love you all the days and the nights all the moments of the days I love you In very terror she flung out her hands and placed them on his breast holding him thus at arm s length and with head thrown back still looked into his eyes piteously imploringly With trembling lips she seemed to be speaking but no voice came He covered her hands with his and held them where she had placed them You have put a wall between us Why have you done it I didn t didn t know I thought you were as far as far away from us as the star the star of gold is from our world in the night so far I didn t guess you could come so near She bowed her head and wept You are the star yourself you beautiful you are But she stopped him crying out She could not draw her hands away for he still held them clasped to his heart No no The wall is there It must be between us for always I am promised The grief wailed and wept in her tones and her eyes were wide and pleading I must lead my life and you you must stay outside the wall If you love me Doctor you must never know it and I must never know it Her beating heart stopped her speech and they both stood thus a moment each seeing only the other s soul Promised The word sank into his heart like lead Promised Slowly he released her hands and she covered her face with them and sank at his feet He bent down to her and asked almost in a whisper Promised Did you say that word She drooped lower and was silent All the chivalry of his nature rose within him Should he come into her life only to torment and trouble her Ought he to leave the place Could he bear to live so near her What had she done this flower Was she to be devoured by swine The questions clamored at the door of his heart But one thing could he see clearly He must wait without the wall seeking only to serve and protect her With the unerring instinct which led her always straight to the mark she had seen the only right course He repeated her words over and over to himself If you love me you must never know it and I must never know it Her heart should be sacred from his personal intrusion and their old relations must be reestablished at whatever cost to himself With flash light clearness he saw his difficulty and that only by the elimination of self could he serve her and also that her manner of receiving his revelation had but intensified his feeling for her The few short moments seemed hours of struggle with himself ere he raised her to her feet and spoke quietly in his old way He lifted her hand to his lips It is past Miss Cassandra We will drop these few moments out of your life into a deep well and it shall be as if they had never been He thought as he spoke that the well was his own heart but that he would not say for henceforth his love and service must be selfless We may be good friends still Just as we were Yes suh she spoke meekly And we can go right on helping each other as we have done all these weeks I do not need to leave you Oh no no She spoke with a gasp of dismay at the thought It won t hurt so much if I can see you going right on getting strong like you have been and being happy and She paused in her slowly trailing speech and looked about her They were down in a little glen and there were no mountain tops in sight for her to look up to as was her custom And what Cassandra Finish what you were saying Still for a while she was silent and they walked on together And now won t you say what you were going to say He could not talk himself and he longed to hear her voice I was thinking of the music you made It was so glad I can t talk and say always what I think like you do but seems like it won t hurt me so here she put her hand to her throat where it always hurts me when I am sorry at anything if I can hear you glad in the music like you were that night I thought you were the Voices Cassandra it shall be glad for you always She looked into his eyes an instant with the clear light of understanding in her own But for you It is for you I want it to be glad CHAPTER XIV IN WHICH DAVID VISITS THE BISHOP AND FRALE SEES HIS ENEMY The bishop was seated in a deep canvas chair on his wide veranda looking out over his garden toward a distant line of blue hills His little wife sat close to his side on a low rocker very busy with the making of buttonholes in a small girl s frock of white dimity and lace Betty Towers loved lace and pretty things The small girl was playing about the garden paths with her puppy and chattering with Frale in her high happy childish voice while he bent weeding among the beds of okra and egg plant His face wore a more than usually discontented look even when answering the child with teasing banter Now and then he lifted his eyes from his work and watched furtively the movements of David Thryng who was pacing restlessly up and down the long veranda in earnest conversation with the bishop and his wife The two in the garden could not understand what was being said at the house but each party could hear the voices of the other and by calling out a little could easily converse across the dividing hedge and the intervening space Talk about the influence of the beautiful in nature upon the human soul it is all very pretty but I believe the soul must be more or less enlightened to feel it I ve learned a few things among your people up there in the mountains Strange beings they are It only goes to show that heredity alone won t do everything said the bishop placing the tips of his fingers together and frowning meditatively Heredity It means a lot to us over there in England Yes yes But your old families need a little new blood in them now and then even if they have to come over here for it For that and your money yes Thryng laughed But these mountain people of yours who are they anyway Most of them are of as pure a strain of British as any in the world as any you will find at home They have their heredity and only that from all your classes over there but it is from those of a hundred or more years ago They are the unmixed descendants of those you sent over here for gain drove over by tyranny or exported for crime How unmixed in your most horribly mixed and mongrel population Circumstances and environment have kept them to the pure stock and neglect has left them untrammelled by civilization and unaided by education Time and generations of ignorance have deteriorated them and nature alone as you were but now admitting has hardly served to arrest the process by the survival of the fittest Nature yes how do you account for it I have been in the grandest most wonderful places I venture to say that are to be found on earth and among all the glory that nature can throw around a man he is still if left to himself more bestial than the beasts He destroys and defaces and defiles nature he kills for the mere sake of killing more than he needs he enslaves himself to his appetites and passions follows them wildly yields to them recklessly and destroys himself and all the beauty around him that he can reach wantonly Why Bishop Towers sometimes I ve gone out and looked up at the stars above me and wondered which was real they and the marvellous beauty all around me or the three hundred reeking humanity sleeping in the camp beneath them Sometimes it seemed as if only hell were real and the camp was a bit of it let loose to mock at heaven We mustn t forget that what is transitory is not a part of God s eternity of spirit and truth Oh yes yes But we do forget And some transitory things are mighty hard to endure especially if they must endure for a lifetime David was thinking of Cassandra and what in all probability would be her doom He had not mentioned her name but he had come down with the intention of learning all he could about her and if possible to whom she was promised He feared it might be the low browed handsome youth bending over the garden beds beyond the hedge and his heart rebelled and cried out fiercely within him What a waste what a waste Betty Towers intent on her sewing felt the thrill that intensified David s tone and she too thought of Cassandra She dropped her work in her lap and looked earnestly in her husband s face James I feel just as Doctor Thryng does when I think of some things When I see a tragedy coming to a human soul I feel that a lifetime of transitory things like that is hard to endure Fancy James Think of Cassandra You know her Doctor Thryng of course They live just below your place She is the Widow Farwell s daughter but her name is Merlin David arrested his impatient stride and drawing a chair near her dropped into it What about her he said What is the tragedy I think Betty the hills must keep their own secrets said the bishop His little wife compressed her lips glanced over the hedge at the young man who happened at the moment to have straightened from his bent position among the plants and was gazing at their guest then resumed her sewing Is it something I must not be told asked David quietly But I may have my suspicions Naturally we can t help that I think it is better to know the truth I don t like suspicions They are sure to lead to harm James let me put it to the doctor as I see it and see what he thinks of it As you please dear It s like this Have you seen anything of that girl or observed her much I certainly have Then of course you can see that she is one of the best of the mountain people can t you Well She has promised to marry promised to marry think of it one of the wildest most reckless of those mountain boys one that she knows very well has been in illicit distilling He is a lawbreaker in that way and more than that he drinks and in a drunken row he shot dead his friend Ah David rose turned away and again paced the piazza Then he returned to his seat I see The young man I tried to help off when I first arrived Yes There he is I see Handsome type He s down here now keeping quiet How long it will last no one knows Justice is lax in the mountains His father shot three or four men before he died himself of a gunshot wound which he received while resisting the officers of the law If there s a man left in the family to follow this thing up Frale will be hunted down and arrested or shot otherwise when things have cooled off a little up there he will go back and open up the old business and the tragedy will be repeated James you know how often after the best you could do and all their promises they go back to it I admit it s always a question They don t seem to be content in the low country I think it is often a sort of natural gravitation back to the mountains where they were born and bred more than it is depravity I know James but that excuse won t help Cassandra Why did she do it asked David She must have known to what such a marriage would bring her Do it That is the sort of girl she is If she thought she ought she would leap over that fall there But why should she think she ought Had she given her promise David saw her as she appeared to him when she had said that word to him on the mountain and it silenced him but only for a moment He would learn all he could of her motives now He must he would know I mean before he did this before she went away to study had she made him such a promise No You tell him about it James You have seen her and talked with her They were quarrelling about her as I understand and she thinks because she was the cause of the deed she must help him make retribution Isn t that it James She knows perfectly well what it means for her for she has had her aspirations I can see it all Frale says he was not drunk nor his friend either He says the other man claimed but I won t go into that only Cassandra promised him before God he says that if he would repent she would marry him And when she was here she used to talk about the way those women live How her own mother has worked and aged Why she is not yet sixty You have seen how they live in their wretched little cabins Doctor that s what Frale would doom her to He never in life will understand her He ll grow old like his father a passionate ignorant untamed animal and worse for he would be drunken as well He s been drunk twice since he came down here James you know they think it s perfectly right to get drunk Saturday afternoon Yes it seems a terrible waste but if she has children she will be able to do more for them than her mother has done for her and they will have her inheritance so her life can t be wholly wasted even if she is not able to live up to her aspirations James Towers I that it s because you are a man that you can talk so I m ashamed and you a bishop I wish Betty s eyes were full of angry tears I only wish you were a woman Slowly improve the race by bearing children giving them her inheritance How would she bear them Year after year ill fed half clothed slaving to raise enough to hold their souls in their bodies bringing them into the world for a brute who knows only enough to make corn whiskey to sell it and drink it and reproduce his kind when when she knows all the time what ought to be Oh James James think of it My dear my dear you forget he has promised to repent and live a different life If he does things will be better than we now see them If he does not change then we may interfere perhaps I know James But but suppose he repents and she becomes his wife and puts aside all her natural tastes and the studies she loves and goes on living with him there on the home place and he does the best he can even Don t you see that her nature is fine and and so different even at the best James for her it will be death in life And then there is the terrible chance after all that he might go back and be like his father before him and then what Well their lives and destinies are not in our hands we can only watch out for them and help them James he has been drunk twice Yes yes Betty my little tempest and if he gets drunk twice more and twice more she will still forgive him until seventy times seven We must make her see that unless he keeps his promise to her she must give him up Of course I suppose that s all we can do I don t know what you ll think of me Doctor Thryng I m a dreadful scold If James were not an angel It s perfectly delicious I would rather hear you scold than Than hear James preach laughed the bishop I agree with you I agree with her said David emphatically It ought to be stopped if If it ought to be it will be What do you think she said to me about it when I went to reason with her If Christ can forgive and stand such as he I can It is laid on my soul to do this I had no more to say That is one point of view but we mustn t lose sight of the practical either To be his wife and bear his children I call it a waste a Yes yes So it is And what more could the bishop say After a little he added But still we must not forget that he too is a human soul and has a value as great as hers According to your viewpoint but not to mine not to mine If a man is enslaved to his own appetites he has no right to enslave another to them The following day David took himself back to his hermitage setting aside all persuasions to remain Don t make a recluse of yourself begged the bishop s wife The amenities of life can t always be dispensed with and we need you James and I you and your music David laughed I m too fatally human to become a recluse and as for the amenities they are not all of one order you know I find plenty of scope for exercising them on others and I often submit to having them exercised on me after their own ideas He laughed again I wish you could look into my larder You d find me provided with all the hills afford They have loaded me with gifts No wonder I know what your life up there means to them taking care of their mothers and babies and sitting up with them nights going to them when they are in trouble rain or shine and visiting them in their bare wretched crowded homes It wouldn t be so bad often if it weren t that when a family is in serious trouble or has a case needing quiet and care the sympathies of all their relatives are roused and they come crowding in In one case the father was ill with pneumonia I did all I could for him and next day would you believe it I found his sister and her old man and their three youngsters his old mother and a brother and a widowed sister all camped down on them all in one room The sister sat by the fire nursing her three months old baby his mother was smoking at her side and the sick man s six little children and their three cousins were raising Ned in and out with three or four hounds Not one of the visitors was helping or as they say up there doing a lick but the wife was cooking for the whole raft when her husband needed all her care Marvellous ideas they have some of them You ought to write out some of your experiences Oh I can t It would seem like a sort of betrayal of friendship They have adopted me so to speak and are so naive and kind and have trusted me I think they are my friends I may be very odd you know I know how you feel said Betty The bishop s little daughter had assumed the proprietorship of the doctor She even preferred his companionship to that of her puppy She clung to his hand as he walked away pulling and swinging upon his arm to coax him back He took her in his arms and carried her out upon the walk the small dog barking and snapping at his heels as David threatened to bear his tyrannical young mistress away to the station Doggie wants you to leave me here she cried pounding him vigorously with her two little fists He brought her back and placed her on the broad flat top of the high gate post Very well doggie may have you I will leave you here Doggie wants you to stay too She held him with her small arms about his neck Well doggie can t have me He unclinched her chubby hands crossed them in her lap and held them fast while he kissed her tanned and rosy cheek Good by you young rogue he said and strode away Come and lift me down she wailed But he knew well she could scramble down by herself when she chose and walked on She continued to call after him then spying Frale in the wood yard she imperatively summoned him to her aid and trotted at his side back to the woodpile where they sat comfortably upon a log and visited together They were the best of friends and chattered with each other as if both were children In the slender shadow of a juniper tree that stood like a sentinel in the corner of the wood yard they sat where a high board fence separated them from the back street The bishop s place was well planted and this corner had been the quarters of the house servants in slave times It was one of Frale s duties to pile here for winter use the firewood which he cut in short lengths for the kitchen fire and long lengths for the open fireplaces He hated the hampered village life and round of small duties the weeding in the garden cleaning of piazzas and windows and the sweeping of the paths The woodcutting was not so bad but the rest he held in contempt as women s work He longed to throw his gun in the hollow of his arm and tramp off over his own mountains At night he often wept for homesickness and wished he might spend a day tending still or lying on a ridge watching the trail below for intruders on his privacy The joy of life had gone out for him He thought continually of Cassandra and desired her and his soul wearied for her until he was tempted to go back to the mountains at all risks merely for a sight of her Painfully he had tried to learn to write working at the copies Betty Towers had set for him and certainly she had done all her conscientious heart prompted to interest him and keep him away from the village loungers He had even progressed far enough to send two horribly spelled missives to Cassandra feeling great pride in them And now he had begun to weary of learning To be able to write those badly scrawled notes was in his eyes surely enough to distinguish him from his companions at home of what use was more What s that you are tossing up in the air Let me see it demanded the child as Frale tossed and caught again a small bright object He kept on tossing it and catching it away from the two little hands stretched out to receive it Give it to me Give it to me Frale Let me see it He dropped it lightly in her palm Don t you lose hit That thar s somethin at s got a charm to hit What s a charm to hit I don t see any charm Then Frale laughed aloud He took it with his thumb and forefinger and held it between his eye and the sun Is that the way you see the charm to hit Let me try But he slipped it in his pocket first placing it in a small bag which he drew up tightly with a string Hit hain t nothing you kin see Hit s only a charm at makes hit plumb sure to kill anybody at hit hits Hit s plumb sure to hit an plumb sure to kill too Oh Frale What if it had hit me when you threw it up that way and killed me Then you d be sorry wouldn t you Frale Hit nevah wouldn t kill a girl a nice little girl like you be Hit s charmed that a way at hit won t kill nobody what I don t want hit to Then what do you keep it in your pocket for You don t want to kill anybody do you Frale Naw I reckon not not thout I have to But you don t have to do you Frale piped the child He rose and selecting an armful of stove wood carried it into the shed and began packing it away Dorothy sat still on the log her elbows on her knees her chin in her hands meditating A tall man slouched by and peered over the high board fence at her His eyes roved all about the place eagerly keen and black His matted hair hung long beneath his soft felt hat The child looked up at him with fearless questioning glance then trotted in to her friend Frale did you see that man lookin over the fence You think he was lookin for you Frale Come see who tis P r aps he s a friend of yours Dorothy Dorothy called her mother from the piazza and the child bounded away her puppy yelping and leaping at her side The tall man turned at the corner and looked back at the child The bishop s place occupied one corner of the block and the fence with a hedge beneath it ran the whole length of two sides Slowly sauntering along the second side the gaunt hungry eyed man continued his way searching every part of the yard and garden even endeavoring with backward furtive glances to see into the woodhouse where in the darkness Frale crouched once more pallid with abject fear peering through the crack where on its hinges the door swung half open As the man disappeared down the straggling village street Frale dropped down on the wheelbarrow and buried his haggard face in his hands A long time he sat thus until the dinner hour was past and black Carrie had to send Dorothy to call him Then he rose but in the place of the white and haunted look was one of stubborn recklessness He strolled to the house with the nonchalant air of one who fears no foes but rather glories in meeting them and sat himself down at his place by the kitchen table where he bantered and badgered Carrie who waited on him reluctantly with contemptuous tosses of her woolly head From the day of his first appearance there had been war between them and now Frale knew that if the stranger asked her she would gladly and slyly inform against him The afternoon wore on Again Frale sat on the wheelbarrow thinking thinking He took the small bag from his pocket and felt of the bullet through the thin covering then replaced it and drawing forth another bag began counting his money over and over There it was all he had saved five dollars in bills and a few quarters and dimes He did not like to leave the shelter of the shed and his eyes showed only the narrow glint of blue as with half closed lids he still peered out and watched the street where his enemy had disappeared Suddenly he rose and climbed with swift catlike movements up the ladder stairs behind him which led to his sleeping loft There he rapidly donned his best suit of dyed homespun tied his few remaining articles of clothing in a large red kerchief and before a bit of mirror arranged his tie and hair to look as like as possible to the village youth of Farington The distinguishing silken lock that would fall over his brow had grown again since he had shorn it away in Doctor Thryng s cabin Now he thrust it well up under his soft felt hat and taking his bundle descended Again his eyes searched up and down the street and all about the house and yard before he ventured out in the daylight Dorothy and her dog came bounding down the kitchen steps She carried two great fried cakes in her little hands warm from the hot fat and she laughed with glee as she danced toward him Frale Frale I stole these I did for you I told Carrie I wanted two for you an she said G long chile She thrust them in his hands What s the matter Frale What you all dressed up for This isn t Sunday Frale Is they going to be a circus Frale is they She poured forth her questions rapidly as she hopped from one foot to the other Will you take me Frale if it s a circus I ll ask mamma I want to see the el phant Tain t no circus he replied grimly What s the matter Frale Don t you like your fried cakes Then why don t you eat them What you wrapping them up for You ought to say thank you when I bring you nice cakes at I went an stole for you she remonstrated severely His throat worked convulsively as he stood now looking at the child now watching the street Suddenly he lifted her in his arms and buried his face in her gingham apron I had a little sister oncet only she s growed up now an she hain t my little sister any more He kissed her brown cheek tenderly even as David had done and set her gently down on her two stubby feet You run in an tell yer maw thank you fer me will ye Mind now Listen at me whilst I tell you what to tell yer paw an maw fer me Say Frale seen a houn dog on his scent an he s gone home to git shet of him Where s the houn dog Frale She gazed fearfully about He s gone now He won t bite not you he won t Oh Frale I wish it was a circus Yas drawled the young man with a sullen smile curling his lips may be hit be a sort of a circus Kin ye remember what I tol you to tell yer paw You you seen a houn dog on on a cent how could he be on a cent Say Frale seen a houn dog on his scent an he s gone home to git shet of him Frale seen a houn dog on on a a cent an an an he s gone home to to get shet of him What s get shet of him Frale Nevah mind honey yer paw ll know Run in an tell him fore you forgit hit Good by She danced gayly off toward the house but turned to call back at him as he stood watching her Are you going to hit the houn dog with the pretty ball Frale I reckon He laughed and strode off toward the one small station in the opposite direction from the way the man had taken Frale knew well where he had gone On the outskirts of the village was a small grove of sycamore and gum trees by a little stream where it was the custom for the mountain people to camp with their canvas covered wagons There they would build their fires on a charred place between stones and heat their coffee There they would feed their oxen or mule team tied to the rear wheels of their wagons with corn thrown on the ground before them At nightfall they would crawl under the canvas cover and sleep on the corn fodder within Often beneath the fodder might be found a few jugs of raw corn whiskey hidden away while the articles they had brought down for sale or barter at the village stores were placed on top in plain view Sometimes they brought vegetables or baskets of splints and willow withes made by their women or they might have a few yards of homespun towelling The man Frale had seen was the older brother of his friend Ferdinand Teasley and well Frale knew that he was camped with his ox team down by the spring where it had been his habit to wait for the cover of darkness when he could steal forth and leave his jugs where the money might be found for them placed on some rock or stump or fallen trunk half concealed by laurel shrubs How often had the products of Frale s still been conveyed down the mountain by that same ox team in that same unwieldy vehicle Giles Teasley s cabin and patch of soil planted always to corn was a long distance from his father s mill and also from his brother s still hence he could with the more safety dispose of their illicit drink In the slow but deadly sure manner of his people he had but just aroused himself to the fact that his brother s murderer was still alive and the deed unavenged and Frale knew he had come now not to dispose of the whiskey since the still had been destroyed but to find his brother s slayer and accord him the justice of the hills To the mountain people the processes of the law seemed vague and uncertain They preferred their own methods A well loaded gun a sure aim and a few months of hiding among relatives and friends until the vigilance of the emissaries of the law had subsided was the rule with them Thus had Frale s father twice escaped either prison or the rope and during the last four years of his life he had never once ventured from his mountain home for a day at the settlements below while among his friends his prowess and his skill in evading pursuit were his glory Now it was Frale s thought to dare the worst to walk to the station like any village youth buy his ticket and take the train for Carew s Crossing and from there make his way to his haunt while yet Giles Teasley was taking his first sleep He reasoned and rightly that his enemy would linger about several days searching for him and never dream of his having made his escape by means of the train Since the first scurry of search was over it was no longer the officers of the law Frale feared but this same lank ill favored mountaineer who was now warming his coffee and eating his raw salt pork and corn bread by the stream while his drooling cattle stood near sleepily chewing their cuds CHAPTER XV IN WHICH JERRY CAREW GIVES DAVID HIS VIEWS ON FUTURE PUNISHMENT AND LITTLE HOYLE PAYS HIM A VISIT AND IS MADE HAPPY Uncle Jerry Carew had led David s horse down to the station ready saddled to meet him according to agreement and side by side they rode back the old man beguiling the way with talk of mountain affairs most interesting to the young doctor who led him on from tales of his own youthful prowess when catamounts and painters war nigh as frequent as woodchucks is now until he felt he knew pretty well the history of all the mountain side Yas when I war a littlin no highah n my horse s knees I kin remember thar war a gatherin fer a catamount hunt on Reed s Hill ovah to ds Pisgah Catamounts war mighty pesterin creeters them days Ev y man able to tote a gun war thar Ol man Caswell that war Miz Merlin she war only a mite of a baby then her gran paw he war the oldest man in th country he went an carried his rifle his paw fit in th Revolution with He fit at King s Mountain an all about here he fit Did he fight in the Civil War too Her gran paw s paw No He war too ol fer that but his gran son Caswell he fit in hit an he nevah come back neither Ol Miz Caswell Cassandry Merlin s gran maw she lived a widow nigh on to thirty year She an her daughter that s ol Miz Farwell that is now they lived thar an managed the place ontwell she married Merlin You knew her first husband then Yas know him Ev ybody knew Thad Merlin He come f om ovah Pisgah way an he took Marthy thar Hit s quare how things goes I always liked Thad Merlin The wa n t no harm in him David saw a quaint whimsical smile play about the old man s mouth He war a preacher kind of a mixtur of a preacher an teacher an hunter Couldn t anybody beat him huntin and farmin well he could farm too better n most He done well whatever he done but he had a right quare way He built that thar rock wall an he lowed he d have hit run plumb round the place He war a fiddler and he d build awhile and fetch his fiddle he warn t right strong an then he d set thar on the wall an fiddle to the birds an the wild creeturs they d come an hear to him I seen squerrels settin on end hearkin to him myself Arter a while folks begun to think at he didn t preach the right kind of religion an they wouldn t go to hear him no more without hit war to listen did he say anythin they could fin fault with Pears like they got in that a way they didn go fer nothin else Hit cl ar plumb broke him all up He quit preachin an took more to fiddlin an he sorter grew puny an one day jes natch ly lay down an died all fer nothin at anybody could see What was the matter with his preaching asked David and again the whimsical smile played around the old man s mouth and his thin lips twitched I reckon thar wa n t nuff hell n damnation in hit Our people here on the mountain they re right kind an soft therselves They don t whop ther chillen nor do nothin much cept a shootin now an then but that s only amongst the men The women tends mostly to the religion an they likes a heap o hell n damnation Hit sorter stirs em up an gives em somethin to chaw on an keeps em contented like They has somethin to threat n ther men folks with an keep ther chillen straight on an a place to sen ther neighbors to when they don t suit Yas hit s right handy fer th women I reckon they couldn t git on without hit Do they think they will have bodies that can be hurt by any such thing in the next world I reckon so But preacher Merlin he said that thar war paths o light an paths o darkness an that eve y man he bided right whar he war at when he died Ef he hed tuk the path o darkness thar he war in hit but ef he hed tuk the path o light whar war heaven then he war thar An he said the Lord nevah made no hell hit war jes our own selves made sech es that an he took an cut that thar place cl ar plumb out n the Scripturs an the worl to come But he sure hed a heap o larnin only some said a sight on hit war heathen an that war why he lef all the hell an damnation outen his religion Thus enlightened concerning many things both of this particular bit of mountain world which was all the world to his companion and of the world to come Thryng rode on quietly amused Sometimes he dismounted to investigate plants new to him or to gather a bit of moss or fungi or parasite anything that promised an elucidating hour with his splendid microscope For these he always carried at the pommel of his saddle an air tight box The mountain people supposed he collected such things for the compounding of his drugs When they reached the Fall Place David continued along the main road below and took a trail farther on merely a foot trail little used to his eyrie He had not seen Cassandra since they had walked together down from Hoke Belew s place He had gone to Farington partly to avoid seeing her nor did he wish to see her again until he should have so mastered himself as to betray nothing by his manner that might embarrass her or remind her painfully of their last interview knowing he must eliminate self to reestablish their previous relations David rode directly to his log stable put up his horse then unslung his box and walked with it toward his cabin Suddenly he stopped From the thick shrubbery where he stood he could see in at the large window where his microscope was placed quite through his cabin into the light white canvas room beyond Before the fireplace clearly relieved against the whiteness of the farther room stood Cassandra gazing intently at something she held in her hand David recognized it as a small framed picture of his mother a delicately painted miniature He kept it always on the shelf near which she was standing He saw her reach up and replace it then brush her hand quickly across her eyes and knew she had been weeping He was ashamed to stand there watching her but he could not move Always it seemed to him she was being presented to him thus strongly against a surrounding halo of light revealing every gracious line of her figure and her sweet clean profile He turned his eyes away but as quickly gazed again she had disappeared He waited and again she passed between his eyes and the light here and there moving quietly about seeing that all was in order as her custom was when she knew him to be absent He saw her brushing about the hearth carefully wiping the dust from his disordered table lifting the books touching everything tenderly and lightly His flute lay there She took it in her hands and looked down at it solemnly then slowly raised it to her lips 
5290_26685_000041_000001	train-clean-360	What Was she 
none	none	going to try to play upon it No but she kissed it Again and again she kissed the slender magic wand hurriedly then laid it very gently down and with one backward glance walked swiftly out of the cabin and away from him down the trail with long easy steps Only once more she drew her hand across her eyes and with head held high moved rapidly on Never did she look to the right or the left or she must have seen him as he stood scarcely breathing and hard beset to hold himself back and allow her to pass him thus Now he knew that she had been deeply stirred by him and the revelation fell upon his spirit filling him with a joy more intense than anything he had ever felt or experienced before so poignantly sweet that it hurt him Had he indeed entered into her dreams and become an undercurrent in her life even as she had in his and did her soul and body ache for him as his for her Then he suffered remorse for what he had done How long she had defended herself by that wall of impersonality with which she had surrounded herself He had beaten down the ramparts and trampled in the garden of her soul As he stood in the door of his cabin the place seemed to breathe of her presence She had made a veritable bower of it for his return Every sweet thing she had gathered for him as if out of her love and her sorrow she had meant to bring to him an especial blessing A shallow basin filled with wild forget me nots stood on the shelf before his mother s picture Ferns and vines fell over the stone mantle and in earthen jars of mountain ware the early rhododendron with its delicate pearly pink blossoms filled the dark corners Masses of the plumed white ash shook feathery tassels along the walls making the air sweet with their fragrance Ah how clean and fresh everything was All his disorder was set to rights and fresh linen was on his bed in his canvas room Even his table was laid with his small store of dishes and food placed upon it still covered in the basket he was now so accustomed to see Sweet and dainty it all was He had only to light the fat pine sticks laid beneath the kettle swung above and make his tea and his meal was ready Had she divined he would not stop at the Fall Place this time when in the past it had been his custom to do so Ah she knew for is not the little winged god a wonderful teacher Thryng was humbled in the very dust and ashes of repentance as he sat down to his late dinner The fragrance in the room all he ate everything he touched filled his senses with her and he he had only brought her sorrow He had come into her life but to bruise her spirit and leave her sad at heart with a deep sadness he dared not and could not alleviate He lifted a pale purple orchid she had placed in a tumbler at his hand and examined it Evidently she had thought this the choicest of all the woodland treasures she had brought him and had placed it there a sweet message What should he do Ah what could he do He must not see her yet at least not until to morrow Later David brought in his specimens and occupied himself with his microscope He had begun a careful study of certain destructive things Even here in the wild he found them evil and unwholesome clinging to the well and strong slowly but surely sapping the vitality of those who gave them life Every evil he thought must in the economy of nature have its antidote So with the ardor of the scientist he divided with care the nasty pasty growth he had found and prepared his plates Systematically he made drawings and notes as he studied the magnified atoms beneath his powerful lens and while he sat absorbed in his work Hoyle s childish voice piped at him from the doorway Howdy Doctah Thryng Why hello Howdy said David without looking up from his work What you got in that thar gol machine Kin I look too What have I got Why I ve got a bit of the devil in here Whar d you git him Huh Oh I found him along the road between here and the station Did did he come on the cyars with you Whar war he at Hu come he in thar David did not reply for an instant and the awed child drew a step nearer Whar war he at he insisted Hu come he in thar He was hanging to a bush as I came along and I put him in my box and brought him home and cut him up and put a little bit of him in here Then there was silence and David forgot the small boy until he heard a deep drawn sigh behind him Looking up for the first time he saw him standing aloof a look of terror in his wide eyes as if he fain would run away but could not from sheer fright Poor little mite David in his playful speech had not dreamed of being taken in earnest He drew the child to his side where he cuddled gladly nestling his twisted little body close partly for protection and partly in love You reckon he s plumb dade David could feel the child s heart beating in a heavy labored way against his arm as he held him and pushing his papers one side he lifted him to his knee Do I reckon who s dead he asked absently with his ear pressed to the child s back The devil what you done brought home in yuer box Dead Oh yes He s dead good and dead Sit still a moment so now take a long breath A long one deep that s right Now another so What fer I want to hear your heart beat Kin you hear hit Yes don t talk a minute that ll do What you want to hear my heart beat fer I kin feel hit Kin you feel yourn Be they more n one devil Heaps of them When I go back you reckon I ll find em hanging on the bushes Do they hang by ther tails like possums does Comfortable and happy where he was the little fellow dreaded the distance he must traverse to reach his home under the peculiar phenomena of devils hanging to the bushes along his route Oh no no Here I ll show you what I mean Then he explained carefully to the child what he really meant showing him some of the strange and beautiful ways of nature and at last allowing him to look into the microscope to see the little cells and rays As he patiently and kindly taught he was pleased with the child s eager receptive mind and naive admiration Towards evening Hoyle was sent home quite at rest concerning devils and all their kin and radiantly happy with a box of many colored pencils and a blank drawing book which David had brought him from Farington I kin larn to make things like you b en makin with these an Cass she ll he p me he cried What is Cass doing to day David ventured She be n up here most all mornin an I he ped get the light ud fer fire an then she sont me home to he p maw whilst she stayed to fix up But now I mean when you came up here Weavin in the loom shed Maw she has a lot o little biddies The ol hen hatched em she did What have you done to your thumb asked David seeing it tied about with a rag I plunked hit with the hammer when I war a makin houses fer the biddies I nailed em I did You made the chicken coops Well you are a clever little chap Let me see your hand Yas maw said I war that too But you weren t very clever to do this Whew What did you hit your thumb like that for Dunno He looked ruefully at the crushed member which the doctor laved gently and soothingly Why didn t you come to me with it Maw lowed the wa n t no use pesterin you with eve ything She tol me eve y man had to larn to hit a nail on the haid David laughed and the child trotted away happy his hand in a sling made of one of the doctor s linen handkerchiefs and his box of pencils and his book hugged to his irregularly beating heart but it was with a grave face that Thryng saw him disappear among the great masses of pink laurel bloom That evening as the glow in the west deepened and died away and the stars came out one by one and sent their slender rays down upon the hills David sat on his rock with his flute in his hand waiting for a moment to arrive when he could put it to his lips and send out the message of glad hopes he had sent before She had asked that one little thing that his music might still be glad and so for Cassandra s sake it must be He tried once and again but he could not play At last putting away from him his repentant thoughts he gave his heart full sway saying to himself For this moment I will imagine harmlessly that my vision is all mine and my dream come true It is the only way Then he played as if it were he whom she had kissed so passionately instead of his flute and thus it was the glad notes were falling on her spirit when Frale found her CHAPTER XVI IN WHICH FRALE RETURNS AND LISTENS TO THE COMPLAINTS OF DECATUR IRWIN S WIFE All was quiet and lonely around Carew s Crossing when Frale dropped from the train and struck off over the mountain Soon there would be bustle and stir and life about the place for the hotel would be open and people would be crowding in some to escape the heat of the far South and the low countries some from the cities either North or South to whom the bracing air of the mountains would bring renewed vitality business men with shattered nerves and women whose high play during the winter at the game of social life had left them nervous wrecks But now the beauty of the spring and the sweet silences were undisturbed by alien chatter As yet were to be heard only the noises of the forest of wind and stream of bird calls and the piping of turtles and the shrilling of insects or vibrant croaking of frogs or mayhap the occasional sound of a gun discharged by some solitary mountain boy regardless of game laws to provide a supper at home only these as Frale climbed rapidly away from the station toward the Fall Place and Cassandra He would stop there first and then strike for his old haunts and hiding places He felt a leaping joy in his veins to be again among his hills How lonely he had been for them he had not known until now when with lifted head and bounding heart he trod lightly and easily the difficult way And yet the undercurrent of a tragedy lay quiet beneath his joy and haunted him keeping him to the trails above the secret paths which led circuitously to his home even while the thought of Cassandra made his heart buoyant and eager The sight of Doctor Thryng who during these months had been near her perhaps seeing her daily aroused all the primitive jealousy of his nature He would go now and persuade her to marry him and stand by him until he could fight his way through to the unquestioned right to live there as his father had done defying any who would interfere with his course Had he not a silver bullet for the heart of the man who would dare contest his rights It only remained for him to meet Giles Teasley face to face to settle the matter forever Since it was purely a mountain affair and the officers of the law had already searched to their satisfaction there was little chance that the pursuit would be renewed by the State It would however be impossible for him to go back to the Fall Place and live there openly until the last member of the Teasley family capable of wreaking vengeance on his head had been settled with but as the father was crippled with rheumatism and could do no more than totter about his mill and talk only this one brother was left with whom to deal Now that Frale was back in his own hills again all terror slipped from him and the old excitement in the presence of danger to be met or avoided stimulated him to a feeling of exuberance and triumph With childlike facility he tossed aside the thought of his promise to Cassandra It all seemed to him as a dream all the horror and the remorse Time had quickly dulled this last Ef I hadn t a killed Ferd he would a shot me Anyhow he hadn t ought to a riled me that a way He thought with shame of how he had sat cowering at the head of the fall and had hurled his own dog to destruction in his fear I war jes plumb crazy he soliloquized As to how he could deal with Cassandra he did not as yet know but he would find a way In his heart he reached out to her and already possessed her His blood leaped madly through his veins that he was so soon to see her and touch her Have her he would if he must continue to kill his way to her through an army of opponents The evening was falling and imagining they would all be sleeping he meant to creep quietly up and spend the night in the loom shed There was no dog there now to disturb them with joyful bark of recognition At last he found himself above the home where by striking through the undergrowth a short distance he would come out by the great holly tree near the head of the fall Already he could hear the welcome sound of rushing water He drew nearer through the thick laurel and azalea shrubs now in full bloom their pollen clung to his clothing as he brushed among them Cautiously he approached the spot which recalled to him the emotions he had experienced there now throbbing through him anew He peered into the gathering dusk with eager eyes as if he thought to find her still there Ah he could crush her in his mad joy Suddenly he paused and listened Other sounds than those of the night and the running water fell on his ear sounds deliciously sweet and thrilling filling all the air mingling with the rushing of the fall and accenting its flow From whence did they come those new sounds He had never heard them before Did they drop from the sky from the stars twinkling brightly down on him now faint and far as if born in heaven now near and clear silvery clear and strong and sweet penetrating his very soul and making every nerve quiver to their pulsating rhythm He felt a certain fear of a new kind creep tinglingly through him holding him cold and still for the moment breathless Was she there Had she died and was this her spirit trying to speak Very quietly he drew nearer to the great rock Yes she was there standing with her back to the silvery gray bole of the holly tree her face lifted toward the mountain top and her expression rapt and listening holy and pure far removed from him as was the star above the peak toward which her gaze was turned He could not touch her nor crush her to him as a moment before he had felt he must but he slowly approached She heard his step and then saw him waiting there in the dim light of the starry dusk For an instant she regarded him in silence then she essayed to speak but her lips only trembled over the words voicelessly He could not see her emotion but he felt it although her stillness made her seem calm Hungrily he stood and watched her At last she spoke Why Frale Frale Hit s me Cass Have have you been down to the house Frale Naw I jes come this a way from the station Is it is it safe for you to come here Frale She stood a short distance from him speaking so softly and yet he could not touch her his hands seemed numb and his breath came pantingly I reckon hit s safe here as thar he said huskily An I m come to stay too Then let s go down to mother Likely she s a bed by now but she ll be right glad to see you She can walk a little now She hastened to fill the moments with words anything to divert that fixed gaze and take his thoughts from her Instinctively she groped thus for time she who like a deer would flee if flight were possible even while her heart welled with pity for him Come You can talk with her whilst I get you some supper She felt his pent up emotion and secretly feared it but held herself bravely Hoyle will nigh jump out of his skin he ll be that glad you come back He stood stubbornly where he was and lifted his hand to grasp her arm but she glided on just beyond his reach either not seeing it or avoiding it he could not decide which and still she said Come Frale He followed stumblingly in her wake as a man follows an ignis fatuus unconscious of the roughness of the way or of the steps he was taking and the flute notes followed them from above sweetly mockingly as it seemed to him What were they Why were they How came Cassandra there listening He could stand this mystery no longer and he cried out to her Cass hear Listen to that Yes Frale She spoke wearily but did not pause Wait Cass What be hit ye reckon Hit sure hain t no fiddle Thar Heark to hit Whar be hit at I reckon it s up yonder at Doctor Thryng s cabin He has a little pipe like that he blows on and it makes music like that An you clum up thar to heark to him He bounded forward in the darkness and walked close to her She quivered like a leaf but held her voice low and steady as she replied No Frale I go there evenings when I m not too tired I ve been going there ever since you left to That doctah he s be n castin a spell on you Cass I kin see hit how you walkin off an nevah low me to touch you Ye hain t said howd y to me nor how you glad I come You like a colonel white drift o snow blowin on ahead o me You hain t no human girl like you used to be I got somethin to put a spell on him too ef he don t watch out He spoke in his mild low voiced drawl but he kept close to her side and she could hear his breathing quick and panting She felt as if a tiger were keeping pace with her and she knew the sinister meaning beneath his words She knew that all she could do now was to take him back to his promise and hold him to it There s no such thing as spell casting Frale You know that and you have my promise and I have yours Have you forgot Talking that way seems like you have forgot She walked on rapidly taking him nearer and nearer their home and in her haste she stumbled In an instant his arm was thrown around her holding her on her feet Look at you now like to fall cl ar headlong runnin that a way to get shet o me Pears like you mad that I come He held her back and they went slowly but he did not release her nor did she struggle futilely against his strength knowing it wiser to continue calmly leading him on but she could not reply The start of her fall and her wildly beating heart rendered her breathless and weak I tell you that thar doctah man he have put a spell on you He done drawed you up thar to hear to him I seed you lookin like he d done drawed yuer soul outen yuer body I have heard o sech He s be n down to Bishop Towahs too whar I be n workin at I seed him watchin me like he come to spy on me an he no sooner gone than I seed that thar Giles Teasley sneakin long the fence lookin over an searchin eve y place like he war a hungerin fer a sight o me He stopped and swallowed angrily They had arrived at the trough of running water and she breathed easier to find herself so near her haven What have you done with your dog Frale You reckon he followed you off I haven t seen him since you left He released her then and stooping to the water pipe drank a long draft and thrust his head beneath it allowing the water to drench his thick hair Then he stood a moment shaking his curling locks like a spaniel Wait here I ll fetch a towel She hastened within Mother Frale s come back she said quietly not to awaken Hoyle then returned and tossed him the towel which he caught and rubbed vigorously over his head and face Now you are like yourself again Frale Yas I m here an I m myself I reckon Who d ye think I be He caught her and kissed her and with his arm about her entered the cabin His mood changed with childish ease according to whatever the moments brought him Cassandra lighted a candle for now that the days had grown warm the fire was allowed to go out unless needed for cooking His stepmother had roused herself and peered at him from out her dark corner where little Hoyle lay sleeping soundly in the farther side of her bed Frale strode across the uneven floor and kissed her also resoundingly Astounded she dropped back on her pillow What ails ye Frale The mountain people are for the most part too reserved to be lavish with their kisses Nothin ails me I m kissin you fer Cass s sake Me an her s goin to get jined an set up togethah I m come back fer to marry with her and we re goin ovah t othah side Lone Pine an I m goin to build a cabin thar That s how I m kissin you Will you have anothah or shall I give hit to Cass You hush an go long said the mother half contemptuously Frale s making fool talk mothah Don t give heed to him He s light headed I reckon and I m going to get him something to eat right quick I low he be light headed Nobody s goin to git Cass whilst I m livin thout he s got more n a cabin ovah t othah side Lone Pine She s right well off here an here she ll bide Frale turned darkly on the mother I reckon you d bettah give heed to me mor n to her he said in the low drawl which boded much with him Cassandra on her knees at the hearth was arranging sticks of fat pine to light the fire Her hands shook as she held them This Frale saw and his eyes gleamed He came to her side and kneeling also took them from her Hit s my place to do this fer you now Cass F om now on I reckon I ll hang the kittle fer ye too an fetch the water The mother stared at them in silence and Cassandra taking up the coffee pot rose and went out When she returned the fire was crackling merrily and the great kettle swung over it Hoyle was up and seated on his half brother s knee Cassandra s eyes looked heavy and showed traces of tears Frale saw it all with eyes gleaming blue through narrowly drawn lids His lips quivered a little as he talked with Hoyle He drew out his money for the child to count over gleefully thus diverting himself with the boy while he watched Cassandra furtively He decided to say no more at present until she should have had time to adjust her mind to the thought he had so daringly announced to her mother The two cakes little Dorothy had given him he took from his bundle and gave to Hoyle then carried him back and put him to bed and told him to sleep again For all of her promise Cassandra had not expected this to come upon her so suddenly like lightning out of a clear sky startling her very soul with fear As Frale ate what she set before him she went over to the bedside and sat there holding her mother s hand and talking in low tones while Hoyle with wide eyes strove to hear Be hit true what he says Cass Not all mother I never told him I would go and live over beyond Lone Pine I meant always to live right here with you but I am promised to him I gave him my word that night he left to get him to go and save him Oh God Mother I didn t guess it would come so soon He promised me he would repent his deed and live right The mother brightened and drew her daughter down and spoke low in her ear Make him keep to his promise first child Yuer safe thar I reckon he s doin a heap o repentin this a way I ain goin low you throw you se f away on no Farwell ef he be good lookin thout he holds to his word good fer a year Hit s jes the way his paw done me He gin me his word at he d stop stillin an drinkin an he helt to hit fer three months an then he come on me this a way an I married him an he opened up his still again in three weeks an thar he went his own way f om that day Cassandra rose and went to the door I m going to make you a bed in the loom shed like I made it for the doctor There is no bed up garret now I emptied out all the ticks and thought I d have them fresh filled against you come back but I ve been that busy Soon he followed her out I reckon I won t sleep thar whar that doctah have slep He might put a spell on me too he said standing in the door of the shed and looking in on her The night was lighter now for the full moon had glided up over the hills and she worked by its light streaming through the open door I can t see with you standing there Frale I reckon you ll have to sleep here because it s too late to fill your bed to night Oh leave that be and come and sit here with me he said dropping on the step where the doctor had sat when she opened her heart to him and told him about her father It all surged back upon her now She could not sit there with Frale I ll make my bed myself an I ll I ll sleep wharevah you want me to ef hit s up on the roof or out yandah in the water trough Come sit We ll go back on the porch and I ll take mother s chair I m right tired When we git in our own cabin ovah t othah side Lone Pine you won t have nothin to do only tend on me he said drawing her to him He led her across the open space and placed her gently in her mother s chair on the little porch Now Frale sit down there and listen she said pointing to the step at her feet where Thryng had sat only a few days before to make out the lease of their land Everything seemed to cry out to her of him to night but she must steel her heart against the thought I m going to talk to you straight just what I mean Frale You ve been talking as you pleased in there and I lowed you to I was that set back Anyway I d rather talk to you alone Frale our promise was made before God and you know I will keep to mine But you must keep to yours too Listen at me missus Towers wrote me you had been drunk twice Is that keeping your promise to leave whiskey alone Is it Frale You have somebody down thar watchin me an I hain t nobody a watchin you he said sullenly She felt degraded by his words Frale do you know me all these years to think such as that of me now I tell you he have put a spell on you I kin feel hit an see hit Hit ain t your fault Cass I d put one on you myself ef I could Anyhow I ll take you out of this fer he have done hit Do you never say that word to me again as long as you live Frale she said sternly Listen at me I say You go back there and work like you said you would Didn t I tell you that thar houn dog Giles Teasley war on my scent I seen him I got to come back ontwell I c n git shet o him And that means another murder Oh Frale Frale She covered her face with her hands and moaned Then they sat silent awhile After a little she lifted her head Frale I ll go over to Teasleys and beg for them to leave you be I ll beg Giles Teasley on my knees I will Then when you have bided your year and kept your promise like you swore before God I ll marry you like I promised and we ll live here and keep the old place like it ought to be kept You hear Frale Good night now It s only fair you should give heed to me Frale if I do that for you Good night She glided past him into the house like a wraith and he rose without a word of reply and stretched himself on the half made bed in the loom shed as he was Sullen and angry he lay far into the night with the moonlight streaming over him but he did not sleep and his mood only grew more bitter and dangerous When the first streak of dawn was drawn across the eastern sky he rose unrefreshed and began a search feeling along the rafters high above the bags of cotton Presently he drew forth an ancient long barrelled rifle and taking it out into the light examined it carefully He rubbed and cleaned the barrel and polished the stock and oiled the hammer and trigger Then he brought from the same hiding place a horn of powder and gun wadding and at last took from his pocket the silver bullet with which he loaded his old weapon even as he had seen it charged in past days by his father s hand Below the house built over a clear welling spring which ran in a bright little rivulet to the larger stream was the spring house Here after the warm days came the milk and butter were kept and here Frale sauntered down his gun slung across his arm his powder horn at his belt in his old clothes with his trousers thrust in his boot tops to search for provisions for the day and his breakfast as well He had no mind to allow the family to oppose his action or reason him out of his course He found a jug of buttermilk placed there the evening before for Hoyle to carry to the doctor in the morning and slung it by a strap over his shoulder In one of the sheds lay two chickens ready dressed to be cut up for the frying pan and one of these with a generous strip of salt pork from the keg of dry salt where it was kept he dropped in a sack He would not enter the house for corn bread even though he knew he was welcome to all the home afforded but planned to arrive at some mountain cabin where friends would give him what he required to complete his stock of food His gun would provide him with an occasional meal of game and he thus felt himself prepared for as long a period of ambush as might be necessary Before sunrise he was well on his way over the mountain He did not attempt to go directly to his old haunt but turned aside and took the trail leading along the ridge the same Thryng and Cassandra had taken to go to the cabin of Decatur Irwin Frale had no definite idea of going there but took the high ridge instinctively So long had he been in the low country that he craved now to reach the heights where he might see the far blue distances and feel the strong sweet air blowing past him It was much the same feeling that had caused him to thrust his head under the trough of running water the evening before As a wild creature loves the freedom of the plains or an eagle rises and circles about in the blue ether aimless and untrammelled so this man of the hills moved now in his natural environment living in the present moment glad to be above the low levels and out from under all restraint seeing but a little way into his future content to satisfy present needs and the cravings of his strong virile body Moments of exaltation and aspiration came to him as they must come to every one but they were moments only and were quickly swept aside and but vaguely comprehended by him As a child will weep one minute over some creature his heedlessness has hurt and the next forget it all in the pursuit of some new delight so this child of nature took his way swayed by his moods and desires an elemental force like a swollen torrent taking its vengeful way forgetful of promises glad of freedom angry at being held in restraint and willing to crush or tear away any opposing force At last breakfastless and weary after his long climb his sleepless night and the depression following his talk with Cassandra the evening before he paused at the edge of the descent loath to leave the open height behind him and stretched himself under a great black cedar to rest As he lay there dreaming and scheming with half shut eyes he spied below him the bare red patch of soil around the cabin of Decatur Irwin Instantly he rose and began rapidly to descend Decatur was away He had got a job of hauling his wife said and had to be away all day but she willingly set herself to bake a fresh corn cake and make him coffee He had already taken a little of his buttermilk but he did not care for raw salt pork alone He wanted his corn bread and coffee the staple of the mountaineer She talked much in a languid way as she worked and he sat in the doorway Now and then she asked questions about his home and Cassandry which he answered evasively She gossiped much about all the happenings and sayings of her neighbors far and near and complained much when she came to take pay from him for what she provided of the times which had come upon them since Cate had hurt his foot She told how that fool doctor had come there and taken hit off makin out like Cate d die of hit ef he didn t and how Cassandry Merlin had done cheated her into goin off so t she could bide thar at the cabin alone with that doctah man herself an he p him do hit With her snuff stick between her yellow teeth and her numerous progeny squatting in the dirt all about the doorway idly gazing at Frale she retailed her grievances without reserve How the wife of Hoke Belew had been ailin and Cassandra had be n thar ev y day keerin fer her I low she jes goes cause she lows she ll see that doctah man thar an ride back with him like she done when she brung him here said the pallid spiteful creature and spat as she talked She nevah done that fer me I be n sick a heap o times an she hain t nevah come nigh me to do a lick Frale was annoyed to hear Cassandra thus spoken against for was she not his own He chose to defend her while purposely concealing his bitter anger against the doctor The hain t nothin agin Cassandry She s sorter kin to me an I low the hain t Naw said the woman changing instantly at the threatening tone the hain t nothin agin her I reckon he tells her whar to go an she jes goes like he tells her Frale threw his sack over his shoulder and started on in silence and the woman smiled evilly after him as she sat there and licked her lips and chewed on her snuff stick and spat CHAPTER XVII IN WHICH DAVID THRYNG MEETS AN ENEMY The next day David gave his attention to the letters which he found awaiting him One was from Doctor Hoyle in Canada He had but just returned from a visit to England and it was full of news of David s family there Your two cousins and your brother are gone with their regiments to South Africa he wrote They are jubilant to be called to active service as they ought to be but your mother is heartbroken over their departure You stay where you are my boy She is glad enough to have you out of England now and far from the temptation which besets youth in times of war It has already caused a serious blood letting for Old England I have grave doubts about this contention In these days there ought to be a way of preventing such disaster Write to your mother and comfort her heart she needs it I was careful not to betray to her what your condition has been as I discovered you had not done so Hold fast and fight for health and be content Your recuperative power is good David was filled with contrition as he opened his mother s letter which was several weeks old and had come by way of Canada since she did not know he had gone South For some time he had sent home only casual notes partly to save her anxiety and partly because writing was irksome to him unless he had something particularly pleasant to tell her His plans and actions had been so much discussed at home and he had been considered so censurably odd so different from his relatives and friends in his opinions and so impossible of comprehension which branded him in his own circle as being quite at fault that he had long ago abandoned all effort to make himself understood by them and had retired behind his mask of reserve and silence to pursue his own course undisturbed Thus at best an occasional perfunctory letter that all was well with him was the sum total of news they received Thryng had no money anxieties for his family The needs of his mother and his sister not yet of age were amply provided for by a moderate annuity while his brother had his position in the army and help from his uncle besides For himself he had saved enough with his simple tastes and much hard work to tide him over this period of rest David sat now and turned his mother s letter over and over He read and reread it It was very sad Her splendid boys both gone from her one possibly never to return neither of them married and with no hope of grandchildren to solace her declining years Stay where you are David she wrote Doctor Hoyle tells us you are doing well Don t oh don t enter the army One son I have surrendered to my country s service let me feel that I still have one on whom I may depend to care for Laura and me in the years to come We do not need you now but some day we may David s quandary was how to give her as much of his confidence as filial duty required without betraying himself so far as to arouse the antagonistic comment of her immediate circle upon his course At last he found a way Telling her he did not know how soon he might return to Canada he requested her to continue to address him there He then filled his letter with loving thoughts for her and Laura and a humorous description of what he had seen and experienced in the States and the country about him all so foreign and utterly strange to her as to be equal to a small manuscript romance It was a cleverly written letter so hiding the vital matters of his soul which he could not reveal even to the most loving scrutiny that all her motherly intuition failed to read between the lines The humorous portions she gave to the rector s wife her most intimate friend and the dear son s love expressed therein she treasured in her heart and was comforted Then David rode away up the mountain without descending to his little farm He craved to get far into the very heart of the wildest parts for with the letters the old conventional and stereotyped ideals seemed to have intruded into his cabin He passed the home of Hoke Belew and stopped there to see that all was well with them The rose vine covering the porch roof was filled with pink blossoms hundreds of them swinging out over his head The air was sweet with the odor of honeysuckle The old locust tree would soon be alive with bees for it was already budded He took the baby in his arms and saw that its cheeks were growing round and plump and that the young mother looked well and happy and he was glad Take good care of them Hoke they are worth it he said to the young father as he passed him coming in from the field I will that said the man Can you tell me how to reach a place called Wild Cat Hole I have a fancy to do a little exploring Waal hit s sorter round about I don t guess ye c n find hit easy The man spat as if reluctant to give the information asked which only stimulated David all the more to find the spot Keep right on this way do I Yas you keep on fer a spell an then you turn to th right an foller the stream fer a spell an you keep on follerin hit off an on till you git thar Ye ll know hit when you do git thar but th still s all broke up Oh I don t care a rap about the still Naw I reckon not Better light an have dinner fore you go on Azalie keep the doc to dinner I m comin in a minute he called to his wife who stood smiling in the doorway David willingly accepted the proffered hospitality as he had often done before knowing it would be well after nightfall ere he could return to his cabin and rode back to the house While Azalea prepared dinner Hoke sat in the open door and held his baby and smoked David took a splint bottomed chair out on the porch and smoked with him watching pleasantly the pride of the young father who allowed the tiny fist to close tightly around his great work roughened finger Look a thar now See that hand Hit ain t bigger n a bumble bee an see how he kin hang on Yes said David absently regarding them He s a fine boy He sure is The hain t no finer on this mountain Azalea came and looked down over her husband s shoulder Don t do that a way Hoke You ll wake him up bobbin his arm up an down like you a doin Hoke he s that proud you can t touch him You hear that Doc Azalie she s that sot on him she s like to turn me outen the house fer jes lookin at him She lows he ll grow up a preacher on account o the way he kin holler an thrash with his fists but I tell her hit hain t nothin but madness an devilment at gits in him With a mother s superior smile playing about her lips she glanced understandingly at David and went on with her cooking As they came in to the table she called David s attention to a low box set on rockers and taking the baby from her husband s arms carefully placed him still asleep in the quaint nest Hoke made that hisself she said with pride And Cassandry she made that kiver Thryng touched the cover reverently bending over it and left the cradle rocking as he sat down at Hoke s side and began to put fresh butter between his hot biscuit as he had learned to do His mother would have flung up her hands in horror had she seen him doing this or could she have known how many such he had devoured since coming to recuperate in these mountain wilds The home was very bare and simple but sweet and clean and love was in it To sit there for a while with the childlike young couple enjoying their home and their baby and the hospitality generously offered according to their ability warmed David s heart and he rode away happier than he came With mind absorbed and idle rein he allowed his horse to stray as he would while his thoughts and memory played strange tricks presenting contrasting pictures to his inward vision Now it was his mother reading by the evening lamp carelessly scanning a late magazine only half interested her white hair arranged in shining puffs high on her head and soft lace old lace falling from open sleeves over her shapely arms and Laura red cheeked and plump curled feet and all in a great lounging chair poring over a novel and yawning now and then her dark hair carelessly tied with straight straying ends hanging about her face as he had many a time seen her after playing a game of hockey with her active romping friends His mother and Laura were the only ones at home now since the big elder brother was gone Of course they would miss him and be sad sometimes but Laura would enjoy life as much as ever and keep the home bright with youth Even as he thought of them the room faded and his own cabin appeared as he had seen it the day before through the open window with Cassandra moving about in her quiet gliding way haloed with light Again he would see a picture of another room all white and gold with slight French chairs and tables and couches and cushions and candelabra of quivering crystals with pale green walls and gold framed paintings and a great three cornered piano massive and dark where a slight fair girl sat idly playing tinkling music in keeping with herself and the room but quite out of keeping with the splendid instrument He saw people all about her chatting laughing sipping tea and eating thin bread and butter He saw as if from a distance another man himself in that room standing near the piano to turn her music while the tinkling runs and glib expressionless trills wove in and out a ceaseless nothing She spent years learning to do that he thought and any amount of money Oh well She had it to spend and of what else were they capable those hands He could see them fluttering caressingly over the keys pink slender pretty and then he saw other hands somewhat work worn not small nor yet too large but white and shapely Ah Of what were they not capable And the other girl in coarse white homespun seated before the fire in Hoke Belew s cabin holding in her arms the small bundle and her smile so rare and fleeting He saw again the handsome sullen youth in Bishop Towers garden regarding him over the hedge with narrowed eyes and his whole nature rebelled and cried out as before What a waste Why should he allow it to go on He must thrash this thing out once for all before he returned to his cabin the right and the wrong of the case before he should see her again while as yet he could be engineer of his own forces and hold his hand on the throttle to guide himself safely and wisely Could he succeed in influencing her to set her young lover s claims one side But in his heart he knew if such a thing were possible she would not be herself she would be another being and his love for her would cease No he must see her but little and let the tragedy go on even as the bishop had said go on as if he never had known her As soon as possible he must return and take up his work where he could not see the slow wreck of her life A heavy dread settled down upon him and he rode on with bowed head until his horse stumbled and thus roused him from his revery To what wild spot had the animal brought him David lifted his head and looked about him and it was as if he had been caught up and dropped in an enchanted wood The horse had climbed among great boulders and paused beneath an enormous overhanging rock He heard off at one side the rushing sound of a mountain stream and judged he was near the head of Lone Pine Creek But oh the wildness of the spot and the beauty of it and the lonely charm He tied his horse to a lithe limb that swung above his head and dismounting clambered on towards the rushing water The place was so screened in as to leave no vista anywhere hiding the mountains on all sides Light green foliage overhead where branches thickly interlaced from great trees growing out of the bank high above made a cool lucent shadowiness all around him There was a delicious odor of sweet shrub in the air and the fruity fragrance of the dark wild wake robin underfoot The tremendous rocks were covered with the most exquisite forms of lichen in all their varied shades of richness and delicacy He began carefully removing portions here and there to examine under his microscope when he noticed almost crushed under his foot a pale purple orchid like the one Cassandra had placed on his table Always thinking of her he stooped suddenly to lift the frail thing and at the instant a rifle shot rang out in the still air and a bullet meant for his heart cut across his shoulders like a trail of fire and flattened itself on the rock where he had been at work At the same moment with a bound of tiger like ferocity and swiftness one leaped toward him from a near mass of laurel and he found himself grappling for life or death with the man who fired the shot Not a word was spoken The quick short breathing the scuffling of feet among the leaves and the snapping of dead twigs underfoot were the only sounds Had the youth been a trained wrestler David would have known what to expect and would have been able to use method in his defence As it was he had to deal with an enraged creature who fought with the desperate instinct of an antagonist who fights to the death He knew that the odds were against him and felt rising within him a wild determination to win the combat and thinking only of Cassandra to settle thus the vexed question to fight with the blind passion and the primitive right of the strongest to win his mate He gathered all his strength his good English mettle and nerve and grappled with a grip of steel This way and that twisting turning stumbling on the uneven ground with set teeth and faces drawn and fierce they struggled and all the time the light tweed coat on David s back showed a deeper stain from his heart s blood and his face grew paler and his breath shorter Yet a joy leaped within him It was thus he might save her either to win her or to die for her for should Frale kill him she would turn from him in hopeless horror and David even in dying would save her Suddenly the battle was ended Thryng s foot turned on a rounded stone causing him to lose his foothold At the same instant with terrible forward impetus Frale closed with him bending him backward until his head struck the lichen covered rock The purple orchid was bruised beneath him and its color deepened with his blood Then Frale rose and looked down upon the pallid upturned face and inert body which lay as he had crushed it down As he stood thus a white figure bareheaded and alone came swiftly through the wall of laurel which hid them and pausing terror stricken in the open space looked from one to the other Illustration I take it back back from God the promise I gave you there by the fall Page one hundred seventy one For an instant Cassandra waited thus as if she too were struck dead where she stood Then she looked no more on the fallen man but only at Frale with eyes immovable and yet withdrawn as if she were searching in her own soul for a thing to do while her heart stood still and her throat closed Those great gray eyes with the green sea depths in them began to glow with a cruel light as if she too could kill as if they were drawing slowly from the deep well of her being as it were a sword from its scabbard wherewith to cut him through the heart Her hand stole to her throat and pressed hard Then she lifted it high above her head and held it as if in an instant more one might see the invisible sword flash forth and strike him Frale cried out then Don t don t curse me Cass and lifted his arm to shield his face while great beads of moisture stood out on his face It s not for me to curse Frale Her voice was low and clear Curses come from hell like what you been carrying in your heart that made you do this Her voice grew louder and her hand trembled and shut as if it grasped something I take it back back from God the promise I gave you there by the fall Then looking up her voice grew low again though still distinct I take that promise back forever oh God Her hand dropped The cruel light died slowly out of her eyes and she turned and knelt by the prostrate man and began pulling open his coat Frale took one step toward her Cass he said with shaking voice I ll he p you Her hands clinched into David s coat as she held it Go back Don t you touch even his least finger she cried looking up at him from where she knelt like a creature hurt to the heart defending its own You ve done your work Take your face where I never can see it again He still stood and looked down on her She turned again to David and thrusting her hand into his bosom drew it forth with blood upon it I say you Frale she cried holding it toward him quivering with the ferocity she could no longer restrain leave here or with this blood on my hand I ll call all hell to curse you Frale turned with bowed head and left her there CHAPTER XVIII IN WHICH DAVID THRYNG AWAKES Thryng lay in Hoke Belew s cabin not in the one great living room where were the fireplace and the large bed and the tiny cradle but in the smaller addition at the side entered only from the porch which extended along the front of both parts He still lay on the litter upon which he had been placed to carry him down the mountain an improvised thing made by stretching quilts across two poles of slender green pines The litter was placed on low trestles to raise it from the floor and close to the open door to give him air David had not regained consciousness since his hurt but lay like one dead with closed eyes and blanched lips yet they knew him to be living Cassandra sat beside him alone All night long she had been there unsleeping hollow eyed and worn with tearless grief She had done all she knew how to do Before going for help she had removed his clothing and bound about his body strips torn from her dress to stop the bleeding of his shoulders where the silver bullet had torn across them How the ball had missed giving a mortal wound was like a miracle Hoke Belew had tried to arouse him but had failed At intervals during the night Cassandra had managed to drop a little whiskey between his lips with a spoon and she had bathed him with the stimulant over heart and lungs and chafed his hands and had tried to warm his feet by rubbing them and wrapping them up between jugs of hot water She had bathed his bruised head and cut away the softly curling hair from the spot where his head had struck the rock What more she could do she knew not and now she sat at his side still chafing his hands and waiting for Hoke Belew s return Hoke had gone to the station to telegraph for Bishop Towers Fortunately as the hotel was so soon to be opened and the busy summer life to begin the operator was already there Azalea in the great room was preparing dinner stopping now and then to touch her baby s cradle or to stoop a moment over the treasure therein Aunt Sally sat in the doorway smoking her cob pipe and telling grewsome tales of how she had seen people hurted that a way and nevah come out en hit Sally had ridden over to give help and sympathy but Cassandra had said she would watch alone She had eaten nothing since the day before only sipping the coffee Azalea had brought her It was one of those breathless hours before a rain when not a leaf stirs even the birds were silent Cassandra tried once more to give David a few drops of the whiskey and this time it seemed as if he swallowed a little She thought she saw his eyelids quiver and her heart pounded suffocatingly in her breast She dropped beside him on her knees and once again tried to give him the only stimulant they had This time she was sure he took it and still kneeling there she bowed her head and pressed her lips upon the hand she had been chafing Did it move or not She could not tell and again she sat gazing in the still white face Oh the suspense Oh the joy that was agony If this were truly the awakening and meant life In her intensity of longing for some further signs she drew slowly nearer and nearer until at last her lips touched his Then in shame she hid her face in the quilt at his side and weak with the exhaustion of her long anguish and fasting and watching she wept the first tears tears of hope she was not strong enough to bear As she thus knelt weeping softly his fluttering eyelids lifted and he saw her there and felt the quivering hand beneath his head Not understanding how or why this should be he waited perfectly still trying to gather his thoughts A great peace was in his heart a peace and content so sweet he did not wish to move Lingering beneath this content he held a dim memory of a great anger a horror of anger when he saw red and hungered for blood Vaguely it seemed to him now that all was as he wished it to be with Cassandra near He liked to feel her hand beneath his head and her other hand upon his own and her heavy bronze hair so close and he closed his eyes once more to shut out all else for the room was strange to him this raftered place all whitewashed from ceiling to floor He had forgotten what had happened but Cassandra was there and he was content Something had touched his lips and brought him back he was sure of that and his weakly beating heart stirred to more vigorous action He turned his head a little a very little toward her and his fingers closed about her hand to hold it there She lifted her head then and they looked into each other s eyes a long deep look Later when Azalea entered she found them both sleeping Cassandra s hand still beneath his head his face pressed to her soft hair and his free arm flung about her Azalea stole away and hurried with the news to old Sally who also crept in and looked on them and stole away Yas she sure have saved his life said Sally Heap o times they nevah do come out en that thar kin o sleep I done seed sech before Ef he have come to hisself you reckon I bettah wake em up and give her a leetle hot milk She hain t eat nothin sence yestiday Naw leave em be No body nevah hain t starved in his sleep yit I reckon He hain t eat nothin neithah He sure have been bad hurted The two women sat in the large room and talked in low tones while at intervals Azalea crept to the door and looked in on them At last the baby wailed out with lusty cry which sounded through the stillness of the house and roused Cassandra but as she lifted her head David clung to her and drew her cheek to his lips Are you hurt he murmured In some strange way he had confused matters and thought it was she who had been shot It s not me that s hurt she said tenderly Azalea hurried away and returned with the warm milk she had prepared for Cassandra who took it and held it to David s lips Drink it Doctah She won t touch anything till you do Then he obeyed slowly drinking it all his eyes fixed on Cassandra s as a child looks up to his mother As she rose he held her with his free hand What is it How long His voice sounded thin and weak Strange I can t lift this arm at all Tell me Seems like I can t When you are strong again I will Feebly he tried to raise himself Don t oh don t Doctah Thryng If you bleed again you ll die she wailed Sit near me She drew a low chair and sat near him as she had through the slow and anxious hours and again he drowsed off only to open his eyes from time to time as if to assure himself that she was still there Again Azalea brought her milk and white beaten biscuit hot and sweet and Cassandra ate When David opened his eyes to look at her she smiled on him but would not let him talk to her Nevertheless his mind was busy trying to understand why he was lying thus and dimly the events of the last few days came back to him shadowy and confused When he looked up and saw her smile his heart was satisfied but when he closed his eyes again a strange sense of tragedy settled down upon him but what or why he knew not Suddenly he called to her as if from his sleep Have I killed some one and there was horror in his voice No no Doctor Thryng You been nigh about killed yourself Oh why didn t I send for a doctor who could do you right Bishop Towers won t know anything about this What have you done I sent for Bishop Towers Who did me up like this She was silent and rising quickly stepped out on the porch her cheeks flaming crimson Yesterday in her terror and frenzy she could have done anything but now with his eyes fixed on her face so intently she could not reply nor tell how alone she had stripped him to the waist and bound him about with the homespun cotton of her dress to stanch the bleeding before hurrying down the mountain for help Instinctively she had done the right thing and had done it well but now she could not talk about it David tried to call after her but she had gone around into the next room and taken the baby from his cradle where he was wailing his demands for attention Azalea had gone out for a moment and Aunt Sally lowed the wa n t no use sp ilin him by takin him up every time he fretted fer hit Hit would do him good to holler an stretch So she sat still and smoked Cassandra walked up and down the porch comforted by the feeling of the child in her arms The small head bobbed this way and that until she pressed it against her cheek and held him close and he gradually settled down on her bosom his face tucked softly in the curve of her neck and slept She heard David speaking her name and went to him but he only looked up at her and smiled I m sorry I left you alone she said tenderly I ll call Aunt Sally No wait I only want to look at you She stood swaying her lithe body to rock the sleeping child David thought he never had seen anything lovelier How serious his wounds were he did not know But one thing he knew well and to that one thought he clung He wanted Cassandra where he could see her all the time He wished she would talk to him and not let him lose consciousness relapsing into the horror of a strange dream that continued to haunt him Do you love that baby he asked his voice faint and high He s a right nice baby I say do you love him Why I reckon I do Don t try to move that way Doctah You may not be done right and you ll bleed again Oh we don t know we are so ignorant Azalie and me He smiled Nothing matters now he said They heard voices and she looked out from the doorway It s Hoke They ve sent old Doctor Bartlett I m so glad Aunt Sally I reckon they ll need hot water Get some ready will you Cassandra Cassandra called David almost irritably She came back to him Where are they Down the road a piece I m glad You ll be done right now Stoop to me She obeyed and the free arm caught and held her then as the voices drew near released her with glowing eyes and burning cheeks She stepped out on the porch to meet them half hiding her face behind the babe in her arms and old doctor Bartlett as he looked on her with less prejudiced and more experienced eyes thought he too never had seen anything lovelier He s awake said Cassandra quietly to Hoke and the two men went to David She carried the child back and asked Aunt Sally to wait on them while she sat down in a low splint rocker clinging to the little one and listening with throbbing nerves to the voices in the room beyond When Hoke came out to them a moment later Azalea began eagerly to question him but Cassandra was silent Doctah says we bettah tote im ovah to his own place to day Aunt Sally lows she can bide thar fer a while an see him well again You hain t goin to low that be ye Hoke Hit mount look like we wa n t willin fer him to bide long of us Hit hain t what looks like hit s what s best fer him said Hoke sagely Whatevah doctah says we ll do Then Hoke laughed quietly He done tol Doctor Bartlett at he reckoned somebody mus a took him fer some sorter wild creetur an shot him by mistake I guess Frale s safe enough f om him if the fool boy only know d hit Frale he s plumb crazy the way he s b en actin said Azalea An Bishop Towahs he telegrafted at he d send this here doctah an he d come up to morrer with Miz Towahs to stop ovah with you so I reckon yer maw wants you down thar Cass Cassandra rose quickly and placed the sleeping child gently in his cradle box I ll go she said There s no need for me here now Hoke you ve been right good She stopped abruptly and turned to his wife I must wear your dress off Azalie but I ll send it back by Hoke as soon as hit s been washed She went out the door almost as if she were eager to escape Hain t ye goin to wait fer yer horse said Hoke laughing Set a minute till I fetch him I clean forgot she said and when he had left she turned to her friend Azalie don t say anything to Hoke about me us Did Aunt Sally see You know I didn t know myself until I woke and found myself there I d been trying to make him take a little whiskey and I must have gone asleep like I was and he woke up and must a felt like he had to kiss somebody he was that glad to be alive Nevah you fret child Azalea smiled a quiet smile I m not one to talk anyway I reckon Doctah Thryng s about right He sure have been good to me The widow sat on her little stoop waiting and watching as her daughter rode to the door and wearily alighted Cassandry Merlin For the Lord s sake What all is up now Hoyle where is that boy Hoyle come here an take the horse fer sister Be ye most dade honey I reckon ye be Ye look like hit Cassandra kissed her mother and passed on into the house I couldn t send you word last night anyway I reckoned you d rest better if you didn t know for we all thought Doctor Thryng was sure killed Did Hoke tell you this morning I lowed you was stoppin with Azalie at baby was sick or somethin when Hoyle went up to the cabin an said doctah wa n t there Frale sure have done for hisself I reckon you are cl ar shet o him now an I m glad ye be since he done took to the idee o marryin with you What

Hoyle stood in the middle of the room and gazed with wide eyed wonder Be the doctah dade maw he asked in an awed whisper No child no You fetch a leetle light ud an chips an we ll make her some coffee Sister s that tired pore child Have ye been up all night Cass She nodded her head and still sobbed on He s gettin on all right now be he Again she nodded but did not take her hands from her face Then you d ought to be glad Hit ain t like Frale had of killed him Farwell he had many a time sech as that with one an another an he nevah come to no harm f om hit I reckon Frale ll be safe Be ye cryin fer him Cass Pore child I nevah did think you keered fer Frale that a way Then Cassandra burst forth with impetuous fire Oh mother mother Never say that name to me again Mother I saw them I saw them fighting and all the time the doctor was bleeding bleeding and dying where Frale had shot him I don t know how long they d been fighting but I came there and I saw them I saw him slip and how Frale crushed him down down and his head struck the rock I saw and I almost cursed Frale I hope I didn t oh I hope not But mother mother Don t ask me anything more now Oh I want to cry I want to cry and never stop While she lay thus weeping the soft rain that had been threatening all day began pattering down blessed and soothing the rain to the earth and the tears to the girl In spite of the rain Thryng was carried home that afternoon according to the physician s orders and placed in his cabin with Aunt Sally to stand guard over him and provide for his wants A bed was improvised for her on the floor of the cabin while David lay in his own bed in his canvas room bandaged about both body and head and withal moderately comfortable sufficiently himself to realize what had occurred and overjoyed because of the reward his wounds had brought him Doctor Bartlett came down to the Fall Place and was given the bed in the loom shed as David had been and had the pleasure of again seeing Cassandra who her tears dried and her manner composed looked after his needs as if no storms had ever shaken her soul CHAPTER XIX IN WHICH DAVID SENDS HOKE BELEW ON A COMMISSION AND CASSANDRA MAKES A CONFESSION Early one morning Hoke Belew put his head in at the door of Thryng s cabin where Aunt Sally was squatted before the fireplace preparing breakfast for the patient How s doc he asked He s right fa r He mount be worse an he mount be bettah You reckon I mount go in yandah whar he is at Ye can look an see is he awake I m gittin his hot bread an coffee You bettah bide an have a leetle she said with ever ready hospitality He crossed the floor with careful steps and paused in the doorway of the canvas room big and smiling That you Hoke Come in said David cheerfully He extended a hand which Hoke took in his and held awkwardly shocked at the white face before him Ye do look puny he said at last But we uns sure be glad yer livin Ye tol me to come early so I come It s awfully good of you Bring a chair and sit near so we can talk a bit Now Hoke laid up here as I am I need your help I want to send you to Farington or Lone Pine somewhere I don t know where such things are to be had but Hoke you ve been married and know all about what s needed here Ye want me to git ye a license I reckon said Hoke grinning an ye mount send me a errant I d like a heap worse that s so but what good will hit be to ye now You can t stan on your feet I can put it under my pillow and keep it to get well on See here Hoke I don t even know if she ll marry me she has not said so but I ll be ready You ll keep this quiet for me Hoke Because it would trouble her if the whole mountain side should know what I have done before she does Yet a girl like Cassandra is worth winning if you have to go to the edge of the grave to do it so whenever she will have me I want to be ready They talked in low tones Hoke leaning forward close to David his elbows on his knees I reckon you are a thinkin to bide on here long o we uns an not carry her off nowhar else he asked gravely David s paleness left him for a moment as the warm tide swept upward from his heart My home is not in this country and wherever a man goes he expects to take his wife with him Don t you people here in the mountains do the same I reckon so but hit would nigh about kill Azalie if she war to lose Cass They have been frien s evah sence they war littlin s Hoke if you were to find it necessary to go away anywhere would you leave your wife behind to please Cassandra Merlin The man was silent and David continued Before you were married if you had known there was another man and a criminal at that hanging around determined to get her wouldn t you have married her out of hand as soon as you could get her consent It s my opinion knowing the sort of man you are that you would I sure would Then you can understand why I wish to have a marriage license under my pillow I reckon so but you you all hain t quite our kind not bein kin to none of us You understand me suh We uns are a proud people here an we think a heap o our women Hit would be right hard should you git sorter tired o Cassandry when you come to git her amongst your people bein she hain t like none o your folks understand an Cassandry she s sorter hard hit jest now she don t rightly know what all she do think Me an Azalie we been speakin right smart together an well we do sure think a heap o you Doc an hit ain t no disrespect to you uns neither Have you said anything to her maw Not a word When I learned another man was before me I stood one side as an honorable man should and gave him his chance But when it comes to being attacked by the other man and shot in the back by heaven no power on earth will hold me from trying to win her As for the other matter never you fear Be my friend Hoke Waal I reckon you ll have yer own way an I mount as well git hit fer ye but I did promise Azalie at I d speak that word to ye said the young man rising with an air of relief Tell your wife that you are both of you quite right and that I am right also Just hunt up my trousers will you I want my pocket book If I have to sign anything before anybody bring him here I don t care what you do so you get it There on that card you have it all my full name and all that you know David tried to eat what Sally prepared for him using his unbound hand but his egg was hard his coffee thick and boiled He could not drink it very well for his head was too low and he could not raise himself so he lay silent and uncomfortable watching her move about his rooms wearing her great black sunbonnet She appeared kindly and pleasant when he could see her face which was thin and very much lined but motherly and good He fell in the way of calling her Aunt Sally as others did and this seemed to please her She treated him as if he were a big boy who did not know what was good for himself She called all the green blossoming things with which Cassandra had adorned the cabin trash and asked who had toted hit thar Waiting and listening sure Cassandra would not leave him all day without coming to him even though Aunt Sally had taken him in charge David s mind was full of her If he closed his eyes he saw her If he opened them and watched Sally s meagre form and black sunbonnet moving about he thought what it might be to see Cassandra there He could not and would not look at the future The picture Hoke Belew had summoned up when he had suggested the taking of Cassandra away among people alien to her he put from him He would not see it nor think of it The present was his and it was all he had perhaps all he ever would have and now he would not allow one little joy of it to escape him He would be greedy of it and have all the gladness of the moments as they came He could see her down below making ready for their visitors and he knew she would not come until the last task was done but meantime his patience was wearing away Aunt Sally finished her work and David could see her from where he lay seated in the doorway with her pipe looking out on the gently falling rain Without all was very peaceful only within himself was turmoil and impatience But he knew that to remain calm and unmoved was to keep back his fever and hasten recuperation so he closed his eyes and tried to live for the moment in the remembrance of that awakening when he had found her kneeling at his side Thus he dropped to sleep and again when he awoke he found Cassandra there as if in answer to his silent call She was seated quietly sewing as if it were no unusual thing for her to visit him thus and when his earnest gaze caused her to look up she only smiled without perturbation and came to him I sent Aunt Sally down to see mother while I could stay by you and do for you a little she said Calm and restful she seemed yet when he extended his free hand and took hers he felt a tremor in her touch that delighted his heart He brought it to his lips I ve been needing you all the morning Aunt Sally has done everything all she could If I should let you have this hand again would you go so far away from me that I could not reach you Not if you want me near Then put away your sewing and bring your chair close to me and let us talk together while we may She obeyed and sat looking away from him out through the open door Were her eyes searching for the mountain top You have thoughts sweet big thoughts dear girl put them in words for me now while we are so blessedly alone I can t say rightly what I think Seems like if I had some other way something besides words to tell my thoughts with I could do it better but words are all we have and seems like when I want them most they won t come That s the way with all of us Don t you see you are still beyond my reach Come If you can t tell your thoughts in words give them by the touch of your hands as you did a moment ago She did as he bade her and leaning forward took his hand in both her own That s right I ll teach you how to tell your thoughts without words Now how came you to find us the other day I don t know myself It was a strange way First I rode down to Teasley s Mill to to try to persuade them Giles Teasley to allow him to go free She paused and put her hand to her throat as her way was I think Doctor Thryng I d better build up the fire and get you some hot milk Doctor Bartlett said you must have it often and to keep you very quiet Not until you tell me now this moment what I ask you You went to the mill to try to help Frale out of his trouble Cassandra have you loved that boy Her face assumed its old look of masklike impassivity I reckoned he might hold himself steady and do right would they only leave him be and give him the chance Cassandra answer me Was it for love of him that you gave him your promise Her face grew white and for a moment she bowed her head on his hand Please Doctor Thryng let me tell you the strange part first then you can answer that question in your own way She lifted her head and looked steadily in his eyes You remember that day we went to Cate Irwin s When we came to the place where we can see far far over the mountains I laughed with something glad in my heart It was the same this time when I got to that far open place All at once it seemed like I was so free free from the heavy burden and all in a kind of light that was only the same gladness in my heart I stopped there and waited and thought how you said that time It s good just to be alive and I thought if you were there with me and should put your hand on my bridle as you did that night in the rain and if you should lead me away off even into the Valley of the shadow of death into those deep shadows below us I would go and never say a word All at once it seemed as if you were doing that and I forgot Frale and kept on and on and wherever it seemed like you were leading me I went It seemed like I was dreaming or feeling like a hand was on my heart a hand I could not see pulling me and making me feel This way this way I must go this way I never had been where my horse took me before I didn t think how I ever could get back again I didn t seem to see anything around me only to go on on on and at last it seemed I couldn t go fast enough until all at once I came to your horse tied there and I heard strange trampling sounds a little farther on where my horse could not go and I got off and ran I fell down and got up and ran again and it seemed as if my feet wouldn t leave the ground but only held me back It seemed like they hadn t any more power to run and then I came there and I saw She paused covering her face with her hand as if to shut out the sight and slipped to her knees beside him Oh I saw your faces all terrible He put his arm about her and drew her close I saw you fall and your face when it seemed like you were dying as you fought I saw Her sobs shook her and she could not go on My beautiful priestess of good and holy things he said She leaned to him then and placing her arms about him ever mindful of his hurt she lifted his head to her shoulder The flood gates of her reserve once lifted the full tide of her intense nature swept over him and enveloped him It was as light to his soul and healing to his body How often it had seemed as if he saw her with that halo of light about her and now it was as if he had been drawn within its charmed radius as surely he had And then dear heart what did you do I thought you were killed and almost almost I cursed him I hope now I wasn t so wicked But I I called back from God the promise I had given him And then tell me all the blessed truth and then You were bleeding bleeding and I took off your clothes and I saw where you were bleeding your life away and I tied my dress around you I tore it in pieces and wound it all around you as well as I could and then I put your coat back on you and still you didn t waken It seemed as if you had stopped breathing And then I saw the bruise on your head and I thought maybe you were only stunned I brought water from the branch and put your head on the wet cloth and bound it all around but still you looked like he had killed you and then he stirred in her arms to feel their clasp And then then I went for help she said in so low a tone it seemed hardly spoken First you did something you have not told me She waited in a sweet shame he recognized and gloried in but he wanted the confession from her lips And then You said you would teach me to say things without words she said tremulously Not now Later Put everything you did in words And then I thought you were dying She drew in a long sighing breath And you kissed me I have a right to know for I missed them all I did I did she cried vehemently A hundred times I kissed you I had called my promise back from God and I dared it I wasn t ashamed I would have done it if all the mountain side had been there to see but afterwards when that strange doctor from Farington came and I knew he must uncover you and find my torn dress around you somehow then I felt I didn t want for him to look at me and I was glad to go away Do you want to know what he said when he saw it Whoever did this kept you alive young man So you see how you are my beautiful bringer of good You are Oh I have only one arm now I am at a disadvantage When I can stand on my feet I will pay them all back those kisses you threw away on me then We shan t need words then dearest I ll teach you the sweet lesson Your arms tremble they are tired dear Could you let your head rest here and sleep as you did the other day To think how I woke and found you beside me sleeping Let me go now I have things I ought to do for you Not yet I have things I must say to you Please Doctor Thryng My name is David You must call me by it Please Doctor David let me go Why To warm some milk I brought it up for you Pity we must eat to live Then if I let you take your arms away will you come back to me Yes I ll bring the milk There go I m giving you your own way because I know I will recover the sooner the strength I have lost A man flat on his back with but one arm free is no good But you don t let me go Listen Cassandra You brought me back to life Do you know what for What did your father tell you That one should be sent for you It is I dearest From away over on the other side of the earth I have come for you We fought like beasts Frale and I I had given you up you Cassandra had said in my heart I will go away and leave her to the one she has chosen if that be right and even at that moment Frale shot me and sprang upon me and I fought I was glad the chance was given me there in the wilderness in that old and primitive way to settle it and win you I put all the force and strength of my body into it and more all the strength of my love for you It was with that in my heart we clinched I said I will fight to the death for her She shall be mine whether I live or die Stop crying sweet be glad as I am Give thanks that it was to the life and not to the death Listen once more while I can feel and know give way to your great heart of love and treat me as you did after you had bound up my wounds Learn the sweet lesson I said I would teach you Late that evening Hoke Belew rode up to the door of David s cabin and called Aunt Sally out to speak with him How s doc He s doin right well He s asleep now Won t ye light an come in I reckon not Azalie she s been alone all day an I guess she ll be some feared Will you put that thar under doc s pillow whar he kin find hit in the mawnin Hit s a papah he sont me fer Tell im I reckon hit s all straight He kin see Them people Cassandry was expectin from Farington did they come to day Yas they come They re down to Miz Farwell s Well you tell doc at Azalie an me we ll be here long leven in the mawnin Hoke rode off under the winking stars for the clouds after the long day of rain had lifted and in the still night were rolling away over the mountain tops Aunt Sally slipped quietly back into the cabin and softly closed the door of the canvas room lest the rustling of paper should waken her charge for she meant to examine that paper quite innocently since she could neither read nor write but out of sheer childish curiosity She need not have feared waking David however for all his physical discomfort forgotten dominated by the supreme happiness that possessed him yet weak in body to the point of exhaustion he slept profoundly and calmly on even when she came stealthily and slipped the paper beneath his pillow as Hoke had requested CHAPTER XX IN WHICH THE BISHOP AND HIS WIFE PASS AN EVENTFUL DAT AT THE FALL PLACE Do you know James said Betty Towers as she walked at her husband s side in the sweet morning slowly climbing up to David s cabin from the Fall Place I feel almost vexed with you for never bringing me here before Why my dear Yes I do To think of all this loveliness and for six years you have been here many times and never once told me you knew a place hardly two hours away as entrancing as heaven Even now James if it hadn t been for Cassandra I wouldn t have come Why it s the loveliest spot on earth Stand still a minute James and listen That s a thrush Oh something smells so sweet It s a locust And that s a redbird s note There he is like a red blossom in those bushes There no there You will look in the wrong direction James and now he s gone You remember what David Thryng wrote It s good just to be alive He s always saying that and now I understand in such a place as this Oh just breathe the air James I certainly can t help doing that dear The bishop was puffing a little over the climb his slight young wife took so easily I don t care Here I ve lived in cities all my life while you have lived down here and it has lost its charm to you Only think of all this gorgeous display of nature just for these mountain people and what is it to them To them it s the natural order of things just as you implied in regard to me Hark James Now that s a catbird And not a thrush The other was a thrush I know the difference Wise little woman Come There s that young man getting up a fever by fretting We said I said we would come early James I m going to stay up here and let you go to that stupid wedding down in Farington without me Perhaps we may have something interesting up here if you ll hurry a little What is it James I really can t say dear She took his hand and they walked on Wouldn t this be an ideal spot to spend a honeymoon Hear that fall away down below us How cool it sounds Why don t you pay attention to me What are you thinking about James I am making a little poem for you dear Listen Chatter chatter little tongue What a wonder how you re hung Up above the epiglottis Tied on with a little knot tis Only geniuses may be silly James but perhaps you can t help it I think married people ought to establish the custom of sabbatical honeymoons to counteract the divorce habit Suppose we set the example now we have arrived at just the right time for one and spend ours here Anything you say dear Being an absent minded man the bishop had fallen in the way of saying that when had he paused to think he would have admitted that everything was made to bend to his will or wish by the spirited little being at his side Moreover being an absent minded man he drew her to him and kissed her Aunt Sally watching them from the cabin door wondered if the bishop were going away on a journey to leave his wife behind for why else should he kiss her thus Will you sit there on the rock and enjoy the mountains while I see how he is said the bishop So they parted at the door and Aunt Sally brought her a chair and stood beside her giving her every detail of the affair as far as she knew it She sat bareheaded in the sun to Sally s amazement for she had her hat in her lap and could have worn it The wind blew wisps of her fine straight hair across her pink cheeks and in her eyes as she gazed out upon the blue mountains and listened to Sally s tale of How hit all come about For Sally went back into the family history of the Teasleys and the Caswells and the Merlins and the Farwells until Betty forgot the flight of time and the bishop called her Then she went in to see David He had worked his right hand free from its bandages and was able to lift it a little She took it in hers and looked brightly down at him Why Doctor Thryng you look better than when you were in Farington Doesn t he James Aunt Sally gave me to understand you were nearly dead David laughed happily I was but I am very much alive now I am to be married missus Towers our wedding is to be quite comme il faut It is to be at high noon and the ceremony performed by a bishop James Betty dropped into a chair and looked helplessly at her husband You haven t your vestments here I have all I need dear You know Doctor from mister Belew s telegram we were led to expect A death instead of a wedding David finished Betty turned to him Why didn t you tell us when you were down You never gave the slightest hint of your state of mind and there I was with my heart aching for Cassandra when you you stood ready to save her I m so glad for Cassandra I could hug you Doctor Thryng Suddenly she turned on her husband James Have you thought of everything all the consequences What will his mother and the family over in England say James threw up his hand and laughed Don t laugh James Have you thought this all out Doctor Are you sure you can make them understand over there Won t they think this awfully irregular Will they ever be reconciled I know how they are My father was English They never need be reconciled It s our affair and there s nothing to call me back there to live What I do or whom I make my wife is nothing to them I may visit my mother of course but for the rest they gave me up years ago when I had no use for the life they mapped out for me I have nothing to inherit there It would go to my older brother anyway I may follow my own inclination thank God And as for it s being irregular on the contrary we are distinguished enough to have a bishop perform the ceremony That will be considered a great thing at home when they do come to hear of it But it is very sudden Doctor I suppose that s why I said irregular Betty Towers paused a moment with a little frown then laughed outright Does Cassandra know she is to be married to day She learned the fact yesterday incidentally bless her and her only objection was a most feminine one She had no proper dress She said she was wearing her best when she found me and but I told her the trousseau was to come later Betty rose with impulsive importance Well James we ve so little time I must go and help her prepare And you ll rest now won t you Doctor You stay up here with him James and I ll find some way of sending your things up Thar s Hoyle he kin he p a heap He kin ride the mule an tote anything ye like and Marthy I reckon ye kin git her up here on my horse hit s thar at her place said Sally who had been standing in the doorway keenly interested When they were alone she said to David Hit s a right quare way o doin things gitt n married in bed but if Bishop Towahs do hit hit sure must be all right leastways Cassandry ll think so David took the superintendence of the arrangement of his cabin upon himself and Hoke Belew with the bishop s aid carried out his directions One side of his canvas room was rolled to the top leaving the place open to the hills and the beauty without His bed was placed so that he might face the open space and that Cassandra could kneel at his right side His writing table draped with a white cloth and covered with green hemlock boughs formed the altar It was all very quickly and simply done and then David lay quiet with closed eyes listening to his musicians in the tree tops fluting their own gladness while Hoke Belew went down below and the bishop sat out on the rock and meditated Cassandra came up to the cabin alone and sat with David while the bishop donned his priestly vestments and the wedding procession wound slowly up the trail from the Fall Place decorously and gravely clad in their best Azalea and Betty came side by side the mother rode Sally s speckled white horse and little Hoyle ran on ahead Hoke carried his baby in his arms Behind them all rode Uncle Jerry Carew full of the liveliest interest and curiosity Said David This is May day I know what they re doing at home now if the weather will let them They re having gay times with out of door fetes The country girls are wearing their prettiest gowns and the men are wearing sprigs of May in their buttonholes Where did you get your roses Azalie brought them And who put them in your hair missus Towahs did that Do you like me this way David You are the loveliest being my eyes ever rested on This was my best dress last year I did it up and mended it this morning It s home woven like the one I like the other one you said you liked David smiled looking up into the gray eyes with the green lights and blue depths in them How serene and poised her manner was on the verge of the momentous step she was about to take while his own heart was beating high He wondered if she really comprehended the change it was to make in her life that she showed no apprehension or fear Cassandra do you realize that in fifteen minutes you will be my wife It will be a great change for you dearest In spite of all I can do you may be sad sometimes and I may ask of you things you don t want to do I ve been sad already in my life and done things I didn t want to do I don t guess you could change that only God could And you don t feel in the least disturbed Your heart doesn t beat any harder nor your breath come quicker Tell me how you feel She smiled and drew a long breath I don t know how it is Everything is right peaceful and sweet outside the sky and the hills and all the birds even the wind is still in the trees like everything was waiting for something good to happen In your heart it is sweet and peaceful too and waiting for something good to happen Yes David God forgive me if ever I fail you he said drawing her down to him God make me worthy of you Then the bishop entered and the little procession followed and gathered about while the solemn words of the service were uttered Cassandra knelt at David s side as together they partook of the bread and wine and with the worn circlet of gold which had been tied to her father s little Greek books they were pronounced man and wife Then rising from her knees she bent and kissed David the long first kiss of the wedded pair and turned her gravely happy face to the bishop who admitted to Betty afterward that he had never kissed a bride other than his own with such unalloyed satisfaction It was all over quickly and Cassandra was standing in a new world Her eyes shone with the love light no longer held back and veiled She accompanied them all to the door and parted from them even her mother and little Hoyle as a hostess parting from her guests She would not allow any one to stay behind for the wedding feast had been spread in her mother s house and thither they repaired to eat and talk everything over Mother felt right bad to leave us alone She meant to bring everything up and all eat together here but I thought it would be better just we two and me to set things out for you Lie quiet and close your eyes David and make out like you are sleeping while I do it With perfect contentment he obeyed and lay watching her through half closed lids It was always the same vision She moved between him and a halo of light that seemed to be a part of her and to go with her now at his bedside now bending before the fireplace At last the small pine table which had served as an altar was set with their first meal The home was established He opened his eyes and looked on the feast she had set before him The pink rose was still in her hair and one at her throat and two perfect ones were in a glass near his plate The table was drawn close to his bedside and strawberries were upon it and a glass pitcher of cream There were white beaten biscuit and tea as he had made it for her so long ago on her first and only visit to his cabin when he was at home so she had made it for him now There were chicken and green peas also How quickly everything has happened How perfect it all is How did you get all these things together So she told him where everything came from Mother churned the butter to have it right fresh and she left it without salt for you like you said you used to have it in England Uncle Jerry brought the peas from his garden and he shelled them himself I made the biscuit this morning and Aunt Sally fried the chicken when she came down and Azalie prepared the peas and we kept them all hot in the fireplace theirs down there and ours up here Cassandra laughed merrily I reckon it looked funny Every one carried something when they came up Hoyle had the peas in a tin pail and mother rode Aunt Sally s Speckle and carried the biscuit in a pan on front Shut your eyes and you can see them come that way David while I sit here with you talking and feeling that happy Don t try to use your right hand that way I can see it hurts you Let me go on feeding you like I am Don t I do it right Perfectly but I want you to bring that cushion over here and put it under my pillow so you won t have to lift my head That s right Now I want to see you eat You can t feed me and yourself at the same time You won t Then we ll take it turn about How have you managed these days Did Aunt Sally feed you Oh I don t believe you ate anything You couldn t could you She spoke so sadly he laughed It s a lucky thing you sent for the bishop instead of the doctor or I would have had no wife and would have starved to death I couldn t have survived another day Again she laughed out as she seemed so suddenly to have learned to do And I would have stayed away and let you starve to death You must open your mouth David and not try to talk now Ah no that s enough We ve a thousand things to say and plans to make You eat while I talk When I am up we must find some one to stay with your mother She should not be left alone Cassandra paled a little He was watching her face You will be staying up here with me you know all the time Yes I know Her throat seemed to tighten and she looked off toward the hills as her way was Don t you like the thought of staying up here with me Make your confession dearest one He drew her down to look in his eyes It s done We are man and wife Her eyes swam with tears but her lips smiled I do I do want to bide with you All the way before me now looks like a long path of light like what I have dreamed sometimes when the moon shines long down the mists at night Only one place I can t quite see is it shadow or not Perhaps it s only the thought of mother down there alone She spoke dreamily and with the same look of seeing things beyond except that now she fixed her eyes not on the mountain top but on his own Is it in my eyes you see the long path of light Are we together in it I see you always with the light about you I saw you so first in your own home before the blazing fire such a hearth fire as I had never seen before You have appeared to me in my dreams with light about you ever since and in my visions when I have been riding over these hills alone What are you seeing now You as you helped me that first time there in the snow You looked so ill but your way was strong and I thought all at once in a flash like it came from Go on Like it came from my father One will come for you She hid her face in his bosom and her words came smothered and brokenly All the ride home I put them away but they would come back his words On the mountain top one will come for you but we were in such trouble I thought it was just the thought of my father It s always strongest when trouble comes like he would comfort me Don t you have it also when happiness comes to you as on this morning while we waited together No great happiness like this ever came before I have been glad like when mother said I might go to Farington to school and when I knelt and was confirmed I was glad then The first gladness I can remember was when my father used to carry me in his arms up and down his path and repeat strange poetry to me When you are well we will go there won t we Yes dearest but didn t the remembrance come to you just now when you saw the long path of light before us I think no David I m afraid I forgot every one but you then when you asked would I like to bide here with you and the long path of light was our love for it reaches up to heaven doesn t it David It reaches to heaven Cassandra Then they were silent for there was no more to say CHAPTER XXI IN WHICH THE SUMMER PASSES Midsummer arrived and David healed of his wounds pronounced himself as strong as a cricketer What he meant by that Hoyle could only conjecture and after much pondering decided that his strength was now so great that should he desire to do so he could leap into the air or jump long distances after the manner of crickets You reckon you could jump as fer in one jump now as from here to t other side the water trough yandah he asked one day as they sat on the porch steps together No I don t reckon so said David laughing Well could you jump ovah this here house and the loom shed in one jump I don t reckon so Be sensible honey son You mustn t low him to ax ye fool questions Doctah You knows they hain t nobody kin do such as that Hoyle called his mother from within He has some idea in his head What is it brother Hoyle I heered you tellin Cass at you was gettin strong as one o these here cricket bugs an I had one t other day he could jump as fer as cl ar acrost the po ch and he was only bout a inch long er less n a inch I thought if brothah David was that strong he could jump a heap David had comforted Hoyle for the loss of Cassandra from the home by explaining that they were now become brothers for the rest of their lives and in order to give this assurance appreciable significance he had taken the small chap to the circus and had treated him to pink lemonade and a toy balloon They had remained over until the next day and Doctor Bartlett and David had examined him all over at the old physician s office and then had gone into a little room by themselves and stayed a long time leaving him outside Then to compensate for such gross neglect David had taken him to a clothing store and bought him a complete suit of store clothing very neat and pretty Hoyle would have been in the seventh heaven over all this were it not alas that there the child for the first time in his life looked into a mirror that revealed him to himself from head to foot little wry neck hunched back and all David not realizing this was a revelation to the little man wondered as they walked away that all his enthusiasm and exuberance of spirits had left him and that he walked at his side wearily and sadly silent His pathetic little legs spindled down from the smart new trousers and his hands dangled weakly from his thin wrists albeit his fingers clung tightly to his toy balloon We re going back to the bishop s now and we ll have a good dinner and then you ll have a whole hour to play with Dorothy before we leave for home said David cheeringly The child made no response other than to slip his hand into David s What are you thinking about brother Hoyle Jest nothin I war a wonderin Oh there is a difference What were you wondering Maw told me if you war that good to take me to a circus I mustn t bothah you with a heap o questions at wa n t no good That s all right I m questioning you now What war you an that old man feelin me all ovah for War you tryin to make out hu come my hade is sot like this a way Reckon you r aly could set hit straight an get this er lump off n my back Don t worry about your head and your back You have a very good head That s more than some can say I nevah see nary othah boy like I be You reckon that li l girl she thought I war

axed her whyn t she hol her head like I did an she said Don t want to So I said Don t want to He twisted his head about to look up in David s face and his lips smiled but in his eyes was a suspicion of tears His heart heavy for the child David praised him for a brave little chap comforting him as best he could You reckon she d like me if I war to give her this here balloon No you take that home to sister The little girl can get one when the circus comes again But after dinner David did not send Hoyle off to play the hour with Dorothy He took her on his knee and entertained them both with tales and mimicry until he had them in gales of laughter and for the time being Hoyle forgot his troubles As the days passed David became more and more interested in his patch of ground and the growing things in his garden Never had he labored with his hands in this fashion and each night he lay down to sleep physically weary in contentment of spirit Steadily he progressed toward the desired goal of health In his young wife also he found a rich satisfaction watching her unfold and blossom into the gracious wifehood and ladyhood he had dreamed of for her Together they used to stroll to the little farm where she told him all she knew about the crops what was best for the animals and what would be needed for themselves Long before David was able to oversee the work himself she had set Elwine Timms to sowing cow peas and planting corn Behold your heritage David said to her one morning as they strolled thus among the thrifty greenness and patches of vetch where the cow was contentedly feeding He laughed joyously and drew his wife s arm through his She looked up at him wistfully He thought she sighed and bent his head to listen What was that little sound I was only thinking We ll sit here where we sat that morning when we both put our hands to the plough and you tell me what you were thinking I ought not to stop now David I ve left all for mother to do I was that busy at the cabin I didn t get down to her this morning You can t keep two homes going with only your own two dear hands Cassandra It must be stopped We ll find some one to live with your mother and take your place She gave a little gasp then sat silently her hands dropped passively in her lap and he thought she seemed sad He took her face between his hands and made her look into his eyes Don t be worried sweetheart we ll make a few changes You re mine now you know not only to serve me and labor for me as you have been doing all these weeks but But I like it David I like doing for you I hope it may always be so I can do for you Would you like me to become an invalid again so you could keep on in the way you began Not that but sometimes I think what if you shouldn t really need me She hid her face on his breast I I want you to need me David It was almost like a cry for help as she said it Dear heart dear heart What are you thinking and fearing Can t you understand You are mine now to be cared for and loved and held very near and dear to my heart We are no more twain we are one Yes but but David I I want you to need me she sobbed and he knew some thought was stirring in her heart which she could not yet put into words He comforted her and soothed her explaining certain plans which later he put into execution so that her duties at the Fall Place were brought to an end and he could have her always with him A daughter of her Uncle Cotton who had gone down into South Carolina to live was induced to come and stay with the widow and the girl s brother came with her and helped David on the farm Then David made changes in and about his cabin He built on another room and put therein a cook stove He could not bear to see his young wife bending at the hearth preparing their meals and when she demurred he explained that he wished to keep her as she was and not see her growing old and wrinkled before her time with the burning heat of the open fire in her face like many of the mountain women One evening they had eaten their supper out under the trees she proposed they should walk up to her father s path as she called the spot toward which she so often lifted her eyes and David was well pleased to go with her As they set out she asked him to wait a moment while she went back for something and quickly returned bringing his flute I ve often wished father could have heard you play on this she said as he took it from her hand They crossed the little river that tumbled and rushed among great moss covered boulders on its way to the fall and followed its wayward course toward its head where the way was untrodden and wild as if no human foot had ever climbed along its banks After a little they turned off toward a tremendous rock of solid granite that had been cleft smoothly in twain by some gigantic force of nature and walking between the towering walls of stone came out on the farther side upon a small level space where immense ferns and flags grew thickly in the rich soil held in place and kept damp by the great cool masses of stone Above this little dell the hill rose steeply and Cassandra led him to a narrow opening in the dense shrubbery surrounding the spot from which a beaten path wound upward overarched with thickly interlacing branches of birch wood and hemlocks Along this winding trail they climbed until they reached a cluster of enormous cedars which made the dark place on the mountain Cassandra had pointed out to him from below Here the path widened so they could walk side by side and continued along a level line at the foot of the dark mass of trees Here father used to walk up and down reading in his little books seems like I can hear his voice now Sometimes he would look off over the valley below us there and repeat parts by heart Isn t it beautiful here David Heavenly beautiful I m glad we never came here before Why dearest Because She hesitated with parted lips and cheeks flushed from the climb David stood with bared head He felt as if he were in a cathedral And why because he asked again For now we bring just happiness with us We re not troubled or wondering about anything No sorrow comes with us In our hearts we are sure sure She paused again and lifted her eyes to his Sure that all is right when we belong to each other this way Yes sure Oh David sure sure She threw her arms about his neck and drew his face down to hers It s even a greater happiness than when he used to carry me in his arms here There s no sorrow near us It s all far away Thus sometimes she would throw off all the habitual reserve of her manner and open her heart to him following the rich impulses of her nature to their glorious revelation Now David sit here and play play your flute as you did that first time when I learned who made the music that I thought must be the Voices that time I climbed up to see They sat under the great cedars on a bank of moss and David took the flute from her hand smiling as he thought of that moment when he had stood among the blossoming laurel and watched her as she moved about his cabin the day before his hurt and how she had kissed it I used to sit here like this She bent forward and rested her head on his knee She had a way of putting her two hands together as a child is taught to hold them in prayer and placing them beneath her cheek and so she waited while David paused his hand on her hair and his eyes fixed on the sea of hilltops where they melted into the sky a mysterious undulating line of the faintest blue seen through the arching branches above and the swaying hemlocks on either side and over the tops of a hundred varieties of pines and deciduous trees beneath them all down the long slope up which they had climbed Thus they waited until she lifted her head and looked into his eyes questioningly He bent forward and kissed her lips and then lifted the flute to his own but again paused What are you thinking now David she asked So you really thought it was the Voices What was their message Cassandra I couldn t make it out then but I thought of this place and of father and it was all at once like as if he would make me know something and I prayed God would he lead me to understand was it a message or not So that was the way I kept on following until I You came to me dear Yes And what did you think the interpretation was then Yes it was you you David It was love and hope and gladness everything everything Go on Everything good and beautiful but sometimes it comes again What comes Play David play I ll tell you another time in another place not here No no So he played for her until the dusk deepened around and below them and they had to make their way back stumblingly When they came to the wild untrodden bank of the little river David resigned the choosing of their path entirely to her and followed close holding her hand where she led When at last they reached their cabin they did not light candles but sat long in the doorway conversing on the deep things of their souls It still seemed to David as if she held something back from him and now he begged her for a more perfect self revealing It is no longer as if we were separate dearest can t you remember and feel that we are one In a way I do It is very sweet You say in a way In what way Why David I want your point of view I see We re not really one until we see from each other s hilltop are we No and you never take me into the secret places of your heart and let me look off from your own hilltop Didn t I this very evening David We stood on the same spot of earth and looked off on the same distance yet in my soul I know I did not see what you saw Pictures come to me very suddenly and just float by hardly understood by myself I didn t want you to see all I saw David I don t know how comes it but all the time even in the midst of our great gladness right when it is most beautiful far before me right across our way is a place that is dim It seems most like the shadows that fall on the hills when those great piles of clouds pass through the sky when it is deep blue all around them and the sun shines everywhere else Your soul is still an undiscovered country to me Cassandra I should think you d like that Don t men love to go discovering And if you could get into the secret chambers as you call them you wouldn t find much Then you d be sorry Cassandra what are you covering and holding back I don t know David It s like it was when I couldn t understand the message of the Voices When it comes clear and strong I ll tell you Then there is something Yes With a little sigh she rose and entered the cabin He sat in silence as she had left him but soon she returned Standing behind him in the darkness she put her interlaced fingers under his chin and drew his face backward until she could see it white in the dusk beneath her eyes You have come back to explain If I can David It s hard for me to put in words what is so dim what I see It s all just love for you David The love burns and blazes up in me like the fire when it s fiercest on the hearth when the day is cold outside You ve seen it so In the little books my father used to read there was a tale of a woman who had my name She foretold the sorrows to come Perhaps she saw as I see things in the dim pictures only more clearly and wisdom was given her to interpret them Often and often I ve felt that in me that strange seeing and knowing before and I don t like it Only once it made me feel glad when it led me to you and Frale that terrible moment But it wasn t a picture that time it was a feeling that pulled me and made me go I would have gone that time if I had died for it He took her two hands and covered them with kisses there in the darkness I told you you were my priestess of all that is good But I don t want to be always seeing the shadows and foreboding I want to be all happy happy the way you are I believe you are one of the blessed ones of God who have the gift but you are right to feel as you do Your life will be more normal and wholesome not to try to probe into the future I ll not attempt to take my coarser humanity into your holy places dear He led her into their canvas sleeping chamber and there she was soon calmly slumbering at his side but he lay long pondering and trying to see his way out of a certain dilemma of unrest that had been creeping into his veins and prodding him forward ever since his reestablished health had become an assured fact He recognized it as no more than the proper impulse of his manhood not to stagnate and slumber in a lotus dream even as delicious a dream as this Ah it was inevitable His world must become her world Herein lay the dilemma This unsullied beautiful being must enter that sordid old world that had so pressed upon him and broken him down This idyl might go on for perhaps a year longer but not for always not for always He slept at last and dreamed that they were being driven along a dark cold river wide and swift that they had entered it where it was only a narrow rushing stream sparkling and tumbling over rocks and winding in intricate turnings on itself that they had laughed as they followed it plashing among the stones where she led him by the hand until it grew wider and deeper and colder and they were lifted from their feet and were tossed and swirled about and she cried and clung to him and even as he clasped her and held her he knew her to be slipping from him Then in terror he awoke and reaching out in the darkness drew her into his embrace and slept again CHAPTER XXII IN WHICH DAVID TAKES LITTLE HOYLE TO CANADA David said his wife next day as he came whistling up to his cabin from the farm below do you mind if I give mother a little help with the weaving Mattie can t do it She s right nigh spoiled the counterpane we had on when she came and since mother s hurt she can t work the treadles so now the hotel s open Miss Mayhew may come and find them not half done Do I mind Why should I mind if you don t right nigh spoil your back and wear yourself out Then I ll go down with you after dinner and see can I patch up Mattie s mistakes It takes so much patience a loom does to understand it Mattie was the cousin David had imported from the low country to relieve Cassandra from the burden of the work in the home below Although a disappointment to them she still did her work after her own fashion clumsily and slowly but her Aunt Marthy was never at rest prodding the dull nature forward trying to make her take the interest Cassandra had done David had wisely persuaded his wife to leave them to themselves to work out the problem of adjustment to the new conditions as best they might and his persuasions had been of a more peremptory nature than he realized To Cassandra they had been as commands but now when the weaving on which the widow had counted so much was likely to be ruined by Mattie s unskilled hands the old mother had declared she could not bear to see her niece around and should pack her off whar she come from Therefore Cassandra had made her timid request the first evidence of shrinking from her husband she had ever given Why was it he asked himself What had he ever said or done to make her prefer a request in that way But it was over in an instant and her own poised manner returned as they ate and chatted together Little Hoyle came running up to eat with them He had conceived a dislike to the home below since the incumbent had come to take his sister s place and evaded thus as often as possible his mother s vigilance David did not mind the intrusion but suffered the adoring little chap to sit at his side ever twisting his small body about to fix his great eyes on David s face while he plied him with questions and hung on his words too intent to attend to his own eating unless admonished thereto by his sister If you don t eat son I ll send you back to mother she threatened I won t go he rebelled joyously I ll jes set here longside brothah David No you won t young man You ll do whatever sister says That s what I do He put his hand on the boy s tousled head and turned him about to his plate well filled with food still untouched but he noticed that the child ate listlessly more as an act of obedience than from a normal desire He glanced up at his wife and saw that she also noticed Hoyle s languor They finished the meal in a silence only broken by Hoyle s questions and David s replies now serious now teasing and bantering You are so full of interrogation points you have no room for your dinner Here drink this milk slowly don t gulp it I know what they be They go this a way The boy set down his glass to illustrate with his slender little hand the form of the question mark Then he laughed out gayly You know hu come I got filled up with them things I done swallered that thar catechism Cass b en teachin me Sundays No I m thinking you just are one yourself Cause I m crooked like this a way He twisted about and looked up at David gravely No no son Doctor didn t mean that said his sister Finish your milk said David We ll have some fun with the microscope And once again the child essayed to eat and drink a little But the languor and pallor grew in spite of all David could do for him and as the weeks passed his large eyes burned more brilliantly and his thin form grew more meagre Cassandra got in the way of keeping him up at the cabin with her and when she went down to weave he went also and used to lie on the bundles of cotton poring over the books which David procured for him from time to time What he gets in that way won t hurt him It s not like having set tasks to learn and he s not burdened with any ought or ought not about it Let him vegetate until cooler weather Then if he doesn t improve we ll see what can be done Something radical I imagine The fall arrived in a splendor that was truly oriental in its gorgeousness The changing colors of the foliage surpassed in brilliancy anything David had ever seen or imagined possible The mantle of deepest green which had clothed the mountain sides all summer became transmuted until all the world was glorified and glowing as if the heat of the summer sun had been stored up during the drowsy days to burst forth thus in warmest reds and golds The hills look as if they had clothed themselves in Turkish rugs ancient and fine said David one evening as he sat on his rock watching them burn in the afterglow of the setting sun How much there is for me to learn and know Cassandra replied in a low voice I never saw a Turkish rug You often speak of things I know nothing about David laughed and turned upon her happy eyes Why so sad for that Did you think I loved you and married you for your worldly knowledge She smiled back at him and was silent Presently he continued Now while Hoyle is not here I wish to talk to you a little about him Yes David Her heart fluttered with a nameless fear but she betrayed no sign of emotion You ve seen of course It s not necessary to tell you No David only does it mean death She put her hand out to him and he took it in his and stroked it Not surely We ll make a fight for him won t we dear Oh David What can we do she moaned There s a thing to do that I ve been reserving as a last resort I think the time has come to try it This curvature presses on some vital part and the action of his heart is uncertain He needs the tonic of the cold the ice and snow Would you trust him to me dear I ll take him to Doctor Hoyle You know very well everything kindness and skill can do will be done for him there Yes yes David You are so good to him always Would would you go alone with him She drew closer to him her head on his shoulder and her hand in his but he could not see her face You mean without you dearest Yes That may be as you say Would you prefer to go with us She drew a long breath slowly like an indrawn sigh and something trembled to pass her heart but suddenly the old habit of reserve sealed her lips and she remained silent What do you say he urged Tell me first do you want me to go He was silent and they sat waiting for each other Then he said I do want you to go and yet I don t want you to go yet Sometime of course we must go where I may find wider scope for my activities He felt her quiver of anxiety Not until you are quite ready yourself dear always remember that Still she was silent and he continued I can t say that I m quite ready myself I would prefer one more year here but Hoyle must be removed without delay We may have waited too long as it is Will your mother consent She must if she cares to see him live Oh David Go go Take him and go to morrow Leave me here and go but come back to me David soon very soon I I shall need you I Can you leave Hoyle there and come back David Or must you bide there too Suddenly she bowed her face in her hands Oh I m so wicked and selfish to think of leaving him there without you or me or mother one David what can we do He might die there and you you must come back for the winter what would save him might kill you Oh David Take me with you and leave me there with him and you come back Doctor Hoyle will take care of him of us once we are there Now now now hold your dear heart in peace Why I m well To stay another winter would only be to establish myself in a more rugged condition of body not that I must do so We ll talk with your mother to morrow It may be hard to persuade her But he found the mother most reasonable and practical He even tried to abate her perfect trust in him and his ability to bring the child back to her quite well and strong This isn t a trouble that is ever really cured you know When taken young enough it may be helped and I ve known people who have lived long and useful lives in spite of it That s all we may hope for Waal I low ye can t git him no younger n he be now an he s that peart I reckon he s worth hit leastways to we uns Of course he s worth it You are right good to keer fer him like you have I d do a heap fer you ef I could All I have is jest this here farm an hit s fer you an Cass On y ef ye d low me an leetle Hoyle to bide on here whilst we live David was touched Do you realize I ve found here the two greatest things in the world love and health All I want is for you to know and remember that if I can t succeed in doing all I would like for the boy at least I tried my very best I may not succeed you know but this is the only thing to do now the only thing David parted from his young wife leaving her standing in the door of their cabin clad in her white homespun frock smiling yet tearful and pale He was to walk down to the Fall Place where Jerry Carew waited with the wagon in which he had arrived and where his baggage had been brought the day before When he came to the steepest part of the descent he looked back and saw Cassandra still standing as if in a trance gazing after him He felt his heart lean towards her and turning sharply walked swiftly to her and took her once more in his arms and looked down into those deep springs her sweet gray eyes Thus for a long moment he held her to his heart with never a word Then she entered the little home and he walked away looking back no more CHAPTER XXIII IN WHICH DOCTOR HOYLE SPEAKS HIS MIND Doctor Hoyle sat in his office staring straight before him not as if he were looking at David Thryng who sat in range of his vision 
5296-26679-0001	train-other-500	but as if seeing beyond him into some other time and place David had been speaking but now they both were silent and the young man wondered if his old friend had really been paying attention to his words or not
none	none	 Well Doctor he said at last 
5296-26679-0002	train-other-500	Well David You don t seem satisfied Is it with my condition Your condition No no no It s not your condition Yes yes fine fine I never saw such a marvellous change in my life never
5296-26679-0003	train-other-500	David smiled over the old doctor s stammer of enthusiasm It was as if his thoughts fertile and vehement and the feelings of his great warm heart welled up within him and trying to burst forth all at once tumbled over themselves
none	none	 unable to secure words rapidly enough in which to give themselves utterance Then why so silent and dubious Why why 
5296-26679-0004	train-other-500	y young man I wasn t thinking anything about you just then And again David laughed
none	none	 while his wiry old friend jumped up 
5296-26679-0005	train-other-500	and walked rapidly and restlessly about the small apartment and laughed in sympathy It s not not I know David grew instantly sober again Of course the little chap s case is serious
5296-26679-0006	train-other-500	very or I would not have brought him to you Oh no no I m not thinking of Adam bless you no The doctor always called his little namesake Adam I m thinking of her the little girl you left behind you
5296-26679-0007	train-other-500	Yes yes Of her She s not so little now Doctor she s tall tall enough to be beautiful I remember her slight slight little creature
5296-26679-0008	train-other-500	all eyes and hair all soul and mind
none	none	 Now what are you going to do with her eh 
5296-26679-0009	train-other-500	What is she going to do with me rather I ll go back to her as soon as I dare leave the boy
none	none	 But man alive what what are you can t live down there all your days 
5296-26679-0010	train-other-500	It s to be life and work for you sir and what are you going to do with her I say I ll bring her here with me She ll come Of course you ll bring her here with you and you you ll have plenty of friends
5296-26679-0011	train-other-500	Maybe they ll appreciate her and maybe they won t maybe they won t I say Understand
none	none	 And she ll c come 
5296-26679-0012	train-other-500	Oh yes she ll come she ll do whatever you say and presently she ll break her heart and die for you She ll never say a word but that s what she ll do Why Doctor cried David appalled I love her as my own life my very soul Of
5296-26679-0013	train-other-500	of course That goes without saying We all do we men but we damn it all Do you suppose I ve lived all these years and not seen Why we think of ourselves first every time
5296-26679-0014	train-other-500	D don t we though Rather But selfish as we are we can love a man can if he sets himself to it honestly love a woman and make her happy even without the appreciation of others in spite of environment
5296-26679-0015	train-other-500	everything It s the destiny of women to love us thank God She would have been doomed surely to die if she had married the one who wanted her first or to live a life for her worse than death Oh Lord bless you boy yes
5296-26679-0016	train-other-500	It s a woman s destiny I m an old fool There there s my own little girl she s m married and gone gone to live in England They will do it the women will Come we ll go see Adam The doctor sprang up
5296-26679-0017	train-other-500	brushed his hand across his eyes and caught up a battered silk hat He turned it about and looked at it ruefully with a quizzical smile playing about the corners of his eyes Remember that hat he asked Well do I remember it
5296-26679-0018	train-other-500	You ve driven many a mile in many a rainstorm by my side under that hat When you re done with it leave it to me in your will I have a fancy for it Will you Here take it take it I m done with it Mary scolds me every day about it
5296-26679-0019	train-other-500	No p peace in life because of it Here s a new one I bought the other day good one good enough He lifted a box which had fallen from his cluttered office table and took from it a new hat
5296-26679-0020	train-other-500	which had evidently not been unpacked before He tried it on his head turned it about and about took it off and gazed at it within and without then hastily tossed it aside and snatching his old one from David put it on his head and they started off
5296-26679-0021	train-other-500	Hoyle had been placed in a small ward where were only two other little beds both occupied with one nurse to attend on the three patients One of them had broken his leg and had to lie in a cast and the other
none	none	 was convalescing from fever 
5296-26679-0022	train-other-500	but both were well enough to be companionable with the lonely little Southerner Hoyle s face beamed upon David as he bent over him I kin make pi chers whilst I m a lyin here
none	none	 he cried ecstatically That thar lady she lows me to make em She lows mine re good uns 
5296-26679-0023	train-other-500	David glanced at the young woman indicated She was pleasant faced and rosy and looked practical and good He s such an odd little chap she said What be that odd Does hit mean this er lump on my back
5296-26679-0024	train-other-500	He pulled David down and whispered the question in his ear No no She only means that you re a dear queer little chap

5296-26679-0027	train-other-500	from their beds laughed out merrily and strained their necks to see These re theirn I made this n fer him an this n fer him He tossed the pictures feebly toward them and they fluttered to the floor
5296-26679-0028	train-other-500	David gathered them up and gave them to their respective owners The old doctor stood beside the cot and looked down on the little artist His lips twitched and his eyes twinkled
none	none	 Which one is y yours he asked I keep this n with the sea 
5296-26679-0029	train-other-500	an here I made this n fer you He paused and selected carefully among the pile of papers under his hand
none	none	 You reckon you kin tell what tis 
5296-26679-0030	train-other-500	The doctor took the paper and regarded it gravely a moment then lifted his eyebrows and made grimaces of wonderment until the three patients in the three little beds were in gales of laughter At last he said
5296-26679-0031	train-other-500	It s a pile of s sausages Hit hain t no sausages Hit s jest a straight

5296-26679-0033	train-other-500	The doctor turned the paper over and regarded it a moment Show me the window I I see no window on the other side Again the three little invalids laughed uproariously at their visitor
5296-26679-0034	train-other-500	David smilingly looked on How often had he seen the delightful old man amuse himself thus with the children He would contort his mobile face into all the varying expressions of wonder and dismay
5296-26679-0035	train-other-500	of terror or stupefaction and his entrance to the children s ward was always greeted with outcries of delight when the little ones were well enough to allow of such freedom Haven t you one to send to your sister
5296-26679-0036	train-other-500	asked David stooping low to the child and speaking quietly The boy s face lighted with a radiant smile that caused the old man to stand regarding him more intently We ll sen her this n of the sea You reckon hit looks like the ocean
none	none	 whar the ships go a sailin to t othah side o the world

5296-26679-0046	train-other-500	and real blue for the sky and the sea The child s eyes glowed He pulled David down and held him with his arm about his neck and whispered in his ear and what he said was

5296-26679-0050	train-other-500	That s what we re trying for my brave little brother
none	none	 and the two physicians bade the small patients good by and walked out upon the street CHAPTER XXIV IN WHICH DAVID THRYNG HAS NEWS FROM ENGLAND As they passed down the street 
5296-26680-0000	train-other-500	David shivered and buttoned his light overcoat closer about him Cold said the older man
none	none	 Your air is a bit keen here already 
5296-26680-0001	train-other-500	I hope it will be the needed tonic for that little chap What were his s secrets David told him He s imaginative yes yes I really would rather hurt myself He may come on he may
5296-26680-0002	train-other-500	I ve known I ve known curious but Why Hello
none	none	 hello Why where and Doctor Hoyle suddenly darted forward 
5296-26680-0003	train-other-500	and shook hands with another old gentleman
none	none	 who was alertly stepping toward them also thin and wiry 
5296-26680-0004	train-other-500	but with a face as impassive as the doctor s was mobile and expressive mister Stretton why why David mister Stretton David Thryng Ah mister Thryng I am most happy to find you here Doctor Thryng
5296-26680-0005	train-other-500	over here on this side you know Ah yes I had really forgotten But speaking of titles I must give this young man his correctly Lord Thryng allow me to congratulate you my lord
5296-26680-0006	train-other-500	I fear you mistake me for my cousin sir said David smiling I hope you have no ill news from my good uncle but I am not the David who inherits I think he is in South Africa
none	none	 or was by the latest home letters 
5296-26680-0007	train-other-500	mister Stretton did not reply directly but continued smiling as his manner was and turned toward David s companion Shall we go to my hotel I have a great deal to talk over business which concerns
5296-26680-0008	train-other-500	ahem ahem your lordship on behalf of your mother having come expressly he turned again to David Ah now don t be at all alarmed I beg of you I see I have disturbed you She is quite well or was a week or more ago
5296-26680-0009	train-other-500	Doctor Hoyle you ll accompany us At my request Undoubtedly you are interested in your young friend Mechanically David walked with the two older men filled with a strange sinking of the heart and at the same time with a vague elation
5296-26680-0010	train-other-500	Was he called home by his mother to help her sustain a new calamity Had the impossible happened mister Stretton s manner continued to be mysteriously deferential toward him and something in his air reminded David of England
none	none	 and the atmosphere of his uncle s stately home 
5296-26680-0011	train-other-500	Had he ever seen the man before He really did not know They reached the hotel shortly and were conducted to mister Stretton s private apartment where wine was ordered and promptly served For years thereafter
5296-26680-0012	train-other-500	David never heard the clinking of glasses and bottles borne on a tray without an instant s sickening sinking of the heart and the foreboding that seemed to drench him with dismay as the glasses were placed on the stand at mister Stretton s elbow
5296-26680-0013	train-other-500	When that gentleman after seeing the waiter disappear and placing certain papers before him began speaking David sat dazedly listening What was it all what was it The glasses seemed to quiver and shake
5296-26680-0014	train-other-500	throwing dancing flecks of light and the wine in them why did it make him think of blood Were they dead then all three his two cousins and his brother dead Shot
5296-26680-0015	train-other-500	Killed in a bloody and useless war He was confounded and bowing his head in his hands sat thus his elbows on his knees waiting hearing but not comprehending
5296-26680-0016	train-other-500	He could think only of his mother He saw her face aged and grief stricken He knew how she loved the boy she had lost above all and now she must turn to himself
5296-26680-0017	train-other-500	He sat thus while the lawyer read a lengthy document and at the end personally addressed him Then he lifted his head What is this My uncle My uncle gone too
5296-26680-0018	train-other-500	Do you mean dead My uncle dead and I I his heir The lawyer replied formally You are now the head of a most ancient and honorable house
none	none	 You will have the dignity of the old name to maintain and are called upon to return to your fatherland 
5296-26680-0019	train-other-500	and occupy the home of your ancestors He took up one of the papers and adjusted his monocle For a time David did not speak At last he rose and with head erect extended his hand to the lawyer
5296-26680-0020	train-other-500	I thank you sir for your trouble but now Doctor shall we return to your house I must take a little time to adjust my mind to these terrible events
none	none	 It is like being overtaken with an avalanche at the moment when all is most smiling and perfect 
5296-26680-0021	train-other-500	The lawyer began a few congratulatory remarks but David stopped him with uplifted hand It is calamitous It is too terrible he said sadly And what it brings may be far more of a burden than a joy
5296-26680-0022	train-other-500	But the name my lord the ancient and honorable lineage That last was already mine and for the title I have never coveted it
none	none	 far less all that it entails 
5296-26680-0023	train-other-500	I must think it over But my lord it is yours You can t help yourself you know a the the position is yours and you will a fill it with dignity and a
5296-26680-0024	train-other-500	let me hope will follow the conservative policy of your honored uncle And I say I must think it over May I not have a day a single day in which to mourn the loss of my splendid brother
5296-26680-0025	train-other-500	Would God he had lived to fill this place he said desperately The lawyer bowed deferentially and Doctor Hoyle took David s arm and led him away as if he were his son Not a word was spoken by either of them
5296-26680-0026	train-other-500	until they were again in the doctor s office There lay the new silk hat as he had tossed it one side He took it up and turned it about in his hand You see David an old hat is like an old friend
5296-26680-0027	train-other-500	and it takes some time to get wonted to a new one He gravely laid the old one within easy reach of his arm and restored the new one to its box Then he sat himself near David and placed his hand kindly on his knee
5296-26680-0028	train-other-500	You you have your work laid out for you my young friend It s the way in Old England The stability of our society
none	none	 our national life demands it 
5296-26680-0029	train-other-500	I know You must go to your mother Yes I must go to her Of course of course and without delay Well I ll take care of the little chap I know you will
5296-26680-0030	train-other-500	better than I could David lifted his eyes to his old friend s then turned them away I feel him to be a sacred trust Again he paused It would take a
5296-26680-0031	train-other-500	long time to go to her first To her For the instant the old man had forgotten Cassandra Not so David My wife It will be desperately hard
5296-26680-0032	train-other-500	for her Yes yes But your uncle you know died of grief and your m mother I know so the lawyer said Now at last we ll read mother s letter
5296-26680-0033	train-other-500	He wondered I suppose that I didn t look at it when he gave it to me but I felt conscience stricken I ve been so filled with my life down there the peace
none	none	 the blessed peace and happiness 
5296-26680-0034	train-other-500	that I have neglected her my own mother I couldn t open and read it with that man s eyes on me No no Stay here I beg of you stay You are different I want you
5296-26680-0035	train-other-500	He opened his mother s letter and slowly read it then passed it to his friend and rising walked to the window and stood gazing down into the square
none	none	 Autumn leaves were being tossed and swirled in dancing flights 
5296-26680-0036	train-other-500	like flocks of brown and yellow birds along the street The sky was overcast with thin hurrying clouds and the feeling of autumn was in the air but David s eyes were blurred and he saw nothing before him
5296-26680-0037	train-other-500	The doctor s voice broke the silence with sudden impulse In this she speaks as if she knew nothing about your marriage I told you I had neglected her cried David contritely
none	none	 But m man alive why why in the name of all the gods All England is filled with fools 
5296-26680-0038	train-other-500	cried the younger man desperately I could never in the world make them understand me or my motives I gave it up long ago I ve not told my mother to save her from a needless sorrow that would be inflicted on her by her friends
5296-26680-0039	train-other-500	They would all flock to her and pester her with their outcry of How very extraordinary I can hear them and see them now I tell you if a man steps out of the beaten track over there if he attempts to order his own life marry to please himself
5296-26680-0040	train-other-500	or cut his coat after any pattern other than the ordinary conventional lines even the boys on the street will fling stones at him Her patronizing friends would at the very least politely raise their eyebrows She is proud and sensitive
5296-26680-0041	train-other-500	and any fling at her sons is a blow to her But what I say I couldn t tell her I tell you I have been drinking from the cup of happiness I have drained it to the last drop My wife is mine
5296-26680-0042	train-other-500	She does not belong to those people over there to be talked over and dined over and all her beauty and fineness overlooked through their monocles brutes My mountain flower in her homespun dress
none	none	 only poets could understand and appreciate her B but 
5296-26680-0043	train-other-500	what were you going to do about it Do about it I meant to keep her to myself until the right time came Perhaps in another year bring her here and begin life in a modest way and let my mother visit us and see for herself
5296-26680-0044	train-other-500	I was planning it out slowly but this You see Doctor their ideas are all warped over there They accept all that custom decrees and have but the one point of view
5296-26680-0045	train-other-500	The true values of life are lost sight of They have no hilltops like Cassandra s Only the poets have A quizzical smile played about the old man s mouth
5296-26680-0046	train-other-500	He came and laid his arm across David s shoulders and the act softened the slight sting of his words And you call yourself a poet Not that said the young man humbly
5296-26680-0047	train-other-500	but I have been learning I would have scorned to be called a poet until I learned of this girl and her father I thought I had ideals
none	none	 and felt my superiority in consequence 
5296-26680-0048	train-other-500	until I came down to the beginnings of things with them Her her father Why he s dead he
none	none	 And yet through her 
5296-26680-0049	train-other-500	I have learned of him I believe he was a man who walked with God and at Cassandra s side I have trod in his secret places That s right I m satisfied now about her You re all right but
5296-26680-0050	train-other-500	but your mother David turned and walked to the table and sat with his head bowed on his arms Had he been alone he would have wept As it was he spoke brokenly of his old home
5296-26680-0051	train-other-500	and the responsibilities now so ruthlessly thrust upon him Of his mother s grief and his own
none	none	 and of this inheritance that he had never dreamed would be his 
5296-26680-0052	train-other-500	and therefore had never desired now given him by so cruel a blow He would not shrink from whatever duty
none	none	 or obligation might rest upon him but how could he adjust his changed circumstances to the conditions he had made for himself by his sudden marriage 
5296-26680-0053	train-other-500	At last it was decided that he should sail for England without delay taking the passage already provisionally engaged for him by mister Stretton I can write to Cassandra She will understand more easily than my mother
5296-26680-0054	train-other-500	She sees into the heart of things Her thoughts go to the truth like arrows of light She will see that I must go but she must never know I must save her from it if I have to do so at the expense of my own soul
5296-26680-0055	train-other-500	that the reason I cannot take her with me now is that our great friends over there are too small to understand her nature and might despise her I must go to my mother first and feel my way see what can be done
5296-26680-0056	train-other-500	Neither of them must be made to suffer That s right perfectly but don t wait too long Just have it out with your mother all of them
none	none	 the sooner the simpler the sooner the simpler CHAPTER XXV IN WHICH DAVID THRYNG VISITS HIS MOTHER How wise was the advice of the old doctor to make short work of the confession to his mother and to face the matter of his marriage bravely with his august friends and connections David little knew If his marriage had been rash in its haste nothing in the future should be done rashly Possibly he might be obliged to return to America before he made a full revelation that a wife awaited him in that far and but dimly appreciated land In his mind the matter resolved itself into a question of time and careful adjustment Slowly as the boat ploughed through the never resting waters slowly as the western land with its dreams and realities drifted farther into the vapors that blended the line of the land and the sea so slowly the future unveiled itself and drew him on into its new dreams revealing with the inevitable progression of the hours a life heretofore shrouded and only vaguely imagined as a glowing reality filled with opportunity and power He felt his whole nature expand and become imbued with intoxicating ambitions as if hereafter he would be swept onward to ride through life triumphant even as the boat was riding the sea surmounting its mysterious depths and taking its unerring way in spite of buffeting of winds and beating of waves Still young with renewed vitality his hopes turned to the future recognizing the tremendous scope for his energies which his own particular prospects presented Often he stood alone in the prow among the coils of rope and watched the distance unroll before him while the salt breeze played with his clustering hair and filled his lungs He loved the long sweep of the prow as it divided the water and cast it foaming on either side in opaline and turquoise tints shifting and falling into the indigo depths of the vastness around In thought he spanned the wide spaces and leaped still toward the future before him the gray haired mother who trembled to hold him once more in her arms behind him the young wife waiting his return enclosing him serenely and adoringly in her heart Each day while on shipboard David wrote to Cassandra voluminously He found it a pleasant way of passing the hours He described his surroundings and unfolded such of his anticipations as he felt she could best understand and with which she could sympathize trying to explain to her what the years to come might hold for them both and telling her always to wait with patience for his return This could not be known definitely until he had looked into the state of his uncle s affairs which would hereafter be his own Sometimes his letter contained only a review of some of the happiest hours they had spent together as if he were placing his thoughts of those blessed days on paper that they might be for their mutual communing Sometimes he discoursed of the calamity he had suffered the uselessness of his brother s death and the cruelty and wastefulness of war At such times he was minded to write her of the opportunity now given him to serve his country and the power he might some day attain to promote peace and avert rash legislation Never once did he allow an inadvertent word to slip from his pen whereby she could suspect that she as his wife might be a cause of embarrassment to him or a clog in the wheel of the chariot which from now on was to bear him triumphantly among his social friends or political enemies Never would he disturb the sweet serenity that encompassed her Yet well he knew what an incongruity she would appear should he present her now as she had stood by her loom or in the ploughed field at his side to the company he would find in his mother s home Simple and direct as she was she would walk over their conventions and proprieties and never know it How strange many of those customs of theirs would appear to her and how unnecessary He feared for her most in her utter ignorance of everything pertaining to the daily existence of the over civilized circle to which the changed conditions of his life would bring her Much he knew would pass unseen by her but soon she would begin to understand and to wince under their exclamations of How extraordinary The masklike expression would steal over her face her pride would encase her spirit in the deep reserve he himself had found so hard to penetrate and he could see her withdrawing more and more from all until at last Ah it must not be He must manage very carefully lest Doctor Hoyle s prophecy indeed be fulfilled At last the lifting of the veil to the eastward revealed the bold promontory of Land s End and soon beyond the fair green slopes of his own beautiful Old England For all of the captious criticism he had fallen in the way of bestowing upon her how he loved her He felt as if he must throw up his arms and shout for joy Suddenly she had become his with a sense of possession new to him and sweet to feel The orderliness and stereotyped lines of her social system against which he had rebelled and the iron bars of her customs which his soul had abhorred in the past against which his spirit had bruised and beaten itself now lured him on as a security for things stable and fine In subtile ways as yet unrealized he was being drawn back into the cage from which he had fled for freedom and life How quickly he had become accustomed to the air of deference in mister Stretton s continual use of his newly acquired title my lord Why not It was his right The same laws which had held him subservient before now gave him this and he who a few months earlier had been proudly ploughing his first furrows in his little leased farm on a mountain meadow now walked with lifted head to the manor born along the platform and entered the first class compartment with mister Stretton where a few rich Americans had already installed themselves David noticed with inward amusement their surreptitious glances when the lawyer addressed him how they plumed themselves yet tried to appear nonchalant and indifferent to the fact that they were riding in the same compartment with a lord In time he would cease to notice even such incongruities as this tacit homage from a professedly title scorning people David s mother had moved into the town house whither his uncle had sent for her when stricken with grief he had lain down for his last brief illness The old servants had all been retained and David was ushered to his mother s own sitting room by the same household dignitary who was wont to preside there when as a lad he had been allowed rare visits to his cousins in the city How well he remembered his fine punctilious old uncle and the feeling of awe tempered by anticipation with which he used to enter those halls He was overwhelmed with a sense of loss and disaster as he glanced up the great stairway where his cousins were wont to come bounding down to him handsome hearty romping lads It had been a man s household for his aunt had been dead many years a man s household characterized by a man s sense of heavy order without the many touches of feminine occupation and arrangement which tend to soften a man s half military reign As he was being led through the halls he noticed a subtile change which warmed his quick senses Was it the presence of his mother and Laura His entrance interrupted an animated conversation which was being held between the two as the manservant announced his name and in another instant his mother was in his arms Dear little mother Dear little mother But she was not small She was tall and dignified and David had to stoop but little to bring his eyes level with hers David I m here too A hand was laid on his arm and he released his mother to turn and look into two warm brown eyes And so the little sister is grown up he said embracing her then holding her off at arm s length Five years When I look at you mother they don t seem so long but Laura here You didn t expect me to stay a little girl all my life did you David No no He took her by the shoulder and shook her a little and pinched her cheeks What roses Why sis I say you know I m proud of you What have you been up to anyway He flung himself on the sofa and pulled her down beside him Give an account of yourself I ve gone in for athletics Right And Oh lots of things You give an account of yourself David glanced at his mother She was seated opposite them regarding him with brimming eyes No he could not give an account of himself yet He would wait until he and his mother were alone He lifted Laura s heavy hair which confined only by a great bow of black ribbon hung streaming down her back in a dark mass that gave her a tousled unkempt look and which taken together with her dead black dress and her dark tanned skin roughened by exposure to wind and sun greatly marred her beauty in spite of her roses and the warmth of her large dark eyes As David surveyed his sister he thought of Cassandra and was minded then and there to describe her to attempt to unveil the events of the past year and make them see and know as far as possible what his life had been He held this thought a moment poised ready for utterance a moment of hesitation as to how to begin and then forever lost as his mother began speaking Laura hasn t come out yet As events have turned it is just as well for her chances naturally will be much better now than they would have been if we had had her coming out last year I don t see how mamma with all this heavy black I can t come out until I leave it off and it will be so long to wait Laura pouted a little discontentedly then flushed a disfiguring flush of shame under her dark skin as she caught the look in her brother s eyes Not but what I shall keep on mourning for Bob as long as I live he was such a dear she added her eyes filling with quick impulsive tears But how you make out my chances will be better now mamma I can t see really I look such a fright Chances for what asked David dryly For matrimony naturally his sister flung out defiantly half smiling through her tears Don t you know that s all a girl of my age lives for matrimony and a kennel I mean to have one now we will have our own preserves It will be ripping you know Certainly our own preserves said David still dryly thinking how Cassandra would wonder what preserves were and what she would say if told that in preserves wild harmless animals were kept from being killed by the common people for food in order that those of his own class might chase them down and kill them for their amusement Oh David I remember how you used to be always putting on a look like that and thinking a lot of nasty things under your breath I hoped you would come home vastly improved Was it what I said about matrimony Mamma knows it s true Hardly as you put it my child there is much besides for a girl to think about You said chances yourself mamma Certainly but that is for me to consider You must remember that it was you who refused to have your coming out last year I didn t want my good times cut short then mamma and have to take up proprieties or at least I would have had to be dreadfully proper for a while anyway and now why I have to be naturally and here I am unable to come out for another year yet and my hair streaming down my back all the time I m sure I can t see how my chances are in the least improved by it all and by that time I shall be so old Oh you will be quite young enough said David You occupy a far different position now child To make your debut as Lady Laura will give you quite another place in the world Your headstrong postponement fortunately will do no harm It will make your introduction to the circle where you are eventually to move much simpler Laura lifted her eyebrows and glanced from her mother to her brother Very well mamma but one thing you might as well know now I shan t drop some of my friends if being Lady Laura lifts me above them as high as the moon I like them and I don t care She whistled and a beautiful silken haired setter crept from under the sofa whereon she had been sitting and wriggled about after the manner of guilty dogs Laura dear Yes mamma I ve been hiding him with my skirts by sitting there He was bad and followed me in We ve been out riding together She stroked his silken coat with her riding crop Mamma won t allow him in here and he jolly well knows it Bad Zip bad sir Look at him Isn t he clever I must go and dress for dinner Mamma wants you to herself I know and mister Stretton will be here soon You can t think David how glad I am we have you back You couldn t think it from my way but I am rather It s been awful here simply awful since the boys all left Again her eyes filled with quick tears and she dashed out with the dog bounding about her and leaping up to thrust his great tongue in her face You are too big for the house Zip Down sir In an instant she was back putting her tousled head in at the door David when mamma is finished with you come out and see my dogs I have five already and Nancy is going to litter soon Calkins is to take them into the country to morrow for they are just cooped up here She withdrew and David heard her heavy soled shoes clatter down the long halls He and his mother smiled as they listened looking into each other s eyes She is a dear child but life means only a good time to her as yet Well let it She has splendid stuff in her and is bound to make a splendid woman She s right David It has been awful since your brother left David sat beside her and placed his hand on hers Again it was in his mind to tell her of Cassandra and again he was stopped by the tenor of her next remark You see how it is my son Laura can t understand but you will I m not sure that I do Open your heart to me mother tell me what you mean My dear son I don t like to begin with worries It is so sweet to have you back in the home May you always stay with us I don t mind the worries mother he said tenderly I am here to help you What is it It is only that although we have inherited the title and estates we are not there We will be received of course but at first only by those who have axes to grind There are so many such and it is hard to protect one s self from them For instance there is Lady Willisbeck Her own set have cut her completely for certain reasons there is no need to retail unpleasant gossip but she was one of the first to call Her daughter Lady Isabel gave Laura that dog but all the more because Laura and Lady Isabel were in school together and were on the same hockey team they will have that excuse for clinging to us like burs Lady Willisbeck would like very much now for her daughter s sake to win back her place in society although she did not seem to value it for herself Long before her mother s life became common talk because she was infatuated with your cousin Lyon Lady Isabel chose Laura for her chum and the two have worked up a very romantic situation out of the affair You see I have cause for anxiety David He still held her hand looking kindly in her face Is Lady Isabel the right sort he asked What do you mean by the right sort David She isn t like her mother naturally or I would have been more decided but she is not the right sort for us Lady Willisbeck is ostracized and it is a grave matter Her daughter will be ostracized with her unless she can find a chaperon of quality to champion her to to well you understand that Laura can t afford to make her debut handicapped with such a friendship Not now I fail to see until I know more of her friend But David we can t be visionary now We must be practical and face the difficulties of our situation We are honorably entitled to all that the inheritance implies but it is another thing to avail ourselves of it Your uncle led a most secluded life He had no visitors and was known only among men and politically as a close conservative His seat in the House meant only that So now we enter a circle in which we never moved before and we are not of it For the present our deep mourning is prohibitory but it is also Laura s protection although she does not know it His mother paused She was not regarding him She seemed to be looking into the future and a little line which had formed during the years of David s absence deepened in her forehead Be a little more explicit mother Protection from what From undesirable people dear We are very conspicuous to be frank we are new My own family connections are all good but they will not be the slightest help to Laura in maintaining her position We have always lived in the country and know no one You have refinement and good taste mother I know it that and this inheritance and the title Isn t that protection enough I really fail to see Whatever would please you would be right You may have what friendships you Not at all David Everything is iron bound They are simply watching lest we bring a lot of common people in our train Things grow worse and worse in that way There are so many rich tradespeople who are struggling to get in and clinging desperately to the skirts of the poorer nobility Of course it all goes to show what a tremendous thing good birth is and the iron laws of custom are after all a proper safeguard and should be respected Nevertheless we who are so new must not allow ourselves to become stepping stones It is perfectly right That is why I said this period of mourning is Laura s protection She will have time to know what friendships are best and an opportunity to avoid undesirable ones You have been away so long David where the class lines are not so rigidly drawn that you forget or never knew It is my duty without any foolish sentiment to guard Laura and see to it that her coming out is what it should be For one thing she is so very plain If she were a beauty it would help but her plainness must be compensated for in other ways She will have a large settlement mister Stretton thinks if your uncle s interests are not too much jeopardized in South Africa by this terrible war That is something you will have to look into before you take your seat in the House Oh mother mother I can t My dear boy your brother died for his country and can you not give a little of your life for it I can rely on you to be practically inclined now that you are placed at the head of such a family I m glad now you never cared for Muriel Hunt She could never have filled the position as her ladyship your uncle s wife did She was Lady Thomasia Harcourt Glendyne of Wales Beside her Muriel would appear silly It is most fortunate you have no such entanglement now Mother mother I am astounded I never dreamed my dear beautiful mother could descend to such worldliness You are changed mother There is something fundamentally wrong in all this She looked up at him aghast at his vehemence My son my son Let us have only love between us only love I am not changed I was content as I was nor ever tried to enter a sphere above me Now that this comes to me forced on me by right of English law I take it thankfully with all it brings I will fill the place as it should be filled and Laura shall do the same and you also my son As for Muriel Hunt I will make concessions if if your happiness demands it David groaned inwardly No mother no It goes deeper than Muriel it goes deeper They had both risen She placed her hands on his shoulders and looked levelly in his eyes and her own lightened through tears held bravely back It may well go deeper than Muriel and still not go very deep And yet the time was when Muriel Hunt was thought quite deep enough he said sadly still looking in his mother s eyes but she only continued Never doubt for a moment dear that Laura s welfare and yours are dearer to me than life You are very weary I see it in your eyes Have you been to your apartment Clark will show you She kissed his brow and departed CHAPTER XXVI IN WHICH DAVID THRYNG ADJUSTS HIS LIFE TO NEW CONDITIONS David stood where his mother had left him dazed hurt sad He was desperately minded to leave all and flee back to the hills back to the life he had left in Canada He saw the clear true look of Cassandra s eyes meeting his His heart called for her his soul cried out within him He felt like one launched on an irresistible current which was sweeping him ever nearer to a maelstrom wherein he was inevitably to be swallowed up He perceived that to his mother the established order of things there in her little island was sacred an arrangement to be still further upheld and solidified She had suddenly become a part of a great system intrusted with a care for its maintenance and stability as one of its guardians Before it had mattered little to her for she was not of it Now it was very different Slowly David followed Clark to his own apartments He had been given those of the old lord his uncle Everything about him was dark massive and rich but without grace His bags and boxes had been unpacked and his dinner suit laid in readiness and Clark stood stiffly awaiting orders Will you have a shave my lord The man s manner jarred on him It was obsequious and he hated it Yet it was only the custom Clark was simple hearted and kindly filling his little place in the upholding of the system of which he was a part had his manner been different a shade more familiar David would have resented it and ordered him out but of this David was not conscious In spite of his scruples he was born and bred an aristocrat No a I ll shave myself Still the man waited and taking up David s coat flicked a particle of dust from the collar I don t want anything You may go Thank you Clark melted quietly out of the apartment Thanks me for being rude to him thought David irritably I shall take pleasure in being rude to him My God What a farce life is over here The whole thing is a farce He shaved himself and cut his chin and when he appeared later with a patch of court plaster thereon Clark commented to himself on his lordship s inability to do the shaving properly As David thought over his mother s words her outlook on life his sister s idle aims the companionships she must have and the kind of talk to which she must listen he grew more and more annoyed He contrasted it all with the past His mother who had been so noble and fine seemed to have lost individuality to have become only a segment of a circle which it was henceforth to be her highest care to keep intact Laura must become a part of the same sacred ring and he too must join hands with those who formed it and make it his duty to keep others out There were also other circles guarded and protected by this one circles within circles each smaller and more exclusive than the last The object of the huge game of life over here seemed to be to keep the great mass of those whom they regarded as commonalty out of any one of the circles while striving individually each to climb into the one next above and more contracted The most maddening thing of all was to find his grave dignified mother drawn in and made a partaker in this meaningless strife Still essentially an outsider David could look with larger vision the far seeing vision of the western land the hilltops and the dividing sea and to him now the circles seemed verily the concentric rings of the maelstrom into which events were hurrying him Would he be able to rise from the swirling flotsam and ride free The deeper philosophy underlying it all he as yet but vaguely understood that the highest good for all could only be maintained by stability in the commonwealth as the tremendous rock foundations of the earth are a support for the growth thereon of all perfection all grace and beauty that the concentric rings when rightly understood should become a means of purification of reward for true worth of power for noblest service and not for personal ambition and the unmolested gratification of vicious tastes David did not as yet know that his clear seeing wife could help him to the attainment of his greatest possibilities right here where he feared to bring her the wife of whom he dare not tell his mother Blinded by the world s estimates which he still had sense enough to despise he did not know that the key to its deepest secrets lay in her heart nor that of the two her heritage of the large spirit and the inward seeing eye direct to the Creator s meanings was the greater heritage Lady Thryng found it possible to have a few words with the lawyer before David appeared and impressed upon him the necessity of interesting her son in this new field by showing him avenues for power and work I don t quite understand the boy she said After seeing the world and going his own way I really thought he would outgrow that sort of moody sentimentalism but it seems to be returning He is quixotic enough to turn away from everything here and go back to Canada unless you can awaken his interest I see I see said the lawyer Mere personal ambition will not satisfy him added his mother proudly He must see opportunities for service He must understand that he is needed I see I understand He must be dealt with along the line of his nobler impulses ahem ahem and David appeared His mother rose and took his arm to walk out to dinner while Laura who should have gone with mister Stretton did not see his proffered arm but provokingly indifferent strolled out by herself David absorbed in his own thoughts did not notice his sister s careless mien but the mother observed the independent and boyish swing of her daughter s shoulders and resented it with a slightly reproving glance after they were seated Laura lifted her eyebrows and one shoulder with an irritating half shrug What is it mamma she asked but Lady Thryng allowed the question to go unheeded and turned her attention to the two gentlemen during the rest of the meal All through dinner David was haunted by Cassandra s talk with him the night he dreamed she was being swept out of his arms forever by a swift cold current which from a little purling stream high up on a mountain top had become a dark relentless flood overwhelming them utterly What was she doing now Did she know she was in that terrible flood Was she really being swept from him Ah never never He would not allow it if he must break all hearts but hers The meal progressed sombrely and heavily with much ceremony although they were so few Was his mother practising for the future that she kept such rigid state He suspected as much and that Laura was being trained to the right way of carrying herself but that and the real sorrow of the family over their bereavement made a most oppressive atmosphere Might this be the shadow Cassandra had seen lying across their future Only a passing cloud a vapor it must be only that Laura and her mother withdrew early leaving David and the lawyer together when mister Stretton immediately launched into talk of David s prospects and resources In spite of himself the gloom of the dinner hour slipped from him and soon he was taking the liveliest interest in what might be possible for him here and now Although not one to be easily turned from a chosen path by outside influence David yet had that almost fatal gift of the imaginative mind of seeing things from many sides until at times they took on a kaleidoscopic reversibility Now this unlooked for development of his life opened to him a vista new and yet old old as England herself While digging deep into the causes of his former discontent he had come to strike his spade upon the rock foundations whereon all this complicated superstructure of English society and national life was builded He saw that every nobleman inherited with his title and his lands a responsibility for the welfare of the whole people from the poorest laborer in the ditch or the coal mine to the head wearing the crown and that it was the blindness of individuals like himself or his uncle before him their misuse or unscrupulous indifference to and abuse of power which had brought about those conditions under which the masses were writhing and against which they were crying out He saw that it was only by the earnest efforts of the few who did understand the few who were not indifferent that the stability of English government was still her glory At last he rose and lifted his arms high above his head then dropped them to his side I see He held up his head and looked off as he had done when he stood on the prow of the steamship with the salt breeze tossing his hair A little of this came to me as I crossed the ocean when I saw the green slopes of England again I knew I loved her and the old feeling of impotence that hounded me in the past when I could do nothing but rebel slipped from me I felt what it might be to have power to become effective instead of being obliged to chafe under the yoke of an imposed submission to things which are wrong things which those who are in power might set right if they would I believe for a moment mister Stretton I felt it all He paused and bowed his head All at once in the midst of his exaltation he saw Cassandra standing white and still as he had seen her on the hilltop before their little cabin looking after him when he bade her good by and just as he then turned and went swiftly back to her so now in his soul he turned to her yearningly and took her to his breast Still penetrating the sweet white halo of this vision he heard the voice of mister Stretton deferentially droning on And with your resources the wealth which with a little care and thought just now at this crucial moment will be yours Still David stood with bowed head It is as if you were predestined my lord to step in at a critical time of your country s need with brains education conscience and wealth with every obstacle swept away Still before him stood Cassandra white and silent he could see only her Every obstacle swept away repeated the lawyer And Cassandra God help her and me David slowly turned lifted a glass of wine from the table and drank it Well so be it so be it he said aloud We ll join mother and Laura At the door he paused You spoke of education the learning of a physician is but little in the line of statesmanship How soon will I be expected to take my seat If you ask my advice my lord I would say better wait a year It will be advisable for you to go yourself to South Africa and look into your uncle s investments there as a private individual of course not as a public servant Two thirds of the receipts have fallen off since the war learn what may be saved from the wreckage or if there be a wreckage I m inclined to think not all for the investments were varied Your uncle may have been a silent member but he was certainly a man of good business judgment mister Stretton paused and coughed a little apologetically before adding Not an inherited talent only ah cultivated cultivated you know Good business judgment is not a trait inherent in our peerage as a rule David was amused and entered the drawing room with a smile on his face His mother was pleased and rose instantly coming forward with both hands extended to take his He understood it as a welcome back to the family circle the quiet talks and the evening lamp less formal than the oppressive dinner had been He held her hands thus offered and kissed the little anxious line on her brow then playfully smoothed it with his finger We mustn t let it become permanent you know mother No David It will go now you are at home He did not know that his mother and Laura had been having a lively discussion apropos of the silent tilt at the dinner table his sister pleading for a return to the old ways and a release from such state and ceremony At least while we are by ourselves mamma Anyway I know David will just hate it and I don t see what good a title is if we must become perfect slaves to it David crossed the room and sat down before the piano How strange this old place seems without the others Bob and the cousins and uncle himself We weren t admitted often but Sh sh said Laura who had followed him and stood at his ride Don t remind mamma She remembers too much all the time Play the King s Hunting Jig David Remember how you used to play it for me every evening after dinner when I was a girl Do I remember Rather I have done nothing with the piano since then when you were a girl I ll play it for you now while you are a girl But I really am grown up now David It s quite absurd for me to go about like this It s only because mamma chooses to have it so She even keeps a governess for me still To her you are a child and to me you are still a girl and a mighty fine one It s so good to have you back David You haven t forgotten the Jig Where s your flute Get it and I ll accompany you I can drum a little now after a fashion We ll let them talk So they amused themselves for the rest of the evening with music and Lady Thryng s face lost the strained and harassed expression it had worn all during dinner and took on a look of contentment After this the days were spent by David in going over his uncle s large mass of papers and correspondence with the aid of mister Stretton and a secretary A colossal task it proved to be No one even his lawyer who had his confidence more than any one else knew in what the old Lord Thryng s wealth really consisted although mister Stretton surmised much of his surplus income of late years had been placed in Africa As his papers had not been set in order or tabulated for years every note land loan mortgage and rental had to be unearthed slowly and laboriously from among a mass of written matter and figures more or less worthless for the old lord had a habit of saving every scrap of paper the backs of notes and letters for summing up accounts and jotting down memoranda and dates Certain hours of each day David devoted to this labor collecting his papers in a small room opening off from the law chambers of mister Stretton where for years his uncle had kept a private safe Conscientiously he toiled at the monotonous task until weeks then months slipped by hardly noticed ignoring all social life When his mother or Laura broached the subject he would say Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof and this must be done first He was not unmindful of his wife during this interval but wrote frequently and to guard against any danger of her being left without resources should something unforeseen befall him he placed in Bishop Towers s hands the residue of money remaining to him in Canada for Cassandra He wrote her to use it as occasion required and not to spare it that it was hers without restriction He sent her the names of books he wished she would read that she should write the publishers for them He begged her to do no more weaving for money but only for her own amusement and above all to trust and be happy not to be sorrowful for this long delay which he would cut as short as he could Much of his occupation he could not explain to her and ofttimes it was hard to find matter for his letters then he would revert to reminiscence These were the letters she loved best and sometimes wept over and these were the letters that often left him dreamy and sad and sometimes made him distraught when his mother and Laura talked over their affairs so utterly alien to his thoughts and longings Cassandra s replies were for the most part short but they were sent with unfailing regularity and always they seemed to bring with them a breath from her own mountain top naive tender absolutely trusting often quaintly worded and telling of the simple innocent things of her life He could see that she held herself in reserve even as her nature was a psychologic something was held back He could not dream what it might be but reasoned with himself that it was only that she found it harder to unveil her thoughts by means of the pen than in speech One day as he rode alone in the park he noticed that the leaf buds were swelling What Was spring upon them A white fog was lifting and every twig and stem held its tiny pearl of wetness All the earth glistened and was clean and looked as if greenness was returning He regarded the artificial effects around him the long lines of trees and set clumps of shrubbery and was seized with a desire well nigh irresistible for the wild roads and rugged steeps the wandering streams and sound of falling waters He saw it all again the blossoming spring where Cassandra sat waiting for him and he resolved to start without delay to go to her and bring her back with him All this sordid calculation of the amount of his fortune his mother s and sister s shares the annuities of poor dependents stocks to be bought interest to be invested the government and his future part therein pah It must wait He would have his own His heritage should not be his curse He returned in haste that day only to learn that certain facts had been unearthed which necessitated a journey into Wales where interests of the former Lady Thryng s estates were concerned His uncle had inherited all from her with the exception of certain bequests to relatives with which he had been intrusted Some of the records had been lost and whether the beneficiaries were dead or not none knew but now and then letters came pleading for a continuance of former favors and recalling obligations mister Stretton had been ill for a week and now that the records were found David must go and go at once The lawyer had many subjects for investigation to deliver to David There was the death bed request of an old nurse of his aunt who had an annuity that it be extended to her crippled granddaughter She lived among the Cornish hills Would he hunt the family up and learn if they were worthy or impostors His uncle had been endlessly plagued with such importunities and so on and so on Yes certainly David would go He made a mental reservation that he would sail without returning to London and then make a clean breast of his affairs by letter to his mother She had improved in health during the winter and he thought his information would be received by her with more equanimity than it would have been earlier Moreover she had broached the subject of marriage to him more than once but always in one of her most worldly moods when he shrank from hearing Cassandra spoken of as he knew she would be when he could not hear her discussed nor reply with calmness to such questions as he knew must ensue David had little time to brood over his peculiar difficulty as his short journey was full of business interest and new experiences Yet the Cornish hills awoke in him a still greater eagerness for the mountains of his dreams and after securing his passage he went to his hotel to prepare the letter to his mother It is marvellous what trivial events alter destinies In this instance it was the yapping of a small dog which changed David s plans and finally sent him to South Africa instead of America While paying his bill at the hotel a telegram was handed him which he tore open as the clerk was counting out his change He still held in his hand the letter to his mother which he was on the point of dropping in the letter box at his elbow Instead he thrust it in his pocket along with the crushed telegram and taking a cab hastened to the steamship offices to cancel his date for sailing The message read Return with all speed to London mister Stretton lying in the hospital with a fractured skull Thus it was that Lady Tredwell s pet spaniel old and vicious yapping at the heels of mister Stretton s restive horse while my lady s maid who should have been leading him out for an airing was absorbed in listening to the compliments of one of the park guards played so dire a part in the affairs of David Thryng CHAPTER XXVII IN WHICH THE OLD DOCTOR AND LITTLE HOYLE COME BACK TO THE MOUNTAINS Cassandra seated on the great hanging rock before her cabin watched the sunrise where David had so often stood and waited for the dawn during his winter there alone This morning the mists obscured the valleys and the base of the mountains while the sky and the whole earth glowed with warm rose color Presently she rose and walked with lifted head into the cabin and prepared to light a fire on the hearth In the canvas room the bed was made smoothly as she had made it the morning David left No one had slept in it since although Cassandra spent most of her days there Everything he had used was carefully kept as he had left it His microscope covered from dust stood with the last specimen still under the lens A book they were reading together lay on the corner shelf with the mark still in the place where they had read last After lighting the fire she sat near it watching the flames steal up from the small pile of fat pine chips underneath sending up red tongues of fire until the great logs were wrapped in the hot embrace of the flames trembling quivering and leaping high in their mad joy transmuting all they touched It s like love she murmured and smiled Only it s quicker It does in one hour what love takes a lifetime to do Those logs might have lain on the ground and rotted if they d been left alone but now the fire just holds them and caresses them like and they grow warm and glow like the sun and give all they can while they last until they re almost too bright to look at I reckon God has been right good to me not to let me lie and rot my life away He sent David to set my heart on fire and I guess I can wait for him to come back to me in God s own time She rose and brought from the canvas room a basket of willow woven in open work pattern It was a gift from Azalea who had learned from her mother the art of basket weaving Some said Azalea s grandmother was half Indian and that it was from her they had learned their quaint patterns and shapes and that she and her Indian mother before her had been famous basket weavers This pretty basket was filled with very delicate work of fine muslin much finer than anything Cassandra had ever worked upon before Her hands no longer showed signs of having been employed in rough coarse tasks they were soft and white She placed the basket of dainty sewing on the same table which had served as an altar when she knelt beside David and was made his wife It was serving as an altar still bearing that basket of delicate work She had become absorbed in a book not one of those David had suggested It is doubtful had he been there whether he would have really liked to see her reading this one although it was written by Thackeray dear to all English hearts It is more than probable that he would have thought his young wife hardly need be enlightened upon just the sort of things with which Vanity Fair enriches the understanding Be it how it may Cassandra was reading Vanity Fair which she found in the box of books David had opened so long before While she read she worked with her fingers incessantly at a piece of narrow lace with a shuttle and very fine thread This she did so mechanically that she could easily read at the same time by propping the book open on the table before her For a long time she sat thus growing more and more interested until the fire burned low and she rose to replenish it The logs were piled beside the door of the small kitchen David had built for her and where he had placed the cook stove She had come up early this morning because she was sad over his last letter in which he had told her of his disappointment in having to cancel his passage to America Hopeful and cheery though the letter was it had struck dismay to her heart it was her way when sad and longing for her husband to go up to her little cabin her own home and think it all over alone and thus regain her equanimity Here she read and thought things out by herself What strange people they were over there Or perhaps that was so long ago they might have changed by this time Surely they must have changed or David would have said something about it He never would become a lord to be one of such people never never It was not at all like David A figure appeared in the doorway Cassandra What are you doing here all by yourself It was Betty Towers Cassandra ran joyfully forward and clasped the little woman in her arms Almost carrying her in she sat her by the pleasant open fire Then seeing Betty s eyes regarding her questioningly she suddenly dropped into her own chair by the table leaned her head upon her arms and began to weep silently In an instant Betty was kneeling by her side holding the lovely head to her breast Dearest You shan t cry You shan t cry like that Tell me all about it Why on earth doesn t Doctor Thryng come home Cassandra lifted her head and dried her tears He was coming The last letter but one said he was to sail next day Then last night came another saying the only man who could look after very important business for him had been thrown from his horse and hurt so bad he may die and David had to give up his passage and go back to London He may have to go to Africa He felt right bad but Goodness me child Why he has no business now more important than you What a chump Cassandra stiffened proudly and drew away taking up her shuttle and beginning her work calmly as if nothing had happened to destroy her composure I ve not written David anything to disturb him or make him hurry home Oh Cassandra Cassandra You re not treating either him or yourself fairly For him I can t help it and for me I don t care Other women have got along as best they could in these mountains and I can bear what they have borne But why on earth haven t you told him Cassandra bent her head lower over her bit of lace and was silent Betty drew her chair nearer and put her arms about the drooping girl Can t you tell me all about it dear Not if you are going to blame David I won t you lovely thing I can t since he doesn t know but why At first I couldn t speak I tried but I couldn t Then he had to take Hoyle North and I thought he would see for himself when he came back or I could tell him by that time Then came that dreadful news you know four all dead His brother and his two cousins all killed and his uncle dying of grief and he had to go to his mother or she might die too and then he found so much to do Now you know he has to be a She was going to say a lord but happening to glance down at her open book the name of Lord Steyne caught her eye and it seemed to her a title of disgrace She must talk with David before she allowed him to be known as a lord so she ended hurriedly He has to be a different kind of a man now not a doctor He has a great many things to do and look after If I told him he would leave everything and come to me even if he ought not and if he couldn t come he would be troubled and unhappy Why should I make him unhappy When he does come home he ll be glad oh so glad Why need he know when the knowing will do no good and when he will come to me as soon as he can anyway You strange girl Cassandra You brave old dear But he must come that s all It is his right to know and to come I can tell him Let me No no Please missus Towers you must not He will come back as soon as he can and now now he will be too late since he he did not sail when he meant to Betty rose with a set look about the mouth Unless we cable him Cassandra Would there be time in that case Come you must tell me No no wailed the girl And now he must not know until he comes It would be cruel I will not let you write him or cable him either Then what will you do Oh I don t know I ll think out a way You ll help me think but you must promise me not to write to David I send him a letter every day but I never tell him anything that would make him uneasy because he has very important business there for his mother and sister even more than for himself You see how bad I would be to write troubling things to him when he couldn t help me or come to me A light broke over Betty Towers s face I can think out a way dear of course I can Just leave matters to me Thus it was that Doctor Hoyle received a letter in Betty s own impassioned and impulsive style begging him for love s sake to leave all and come back to the mountains and his own little cabin where Cassandra needed him Never mind Doctor Thryng or anything surprising about his being absent just come if you possibly can and hear what Cassandra has to say about it before you judge him She is quaint and queer and wholly lovely If you can bring little Hoyle with you do so for I fear his mother is grieving to see him She wrote me a most peculiar and pathetic letter saying her daughter was so silent about her affairs that she herself war nigh about dead fer worryin and would I please come and see could I make Cass talk a leetle so you may be sure there is need of you The winter is glorious in the mountains this year Your appearance will set everything right at the Fall Place and Cassandra will be safe Old Time the unfailing who always marches apace bringing with him changes for good or evil brought the dear old doctor back to the Fall Place brought the small Adam Hoyle with his queer little twisted neck and hunched back drawn by harness and plaster into a much improved condition although not straight yet brought many letters from David filled with postponements and regrets therefor and brought also a little son for Cassandra to hold to her bosom and dream and pray over And the dreams and the prayers travelled far far to the sunny haired Englishman wrapped in the intricate affairs of a great estate How much money would accrue How should it be spent What improvements should be made in their country home When Laura s coming out should be How many of her old companions might she retain How many might she call friends How many were to be hereafter thrust out as quite impossible Should she be allowed a kennel or should her sporting tendencies be discouraged All these things were forced upon David s consideration how then could he return to his young wife especially when he could not yet bring himself to say to his world that he had a young wife Impatient he might be nervous and even irritable but still what could he do While there in the faraway hills sat Cassandra loving him brooding over him with serene and peaceful longing holding his baby to her white breast holding his baby s hand to her lips full of courage strong in her faith patient in spirit until as days and weeks passed she grew well and strong in body Being sadly in need of rest the old doctor lingered on in the mountains until spring was well advanced Slight of body but vigorous and wiry and as full of scientific enthusiasm as when he was thirty years younger he tramped the hills taking long walks and climbs alone or shorter ones with Hoyle at his heels like a devoted dog shrilling questions as he ran to keep up These the good doctor answered according to his own code or passed over as beyond possibility of reply with quizzical counter questioning They sat together one day eating their luncheon in the shelter of a great wall of rock and below them lay a pool of clear water which trickled from a spring higher up Now and then a bullfrog would sound his deep bass note and all the time the high piping of the peepers made shrill accompaniment to their voices as they conversed The doctor had made an aquarium for Hoyle using a great glass jar which he obtained from a druggist in Farington They had come to day on a quest for snails to eat the green growth which had so covered the sides of the jar as to hide the interesting water world within from the boy s eyes Many things had already occurred in that small world to set the boy thinking Doctah Hoyle you remembeh that thar quare bunch of leetle sticks an stones you put in my quar um first day you fixed hit up fer me Yes yes Well the is a right quare thing with a big hade come outen hit an he done eat up some o the leetle black bugs I seed him jump quicker n lightnin at that leetlist fish only so long an try to bite a piece outen his fin his lowest fin What did he do that fer Why why he was hungry He made his dinner off the little black bugs and he wanted the fin for his dessert I don t like that kind of a beast Oncet he was a worm in a kind of a hole box an then he turned into a leetle beast crittah an what ll he be next Next why next he ll be a fly a a beautiful fly with four wings all blue and gold and green I seen them

ails me You Why why what ails you You reckon p r aps I mount git changed some way outen this here quare back I got so t I can hol my hade like otheh folks Jes go to sleep like an wake up straight like Frale The old doctor turned and looked down a moment on the child sitting hunched at his side His mouth worked as he meditated a reply What would you do if you could c arry your head straight like Frale If you had been like him you would be running a still pretty soon You never would have come to me to set you straight and so you would n never have seen all the pictures and the great cities You are going to be a man before you know it and And I ll do a heap o things when I m a man too but I wisht I wisht These here snails we b en hunt n you reckon they re done growed to ther shells so they can t get out What did God make em that a way fer It s all in the order of things Everything has its place in the world and its work to do They don t want to get out They like to carry their bones on the outside of their bodies They re made so Yes yes all in the order of things They like it You reckon you can tell me hu come God lowed me to have this er lump on my back Hit hain t in no ordeh o things fer humans to be like I be The sceptical old man looked down on the child quizzically yet sadly His flexible mouth twitched to reply but he was silent Hoyle looked back into the old doctor s eyes with grave direct gaze and turned away You reckon why he done hit See here Suppose just suppose you were given your choice this minute to change places with Frale Lord knows where he is now or what he s doing or be as you are and live your own life which would you be Think it over think it out Ef I had a been straight brother David never would a took me up to you No no no You would have been a You mean if a magic man should come by here an just touch me so an change me into Frale would I low him to do hit That s what I mean I don t guess Frale he d like to be done that a way The loving little chap nestled closer to the doctor s side I like you a heap Doctah Hoyle Frale he fit brothah David an nigh about killed him I reckon I rutheh be like I be an bide nigh Cass an th baby an have the quar um an see maw an go with you You reckon I can go back with you Go back Of course go back Be I heap o trouble to you You reckon God lowed me to have this er hump so t I could get to go an bide whar you were at like I done A suspicious moisture gathered in the doctor s eyes and he sprang up and went to examine earnestly a thorny shrub some paces away while the child continued to pipe his questions for the most part unanswerable You reckon God just gin my neck er twist so t brothah David would take me to Canada to you an so t maw d low me to go You reckon if I m right good He ll low me to make a picture o th ocean some day like the one we seed in that big house You reckon if I tried right hard I could paint a picture o th mountain yandah an th sea an all the all the ships The doctor laughed heartily and merrily Come come We must go home now to Cassandra and the baby Paint Of of course you could paint You could paint p pictures enough to fill a house We don t want no magic man do we Doctah Hoyle I cried a heap after I seed myself in the big lookin glass down in Farington whar brothah David took me I cried when hit war dark an maw war sleepin Next time I reckon I bettah tell God much obleeged fer twistin my hade roun stead er cryin an takin on like I been doin You reckon so Doctah Hoyle Yes yes yes I reckon so said the doctor meditatively as they descended the trail From that day the child s strength increased Sunny and buoyant he shook off the thought of his deformity and his beauty loving soul ceased introspective brooding and found delight in searching out beauty and in his creative faculty CHAPTER XXVIII IN WHICH FRALE RETURNS TO THE MOUNTAINS Doctor Hoyle lingered until the last of the laurel bloom was gone and the widow had become so absorbed in her grandchild as to make the parting much easier Then he took the small Adam and departed for the North Never did the kind old man dream that his frail and twisted little namesake would one day be the pride of his life and the comfort of his declining years Hoyle sure do look a heap bettah n when Doctah David took him off that day Hit did seem like I d nevah see him again Don t you guess at he s beginnin to grow some Seems like he do The widow was seated on her little porch with the doctor the evening before they left and Cassandra who since the birth of the heir had been living again in her own little cabin had brought the baby down He lay on his grandmother s lap quietly sleeping while his mother gathered Hoyle s treasures and packed his diminutive trunk The boy followed her chattering happily as she worked She also had noticed the change in him and suggested that perhaps as he had gained such a start toward health he need not return but would do quite well at home He s a care to you Doctor although you re that kind and patient I don t see how ever we can thank you enough for all you ve done Then Hoyle to their utter astonishment threw himself on the ground at the doctor s feet and burst into bitter weeping Why son are ye cryin that a way so s you can get to go off an leave maw here lone But he continued to weep and at last explained to them that the Lord done crooked him up that a way so t he could git to go an learn to be a painter an make a house full of pictures and that the doctor had said he might Doctor Hoyle lifted him to his knees with many assurances that he would keep his word but for a long time the child sobbed hysterically his face pressed against the old man s sleeve What s that you sayin child bouts the Lord twistin yer neck Bettah lay sech as that to the devil more n likely At the mention of that sinister individual the babe wakened and stretched out his plump bare arms with little pink fists tightly closed He yawned a prodigious yawn for so small a countenance and gazed vacantly in his grandmother s face Then a look of intelligence crept into his eyes and he smiled one of those sweet evanescent smiles of infancy Look at him now laughin at me that a way He be the peartest I eveh did see Cass she sure be mean not to tell his fathah at he have a son she sure be Cassandra came and tenderly took the babe in her arms and held him to her breast There there Sleep honey son sleep again she cooed swaying her body to the rhythm of her speech Sleep honey son sleep again Don t you reckon she be mean to Doctah David nevah to let on at he have a son and he a growin that fast You a doin his fathah mean Cassandry Still Cassandra swayed and sang Sleep honey son sleep again He nevah will forgive you when he finds out how you have done him I can t make out what all ails ye nohow Hush mother I m just leaving his heart in peace He ll come when he can and then he ll forgive me As the doctor walked slowly at her side that evening carrying the sleeping child back to her cabin he also ventured a remonstrance but without avail It s hardly fair to his father such a fine little chap You you have a monopoly of him this way you know She flushed at the implication of selfishness but said nothing How how is that Don t you think so he persisted kindly I reckon you can t feel what I feel Doctor Why should I make his heart troubled when he must stay there David knows I hate it to bide so long without him He he knows If he could get to come back don t you guess he d come right quick anyway Would he come any sooner for his son than for me It was the doctor s turn for silence She asked again this time with a tremor in her voice You reckon he would Doctor No Of of course not he cried Then what would be the use of telling him only to trouble him He he might like to think about him you know might like it He said he must go to Africa in May so now he must have started and our wedding was on May day Now it s the last of May he must be there He might be obliged to bide in that country a whole month maybe two It s so far away and his letters take so long to come Doctor are they fighting there now Sometimes I wake in the night and think what if he should die away off there in that far place No no That s done Not fighting thank God Rest your heart in peace Now after I m gone don t stay up here alone too much I m a physician and I know what s best for you She took the now soundly sleeping child from the doctor s arms and laid him on the bed in the canvas room The day had been warm and the fire was out in the great fireplace the evening wind light and cool laden with sweet odors swept through the cabin They talked late that night of Hoyle and his future but never a word more of David The old man thought he now understood her feeling and respected it She certainly had a right to one small weakness this strong fair creature of the hills Her husband must release himself from his absorbing cares and return simply for love of her not at the call of his baby s wail So the doctor and his diminutive namesake drove contentedly away next morning in the great covered wagon and Cassandra standing by her mother s door smiled and lifted her baby for one last embrace from his loving little uncle I m goin to grow a big man an I ll teach him to make pictures big ones he called back Yas you ll do a heap You bettah watch out to be right good and peart that s what you bettah do David not unmindful of affairs on the far away mountain side made it quite worth the while of the two cousins to stay on with the widow and run the small farm under Cassandra s directions and she found herself fully occupied She wrote David all the details when and where things were planted how the vines he had set on the hill slope were growing how the pink rose he had brought from Hoke Belew s and planted by their threshold had grown to the top of the door and had three sweet blossoms She had shaken the petals of one between the pages of her letter on May day and sent it to remind him she said Nearly a month later than he had intended to sail David left England overwhelmed with many small matters which seemed so great to his mother and sister and burdened with duties imposed upon him by the realization that he had come into the possession of enormous wealth more than he could comprehendingly estimate and that he was now setting out to secure and prevent the loss of possibly double what he already possessed People gathered about him and presented him with worthy and unworthy opportunities for its disposal They flocked to him in herds with importunities and flatteries The tower which he had built up with his ideals and in which he had intrenched himself was in danger of being undermined and toppled into ruins burying his soul beneath the debris When seated on the deck the rose petals dropped into his hand as he tore open Cassandra s letter Some ere he could catch them were caught up and blown away into the sea He held them and inhaled their sweetness and everything seemed to find its true value and proportion and to fall into its right place Again on the mountain top with Cassandra at his side he viewed in a perspective of varying gradations his life his aims and his possessions The personality of his young wife of late a vague thing to him distant and fair and haloed about with sweet memories dimly discerned like a dream that is past presented itself to him all at once vivid and clear as if he held her in his arms with her head on his breast He heard again her voice with its quaint inflections and lingering tones Their love for each other loomed large and became for him at once the one truly vital thing in all his share of the universe Had his body been endowed with the wings of his soul he would have left all and gone to her but alas for the restrictions of matter he was gliding rapidly away and away farther from the immediate attainment Yet was his tower strengthened wherein he had intrenched himself with his ideals The withered rose petals had brought him exaltation of purpose In the mountains July came with unusually sultry heat yet the rich pocket of soil watered by its never failing stream suffered little from the drought Weeds grew apace and Cassandra had much ado to hold her cousin Cotton Caswell easy going and thriftless to his task of keeping the small farm in order For a long time now Cassandra had avoided those moments of far seeing and brooding Had not David said he feared them for her In these days of waiting she dreaded lest they show her something to which she would rather remain blind In the evenings looking over the hilltops from her rock visions came to her out of the changing mists but she put them from her and calmed her breast with the babe on her bosom and solaced her longing by keeping all in readiness for David s return Perhaps at any moment with wind lifted hair and buoyant smile he might come up the laurel path For this reason she preferred living in her own cabin home and that she might not be alone at night Martha Caswell or her brother slept on a cot in the large cabin room but Cassandra cared little for their company They might come or not as they chose She was never afraid now that she was strong again and baby was well One evening sitting thus her babe lying asleep on her knees and her heart over the sea something caused her to start from her revery and look away from the blue distance toward the cabin There a few paces away regarding her intently stalwart and dark handsome and eager stood Frale Much older he seemed more reckless he appeared yet still a youth in his undisciplined impulse She sat pale as death unable to move in breathless amazement He smiled upon her out of the gathering dusk For some minutes he had been regarding her and the tumult within him had become riotous with long restraint He came swiftly forward and ere she could turn her head his arms were about her and his lips upon hers and she felt herself pinioned in her chair nor for guarding her baby unhurt by his vehemence could she use her hands to hold him from her nor for the suffocating beating of her heart could she cry out neither would her cry have availed for there were none near to hear her Stop Frale I am not yours stop Frale she implored Yas you are mine he said in his low drawl lifting his head to gaze in her face You gin me your promise That doctah man he done gone an lef you all alone and he ain t nevah goin to come back to these here mountins She snatched her hands from the child on her knees and with sudden movement pushed him violently but he only held her closer and it was as if she struggled against muscles of iron Naw you don t I have you now an I won t nevah leave you go again He had not been drinking yet he was like one drunken so long had he brooded and waited Rapidly she tried to think how she might gain control over him when wakened by the struggle the babe wailed out and he started to his feet his hands clutching into his hair as if he were struck with sudden fear He had not noticed or given heed to what lay upon her knees and the cry penetrated his heart like a knife A child His child that doctor s child He hated the thought of it and the old impulse to strike down anything or any creature that stood in his way seized him the impulse that unchecked had made him a murderer He could kill kill Cassandra gathered the little body to her heart and standing still before him looked into his eyes Instinctively she knew that only calmness and faith in his right action would give her the mastery now and with a prayer in her heart she spoke quietly How came you here Frale You wrote mother you d gone to Texas His figure relaxed and his arms dropped but still he bent forward and gazed eagerly into her eyes I come back when I heered he war gone I come back right soon Cate Irwin s wife writ me at he war gone an now she done tol me he ain t nevah goin to come back to these here mountins Ev ybody on the mountins knows that He jes have fooled you all that a way makin out to marry you whilst he war in bed like he couldn stand on his feet an then gittin up an goin off this a way an bidin nigh on to a year We don t low our women to be done that a way like they war pore white trash I come back fer you like I promised an you done gin me your promise too I reckon you won t go back on that now He stepped nearer and she clasped the babe closer but did not flinch Yes Frale you promised and I I promised to save you from yourself to be a good man but you broke yours You didn t repent and you went on drinking and then you tried to kill an innocent man when he was alone and unarmed like a coward you shot him I called back my words from God I gave them to the man I loved promise for promise Frale Yas and curse for curse You cursed me Cass He made one more step forward but she stood her ground and lifted one hand above her head the gesture he so well remembered Keep back Frale I did not curse you I let you go free and no one followed you Go back farther farther or I will do it now Oh God He cowered his arm before his eyes and moved backward Don t Cass he cried For a moment she stood regally before him her babe resting easily in the hollow of her arm Then she slowly lowered her hand and spoke again in quiet distinct tones Now for that lie they have told you I am going to my husband I start to morrow He has sent me money to come to him You tell that word all up and down the mountain side wherever there bides one to hear She lifted her baby pressing his little face to her cheek and turning walked slowly toward her cabin door Cass he called She paused Well Frale Cass you hev cursed me No Frale it is the curse of Cain that rests on your soul You brought it on you by your own hand If you will live right and repent Christ will take it off Will you ask him for me Cass I sure hev lost you now forever Cass Yes Frale I ll ask him to cover up all this year out of your life It has been full of mad badness Be like you used to be Frale and leave off thinking on me this way It is sin Go marry somebody who can love you and care for you like you need and come back here and do for mother like you used to Giles Teasley can t pester you He s half dead with his badness drinking his own liquor She came to him and taking his hand led him toward the laurel path Go down to mother now Frale and have supper and sleep in your own bed like no evil had ever come into your neart she pleaded The good is in you Frale God sees it and I see it Heed to me Frale Good night Slowly with bent head he walked away Trembling Cassandra laid her baby in the cradle Hoke Belew had made her and kneeling beside the rude little bed she bowed her head over it and wept scalding bitter tears She felt herself shamed before the whole mountain side Oh why why need David have left her so long so long The first reproach against him entered her heart and at the same time she reasoned with herself He could not help it surely he could not He was good and true and they should all know it if she had to lie for it When she had sobbed herself into a measure of calmness she heard a step cross the cabin floor Quickly drying her tears she rose and stood in the doorway of the canvas room with dilated eyes and indrawn breath peering into the dusk barring the way It was only her mother Why mothah she cried relieved and overjoyed Have you seen Frale Yes mothah He was here Sit down and get your breath You have climbed too fast Her mother dropped into a chair and placed a small bundle on the table at her side What all is this Frale say you have told him Have David writ fer you like Frale say What all have Frale been up to now He come down creepin like he a half dade man that soft an quiet I m going to David mother You know he sent me money to use any way I choose and I m going She caught her breath and faltered The mother rose and took her in her arms and drawing her head down to her wrinkled cheek patted her softly Thar honey thar I reckon your ol maw knows a heap more n you think You keep mighty still but you can t fool her Cassandra drew herself together Why didn t Martha come up this evening She war makin ready in her triflin slow way an then Frale come down an said that word an I knew right quick at ther war somethin behind his way war that quare so I told Marthy to set him out a good suppah an I d stop up here myself this night She war right glad to do hit Fool she be I could see how she went plumb silly ovah Frale all to onc t Mothah you know right well what they re saying about David and me Is it true that word Frale said that everyone says he nevah will come back The mother was silent That s all right mothah We ll pack up to night and I ll go down to Farington to morrow missus Towahs will help me to start right She lighted candles and began to lay out her baby s wardrobe I haven t anything to put these in but I can carry everything I need down there in baskets and she will help me They ve always been that good to me all my life Cass Cass don t go wailed her mother I m afraid somethin ll happen you if you go that far away If you could leave baby with me Cass Give hit up Be ye feared o Frale honey No mother the man doesn t live that I m afraid of She paused holding the candle in her hand lighting her face that shone whitely out of the darkness Her eyes glowed and she held her head high Then she turned again to her work gathering her few small treasures and placing them on one of the highest shelves of the chimney cupboard As she worked she tried to say comforting things to her mother I ll write to you every day like David does me mother See I ve kept all his letters They re in this box I don t want to burn them because I love them and I don t want any one else to read them and I don t want to carry them with me because I ll have him there Will you lock them in your box mother and if anything happens to me will you sure sure burn them She laid them on the table at her mother s elbow You promise mothah Yas Cass yas What s in that bundle mothah With trembling fingers the widow opened her parcel and displayed the silver teapot from which the spout had been melted to be moulded into silver bullets Thar she said holding it out by the handle hit s yourn Farwell he done that one day whilst I war gone an the last bullet war the one Frale used when he nigh killed your man No I reckon you nevah did see hit before fer I ve kept hit hid good I knowed ther were somethin to come outen hit some day Hit do show your fathah come from some fine high fambly somewhar I done showed hit to Doctah David fer I lowed he mount know was hit wuth anything but he seemed to set more by them two leetle books He has them books yet I reckon Yes he has them When Frale told me you war a goin to David I guessed at thar war somethin at I d ought to know an I clum up here right quick fer if he war a lyin I meant to find out the reason why She looked keenly in her daughter s face which remained passive under the scrutiny Has Frale been a pesterin you He did some at first but I sent him away I reckoned so Now heark You tell me straight did David send fer ye er didn t he In silence Cassandra turned to her work until it seemed as if the room were filled with the suspense of the unanswered question Then she tried evasion Why do you ask in that way mothah Because if he sont fer ye I ll help ye all I can but if he didn t I ll hinder ye and ye ll bide right whar ye be You won t do that mothah I sure will If David haven t sont fer ye an ye go ye ll have to walk ovah me to get thar hear The mother s voice was raised to a higher pitch than was her wont and the little silver pot shook in her hand Cassandra took it and regarded it without interest absorbed in other thoughts Then throwing off her abstraction she began questioning her mother about it and why she had brought it to her now The widow told all she knew as she had told David and pointed out the half obliterated coat of arms on the side I ve heered your paw say at ther war more pieces n this oncet but this n come straight to him from his grandpaw an now hit s yourn If he have sont fer ye take hit with ye Hit may be wuth more n you think fer now I been told they do think a heap o fambly ovah thar jest like we do here in the mounting Leastways hit s all we do have some of us My fambly war all good stock capable and peart an now heark to me Wharevah you go just you hold your hade up The hain t nothin more despisable than a body at goes meachin around like some old sheep stealin houn dog Now if he sure nough have sont fer ye go an I ll help ye but if he haven t bide whar ye be Cassandra drew in her breath sharply no longer able to evade the question with her mother s keen eyes searching her face All her reasons for going flashed through her mind in a moment s space of time The book she had been reading what were English people really like And David her David her boy s father what shameful things were they saying of him all over the mountain that Frale should dare come to her as he had done She could not stay now she would not Her cheeks flamed and she walked silently into the canvas room and stood by her baby s cradle Her mother began wrapping up the silver pot I guess I ll take this back an lock hit up again You sure hain t to go if ye can t give me that word Cassandra went quickly and took it from her mother s hand No mother give it to me I told Frale David had sent for me and I m going And he have sont fer ye Yes mothah Her reply was low as she turned again to her work Waal now why couldn t you have give me that word first off Hit s his right to have ye an I ll he p ye You d ought to go to him if he can t come to you Instantly up and alert putting bravely aside her own feelings at the thought of parting the mother began helping her daughter but long after they were finished and settled for the night she lay wakeful and dreading the coming day Cassandra slept less and lay quietly thinking sorrowful that she must leave her home and not a little anxious over what might be her future and what might be her fate in that strange land When at last she slept she dreamed of the people she had met in Vanity Fair with David strangely mixed up among them and Frale ever alert and watchful moving wherever she moved silently lingering near and never taking his eyes from her face In the morning mother and daughter were up betimes but no word was spoken between them to betoken hesitation or fear Cassandra walked in a sort of dumb wonder at herself and smouldering deep beneath the surface was a fierce resentment against those who having known her from childhood and receiving many favors and kindnesses from her should now presume to so speak against her husband as to make Frale dare to approach her as he had Oh the burning shame of those kisses The shame of the thought against David that pervaded her beloved mountains For the sake of his good name she would put away her pride and go to him CHAPTER XXIX IN WHICH CASSANDRA VISITS DAVID THRYNG S ANCESTORS It was a pleasant morning in London with as clear a sky as is ever permitted to that great city 
5290_26685_000002_000001	train-clean-360	Cassandra had placed her little son in the middle of a huge bed which nearly filled the small room she had been given in a hotel recommended to her by Betty Towers as one where nice ladies travelling alone could stop 
5290_26685_000003_000000	train-clean-360	The child was dressed in a fresh white coat and Cassandra had much ado to keep him clean 
none	none	She heaped him about with pillows and bedclothing to make a nest for him and gave him a spoon and a drinking cup for entertainment while she arranged her own toilet before a cloudy mirror by a slant ray of daylight that managed to sift through the heavy draperies and lace curtains that obscured the one high narrow window of her room 
5290_26685_000004_000000	train-clean-360	She had tried to put them one side that she might look out when she awoke but she could see only chimney pots and grimy irregularly tiled roofs 
5290_26685_000004_000001	train-clean-360	A narrow opening at the top of the window let in a little air still she felt smothered and tried to raise the lower sash but could not move it 
none	none	She thought of the books she had read about great cities and how some people had to live in places like this always and her heart filled with a large pity for them 
5290_26685_000004_000003	train-clean-360	Here only a small triangle of blue sky could be seen not a tree not a bit of earth and in the small room all those heavy furnishings closed around her dark red stuffy and greasy with London smoke 
5290_26685_000004_000004	train-clean-360	She could not touch them without blackening her hands nor let her baby sit on the floor for the dirt he wiped up on his clothing as he rolled and kicked about 
5290_26685_000005_000000	train-clean-360	The room seemed to sway and tip as the ship had done and there was a continuous sound as of thunder a strange undercurrent that seemed to her strained nerves like the moaning of the lost souls of all the ages who had lived and toiled and smothered in this monstrous and terrible city 
none	none	Ah she must get out of it 
5290_26685_000006_000001	train-clean-360	She must hurry hurry and find David 
5290_26685_000006_000002	train-clean-360	He would be glad to see his little son 
5290_26685_000006_000003	train-clean-360	He would take him in his arms 
5290_26685_000006_000004	train-clean-360	He would hold them both to his heart 
none	none	She would see him smile again and look in his eyes and all this foreboding would cease and the woful sounds die out of the air and become only the natural roar of the activities and traffic of a great city 
5290_26685_000006_000006	train-clean-360	She must get used to all this and not expect to find all the world like her own sunny mountains 
none	none	The bishop s careful little wife had tried to explain to her how to meet her new experiences 
5290_26685_000007_000001	train-clean-360	She was to go nowhere alone without taking a cab and never start out on foot carrying her baby in her arms as she might do at home 
5290_26685_000007_000002	train-clean-360	She had given her written instructions how to conduct herself under all ordinary circumstances at her hotel or on the street how to ring for a servant order her meals or call a cab 
none	none	Now standing before her mirror Cassandra essayed to arrange her hair as she had seen other young women wear theirs but she thought the new way looked untidy and she took it all down and rearranged it as she was used to wear it David would not mind if she did not do her hair as others did he would be so glad to see her and his little son Ah the comfort of that little son 
5290_26685_000008_000003	train-clean-360	She leaned over the bed half dressed as she was and murmured pretty cooing phrases kissing and cuddling him to contented laughter 
5290_26685_000009_000000	train-clean-360	Betty Towers had procured clothing for her a modest supply using her own good taste and not disguising Cassandra s natural grace and dignity by a too close adherence to the prevailing mode 
none	none	There were a blue travelling gown and jacket and a toque of the same color with a white wing a soft clinging black silk made with girlish simplicity which admirably became her and a wide flexible brimmed hat with a single heavy plume taken from Betty s own hat of the last winter 
5290_26685_000009_000002	train-clean-360	Cassandra stood a long moment before the two gowns 
none	none	She desired to don the silk but Betty had told her always to wear the blue in the morning so at last she obeyed her kind adviser 
5290_26685_000010_000000	train-clean-360	While waiting with her baby in her arms for the hotel boy to call her cab she observed another lady young and graceful enter a cab and a maid following her wearing a pretty cap and carrying a child 
5290_26685_000010_000001	train-clean-360	Eager for David s sake to draw no adverse comment upon herself she took note of everything 
5290_26685_000010_000002	train-clean-360	Ought she then to arrive attended by a maid carrying her baby 
5290_26685_000010_000003	train-clean-360	But David would know she did not need one bringing him his little son in her own arms what would he care for anything more 
5290_26685_000010_000004	train-clean-360	So the address was given the cabman and they were rattled away over the rough paving a long lonely ride through the wonderful city so many miles of houses and splendid buildings of gardens and monuments 
none	none	Strangely the people of Vanity Fair leaped out of the book she had read and walked the streets or dashed by her in cabs albeit in modern dress The soldiers the guardsmen the liveried lackeys the errand boys all were there and the ladies in fine carriages 
5290_26685_000011_000002	train-clean-360	There were the nursemaids the babies the beggars the ragged urchins and the venders of the street with their raucous cries rending the air 
5290_26685_000011_000003	train-clean-360	Her brain whirled and a new feeling to which she had hitherto been blessedly a stranger crept over her a feeling of fear 
5290_26685_000012_000000	train-clean-360	As the great two story coaches and trams thundered by she clasped her baby closer until he looked up in her face with round eyed wonder and put up his lip in pitiful protest 
5290_26685_000012_000001	train-clean-360	She soothed and comforted him until her panic passed and when at last they stopped before a great house built in on either side by other houses with wide steps of stone descending directly upon the street she had regained a measure of composure 
none	none	She was assured by the cabman leaning respectfully down to her with his cap in his hand that this was the ouse ma m and should he wait Oh yes 
5290_26685_000013_000001	train-clean-360	Wait cried Cassandra 
5290_26685_000013_000002	train-clean-360	What if David were not there 
5290_26685_000013_000003	train-clean-360	And of course he might be out 
5290_26685_000013_000004	train-clean-360	Then they were swallowed up in the dark interior 
none	none	She was admitted to a hall that seemed to her empty and vast by a little old man in livery 
5290_26685_000013_000006	train-clean-360	For a moment bewildered she could hardly understand what he was saying to her 
none	none	Er ladyship s at er country ome and the ouse closed 
5290_26685_000014_000000	train-clean-360	Although dazed and baffled Cassandra betrayed no sign of the tumult within and the little old man stood before her hesitating his curiosity piqued into a determination to discover her business and identity 
5290_26685_000014_000001	train-clean-360	Her gravity and silence gave her a poise and dignity that allayed suspicion but he and his old wife liked diversion and a spice of gossip lightened the monotony of their lives so he waited then coughed behind his hand 
none	none	Yes er ladyship and Lady Laura are at their country ome now ma m Maybe you came to see the ouse ma m
5290_26685_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 No it was not the house it was Again she waited not knowing how to introduce her husband s name 
5290_26685_000017_000000	train-clean-360	A mystery 
5290_26685_000017_000001	train-clean-360	A visitor at this hour and seemingly a lady yet with a baby in her arms and alone and not to see the house 
5290_26685_000017_000002	train-clean-360	Again he coughed behind his hand 
none	none	A many do come to see the ouse ma m with a permit from is lordship ma m E s not ere now but strangers are halways welcome to the gallery ma m
5290_26685_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes I m a stranger She caught at the word 
5290_26685_000019_000001	train-clean-360	Seized by an inward terror of the small eyes fixed curiously on her she intuitively shrank from betraying her identity and the old servant had told her what she needed to know 
5290_26685_000019_000002	train-clean-360	Of course her husband was his lordship over here 
5290_26685_000019_000003	train-clean-360	 I am from America and I would like to see the gallery She must do so to give a pretext for having come to visit an empty house 
none	none	David must not be compromised before the old servant but a great lump filled her throat and tears were burning unshed beneath her eyes For all of the warm August sun shining without a chill struck to her bones as they passed through the vast closed rooms 
5290_26685_000020_000001	train-clean-360	She held her now sleeping baby close to her breast as she followed the old man about from picture to picture 
none	none	Yes a many do come ere especially hartists to see this gallery They say as ow is lordship wouldn t take a thousand pounds for this one ma m 
5290_26685_000021_000001	train-clean-360	We ll let in a little more light 
5290_26685_000021_000002	train-clean-360	A Vandyke and worth it s weight in gold 
5290_26685_000022_000000	train-clean-360	Cassandra watched him cross the floor his short bow legs reflected grotesquely in its shining surface as he walked then turned and gazed again at the life size half length portrait of a young man with sunny hair like David s and warm brown eyes 
none	none	There you see it s more than a Vandyke to the family ma m for it s a hancestor and my wife says it s as like as two peas to is young lordship who has just come into the title ma m And that s strange isn t it for im to look so like being as e belonged to the younger branch who aven t eld the title for four generations but come to dress im in velvet and gold lace and the likeness would be nigh as perfect as if e ad stood for it Cassandra gazed so long silently at this picture that again the little man coughed his deprecatory cough and essayed to lead her on but she was seeing visions and did not heed him When at last she turned her gray eyes had deepened and a clearly defined spot of delicate red burned on one pale cheek 
5290_26685_000024_000002	train-clean-360	She drew a deep breath and looked down the length of the long gallery 
5290_26685_000024_000003	train-clean-360	Everything was being impressed upon her mind as upon sensitized paper 
5290_26685_000025_000000	train-clean-360	She followed slowly in the old man s wake never opening her lips until they had made the circuit and were again standing before the portrait of the fair haired youth 
none	none	Then roused suddenly by a direct question she responded 
5290_26685_000026_000000	train-clean-360	The old servant was saying You aven t appened to meet a Samuel Cutter in America ave you 
5290_26685_000026_000001	train-clean-360	 E s our son 
none	none	England was too slow for im Young men aren t like old ones they wants hadventure and they gets it That s ow so many of em joins the harmy and gets killed like is lordship s two sons and young Lord Thryng s brother as would ave been is lordship if e ad lived You aven t appened to know a Samuel Cutter over there E went to Canada
5290_26685_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 No I never met any one by that name 
none	none	I live a long way from Canada
5290_26685_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 About ow far do you think ma m 
5290_26685_000029_000000	train-clean-360	Cassandra had no idea of the distance but she knew how long David and Hoyle were journeying there so she answered as best she could 
5290_26685_000029_000001	train-clean-360	 It takes three or four days to get there from my home 
5290_26685_000030_000000	train-clean-360	The old man s eyes opened wide and his jaw dropped 
5290_26685_000030_000001	train-clean-360	 It s a big country America is 
5290_26685_000030_000002	train-clean-360	England may be a small place but she as tremendous big possessions He felt it all belonged to England and spoke with swelling pride as his short legs carried him toward the door There again he paused 
5290_26685_000030_000003	train-clean-360	He had learned nothing of this young woman to tell his old wife except that she came from America and had never met Samuel Cutter 
5290_26685_000030_000004	train-clean-360	The mystery was still unsolved 
5290_26685_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes is young lordship do look amazing like that picture 
5290_26685_000031_000001	train-clean-360	If you d ever seen im you d think e d dressed up in velvet and lace and stood for it 
5290_26685_000031_000002	train-clean-360	 E s lived in America five years but if you never were in Canada and never met our Sammy it s more likely you never saw im either 
none	none	Is he at their country home also Cassandra asked 
5290_26685_000032_000001	train-clean-360	She had seated herself in the hall for her heart throbbed chokingly and the lump was heavy in her throat 
none	none	It was as she had dreamed sometimes when her feet seemed to cling to the earth and would not lift her weight up some steep hill
5290_26685_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 Is lordship is still in Hafrica mam 
none	none	E ave been a great traveller but e can t stay much longer now for Lady Laura is to ave a grand coming out and is lordship is to be married Her ladyship s eart is set on it and on is marrying igh too 
5290_26685_000033_000003	train-clean-360	That s gossip you know 
5290_26685_000034_000000	train-clean-360	Cassandra rose and stood suddenly poised for flight 
5290_26685_000034_000001	train-clean-360	She must get out of that house and hear no more 
5290_26685_000034_000002	train-clean-360	She had a silver shilling in her hand for Betty Towers had told her all servants expected a tip and this was intended for the cabman 
5290_26685_000034_000003	train-clean-360	Had she followed her impulse she would have darted by with her fingers in her ears but instead she dropped the shilling in the old man s hand and quietly turned toward the door 
5290_26685_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 Thank you his fingers closed over the shilling 
5290_26685_000035_000001	train-clean-360	Her pallor struck him then even as the red spot on her cheek deepened and he held out his arms for the child 
5290_26685_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 Let me carry im for you ma m 
5290_26685_000036_000001	train-clean-360	Is it a boy 
5290_26685_000037_000000	train-clean-360	But her arms closed tighter about her baby 
5290_26685_000037_000001	train-clean-360	 He is my little son It was almost a cry as she said it but again she forced herself to calmness and walking slowly out added with a quiet smile I always keep him myself 
5290_26685_000037_000002	train-clean-360	We do in America 
5290_26685_000038_000000	train-clean-360	In a moment she was gone 
none	none	The warm sunlight burst in on them and flooded the cold hall as the old man stood in the doorway looking after the retreating cab and down at the silver shilling 
5290_26685_000039_000000	train-clean-360	Darker dingier stuffier seemed the box of a room as she walked into it and laid her still sleeping babe on the bed 
5290_26685_000039_000001	train-clean-360	She felt herself moving in an unreal world 
5290_26685_000039_000002	train-clean-360	David her David she had not come to him after all she had come to an empty place 
none	none	She knelt and threw her arms about her little son encircling his head and his feet 
5290_26685_000039_000004	train-clean-360	She neither wept nor prayed and the red spot burned against the creamy whiteness of her skin 
5290_26685_000039_000005	train-clean-360	She was not thinking only looking seeing into the past and down the long vista of her future 
none	none	Pictures came to her pictures of her girlhood her dim aspirations her melancholy eyed father his hilltop and beloved sunlit mountains 
5290_26685_000040_000001	train-clean-360	In the radiance of the spring she saw them and in the glory of the autumn she breathed the fragrance of the pines in winter and heard the soft patter of summer rains on widespreading leaves 
5290_26685_000040_000002	train-clean-360	She saw David walking at her side and heard his laugh sun bright and glorious he seemed her Phoebus Apollo the father of her little son 
5290_26685_000041_000000	train-clean-360	She saw the terrible sea which she had crossed to come to him the white crested waves with turquoise lights and indigo depths shifting and sliding unceasingly where all the world seemed swallowed in space and the huge steamship so small a thing in the vast and perilous deep and now now she was here 
none	none	What was she What was life 
5290_26685_000042_000000	train-clean-360	She had tried to find him her David and had been shown the dead and the glory of the dead all past and gone her David s glory 
5290_26685_000042_000001	train-clean-360	Shown that long empty gallery resounding with those aged footsteps and the pictures pictures pictures of men and women who had once been babes like her little son and David s now dead and gone not one soul among them all to greet her 
none	none	Proud lords and dames in frames of gold young men and maidens in costly silks and velvets of marvellous dyes red cheeked red lipped and soullessly silent and she alone and undefended in their midst holding in her arms their last descendant All those painted fingers seemed lifted to point at her those silent red lips parted to cry out at her Look at this stranger claiming to be one of us send her away 
5290_26685_000043_000000	train-clean-360	And David her David was one of these 
5290_26685_000043_000001	train-clean-360	What they had felt what they had thought and striven for was it all intensified and concentrated in him 
5290_26685_000043_000002	train-clean-360	Oh if her soul could only reach to him wherever he was and penetrate this impalpable veil that stretched between them 
none	none	If her hands could only touch him her eyes look into his and see what lay in their depths for her Then her babe stirred and tossed up his pretty hands waking her from her sad vision seeing trance 
5290_26685_000044_000001	train-clean-360	He opened his large clear eyes and suddenly it seemed that her wish was granted that the veil was rent and she was looking into David s eyes and seeing his soul free no longer chained by invisible links to those dead and gone beings and their traditions 
5290_26685_000044_000002	train-clean-360	This had been all a dream a dream 
5290_26685_000045_000000	train-clean-360	She gathered the child in her arms and held him with his sweet warm lips pressed to her breast and his soft little hand thrust in her bosom David s little son David s little son 
5290_26685_000045_000001	train-clean-360	Surely all was good and well with the world 
5290_26685_000045_000002	train-clean-360	Did not the old man say it was only gossip 
5290_26685_000045_000003	train-clean-360	Had not evil things been said of David even on her own mountain 
5290_26685_000045_000004	train-clean-360	It was the trail of the serpent of ill report 
5290_26685_000045_000005	train-clean-360	He had not confided his sacred secret to these people and they had thought what they pleased 
none	none	Surely he had told his mother about his wife 
5290_26685_000045_000007	train-clean-360	She would go to his mother and wait for his return and there she would bring her precious gift David s little son 
5290_26685_000046_000000	train-clean-360	Quickly she packed her few belongings and rang for a messenger and as she stood an instant waiting for an answer to her ring the white capped nurse she had noticed in the morning passed by with the baby in her arms 
5290_26685_000046_000001	train-clean-360	Yes surely women of David s state did not travel about alone 
none	none	Had she not read in Vanity Fair how Becky Sharp always had her maid 
5290_26685_000046_000003	train-clean-360	And now she was in Vanity Fair and must be wise and not go to David s mother unattended 
5290_26685_000046_000004	train-clean-360	Then too if only she had some one with her to whom she could speak now and then it would be better 
5290_26685_000046_000005	train-clean-360	Therefore without further consideration she walked swiftly down the corridor after the tidy nurse 
5290_26685_000047_000000	train-clean-360	 Will you tell me please have you a sister she said 
5290_26685_000047_000001	train-clean-360	The young woman stood still in astonishment 
5290_26685_000047_000002	train-clean-360	 Or any friend like yourself 
none	none	I I am a stranger from America The look of surprise changed to one of curiosity
5290_26685_000047_000004	train-clean-360	 And it is right hard to go about alone with my baby so I thought I would ask you if you have a sister 
none	none	Is it to the country you wish to go ma m The baby in her arms stirred and the nurse swayed gently back and forth to hush it Yes
5290_26685_000050_000000	train-clean-360	 I couldn t go with you myself ma m but 
none	none	Oh no I didn t mean you I only thought if you had a sister or a friend maybe who could help me for a little while
5290_26685_000052_000000	train-clean-360	 I saw you this morning ma m as you went out 
5290_26685_000052_000001	train-clean-360	I ll see what I can do What number is your room and what name 
5290_26685_000052_000002	train-clean-360	I mustn t talk here 
5290_26685_000052_000003	train-clean-360	missus Darling is very particular 
5290_26685_000053_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh never mind then Cassandra turned away in sudden shame lest she had not done the right thing 
5290_26685_000053_000001	train-clean-360	The nurse watched her return to her room as swiftly as she had left it and took note of the number 
none	none	How very odd said the young woman to herself 
5290_26685_000055_000000	train-clean-360	Cassandra felt more abashed under the round eyed gaze of the maid than if she had encountered the queen 
5290_26685_000055_000001	train-clean-360	Her ring for a messenger had not been answered and she did not know how to find her husband s country seat She felt faint and weary but did not think of hunger nor that it was long past the dinner hour and that she had eaten nothing since her early breakfast 
5290_26685_000055_000002	train-clean-360	She only thought that she must be brave and try try to think how to reach David s people 
none	none	Resolutely she closed her door and dressed her baby carefully then she arrayed herself in the soft silk gown and the wide hat with the heavy plume and then could David have seen her with her courageous eyes and lifted head and the faint color from excitement in her cheeks he would no longer have feared to take her by the hand and lead her to his mother and say She is my wife and the loveliest lady in the land People looked at her as she passed and turned to look again Down wide carpeted stairs she went until she came to a broad landing with recessed windows where were round polished tables and people seated sipping tea and eating thin bread and butter and muffins 
5290_26685_000057_000002	train-clean-360	Then Cassandra knew that she was hungry and sat herself in one of the windows apart before a table 
5290_26685_000057_000003	train-clean-360	Presently a young man came and bent down to her as if listening 
none	none	She looked up at him in bewilderment but at the same instant seeing another young man similarly dressed bearing a tray of muffins and tea to a lady and gentleman near by she said
5290_26685_000058_000000	train-clean-360	 I would like tea please 
none	none	W ot kind ma m She did not care what kind nor know for what to ask only to have something soon so she said
5290_26685_000060_000000	train-clean-360	 I will take what they have 
5290_26685_000061_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes ma m 
none	none	Muffins ma m Yes she replied wearily and turned to gaze out of the window 
5290_26685_000062_000001	train-clean-360	Cabs and carriages were rushing up and down the street below them 
5290_26685_000062_000002	train-clean-360	She placed her little son on the seat beside her and held him with sheltering arm while he watched the moving vehicles and looked from them to his mother s face 
5290_26685_000063_000000	train-clean-360	 What a perfectly lovely child said a pleasant voice 
none	none	Is it a boy How old is he 
5290_26685_000064_000000	train-clean-360	Cassandra looked up to see a rosy cheeked girl a little too stout and florid with a great mop of dark hair tied with a wide black ribbon 
5290_26685_000064_000001	train-clean-360	A gray haired lady followed and paused beside her 
5290_26685_000065_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes said Cassandra faintly 
none	none	He is almost six months old 
5290_26685_000066_000000	train-clean-360	The girl reached over and patted his cheek 
5290_26685_000066_000001	train-clean-360	 How perfectly dear 
none	none	See him mamma 
5290_26685_000066_000003	train-clean-360	Isn t he though 
5290_26685_000067_000000	train-clean-360	 Babies are always dear said the mother with a smile 
5290_26685_000067_000001	train-clean-360	 Come Laura we can t wait you know and they passed on 
5290_26685_000067_000002	train-clean-360	As Cassandra looked up in the mother s face something stirred vaguely in her heart 
none	none	Had she seen her before Possibly so many had paused to speak to her in this casual way since she left home 
5290_26685_000068_000000	train-clean-360	Then her tea and crisp hot muffins were brought 
5290_26685_000068_000001	train-clean-360	The young girl s pleasant words had warmed her heart and the refreshment gave her more courage 
5290_26685_000068_000002	train-clean-360	She made her way to the office and inquired how she might find Lord Thryng s country home 
5290_26685_000068_000003	train-clean-360	The clerk wrote the address promptly on a card but the keen look of interest with which he handed it to her caused her to shrink inwardly 
5290_26685_000068_000004	train-clean-360	Why what was it to him what place she asked for 
5290_26685_000068_000005	train-clean-360	She lifted her head proudly 
none	none	She must not falter
5290_26685_000069_000000	train-clean-360	 I wish to go there 
5290_26685_000069_000001	train-clean-360	Will you tell me how please 
none	none	But the surprise of the clerk was quite natural as she had signed the hotel register the evening before with her whole name giving no thought to it and now he wondered what relation she might be to the family so lately come into the title since she bore the name yet seemed to know so little about them 
5290_26685_000070_000001	train-clean-360	He explained to her courteously almost deferentially 
5290_26685_000071_000000	train-clean-360	 Will you go to Daneshead Castle itself ma m or stop in Queensderry As she had no idea what the question involved she replied at hazard 
none	none	I will stop in Queensderry And her bags were brought down and she was despatched to the right station without more delay CHAPTER XXX IN WHICH CASSANDRA GOES TO QUEENSDERRY AND TAKES A DRIVE IN A PONY CARRIAGE Glad to be borne away from the city and out through fresh green fields and past pretty church spired villages alone in the compartment Cassandra comforted herself with her baby playing with him until he dropped to sleep when she made a bed for him on the car seat with rugs and taking out her purse began to count her remaining resources Her bill at the hotel had appalled her So much to pay to stay only a night What would David say But he had told her to use the money as she liked and now she was here there was nothing else to do Laboriously she computed the amount in English money and reckoned thus her dollars and cents seemed to shrink and vanish Still more than half remained of what she had brought with her and she viewed the matter calmly The shadows fell long over the smooth greensward as she arrived in the village of Queensderry and was driven to a small inn the only house of entertainment in the place She was given a pleasant room overlooking fields and orchards and bright gardens and the sight rested her eyes and still further calmed her troubled heart She would rest to night and to morrow all would be well Never had food tasted better to her than the supper served in her pretty room toast in a silver rack and fresh butter such as David loved and curds and whey and gingerbread and a small jar of marmalade She ate seated in the window looking out over the sweet English landscape in the warm twilight the breeze stirring the white curtains her little son in her lap gurgling and smiling up at her and her heart with David wherever he might be Slowly the dusk veiled all and one star glimmered above the slender church spire A pretty maid brought candles and a book in which she was asked to write her name She was the landlady s daughter and looked wholesome and bright Cassandra glanced in her face as she set the candles down and took up the pen mechanically Mother says will you sign here please Yes Cassandra turned the leaves slowly and read other names and addresses many of them She wrote Cassandra Merlin and paused then making a long dash added simply America and handing back the book and pen turned again to the window Thank you Is that all said the maid lingering Yes said Cassandra again then she laid her baby on the bed and began taking his night clothing from her bag How pretty he is Shan t I help you unpack ma m Cassandra paused looking dreamily before her as if scarcely comprehending then she said Not to night thank you Perhaps to morrow The maid deftly piled the supper dishes and taking them and the book with her departed with a pleasant Good night ma m In spite of her calmness Cassandra lay wakeful and patient and when at last she did sleep it seemed to her she stood with her husband on her father s path looking out under overarching boughs upon blue distances of heaped up mountain tops and David s flute notes silvery sweet were raining down upon her She awoke to discover day was breaking and a pealing of bells from some distant church tower was announcing the fact She gathered her babe to her throbbing heart and thought to day she was to go out and meet her husband s people How should she go How should she conduct herself Should she go at once or wait until the afternoon Why had she not written her name fully in the travellers book What mysterious foreboding had caught her fingers and stayed them at her maiden name Was she afraid When she arose she found herself trembling from head to foot and called for her breakfast before bathing and dressing her little son The same pretty maid brought it and came again while Cassandra bathed and nursed her baby to set the room to rights Shan t I unpack your box for you now ma m And without waiting for a reply she took out Cassandra s clothing pausing now and then to admire and pet the lovely boy Her simple friendliness pleased Cassandra who was minded to ask some of the questions which were burdening her When do people make visits here in the morning or afternoon That depends ma m How do you mean I m a stranger in England you know Yes ma m If they make polite visits they go about tea time ma m But if it s parish visits or on business or on people they know very well they may go in the morning ma m And when is tea time here Why ma m everybody has their tea in the afternoon along four or thereabouts and sees their friends Can I get a carriage here do you know I can get a pony carriage ma m We hires it when we need it only we must speak for it early or it may be taken Oh Then will you please speak for it soon I would like to have it Yes ma m Will you drive yourself ma m or shall I ask for a boy Oh I don t know I can drive but They are gentle ponies ma m Any one can drive them Yes but I don t know the way Yes ma m Where would you like to go ma m To Daneshead Castle The bright cheeked maid opened her round eyes wider and looked at Cassandra with new interest But ma m that is quite far though the ponies are smart too How far is it It s quite a bit away from here ma m you d have to start at two or thereabouts I could take you myself if mother would let me and tell you all the interesting places but the girl looked at her shrewdly a quickly withdrawn glance that depends on how well acquainted you are there ma m Maybe you d like better to have a man drive and just let me go along to mind the baby for you Yes I would said Cassandra gladly Thank you I ll run for the ponies now ma m Cassandra heard her boots clatter rapidly down the wooden stairs at the back of the house and presently saw her dashing across the inn yard bareheaded and with her bare arms rolled in her apron The girl s manner of receiving the statement that she wished to drive to the castle was not lost on Cassandra s sensitive spirit She sat a moment thoughtful and sad then rose and set herself to prepare carefully for the visit In the afternoon Then she might wear the silk gown and lovely hat Once more she tried to arrange her hair as she saw other young women wear theirs and again swept its heavy masses back loosely from her brow and coiled it low as her custom was The landlady s daughter chattered happily as they drove She held the baby on her knee and he played with the blue beads she wore about her neck while Cassandra sat with hands dropped passively in her lap her body leaning a little forward straight and poised as if to move more rapidly along her red lips parted as if listening and waiting and her eyes courteously turning toward the places and objects pointed out to her yet neither seeing nor hearing except vaguely Presently becoming aware that the chatter was about the family at Daneshead Castle her interest suddenly awoke About the old lord how vast his possessions how ancient the family how neglected the castle had been ever since Lady Thryng s death everything allowed to run down even though they were so vastly rich how different everything was now the parsimonious old lord was dead and the new lord had come in and there were once more ladies in the family what a time since there had been a Lady Thryng at Daneshead how much Lady Laura was like her cousin Lyon how reckless she would be if her mother did not hold her with a firm hand and so the chatter ran on The girl enjoyed the distinction of knowing all about the great family and enlightening this stranger from America whose silent attention and occasional monosyllabic replies were sufficient to inspire her friendly efforts to entertain Moreover her curiosity concerning Cassandra and her errand where she was evidently neither expected nor known was piqued and lively and she threw out many tentative remarks to probe if possible the stranger lady s thoughts Have you ever seen Lord Thryng the new lord I mean ma m Yes said Cassandra simply a chill striking to her heart to hear him mentioned thus He s been out here directing the repairs himself and getting the place ready for his mother and Lady Laura but I never saw him They say he s perfectly stunning Quite the lord Is he so very handsome do you think Yes Cassandra looked away from the girl s searching eyes They say he never has married and that is fortunate too for he has lived so long in America and never expecting to come into the title he might have married somebody his own set over here never could have received and that would have been bad wouldn t it Cassandra turned and looked gravely at the girl She wished to stop her but could not think how to do it She could not bear to hear her husband talked over in this way They are tremendous swells Lady Thryng looks high for him and well she may for mother says he s worthy of a princess he s that rich and high bred too for all that he was only a doctor over in America Mother says it s very fortunate he never married some common sort over there They say Lady Thryng wants him to marry Lady Geraldine Temple s daughter She is a great beauty and has a pretty fortune in her own right too They ll be rich enough to entertain the king And they may do it too some day Cassandra sat still and cold She could not stop the girl now Lady Laura s coming out is to be next week so his lordship must be home soon They say it will be a very grand affair And I am to see it all for mother says she will have a maid and I may go out there to serve and I shall see all the decorations and the fine dresses That will be fine won t it baby She untied the blue beads and dangled them before the baby s eyes and he caught at them and gurgled in baby glee Cassandra sat silent rigid and cold unheeding the child or the girl only vaguely hearing the chatter And that will be grand won t it baby But he is a love this boy There is Daneshead Castle now ma m You see it through the trees but the grounds are so large we have to drive a good bit before we are there The driver turned the ponies heads and they scampered through a high stone gateway and along a smooth road which wound through a dense wood with green open spaces interspersed where deer were browsing All was very beautiful and quiet and sweet but Cassandra sitting with wide open eyes gravely beautiful did not see it To the girl everything was delightful She had not the slightest doubt that the American lady was very rich That she travelled so simply and alone was nothing They all did queer things the Americans She was obtusely unconscious that she had been speaking slightingly of them to one of themselves and she talked on after the romantic manner of girls the world over giving the gossip of the inn parlors as she listened to it evening after evening where the affairs of the nobility were freely discussed and enlarged and commented upon with eager interest What was spoken in her ladyship s chamber and Lady Laura s boudoir their half formed plans and aspirations carelessly dropped words and unfinished sentences quickly travelled to the housekeeper s parlor to the servant s table to the haunts of grooms and stable boys to the farmer s daughters and to the public rooms of the Queensderry Inn Thus it was Cassandra heard tales of the brother and sister and mother of her David and of him also How it was said that once he was engaged to a rich tradesman s daughter but had broken it off and gone to America against the wishes of all his family and had become a common practitioner there to the disgust of all his relatives and again Cassandra felt that she had left a sweet and lovely world behind her to step into Vanity Fair She tried to hold fast her faith in goodness and high purpose She was sure sure David had been moved by noble motives why should she not trust him now Did this girl know him better than she his wife Yet in spite of her valiant spirit two facts fell like leaden weights upon her heart David had not told his people that he had a wife and they would be offended that he had tied himself to a common sort over there This David whom she loved was so high above her in the eyes of all his relatives and perhaps even in his own What ah what could she do Might she still hold him in her heart She could not walk in upon them now and betray him never never Her lips grew pale and her head swam but she sat still leaning a little forward in the moving phaeton her hands tightly clasped in her lap and her babe unheeded at her side until the red returned to her lips and again burned in a clearly defined spot against the pallor of her cheek She did not know that a strange unearthly beauty was hers A carriage met them filled with gay people She did not notice them but they gazed at her and turned to look again as they passed I say you know said one of the men as they whirled by There that was Lady Geraldine Temple in that carriage and the young man who stared so hard is her son They ve been paying a visit or maybe they ve brought Lady Clara to stay a bit They say both families are keen for the match and why shouldn t they be Oh they ll entertain the king here some day and then there ll be high times at Daneshead An automobile flashed by them and then another There must be a party here to day or likely it s visitors dropping in now it s getting toward tea time It s all right ma m she added as Cassandra stirred uneasily It must be only visitors or I would have heard of it They re keeping open house now though they don t go anywhere themselves yet You see it s a year since the deaths so they could mourn them all at once and not spin it along They had to wait a year before Lady Laura s coming out rightly Let the ponies walk now driver I beg pardon ma m The girl had so taken possession of Cassandra the baby and the whole expedition that she gave the order unthinkingly Yes let them walk said Cassandra and drew a long breath She heard gay laughter and caught sight through the trees of light dresses and wide plumed hats Some one sat on the terrace at a table whereon was shining silver There I said so That s Lady Clara pouring tea I say but she s a beauty Isn t she No no Go to the front driver American ladies don t call at the side There s a hautomobile there ma m Then wait a moment Don t be a stupid Thus aided by the innkeeper s clever daughter Cassandra at last made her entrance properly and was guided to the presence of David s mother who had not joined her guests having but just closed an interview with mister Stretton As she saw Cassandra standing in the drawing room waiting her Lady Thryng came graciously forward The lovely August weather had tempted every one out of doors and the great room was left empty save for these two David s mother and his wife The beauty of other worldliness which had infused Cassandra s whole being as she fought her silent battle during the long drive still enveloped her If she could have followed her impulses she would have held out both hands and cried Take me and love me I am David s wife But she would not she must not Her heritage of faith in goodness both of God and man kept her heart open and gave her power to think and act rightly in this her hour of terrible trial even as a little child being behind the veil which separates the soul from God may in its innocent prattle utter words of superhuman wisdom I am sorry if I have interrupted you when you have company she said slowly I am a stranger an American Ah you Americans are a happy lot and may go where you please Take this seat by the window it is very warm My son has been in America but he tells us so little we are none the wiser for that about your part of the world I knew him in America That is why I called Yes The mother bent forward and regarded her curiously attentively He lived very near us He did a great deal of good among the poor She put her hand to her slender white throat then dropped it again in her lap Then looking in Lady Thryng s eyes she said I have seen your picture I should have known you from that but you are more beautiful Oh That can hardly be my dear It was taken many years ago you know Yes he said so his lordship only there we called him Doctah Thryng A shadow flitted over the mother s face He was a practitioner over there never in England That is a pity it is such noble work But perhaps he has other things to do here He has even more noble work than the practice of medicine What does he do here asked Cassandra in a low voice He must take part in the affairs of government Very ordinary men may study and practise medicine but unless men who are wise and are nobly born and bred make it their business to care for the affairs of their country the nation would soon be wrecked That is what saves England and makes her great I see Cassandra sat silent then and Lady Thryng waited expectantly for her errand to be declared curious about this beautiful young creature who had stepped into her home unannounced from out of the unknown yet graciously kindly and unhurried I think I know With us men are too careless They think it isn t necessary I suppose Again she paused with parted lips as if she would speak on but could not With you men are too busy making money I am told It is necessary to have a leisure class like ours Oh Cassandra caught her breath and smiled She was thinking of the silver pot her mother had enjoined her to take with her and why But we do think a great deal of family even the simplest of us care for that although we have no leisure class only the loafers I m afraid you think it very strange I should come to you in this way but I thought I would like to see Doctah Thryng again and when I heard he was not in England I thought I would come to you and bring the messages from those who loved him when he was with us But I mustn t stop now and take your time I ll write them instead only that wouldn t be like seeing him He stayed a whole year at our place And you came from Canada Oh no A long way from there My home is in North Carolina Oh indeed How very interesting That must have been when he was so ill Then noticing Cassandra s extreme pallor she begged her most kindly to come out on the terrace and have tea but she would not She felt her fortitude giving way and knew she must hasten But you must you know The heat and your long ride have made you faint I I m afraid so It won t last Wait then You must take a little wine you need it Roused to sympathy Lady Thryng left her a moment and returned immediately with a glass of wine which she held to her lips with her own hand There you will soon be better Here is a fan It really is very warm Indeed you must have tea before you go She took her passive hand and led her out on the terrace unresisting and again Cassandra was minded to throw her arms about the lovely woman s neck who was so sweet and kind and sob on her bosom and tell her all but David had his own reasons and she would not Do you stay long in England I am going to morrow Oh she exclaimed as they stepped out and she saw the number of elaborately dressed guests moving about and gayly chatting and laughing I can t go out there I am a strangah It was a low melancholy wail as she said it and long afterward Lady Thryng remembered that moaning cry I am a strangah No no You are an American and a very beautiful one Come they will be glad to meet you Give me your name again Thank you but I must must go back Suddenly with a cry My baby he is mine she swept forward with long swinging steps toward a group who were bending over a rosy cheeked girl who was seated on the steps of the terrace with a child in her arms She was comforting him and cuddling and petting him and those around her were exclaiming as young girls will Isn t he a dear Oh let me hold him a moment There he is going to cry again No wonder poor little chap Oh look at his curls so cunning give him to me Seeing his mother he put up his arms to her and smiled while two tears rolled down his round baby cheeks I found him in the pony carriage with Hetty Giles and he was crying so and such a darling I just took him away the love cried Laura Why we saw you yesterday at the Victoria I could not pass him by you remember The baby one beaming smile nestled his face bashfully in his mother s neck and patted her cheek glancing sidewise at his admirers through brimming tears while Cassandra her eyes large and pathetic turned now on Laura now on her mother stood silent quivering like one of her own mountain creatures brought to bay But she was strengthened as she felt her baby again in her arms and as she stood thus looking about her every one became silent and she was constrained to speak She did not know that something in her manner and appearance had commanded silence something tragic despairing It was but for an instant then she turned to Lady Laura Illustration Cassandra stood silent quivering like one of her own mountain creatures brought to bay Page two hundred eighty six Thank you for comforting him I ought not to have left him I nevah did before with strangahs She tried to bid Lady Thryng good by but Laura again besought her to stop and have tea Please do I fairly adore Americans I want to talk to you I mean to hear you talk Cassandra had mastered herself at last and replied quietly I don t guess I can stay thank you You have been so kind Then she said to Lady Thryng Good by and moved away Laura walked by her side to the carriage I hope you ll come again sometime and let me know you You are right kind to say that I shall nevah forget Then leaning down from the carriage seat and looking steadily in Laura s warm dark eyes she added No I shall nevah forget May I kiss you You sweet thing said the girl impulsively and reaching up they kissed Cassandra said in her heart For David and was driven away Laura found her mother standing where they had left her She had been deeply stirred by the sight of Cassandra with the child in her arms Not that beautiful mothers and lovely children were rare in England but that except for the children of the poor no little one like this had been in her own home or so near her in all the years of her widowhood It was the sight of that strong mother love overpowering and sweeping all before it recognizing no lesser call the secret and holy power that lies in the Christ mother for all periods and all peoples she herself had felt it and the cry that had burst from Cassandra s lips My baby he is mine Tears stood in Lady Thryng s eyes and yet it was such a simple little thing Mothers and babies Why they were everywhere She moved like a tragic queen said Lady Clara What was the matter Nothing only her baby had been crying but wasn t he a love said Lady Laura I say He was a perfect dear said one and another I don t care much for babies said Lady Clara They ought to be trained to stay with their nurses and not cry after their mammas like that Fancy having to take such a child around with one everywhere even in making a formal call you know Isn t it absurd American women spoil their children dreadfully I have heard CHAPTER XXXI IN WHICH DAVID AND HIS MOTHER DO NOT AGREE The day after Cassandra s flight from Queensderry David returned Although greatly prolonged his African expedition had been successful and he was pleased He had improved his opportunities to learn political conditions and know what might best advance England s power in that remote portion of her possessions mister Stretton had informed him that he might soon be called to a seat in the House and he was glad to be in a measure prepared to hold opinions of his own on a few at least of the vital issues Canada he already knew well and to be conversant also with the state of affairs in South Africa gave him greater confidence The first afternoon of his return he spent in looking over the changes which had been in progress at Daneshead during his absence In spite of his weariness he seemed buoyant and gay more so his mother thought than at any time since his return from America She said nothing about the episode of Cassandra s call possibly for the time it was forgotten but as they parted for the night when they were alone together Lady Thryng again broached to her son the subject of his marriage We have had a visit from Lady Clara Temple she said David lay upon a divan with his hands clasped beneath his head and the light from a reading lamp streamed upon his sunny hair which always looked as if some playful breeze had just lifted it His whole frame had the sinewy appearance of energy and power His mother s heart swelled with love and pride as she looked at his smiling thoughtful face and down upon his lean strong body that in its lassitude expressed the vigor of a splendid animal at rest Still more would she have given thanks for the restoration of this beloved son could she have been able to contrast his present state with his condition when ill and discouraged he had gone to the lonely log cabin in a wilderness struggling to build up both body and spirit far from the sympathy and fellowship of his own Now she thrilled with the thought of what he might achieve if only he would but her heart misgave her that he still held some strange notions of life She thought the surest way to control his quixotic impulses was to provide him with a good practical wife one who would see the world as it is and accept conditions that are stable not trying to move mountains yet with sufficient ambition for both her husband and herself With a wife and children a man could not afford to be erratic What were you saying mother What were you thinking David that you did not hear me I am telling you we have just had a very delightful visit from Lady Clara Temple and Lady Temple and her son have called David made no reply He seemed to think the remark called for none Well David Well mother and then I think I will go to bed I am rarely tired and bed is the place for me He kissed his mother then took hold of her chin and lifted her face to look in his eyes What is it little mother what is it he asked gayly and obtusely Aren t you a bit stupid David not to see I wish I do wish you could care for Lady Clara She really is charming I do care for her as Lady Clara Temple She is charming and as you say of me a bit stupid What has Laura been doing these two months Preparing for her coming out after her own fashion We ve been a good deal in town but she has a reckless way of doing anything she pleases quite regardless She is a big hearted fine lass mother Don t let her ways trouble you She needs the right influence and Lady Clara seems to exert it over her at least I think she will in time Ah very good let her I won t interfere Good night little mother sleep well If I am late in the morning don t be annoyed I ve had three wakeful nights The sea was very rough David Lady Thryng placed her hands on his shoulders and held him looking in his eyes Marry Lady Clara You are worthy of a princess my son You can afford to be ambitious The day may come when you can entertain the king Now really mother I ll entertain the king with pleasure He s a fine old chap A little gay you know but quite the right sort But Lady Clara is a step too high She d rub it into me some day that I d married above my station you know Good night Dream of the king mother but not of Lady Clara He sought his bed and was soon soundly sleeping content with the thought that next week he would sail for America and have Laura s coming out postponed The family festivity was following too closely on the year of mourning at any rate The announcement that he already had a penniless American wife would naturally be a blow to them all the more so if his mother was seriously cherishing such hopes as she had expressed but he couldn t be a cad His conscience smote him that his conduct already bordered closely on the caddish but to be an out and out cad no no When he awoke late as he had said but refreshed and jubilant the revelation he must make seemed to him less formidable and he was minded to make it with no more delay as he tossed over his mail while breakfasting in his room Ah what is this A letter in his wife s hand bearing the Liverpool postmark Was she on her way to him then Good God He tore off the cover hastily but sat a moment with bowed head his hand over his eyes before reading it MY DEAR DAVID My husband forgive me I have done wrong but I meant to do right They said words of you on our mountain David words I hated and I lied to them and came to you I told them you had sent for me I did it to prove to them that what they were saying was not true I took the money you gave me and came to England and now God has punished me and I am going back I know you will be surprised when I tell you how wrong I have been I would not write you I had borne you a little son because I did not want you to come back to America for his sake but for mine My heart was that proud Oh David forgive me David s face grew pale and the paper trembled in his hand but he read eagerly on My heart cries to you all the time He is yours David forgive me He is very beautiful He is like you Your sister held him in her arms and I kissed her for love of you but she did not know why She did not guess the beautiful baby was yours your very own Your mother saw him but she did not guess he was hers her little grandson I took him away quickly They might have kept him if they knew You will let me have him a little longer won t you David When he is older you will have to take him home and educate him but now now he is all I have of you Soon the terrible ocean will be between us again It will be just the same in your home now as if I had never come I did not say I was your wife for you had not and I would not tell them I want you to know this so nothing will be changed by me In London before I knew when I thought you were there when I did not understand I wrote my name in the hotel book but in Queensderry something in my heart stopped me and I only wrote my old name Cassandra Merlin I must have been beginning to understand David paused and dashed the tears from his eyes Poor little heart Poor little heart he cried He paced the room then tried to read again The letters blurred by his tears seemed to dance about and run together Now I see it all clearly David and after a little God will help me to live on the happiness you brought me in our sweet year together There was happiness for a lifetime in that year Comfort your heart with that thought when you think of me and do not be too sad Oh David I did not know that to save me from marrying Frale and living a life worse than death you sacrificed yourself But you did not need to do it After knowing you and after doing what he did to you I never could have married him I only knew you came to me and saved me from the terrible life I might have led and I took you as from God I have seen the beautiful lady you should have married and I don t know what to do nor how to give you back to yourself I suppose there may be a way but we have made our vows to each other before God and we must do no sin My heart is heavy I would give you all all but I can t take back the love I gave you I could die to set you free again for in that way I could keep the blessed love which is part of my soul in heaven with me only for our little son My life is his now too and I have no right to die not yet even to set you free Oh David David This must be the shadow I saw clouding our long path of light In some terrible way it has been laid on me to do you a wrong in the eyes of your family and all your world Your mother told me you had work to do for your country great and glorious work I believe it and you must do it and not let an ignorant mountain girl stand in your way Oh I can t think it out to night When I try to see a way I can t The visions are lost to my eyes and they may never come again The windows of my soul are clouded and the clear seeing is gone because David I know it is myself that comes between I can only cry to you now to forgive me Don t let me mar your great good life Don t try to come back to me Stay on and live your life and do your work and I will keep your little son safe for you and teach him to love you and call you father and he shall be called David He has no name yet I was waiting for you It will only be a little while before he will need you then you may take him Your mother and sister will love him He will be a great boy full of laughter and light like you David and then your mountain girl wife will be gone and your sacrifice at an end and your reward will come at last I will go back and stay quietly where I belong Don t send me any more money I have enough to take me home and I can earn all we need after that Earning will help me by giving me something to do for our baby and so for you Sometimes I will send you word that all is well with him but do not write to me any more It will be easier for you so and don t let your heart be too much troubled for me David It will interfere with your power and usefulness in your own world Grieving is like fire set to a great tree It burns the heart out of it first and leaves the rest A man must not be like that With a woman it is different Be glad that you did save me and brought me all these months of sweet sweet happiness I will live on the remembrance People have to bear the separation of death and we will call the ocean that divides us Death for our two worlds are divided by it I sail to morrow You took me into your heart to save me and now David my love I go out of your heart to save you and give you back to your own life Some day the cords that bind us to each other the cords our vows have made will part and set you free Good by good by David my heart David my love David David good by CASSANDRA MERLIN For a long instant David sat with the letter crushed in his hand then suddenly awoke to energetic action To day When does the boat leave Good God there may be time He rang for a servant and began tossing his clothing together Curses on me for a cad a boor a lout Why did I leave my mail until this morning and then oversleep Clark he said as the man appeared tell Hicks to bring the machine around immediately then come for my bag Beg pardon but the machine s out of order my lord and her ladyship s just going out in the carriage Why is it out of order Hicks is a fool Ask Lady Thryng to wait No pack my bag and send my boxes on after me as they are I ll speak to her myself He threw off his jacket thrust his cap in his pocket and dashed away pulling on his coat as he went holding the crushed pages of the letter in his hand He overtook his mother as she was walking down the terrace Mother wait he cried I m going with you Where s Laura She was coming I can t think what is delaying her David hurried on to the carriage Get in mother I ll take her place Get in get in We must be off David are you out of your head Yes mother Drive on drive on I must catch the first train for Liverpool I may catch it Put the horses through John Make them sweat he said leaning out of the carriage window Explain yourself David Are you in trouble Yes mother Wait a little She looked at her son and saw his mouth set his eyes stern and anguished and she placed her hand gently on his as they were being whirled away Your bags are not in David if you are going a journey Clark will follow with them and I can wait in Liverpool if I can only catch this boat David explain If you can t then let me read this she pleaded touching the letter in his hand but he clutched it the tighter No one may read this not even you He pressed the crumpled sheets to his lips then folded them carefully away It s just that I ve been a cad a fiendish cad and an idiot in one I thought myself a man of high ideals My God I am a cad David you sacrificed yourself to ideals but you are still a boy and have much to learn When men try to set new laws for themselves and get out of the ordinary they are more than apt to make fools of themselves and may do positive harm What is it now Can t you get over the ground any faster John he cried thrusting his head again out of the window These horses are overfed and lazy like all the English people Why was the machine out of order Hicks is a fool I say He put his hand inside his collar and pulled and worked it loose We are all hidebound here Even our clothes choke us David tell me the truth I am telling you the truth I am a cad I say And you you too are a part of the system that makes cads of us all I am your mother David said Lady Thryng reprovingly You have reason to be proud of your son Oh curse me I won t be more of a cad than I am now by laying the blame on you I could have helped it but you couldn t We are born and bred that way over here The petty lines of distinction our ancestors drew for us we bow down and worship them and say God drew them Over here a man hides the sun with his own hand and then cries out Where is it I would comfort you if I could but this sounds very much like ranting I thought you had outlived that sort of thing my son Thank God no I ve been very hard pressed of late but I ve not outlived it You will tell me this trouble now before you leave me You must dear boy He took the hand she put out to him and held it in silence then incoherently in a voice humbled and low almost lost in the rumbling of the carriage he told her It was a revelation of the soul and as the mother listened she too suffered and wept but did not relent Cassandra s cry I am a strangah sounded in her ears but her sorrow was for her son Yes she was a stranger and had wisely taken herself back to her own place what else could she do Was it not in the nature of a Providence that David had been delayed until after her departure The duty now devolved upon herself to comfort him without further reproof but nevertheless to make him see and do his duty in the position he had been called to fill Of course she has charm David and evidently good sense as well How do you mean To perceive the inevitable and return without fuss or complaint to her own station in life For an instant he sat stunned and ere he could give utterance to his rage she resumed Naturally marriage now in your own class can t be you ll simply have to live as a bachelor David groaned Why my son many do of their own choice and you have managed to be happy during this year He glanced at his watch Eleven o clock can t There s no use urging the horses so we can t make it We may mother we may He half rose as if he would leap from the vehicle I could go faster on foot There s a quarter of an hour yet before the Liverpool express John can t we get on faster than this No my lord One of the orses has picked up a stone If you ll old em I ll dig it out in alf a minute my lord David sprang out and took the reins Where s the footman he asked testily You left im behind my lord He was elping Lady Laura cut roses David this is useless The last train from London went through an hour ago and we haven t ten minutes for the next Order him to return and we ll consider calmly David laughed bitterly and only sprang into the coach and shut the door with a crash Drive on John he shouted through the window and again they were off at a mad gallop His mother turned and looked at him astounded Let me read what she has written you my son she implored half frightened at his frenzy It s of no use for you to read it We can t talk now not rationally Then tell him not to drive so furiously so we can hear each other I would avoid useless discussion mother but you force it An instant he paused and his teeth ground together and his jaw set rigidly then he continued with a savage force that appalled her throwing out short sentences like daggers Lord H brings home an American wife His family are well pleased She is every where received Her father is a rich brewer Her brother has turned out his millions from the business of pork packing The stench from his establishment pollutes miles of country but does not reach England why Because of the disinfectant process of transmuting their greasy American dollars into golden English sovereigns There s justice Be reasonable David Their estates were involved to the last degree and those sovereigns saved the family Without them they would have passed out of their possession utterly and been divided among our rich tradespeople and the family would have descended rapidly to the undergrades It goes to show the value of birth what is more and how those Americans who made a pretence long ago of scorning birth and title and casting it all off are glad enough now to buy their way back again if not for themselves for their children But David for a man to voluntarily degrade his family by marrying beneath him with no such need as that of Lord H of ultimately by that very means lifting it up is is inexpressible why In the case of Lord H there was a certain nobility in marrying beneath him Beneath him For me I married above me over all of us when I took my sweet clean mountain girl The nobility of Lord H is unique Lady H made a poor bargain when she left the mingled stenches of brewing and butchering to step into the moral stench which depleted the Stonebreck estates You are not like my son David You are violent Your son has been a cad Now he is a man and must either be violent or weep He looked away from her out at the flying hedgerows then took up the fruitless discussion again striving with more patience to arouse in his mother a sense of the utter worldliness of her stand She met him at every point with the obtuse and age long arguments of her class When at last he cried out But what of my son mother my little son and the heir to all this grandeur which means so much to you Her eyelids quivered and she looked down merely saying His mother has offered you a solution to that difficulty which seems to me the only wise one You say she proposes to keep him a year or two and then send him to us Ah you are like steel mother David spoke pleadingly You thought him a beautiful child I did and a wholesome one which goes to show that you may safely trust him with her for a time Moreover his mother has a right to him and the comfort she may find in him for a few years You see I would be quite just to her I do not accuse her of being designing in marrying you No doubt it was quite your own fault It is a position you two young people rushed into romantically and most foolishly and you must both suffer the consequences It is sad but it must be regarded in the light of hard common sense and my ungrateful task seems to be to place it in that light for both your sakes Still David watched the hedgerows with averted face You are listening David Yes mother yes Common sense you said Can t you see that to bring her here where she does not belong where she never will be received as belonging even though she is your wife will only cause suffering to you both Eventually misunderstandings will arise then will come alienation and unhappiness Then again yours must be in a measure a public life unless you mean to shirk responsibility Has your country no claim on you I have no thought of shirking my duty and am prepared to think and act also You wish it to be effective Has it never occurred to you how your avenues will be cut off if you marry a wife beneath your class What in God s name will my wife have to do with England s African policy Damme David Mother I beg your pardon She may have everything to do with it No man can stand alone and foist his ideas upon such a body of men without backing Instead of hampering yourself with an ignorant mountain girl from America you should have allied yourself to a strong family of position here if you would be a power in England What sort of a Lady Thryng will your present wife make What kind of a leader socially in your own class You might better try to place a girl from the bogs of Ireland at the head of your table Again David s rage surged through him in a hot wave but he controlled himself You admitted Cassandra has both beauty and charm Would my son have been attracted to her else Nevertheless what I say stands As a help to you You have done your duty mother I will say this for you that for sophistry undiluted a woman of the present day who stands where you do can out Greek the ancients How is it we see so differently Is it that I am like my father How did he see things Your father was as much a nobleman as your uncle Only by the accident of birth was he differently placed Did I never tell you that but for his death he would have been created bishop of his diocese So you see I see By dying he just escaped a bishopric Did it make a difference in his reception up above do you think Oh David David I m sorry mother never mind We re nearly there and I have something I must say to you before I leave you to end this discussion forever There are two kinds of men in this world one sort is made by his circumstances and the other makes his circumstances You would respect your son more if he belonged to the first variety but I tell you no I will make my own conditions Before all else I am a man My lordship was thrust upon me Don t interrupt I beg I know all you would say but you do not know all I would say My birth gave it to me certainly but a cruel and bloody war was the means by which it came to me Very well I will take it and the responsibility which it entails but the cruelty that brought me my title is ended and in no form shall it be continued social or otherwise I hold to the rights of my manhood I will bring to England whom I please as my wife and my world shall recognize her and you will receive her because I bring her and because she will stand head and soul above any one you have here to propose for me Here we are mother dear One kiss Thank you thank you Postpone Laura s coming out until I return which will be when you know He leaped from the carriage before it had time to halt and ran but alas baffled and enraged at his ill success he stood on the platform and watched the train pull out It was only a slow local puffing away there Liverpool express left five minutes ago my lord said the guard His mother leaned out watching him with sad yet eager eyes satisfied that it should be so He might return now and there was by no means an end to her opposition CHAPTER XXXII IN WHICH CASSANDRA BRINGS THE HEIR OF DANESHEAD CASTLE BACK TO HER HILLTOP AND THE SHADOW LIFTS Cassandry Merlin whar did you drap from cried the Widow Farwell as she looked up from the supper she was preparing at the great fireplace and saw her daughter in the doorway with her baby Her old face radiated light and warmth and love as she took them both in her arms Whar s David Cassandra smiled wearily returning her mother s kiss and yielding her the baby You ll have to be satisfied with me and little son mother David was still in Africa so I came home again She spoke as if a trip to England were a casual little matter and this was all the explanation she gave that night I got the hotel carriage to bring me up from the station The mother with quaint simplicity accepted it asking no troublesome questions If David was not there why should not her daughter return After their supper together in the warm starlit evening each member of the family carrying something for the traveller s comfort they all climbed up to Cassandra s cabin and the old life began as if it had suffered no interruption Cassandra so filled the pauses with questions of all that had happened during her absence that it was only after her mother was in bed and dropping off to sleep she remembered questions of her own that had been unasked or left unanswered The next day Cassandra pleaded weariness and stayed in her cabin sending Martha down for her necessary supplies and quietly occupying herself with setting her simple home in its accustomed order The day after she spent overlooking the little farm with Cotton and hearing from him all about the animals The cows two little calves Frale s colt and her own filly and how some ol houn dog had got into the sheep pen and killed the mother sheep and Marthy had brought the twin lambs up by hand And while Cassandra busied herself thus the widow kept charge of the little grandson warming her heart with his baby ways petting him and solacing herself for his long absence Thus the first days were lived through and no further explanation made for something held Cassandra silent in a strange waiting suspense It was not hope for she felt that she had taken a stand which was conclusive and there was nothing more for which to hope What else could she do and what could David do The conditions were made for them each must bide in his own world and she had named the ocean which divided them Death At night she did not weep for weeping made her ill and she must conserve her strength for her little son so she lay staring out at the stars Sometimes she found herself holding her breath and listening half lifting her head from her pillow but listening for what Then she would lean over her baby s cradle and hear his soft breathing trying to make herself think she was listening for that and not for David s step Then she would lie back and try again to sleep and her heart would cry to God to give her peace and let her rest So the long nights passed tearlessly and sleeplessly On the boat she had slept lulled by its rocking and swaying but here in her home in her accustomed routine sleep had fled and old thoughts and dreams came like the dead to haunt her The paleness which had come upon her in London and which the sea breeze had supplanted with fleeting roses returned and she moved about looking as if only her wraith had come back to its old haunts On the third day after Cassandra s return David found himself climbing the laurel path a far different man from the one who two years before had slowly and wearily toiled up to the little house of logs which was to be his shelter With strong free step and heart uplifted and glad he now climbed that winding path He had conquered the ills of his body and his spirit had lived and loved and he had learned to know happiness from its counterfeit He had gone out and seen men chasing phantoms and shadows thinking therein to find joy joy the need of the world one in a coronet one in a crown and the beggar in a golden sovereign while he he had found it in his own heart and in Cassandra s eyes David had passed the Fall Place seeing no one for the widow had ridden over to spend the day with Sally Carew her niece was in the spring house skimming cream while Cotton was dawdling in the corn patch whistling and pulling the ripened ears from the stalks A cool breeze had dispelled the heat of the September afternoon and the hills were already beginning to don their gorgeous apparel after the summer s drouth their wonderful beauty struck him anew and steeped his senses with their charm If only all was well with his wife his wife and his little son His heart beat so madly as he neared the thicket of laurel where once he had stood to watch her moving about his cabin that he was forced to pause and again he saw her standing in her homespun dress strongly relieved against the whiteness of the canvas room beyond but this time not alone Ah not alone Holding his little son in her arms her body swaying with rhythmic motion lulling him to drowsiness and sleep she stooped to lay him in the rude little cradle box David trembled as he watched and dashed the tears from his eyes but could not move to break too soon this breathless poignant spell of gladness Suddenly he could wait no longer but his feet clung to the earth when he would move and his mouth went dry Ah could he never reach her He stood holding out his arms when oh wonder of wonders she raised herself and stood as if listening then moving swiftly walked from the cabin and came to him as if she had heard him call although he had made no sound her arms outstretched to him as were his to her She did not cry out but with parted lips and radiant glowing face fled to him and was clasped to his heart She could feel its beating against her breast and his silence spoke to her through his eyes which saw not her face but her soul his lips brought the roses to her cheeks as the sea breezes had done roses that came and fled and came again until at last it was Cassandra who spoke first I want you to see him David Yes yes my wife was all he said his eyes on hers but he did not move I want you to see our little son David A strange pang shot through his heart Still he stood holding her and marvelling at himself What Was it that this young usurper had stolen into his place Love is selfish dear Let me recover from one joy before you overwhelm me with another First I must have my own and know that it is all mine I don t understand David I can t wait Oh David David You turn my name to music with your tones lingering over it I had forgotten how sweet it was But I don t understand David Come and see him And as she drew him forward they moved as one being not two No you don t understand thank God But I will teach you something you never knew Love is not only blind dearest he is a greedy selfish little god Then she laughed happily holding him at arm s length and looking in his eyes I know it I know it I found it out all by myself Didn t I tell you in my letter Oh David so was I She drew him to her again and nestled her face in his bosom I was jealous of our little son I wanted you David Oh I wanted you At last came the tears the blessed human tears which she had held back so long But now they did no harm except to drench her husband s gray tie and they brought a lovely flush to her face I can t stop David I can t stop I haven t cried for so long and now I can t stop Sweetheart don t try to stop Cry it all out Wash the stains from me of the cruel old world where I have been cleanse me so that I may see as clearly as you see but you would have to cry forever to do that wouldn t you sweet And soon you must laugh again He clasped and comforted her as she was used to comfort her baby soothing her and drying her eyes with his own handkerchief Yours isn t large enough for such a flood is it sweet No a a and I I can can t find mine she sobbed I I left it tucked under baby s chin and now I ve spoiled your pretty gray tie Bless you They are my tears and it is my tie David He is crying hark Helping his mother is he Come then his father will comfort him Hear him Isn t it a sweet little cry David She smiled at him from under tear wet lashes Why bless you again Yours was a sweet little cry They went in and he bent over the odd little cradle and lifted the child tenderly from its soft nest The wailing ceased and the fatherhood awoke in him and laughed with joy as he held the warm little body to his heart wherein now he knew lay the key of life the complete and rounded love God s gift to man to be cherished when found and fought for and held in the holy of holies of his own soul He isn t afraid you see David How he stares at you Does he feel it in his own little heart that you are his father I have whispered it to him a thousand thousand times Sit here with him David and I ll make you some tea She busied herself with the tea things the old life beginning anew with a new interest I always make it just as you taught me that first day when I came up here so choked with trouble I couldn t speak You always brought me good David He saw as he watched her that some new and subtile charm had been added to her personality Was it motherhood that had given it to her or the long year of patient waiting and trusting or had she passed through depths of which he as yet knew nothing to cause this evanescent breath of pathos He felt and knew it was all of these What must she have endured as she wrote that letter David fell easily and happily into his life on the mountain again not the English lord but the vital human being the man in splendid possession of himself and his impulses holding sacred his rights as a man not to be coerced by custom or bound by any chains save those he himself had forged to bind his heart before God For a time he would not allow himself to think of the future preferring to live thus with the world completely shut away Buoyantly jubilantly he tramped the hills and visited the homes where he had been wont to bring help and often comforts and found himself therein lauded and idolized as few of his station ever are Again he was Doctah Thryng and the love that accompanied the title in the hearts of those mountain people was regal He enjoyed his little farm and the gathering of his first crap counting his bundles of fodder and his bushels of corn Sometimes he rode with Cassandra visiting the old haunts at such times David insisted that the boy be left with the grandmother or that Martha should come up to mind him that he might have his wife free and quite to himself as in their first days But all this time although silent about it Cassandra kept in her heart the thought of David s real state She felt he was playing a part to bring her joy and was grateful but she knew he must return to his own world and live his own life Therefore she existed in a state of breathless suspense to enjoy these moments to the fullest not to miss or mar an instant of the blessed time while it lasted The days were flying flying so rapidly she dared not think and here was splendid October trailing her wonderful draperies over the hills like a lavish princess When would David speak But perhaps he was waiting for her to speak first If so how long ought she to remain silent Often he caught the wistful look in her eyes and half divined the meaning One day when they had wandered up her father s path and the wind came in warm soft gusts sweeping over the miles of splendor from the sea David drew her to him determined to win from her a full expression What is it Cassandra Open your heart Don t shut anything away from me What have you been dreaming lately You have never said a word of fault with me yet David for what I did going away off there and not waiting quietly until you could come back as you wrote me to do That was the bravest finest thing you ever did but one He was thinking of her renunciation You are so good to forgive me David In one way it was better that I went because it made me understand as I never could have done otherwise You would never have told me but now I know Unfold a little of this wisdom so I may judge of its value Can you David I m afraid not You have a way of bewildering me so I can t see the rights and wrongs of things myself But there It is just part of the difference Why even the nursemaids over there and Hetty Giles the landlady s daughter are wiser than I I came to see it every instant the difference between you and me between our two worlds David how did you ever dare marry me He only laughed happily and kissed her Tell it all he said tenderly I felt it first when I went to the town house It was hard to find the address I only had mister Stretton s David set his teeth grimly in anger at himself at giving her only his lawyer s address in stupid fear lest her letters betray him to his mother and sister Now do not hide one thing from me not one he said sternly and she continued with a conscientious fear of disobedience to open her heart I saw by the look in the old man s eyes that I had not done the right thing coming in that way with a baby in my arms like a beggar I saw he was very curious and I was that proud I didn t know what to tell him I had come for when I found you were not there so when he said artists often came to see the gallery I said I had come to see the gallery and David I didn t even know what a gallery was I thought it was a high piazza around a house and I found it was a great room full of pictures I was that ignorant I felt like I was some wild creature that had got lost in that splendid palace and didn t know where to run to get away and they all fixed their eyes on me as if they were saying How does she dare come here She isn t one of us and one was a boy who looked like you The old man kept saying how like it was to the new Lord Thryng and it made me cold to hear it so cold that after I had escaped from there and was out in the sun my teeth chattered David sat silent and humbled at last he said Go on Cassandra Don t cover up anything When I got back to the hotel everything seemed so splendid and stuffy and horrid and every way I turned it seemed as if those dead ancestors of yours were there staring at me still and I thought what right had they over the living that they dared stand between you and me and I was angry She stirred in his arms and pressed closer to him David forgive me I can t tell it over it hurts me Go on he said hoarsely The old man told me what was expected of you because of them how your mother wished you to marry a great lady and I knew they could never have heard of me and I forgot to eat my dinner and stayed in my room and fought and fought with myself I m sorry I felt that way David Don t mind I understand now She put up her hand and touched his cheek and he took it in his and kissed it Then she laughed a sad little laugh Remember that funny little old silver teapot Mother brought it to me before I left and I took it with me She is so proud of our family although she has only that poor little pot to show for it with its nose all melted off to make silver bullets sure to kill Did you know it was one of those bullets Frale tried to kill you with Oh David David And yet your mother is right dear That little wrecked bit of silver helps to interpret you indicates your ancestors how you come to be you just as you are How could I ever have loved you if you had been different from what you are For a long moment she lay still scarcely breathing then she lifted her head and looked in his eyes One of her silences was on her and while her lips trembled as if to speak she said no word He tried to draw her to him again but she held him off Then tell me what it is he said gently But she only shook her head and rose to walk away from him He did not try to call her back to him respecting her silence and she moved on up the path with long swift steps When she returned he held out his arms to her but she stood before him looking down into his eyes I couldn t tell you sitting there with your arms around me David and what I have to say must be said now I may never be strong enough to say it another time and it must be said Then she told him all that had occurred while she was in Queensderry from the moment she came going down into her heart and revealing the hidden thoughts never before expressed even to herself while he gazed back into her eyes fascinated by her spiritual beauty which was her power She told of the chatter of Hetty Giles and how she had pointed out the beautiful lady his mother wished him to marry and how slowly everything had dawned upon her the real differences Of the guests she had seen on the Daneshead terrace and how they wore such lovely dresses and moved so easily and laughed and talked all at once as if they were used to it all and perhaps wore such charming things for every day the wonderful colors and wide beautiful hats with plumes and how even the servants wore pretty clothes and went about as if they all knew how to do things passing cups and plates Then she told of her talk with his mother and how carefully she had guarded her tongue lest a word escape her he would rather not have had her speak I had wronged you in not telling you you had a son and I meant to leave him with your mother so he could be raised right She paused and put her hand to her throat then went bravely on Your mother was kind she gave me wine she brought it to me herself I knew what I ought to do but I wasn t strong enough It seemed as if something here in my breast was bleeding and my baby would die if I did it When I came out he was in your sister s arms and had been crying and it seemed as if all I had planned had happened and I took him and carried him away quickly I couldn t go fast enough and I left the inn that night The world seemed all like Vanity Fair David rose and stood before her looking down into her eyes He could not control his voice in speaking and she felt his hands quiver as they rested on her shoulders When did you read that book Cassandra Where did you find it he asked in dismay Among your books in the cabin I felt at first that it must be a kind of a disgrace to be a lord as if every one who had a title or education must be mean and low and all the rest of the world over there must be fools but because of you David I knew better than to believe that Your mother is not like those women either She was kind and beautiful and I loved her but all the more I saw the difference But now you have come to me and made me strong I can do it Everything has grown clear to me again and I see how you gave yourself to me to save me when you did not dream of what was to be for you in the future and out of your giving has come the little son and he is yours Wait Don t take me in your arms She placed her hands on his breast and held him from her So it was just now when you spoke as if people would understand me better because of that little silver pot showing I had somewhere in the past a name and a family like theirs over there I thought of Vanity Fair and I hated it I wish you had never seen it There is nor has been nothing on earth to make me possible for you now your inheritance has come to you I have a pride too David a different kind of pride from theirs You loved me first I know as I was just me It was a foolish love for you to have David dear but I know it is true you could not have given yourself to save me else and I like to keep that thought of you in my heart big and noble and true that you did love just me She faltered but still held him from her Do you think I would not do all I can to keep from spoiling your life over there Stop stop It is enough he cried In spite of herself he took her hands in his and drew her to him in penitent tenderness I m no great lord with wide distances between me and your mountain world here Cassandra never think it I m tremendously near to the soul of things and the man of the wilderness is strong in me One thing you have not touched upon Tell me what did Frale say or do to you to so trouble you and send you off She stirred in his arms and waited then murmured He pestered me Explain Did he come often Oh no He I he came one evening up to our cabin and I sent him off and started next day But explain dearest How did he act What was it She was silent but drew her husband s head down and hid her face in his neck There Never mind love You needn t tell me if you don t wish He kissed me and held me in his arms like they were iron bands and I hated it He said you had gone away never to come back and that the whole mountain side knew it and that he had a right to come and claim my promise to him Oh David David this is the last I have kept nothing back from you now nothing My heart cried out for you like I heard you call and I went to to prove to them all that word was a lie I knew nothing they said here could touch you but I couldn t bear that the meanest hound living should dare think wrong of you Seems like I would have done it if I had had to crawl on my knees and swim the ocean My fingers tingle to grasp the throat of that young man I fought him for you once and if it hadn t been for a rolling stone under my foot it would have been death for one of us As it was I won with you to save me bless you But now David Ah but now what Are you happy That isn t what I mean You have your future I have my now It is all we ever have The past is gone and lives only in our memories and the future exists only in anticipation but now now is all we have or can have Live in it and love in it and be happy But we must be wise We ve got to face it sometime Let me help you now while I have the strength she pleaded earnestly But David only laughed out joyously and looked at his wife until she turned her face away from him Look at me he cried Dear troubled eyes Tears Tears in them Love you have kept nothing back this time and now it is my turn but I shall keep something back from you I m not going to reprove your idolatry by turning iconoclast and throwing your miserable old idol down from his pedestal all at once I tell you what it is though if I could feel that I was worthy of your smallest finger that I deserved only one of those big tears there there there Listen dearest I ll come to the point Who is it now making so much of the estimates of the world Somehow our viewpoints have got mixed Sacrifice myself Why Cassandra if I were to lose you out of my life I should be a broken hearted man What did I sacrifice Phantoms vanities and emptiness Oh Cassandra Cassandra my priestess of all that is good Open your eyes love and see as I see as you have taught me to see Much that we strive for and reckon as gain is really worthless Why sweet I would far far rather have you at your loom for the mother of my son than Lady Clara at her piano Your heritage of the great nature the far seeing the trusting spirit harboring no evil and construing all things to righteousness going out into the world and finding among all the dust and dross even of centuries only the pure gold the eye that sees into a man s soul searching out the true and lovely qualities there and transmuting all the rest into pure metal my own soul s alchemist your heritage is the secret of power I don t believe I understand all you are saying David I only see that I have a very hard task before me and now I know it is hard for you too Your mother made it clear to me that your true place is not living here as a doctor even though you do so much good among us I saw all at once that men are born each to fill a place in the world and I think each man s measure should be the height of his own power and ability nothing lower than that and I see it your power will be there not here where it must be limited by our limits and ignorance That is your own country over there It claims you and I I there is the difference you know Think of your mother and then of mine David I must not Oh David You must be unhampered free what can I what can we do We can just go down the mountain sane beings to our own little cabin belonging to each other first of all He took her hand and led her along the path carpeted with pine needles and fallen leaves And then when you are ready and willing not before love we will go home to my home just like this together She caught her breath Listen for I am seeing visions too now as you have taught me I will lead you through those halls and show you to all those dead ancestors and I will dress you in a silken gown the color of the evening star we used to watch together from our cabin door and around your neck I will hang the yellow pearls that have been worn by all those great ladies who stared at you from out their frames of gold the day you came alone and unrecognized bearing your priceless gift in your arms You shall wear the rich old lace of the family on your bosom and the jewelled coronet on your head and no one will see the silk and the jewels and the lace for looking at you and at the gift you bring No don t speak it is my turn now to see the pictures All will be yours whatever you see and touch in those stately homes for you will be the Lady Thryng and being the Lady Thryng you will be no more wonderful or beautiful than you were when you climbed to me following my flute notes or when you bent between me and the fire preparing my supper or when you were weaving at your loom or when you came to me from our cabin door with your arms outstretched and the light of all the stars of heaven in your eyes Then they were silent a long silence until seated together in their cabin before a bright log fire as she held their baby to her breast Cassandra broke the stillness Now I see it better David As you came here and lived my life and loved me just as I was so to be truly one I must go with you and live your life I must not fail you there You have been tried as by fire and have not failed nor are you the kind of woman who ever fails Then she smiled up at him one of those rare and fleeting smiles that always touched David with poignant pleasure and said I think I understand now
