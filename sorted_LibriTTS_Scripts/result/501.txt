DOCTOR DOLITTLE Produced by Charles Keller HTML version by Al Haines THE Story of DOCTOR DOLITTLE by Hugh Lofting BEING THE HISTORY OF HIS PECULIAR LIFE AT HOME AND ASTONISHING ADVENTURES IN FOREIGN PARTS NEVER BEFORE PRINTED TO ALL CHILDREN CHILDREN IN YEARS AND CHILDREN IN HEART I DEDICATE THIS STORY INTRODUCTION There are some of us now reaching middle age who discover themselves to be lamenting the past in one respect if in none other that there are no books written now for children comparable with those of thirty years ago I say written FOR children because the new psychological business of writing ABOUT them as though they were small pills or hatched in some especially scientific method is extremely popular today Writing for children rather than about them is very difficult as everybody who has tried it knows It can only be done I am convinced by somebody having a great deal of the child in his own outlook and sensibilities Such was the author of The Little Duke and The Dove in the Eagle s Nest such the author of A Flatiron for a Farthing and The Story of a Short Life Such above all the author of Alice in Wonderland Grownups imagine that they can do the trick by adopting baby language and talking down to their very critical audience There never was a greater mistake The imagination of the author must be a child s imagination and yet maturely consistent so that the White Queen in Alice for instance is seen just as a child would see her but she continues always herself through all her distressing adventures The supreme touch of the white rabbit pulling on his white gloves as he hastens is again absolutely the child s vision but the white rabbit as guide and introducer of Alice s adventures belongs to mature grown insight Geniuses are rare and without being at all an undue praiser of times past one can say without hesitation that until the appearance of Hugh Lofting the successor of Miss Yonge missus Ewing missus Gatty and Lewis Carroll had not appeared I remember the delight with which some six months ago I picked up the first Dolittle book in the Hampshire bookshop at Smith College in Northampton One of mister Lofting s pictures was quite enough for me The picture that I lighted upon when I first opened the book was the one of the monkeys making a chain with their arms across the gulf Then I looked further and discovered Bumpo reading fairy stories to himself And then looked again and there was a picture of John Dolittle s house But pictures are not enough although most authors draw so badly that if one of them happens to have the genius for line that mister Lofting shows there must be one feels something in his writing as well There is You cannot read the first paragraph of the book which begins in the right way Once upon a time without knowing that mister Lofting believes in his story quite as much as he expects you to That is the first essential for a story teller Then you discover as you read on that he has the right eye for the right detail What child inquiring mind could resist this intriguing sentence to be found on the second page of the book Besides the gold fish in the pond at the bottom of his garden he had rabbits in the pantry white mice in his piano a squirrel in the linen closet and a hedgehog in the cellar And then when you read a little further you will discover that the Doctor is not merely a peg on whom to hang exciting and various adventures but that he is himself a man of original and lively character He is a very kindly generous man and anyone who has ever written stories will know that it is much more difficult to make kindly generous characters interesting than unkindly and mean ones But Dolittle is interesting It is not only that he is quaint but that he is wise and knows what he is about The reader however young who meets him gets very soon a sense that if he were in trouble not necessarily medical he would go to Dolittle and ask his advice about it Dolittle seems to extend his hand from the page and grasp that of his reader and I can see him going down the centuries a kind of Pied Piper with thousands of children at his heels But not only is he a darling and alive and credible but his creator has also managed to invest everybody else in the book with the same kind of life Now this business of giving life to animals making them talk and behave like human beings is an extremely difficult one Lewis Carroll absolutely conquered the difficulties but I am not sure that anyone after him until Hugh Lofting has really managed the trick even in such a masterpiece as The Wind in the Willows we are not quite convinced John Dolittle s friends are convincing because their creator never forces them to desert their own characteristics Polynesia for instance is natural from first to last She really does care about the Doctor but she cares as a bird would care having always some place to which she is going when her business with her friends is over And when mister Lofting invents fantastic animals he gives them a kind of credible possibility which is extraordinarily convincing It will be impossible for anyone who has read this book not to believe in the existence of the pushmi pullyu who would be credible enough even were there no drawing of it but the picture on page one hundred forty five settles the matter of his truth once and for all In fact this book is a work of genius and as always with works of genius it is difficult to analyze the elements that have gone to make it There is poetry here and fantasy and humor a little pathos but above all a number of creations in whose existence everybody must believe whether they be children of four or old men of ninety or prosperous bankers of forty five I don t know how mister Lofting has done it I don t suppose that he knows himself There it is the first real children s classic since Alice HUGH WALPOLE CONTENTS INTRODUCTION I PUDDLEBY II ANIMAL LANGUAGE III MORE MONEY

STORY OF DOCTOR DOLITTLE THE FIRST CHAPTER PUDDLEBY ONCE upon a time many years ago when our grandfathers were little children there was a doctor and his name was Dolittle John Dolittle M D M D means that he was a proper doctor and knew a whole lot He lived in a little town called Puddleby on the Marsh All the folks young and old knew him well by sight And whenever he walked down the street in his high hat everyone would say There goes the Doctor He s a clever man And the dogs and the children would all run up and follow behind him and even the crows that lived in the church tower would caw and nod their heads The house he lived in on the edge of the town was quite small but his garden was very large and had a wide lawn and stone seats and weeping willows hanging over His sister Sarah Dolittle was housekeeper for him but the Doctor looked after the garden himself He was very fond of animals and kept many kinds of pets Besides the gold fish in the pond at the bottom of his garden he had rabbits in the pantry white mice in his piano a squirrel in the linen closet and a hedgehog in the cellar He had a cow with a calf too and an old lame horse twenty five years of age and chickens and pigeons and two lambs and many other animals But his favorite pets were Dab Dab the duck Jip the dog Gub Gub the baby pig Polynesia the parrot and the owl Too Too His sister used to grumble about all these animals and said they made the house untidy And one day when an old lady with rheumatism came to see the Doctor she sat on the hedgehog who was sleeping on the sofa and never came to see him any more but drove every Saturday all the way to Oxenthorpe another town ten miles off to see a different doctor Then his sister Sarah Dolittle came to him and said John how can you expect sick people to come and see you when you keep all these animals in the house It s a fine doctor would have his parlor full of hedgehogs and mice That s the fourth personage these animals have driven away Squire Jenkins and the Parson say they wouldn t come near your house again no matter how sick they are We are getting poorer every day If you go on like this none of the best people will have you for a doctor But I like the animals better than the best people said the Doctor You are ridiculous said his sister and walked out of the room So as time went on the Doctor got more and more animals and the people who came to see him got less and less Till at last he had no one left except the Cat s meat Man who didn t mind any kind of animals But the Cat s meat Man wasn t very rich and he only got sick once a year at Christmas time when he used to give the Doctor sixpence for a bottle of medicine Sixpence a year wasn t enough to live on even in those days long ago and if the Doctor hadn t had some money saved up in his money box no one knows what would have happened And he kept on getting still more pets and of course it cost a lot to feed them And the money he had saved up grew littler and littler Then he sold his piano and let the mice live in a bureau drawer But the money he got for that too began to go so he sold the brown suit he wore on Sundays and went on becoming poorer and poorer And now when he walked down the street in his high hat people would say to one another There goes John Dolittle M D There was a time when he was the best known doctor in the West Country Look at him now He hasn t any money and his stockings are full of holes But the dogs and the cats and the children still ran up and followed him through the town the same as they had done when he was rich THE SECOND CHAPTER ANIMAL LANGUAGE IT happened one day that the Doctor was sitting in his kitchen talking with the Cat s meat Man who had come to see him with a stomach ache Why don t you give up being a people s doctor and be an animal doctor asked the Cat s meat Man The parrot Polynesia was sitting in the window looking out at the rain and singing a sailor song to herself She stopped singing and started to listen You see Doctor the Cat s meat Man went on you know all about animals much more than what these here vets do That book you wrote about cats why it s wonderful I can t read or write myself or maybe I D write some books But my wife Theodosia she s a scholar she is And she read your book to me Well it s wonderful that s all can be said wonderful You might have been a cat yourself You know the way they think And listen you can make a lot of money doctoring animals Do you know that You see I d send all the old women who had sick cats or dogs to you And if they didn t get sick fast enough I could put something in the meat I sell em to make em sick see Oh no said the Doctor quickly You mustn t do that That wouldn t be right Oh I didn t mean real sick answered the Cat s meat Man Just a little something to make them droopy like was what I had reference to But as you say maybe it ain t quite fair on the animals But they ll get sick anyway because the old women always give em too much to eat And look all the farmers round about who had lame horses and weak lambs they d come Be an animal doctor When the Cat s meat Man had gone the parrot flew off the window on to the Doctor s table and said That man s got sense That s what you ought to do Be an animal doctor Give the silly people up if they haven t brains enough to see you re the best doctor in the world Take care of animals instead THEY ll soon find it out Be an animal doctor Oh there are plenty of animal doctors said John Dolittle putting the flower pots outside on the window sill to get the rain Yes there ARE plenty said Polynesia But none of them are any good at all Now listen Doctor and I ll tell you something Did you know that animals can talk I knew that parrots can talk said the Doctor Oh we parrots can talk in two languages people s language and bird language said Polynesia proudly If I say Polly wants a cracker you understand me But hear this Ka ka oi ee fee fee
101_126861_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 Good Gracious cried the Doctor 
none	none	What does that mean That means Is the porridge hot yet in bird language My You don t say so said the Doctor You never talked that way to me before What would have been the good said Polynesia dusting some cracker crumbs off her left wing You wouldn t have understood me if I had Tell me some more said the Doctor all excited and he rushed over to the dresser drawer and came back with the butcher s book and a pencil Now don t go too fast and I ll write it down This is interesting very interesting something quite new Give me the Birds A B C first slowly now So that was the way the Doctor came to know that animals had a language of their own and could talk to one another And all that afternoon while it was raining Polynesia sat on the kitchen table giving him bird words to put down in the book At tea time when the dog Jip came in the parrot said to the Doctor See HE S talking to you Looks to me as though he were scratching his ear said the Doctor But animals don t always speak with their mouths said the parrot in a high voice raising her eyebrows They talk with their ears with their feet with their tails with everything Sometimes they don t WANT to make a noise Do you see now the way he s twitching up one side of his nose What s that mean asked the Doctor That means Can t you see that it has stopped raining Polynesia answered He is asking you a question Dogs nearly always use their noses for asking questions After a while with the parrot s help the Doctor got to learn the language of the animals so well that he could talk to them himself and understand everything they said Then he gave up being a people s doctor altogether As soon as the Cat s meat Man had told every one that John Dolittle was going to become an animal doctor old ladies began to bring him their pet pugs and poodles who had eaten too much cake and farmers came many miles to show him sick cows and sheep One day a plow horse was brought to him and the poor thing was terribly glad to find a man who could talk in horse language You know Doctor said the horse that vet over the hill knows nothing at all He has been treating me six weeks now for spavins What I need is SPECTACLES I am going blind in one eye There s no reason why horses shouldn t wear glasses the same as people But that stupid man over the hill never even looked at my eyes He kept on giving me big pills I tried to tell him but he couldn t understand a word of horse language What I need is spectacles Of course of course said the Doctor I ll get you some at once I would like a pair like yours said the horse only green They ll keep the sun out of my eyes while I m plowing the Fifty Acre Field Certainly said the Doctor Green ones you shall have You know the trouble is Sir said the plow horse as the Doctor opened the front door to let him out the trouble is that ANYBODY thinks he can doctor animals just because the animals don t complain As a matter of fact it takes a much cleverer man to be a really good animal doctor than it does to be a good people s doctor My farmer s boy thinks he knows all about horses I wish you could see him his face is so fat he looks as though he had no eyes and he has got as much brain as a potato bug He tried to put a mustard plaster on me last week Where did he put it asked the Doctor Oh he didn t put it anywhere on me said the horse He only tried to I kicked him into the duck pond Well well said the Doctor I m a pretty quiet creature as a rule said the horse very patient with people don t make much fuss But it was bad enough to have that vet giving me the wrong medicine And when that red faced booby started to monkey with me I just couldn t bear it any more Did you hurt the boy much asked the Doctor Oh no said the horse I kicked him in the right place The vet s looking after him now When will my glasses be ready I ll have them for you next week said the Doctor Come in again Tuesday Good morning Then John Dolittle got a fine big pair of green spectacles and the plow horse stopped going blind in one eye and could see as well as ever And soon it became a common sight to see farm animals wearing glasses in the country round Puddleby and a blind horse was a thing unknown And so it was with all the other animals that were brought to him As soon as they found that he could talk their language they told him where the pain was and how they felt and of course it was easy for him to cure them Now all these animals went back and told their brothers and friends that there was a doctor in the little house with the big garden who really WAS a doctor And whenever any creatures got sick not only horses and cows and dogs but all the little things of the fields like harvest mice and water voles badgers and bats they came at once to his house on the edge of the town so that his big garden was nearly always crowded with animals trying to get in to see him There were so many that came that he had to have special doors made for the different kinds He wrote HORSES over the front door COWS over the side door and SHEEP on the kitchen door Each kind of animal had a separate door even the mice had a tiny tunnel made for them into the cellar where they waited patiently in rows for the Doctor to come round to them And so in a few years time every living thing for miles and miles got to know about John Dolittle M D And the birds who flew to other countries in the winter told the animals in foreign lands of the wonderful doctor of Puddleby on the Marsh who could understand their talk and help them in their troubles In this way he became famous among the animals all over the world better known even than he had been among the folks of the West Country And he was happy and liked his life very much One afternoon when the Doctor was busy writing in a book Polynesia sat in the window as she nearly always did looking out at the leaves blowing about in the garden Presently she laughed aloud What is it Polynesia asked the Doctor looking up from his book I was just thinking said the parrot and she went on looking at the leaves What were you thinking I was thinking about people said Polynesia People make me sick They think they re so wonderful The world has been going on now for thousands of years hasn t it And the only thing in animal language that PEOPLE have learned to understand is that when a dog wags his tail he means I m glad It s funny isn t it You are the very first man to talk like us Oh sometimes people annoy me dreadfully such airs they put on talking about the dumb animals DUMB Huh Why I knew a macaw once who could say Good morning in seven different ways without once opening his mouth He could talk every language and Greek An old professor with a gray beard bought him But he didn t stay He said the old man didn t talk Greek right and he couldn t stand listening to him teach the language wrong I often wonder what s become of him That bird knew more geography than people will ever know PEOPLE

none	none	I suppose if people ever learn to fly like any common hedge sparrow we shall never hear the end of it You re a wise old bird said the Doctor How old are you really I know that parrots and elephants sometimes live to be very very old I can never be quite sure of my age said Polynesia It s either a hundred and eighty three or a hundred and eighty two But I know that when I first came here from Africa King Charles was still hiding in the oak tree because I saw him He looked scared to death THE THIRD CHAPTER MORE MONEY TROUBLES AND soon now the Doctor began to make money again and his sister Sarah bought a new dress and was happy Some of the animals who came to see him were so sick that they had to stay at the Doctor s house for a week And when they were getting better they used to sit in chairs on the lawn 
208_126851_000005_000000	train-clean-360	And often even after they got well they did not want to go away they liked the Doctor and his house so much 
none	none	And he never had the heart to refuse them when they asked if they could stay with him 
208_126851_000005_000002	train-clean-360	So in this way he went on getting more and more pets 
none	none	Once when he was sitting on his garden wall smoking a pipe in the evening an Italian organ grinder came round with a monkey on a string The Doctor saw at once that the monkey s collar was too tight and that he was dirty and unhappy 
208_126851_000006_000001	train-clean-360	So he took the monkey away from the Italian gave the man a shilling and told him to go 
none	none	The organ grinder got awfully angry and said that he wanted to keep the monkey But the Doctor told him that if he didn t go away he would punch him on the nose John Dolittle was a strong man though he wasn t very tall So the Italian went away saying rude things and the monkey stayed with Doctor Dolittle and had a good home The other animals in the house called him Chee Chee which is a common word in monkey language meaning ginger And another time when the circus came to Puddleby the crocodile who had a bad tooth ache escaped at night and came into the Doctor s garden The Doctor talked to him in crocodile language and took him into the house and made his tooth better But when the crocodile saw what a nice house it was with all the different places for the different kinds of animals he too wanted to live with the Doctor 
208_126851_000007_000003	train-clean-360	He asked couldn t he sleep in the fish pond at the bottom of the garden if he promised not to eat the fish 
none	none	When the circus men came to take him back he got so wild and savage that he frightened them away 
208_126851_000007_000005	train-clean-360	But to every one in the house he was always as gentle as a kitten 
none	none	But now the old ladies grew afraid to send their lap dogs to Doctor Dolittle because of the crocodile and the farmers wouldn t believe that he would not eat the lambs and sick calves they brought to be cured So the Doctor went to the crocodile and told him he must go back to his circus 
208_126851_000008_000002	train-clean-360	But he wept such big tears and begged so hard to be allowed to stay that the Doctor hadn t the heart to turn him out 
none	none	So then the Doctor s sister came to him and said John you must send that creature away Now the farmers and the old ladies are afraid to send their animals to you just as we were beginning to be well off again Now we shall be ruined entirely 
208_126851_000009_000003	train-clean-360	This is the last straw 
none	none	I will no longer be housekeeper for you if you don t send away that alligator It isn t an alligator said the Doctor it s a crocodile
208_126851_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t care what you call it said his sister 
208_126851_000011_000001	train-clean-360	 It s a nasty thing to find under the bed 
none	none	I won t have it in the house
208_126851_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 But he has promised me the Doctor answered that he will not bite any one 
none	none	He doesn t like the circus and I haven t the money to send him back to Africa where he comes from He minds his own business and on the whole is very well behaved 
208_126851_000012_000003	train-clean-360	Don t be so fussy 
none	none	I tell you I WILL NOT have him around said Sarah He eats the linoleum If you don t send him away this minute I ll I ll go and get married All right said the Doctor go and get married It can t be helped And he took down his hat and went out into the garden So Sarah Dolittle packed up her things and went off and the Doctor was left all alone with his animal family And very soon he was poorer than he had ever been before 
208_126851_000016_000001	train-clean-360	With all these mouths to fill and the house to look after and no one to do the mending and no money coming in to pay the butcher s bill things began to look very difficult 
none	none	But the Doctor didn t worry at all Money is a nuisance he used to say We d all be much better off if it had never been invented What does money matter so long as we are happy But soon the animals themselves began to get worried And one evening when the Doctor was asleep in his chair before the kitchen fire they began talking it over among themselves in whispers And the owl Too Too who was good at arithmetic figured it out that there was only money enough left to last another week if they each had one meal a day and no more Then the parrot said I think we all ought to do the housework ourselves 
208_126851_000019_000001	train-clean-360	At least we can do that much 
none	none	After all it is for our sakes that the old man finds himself so lonely and so poor 
208_126851_000020_000000	train-clean-360	So it was agreed that the monkey Chee Chee was to do the cooking and mending the dog was to sweep the floors the duck was to dust and make the beds the owl Too Too was to keep the accounts and the pig was to do the gardening 
none	none	They made Polynesia the parrot housekeeper and laundress because she was the oldest Of course at first they all found their new jobs very hard to do all except Chee Chee who had hands and could do things like a man But they soon got used to it and they used to think it great fun to watch Jip the dog sweeping his tail over the floor with a rag tied onto it for a broom After a little they got to do the work so well that the Doctor said that he had never had his house kept so tidy or so clean before In this way things went along all right for a while but without money they found it very hard Then the animals made a vegetable and flower stall outside the garden gate and sold radishes and roses to the people that passed by along the road 
208_126851_000024_000000	train-clean-360	But still they didn t seem to make enough money to pay all the bills and still the Doctor wouldn t worry 
none	none	When the parrot came to him and told him that the fishmonger wouldn t give them any more fish he said
208_126851_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 Never mind 
208_126851_000025_000001	train-clean-360	So long as the hens lay eggs and the cow gives milk we can have omelettes and junket 
none	none	And there are plenty of vegetables left in the garden 
208_126851_000025_000003	train-clean-360	The Winter is still a long way off 
208_126851_000025_000004	train-clean-360	Don t fuss 
none	none	That was the trouble with Sarah she would fuss I wonder how Sarah s getting on an excellent woman in some ways Well well But the snow came earlier than usual that year and although the old lame horse hauled in plenty of wood from the forest outside the town so they could have a big fire in the kitchen most of the vegetables in the garden were gone and the rest were covered with snow and many of the animals were really hungry THE FOURTH CHAPTER A MESSAGE FROM AFRICA THAT Winter was a very cold one And one night in December when they were all sitting round the warm fire in the kitchen and the Doctor was reading aloud to them out of books he had written himself in animal language the owl Too Too suddenly said Sh What s that noise outside They all listened and presently they heard the sound of some one running Then the door flew open and the monkey Chee Chee ran in badly out of breath Doctor he cried I ve just had a message from a cousin of mine in Africa There is a terrible sickness among the monkeys out there They are all catching it and they are dying in hundreds They have heard of you and beg you to come to Africa to stop the sickness Who brought the message asked the Doctor taking off his spectacles and laying down his book A swallow said Chee Chee She is outside on the rain butt Bring her in by the fire said the Doctor She must be perished with the cold The swallows flew South six weeks ago So the swallow was brought in all huddled and shivering and although she was a little afraid at first she soon got warmed up and sat on the edge of the mantelpiece and began to talk When she had finished the Doctor said I would gladly go to Africa especially in this bitter weather But I m afraid we haven t money enough to buy the tickets Get me the money box Chee Chee So the monkey climbed up and got it off the top shelf of the dresser There was nothing in it not one single penny I felt sure there was twopence left said the Doctor There WAS said the owl But you spent it on a rattle for that badger s baby when he was teething Did I said the Doctor dear me dear me What a nuisance money is to be sure Well never mind Perhaps if I go down to the seaside I shall be able to borrow a boat that will take us to Africa I knew a seaman once who brought his baby to me with measles Maybe he ll lend us his boat the baby got well So early the next morning the Doctor went down to the seashore And when he came back he told the animals it was all right the sailor was going to lend them the boat Then the crocodile and the monkey and the parrot were very glad and began to sing because they were going back to Africa their real home And the Doctor said I shall only be able to take you three with Jip the dog Dab Dab the duck Gub Gub the pig and the owl Too Too The rest of the animals like the dormice and the water voles and the bats they will have to go back and live in the fields where they were born till we come home again But as most of them sleep through the Winter they won t mind that and besides it wouldn t be good for them to go to Africa So then the parrot who had been on long sea voyages before began telling the Doctor all the things he would have to take with him on the ship You must have plenty of pilot bread she said hard tack they call it And you must have beef in cans and an anchor I expect the ship will have its own anchor said the Doctor Well make sure said Polynesia Because it s very important You can t stop if you haven t got an anchor And you ll need a bell What s that for asked the Doctor To tell the time by said the parrot You go and ring it every half hour and then you know what time it is And bring a whole lot of rope it always comes in handy on voyages Then they began to wonder where they were going to get the money from to buy all the things they needed Oh bother it Money again cried the Doctor Goodness I shall be glad to get to Africa where we don t have to have any I ll go and ask the grocer if he will wait for his money till I get back No I ll send the sailor to ask him So the sailor went to see the grocer And presently he came back with all the things they wanted Then the animals packed up and after they had turned off the water so the pipes wouldn t freeze and put up the shutters they closed the house and gave the key to the old horse who lived in the stable And when they had seen that there was plenty of hay in the loft to last the horse through the Winter they carried all their luggage down to the seashore and got on to the boat The Cat s meat Man was there to see them off and he brought a large suet pudding as a present for the Doctor because he said he had been told you couldn t get suet puddings in foreign parts As soon as they were on the ship Gub Gub the pig asked where the beds were for it was four o clock in the afternoon and he wanted his nap So Polynesia took him downstairs into the inside of the ship and showed him the beds set all on top of one another like book shelves against a wall Why that isn t a bed cried Gub Gub That s a shelf Beds are always like that on ships said the parrot It isn t a shelf Climb up into it and go to sleep That s what you call a bunk I don t think I ll go to bed yet said Gub Gub I m too excited I want to go upstairs again and see them start Well this is your first trip said Polynesia You will get used to the life after a while And she went back up the stairs of the ship humming this song to herself I ve seen the Black Sea and the Red Sea I rounded the Isle of Wight I discovered the Yellow River And the Orange too by night Now Greenland drops behind again And I sail the ocean Blue I m tired of all these colors Jane So I m coming back to you They were just going to start on their journey when the Doctor said he would have to go back and ask the sailor the way to Africa But the swallow said she had been to that country many times and would show them how to get there So the Doctor told Chee Chee to pull up the anchor and the voyage began THE FIFTH CHAPTER THE GREAT JOURNEY NOW for six whole weeks they went sailing on and on over the rolling sea following the swallow who flew before the ship to show them the way At night she carried a tiny lantern so they should not miss her in the dark and the people on the other ships that passed said that the light must be a shooting star As they sailed further and further into the South it got warmer and warmer Polynesia Chee Chee and the crocodile enjoyed the hot sun no end They ran about laughing and looking over the side of the ship to see if they could see Africa yet But the pig and the dog and the owl Too Too could do nothing in such weather but sat at the end of the ship in the shade of a big barrel with their tongues hanging out drinking lemonade Dab Dab the duck used to keep herself cool by jumping into the sea and swimming behind the ship And every once in a while when the top of her head got too hot she would dive under the ship and come up on the other side In this way too she used to catch herrings on Tuesdays and Fridays when everybody on the boat ate fish to make the beef last longer When they got near to the Equator they saw some flying fishes coming towards them And the fishes asked the parrot if this was Doctor Dolittle s ship When she told them it was they said they were glad because the monkeys in Africa were getting worried that he would never come Polynesia asked them how many miles they had yet to go and the flying fishes said it was only fifty five miles now to the coast of Africa And another time a whole school of porpoises came dancing through the waves and they too asked Polynesia if this was the ship of the famous doctor And when they heard that it was they asked the parrot if the Doctor wanted anything for his journey And Polynesia said Yes We have run short of onions There is an island not far from here said the porpoises where the wild onions grow tall and strong Keep straight on we will get some and catch up to you So the porpoises dashed away through the sea And very soon the parrot saw them again coming up behind dragging the onions through the waves in big nets made of seaweed The next evening as the sun was going down the Doctor said Get me the telescope Chee Chee Our journey is nearly ended Very soon we should be able to see the shores of Africa And about half an hour later sure enough they thought they could see something in front that might be land But it began to get darker and darker and they couldn t be sure Then a great storm came up with thunder and lightning The wind howled the rain came down in torrents and the waves got so high they splashed right over the boat Presently there was a big BANG The ship stopped and rolled over on its side What s happened asked the Doctor coming up from downstairs I m not sure said the parrot but I think we re ship wrecked Tell the duck to get out and see So Dab Dab dived right down under the waves And when she came up she said they had struck a rock there was a big hole in the bottom of the ship the water was coming in and they were sinking fast We must have run into Africa said the Doctor Dear me dear me Well we must all swim to land But Chee Chee and Gub Gub did not know how to swim Get the rope said Polynesia I told you it would come in handy Where s that duck Come here Dab Dab Take this end of the rope fly to the shore and tie it on to a palm tree and we ll hold the other end on the ship here Then those that can t swim must climb along the rope till they reach the land That s what you call a life line So they all got safely to the shore some swimming some flying and those that climbed along the rope brought the Doctor s trunk and handbag with them But the ship was no good any more with the big hole in the bottom and presently the rough sea beat it to pieces on the rocks and the timbers floated away Then they all took shelter in a nice dry cave they found high up in the cliffs till the storm was over When the sun came out next morning they went down to the sandy beach to dry themselves Dear old Africa sighed Polynesia It s good to get back Just think it ll be a hundred and sixty nine years to morrow since I was here And it hasn t changed a bit Same old palm trees same old red earth same old black ants There s no place like home And the others noticed she had tears in her eyes she was so pleased to see her country once again Then the Doctor missed his high hat for it had been blown into the sea during the storm So Dab Dab went out to look for it And presently she saw it a long way off floating on the water like a toy boat When she flew down to get it she found one of the white mice very frightened sitting inside it What are you doing here asked the duck You were told to stay behind in Puddleby I didn t want to be left behind said the mouse I wanted to see what Africa was like I have relatives there So I hid in the baggage and was brought on to the ship with the hard tack When the ship sank I was terribly frightened because I cannot swim far I swam as long as I could but I soon got all exhausted and thought I was going to sink And then just at that moment the old man s hat came floating by and I got into it because I did not want to be drowned So the duck took up the hat with the mouse in it and brought it to the Doctor on the shore And they all gathered round to have a look That s what you call a stowaway said the parrot Presently when they were looking for a place in the trunk where the white mouse could travel comfortably the monkey Chee Chee suddenly said Sh I hear footsteps in the jungle They all stopped talking and listened And soon a black man came down out of the woods and asked them what they were doing there My name is John Dolittle M D said the Doctor I have been asked to come to Africa to cure the monkeys who are sick You must all come before the King said the black man What king asked the Doctor who didn t want to waste any time The King of the Jolliginki the man answered All these lands belong to him and all strangers must be brought before him Follow me So they gathered up their baggage and went off following the man through the jungle THE SIXTH CHAPTER POLYNESIA AND THE KING WHEN they had gone a little way through the thick forest they came to a wide clear space and they saw the King s palace which was made of mud This was where the King lived with his Queen Ermintrude and their son Prince Bumpo The Prince was away fishing for salmon in the river But the King and Queen were sitting under an umbrella before the palace door And Queen Ermintrude was asleep When the Doctor had come up to the palace the King asked him his business and the Doctor told him why he had come to Africa You may not travel through my lands said the King Many years ago a white man came to these shores and I was very kind to him But after he had dug holes in the ground to get the gold and killed all the elephants to get their ivory tusks he went away secretly in his ship without so much as saying Thank you Never again shall a white man travel through the lands of Jolliginki Then the King turned to some of the black men who were standing near and said Take away this medicine man with all his animals and lock them up in my strongest prison So six of the black men led the Doctor and all his pets away and shut them up in a stone dungeon The dungeon had only one little window high up in the wall with bars in it and the door was strong and thick Then they all grew very sad and Gub Gub the pig began to cry But Chee Chee said he would spank him if he didn t stop that horrible noise and he kept quiet Are we all here asked the Doctor after he had got used to the dim light Yes I think so said the duck and started to count them Where s Polynesia asked the crocodile She isn t here Are you sure said the Doctor Look again Polynesia Polynesia Where are you I suppose she escaped grumbled the crocodile Well that s just like her Sneaked off into the jungle as soon as her friends got into trouble I m not that kind of a bird said the parrot climbing out of the pocket in the tail of the Doctor s coat You see I m small enough to get through the bars of that window and I was afraid they would put me in a cage instead So while the King was busy talking I hid in the Doctor s pocket and here I am That s what you call a ruse she said smoothing down her feathers with her beak Good Gracious cried the Doctor You re lucky I didn t sit on you Now listen said Polynesia to night as soon as it gets dark I am going to creep through the bars of that window and fly over to the palace And then you ll see I ll soon find a way to make the King let us all out of prison Oh what can YOU do said Gub Gub turning up his nose and beginning to cry again You re only a bird Quite true said the parrot But do not forget that although I am only a bird I CAN TALK LIKE A MAN and I know these people So that night when the moon was shining through the palm trees and all the King s men were asleep the parrot slipped out through the bars of the prison and flew across to the palace The pantry window had been broken by a tennis ball the week before and Polynesia popped in through the hole in the glass She heard Prince Bumpo snoring in his bed room at the back of the palace Then she tip toed up the stairs till she came to the King s bedroom She opened the door gently and peeped in The Queen was away at a dance that night at her cousin s but the King was in bed fast asleep Polynesia crept in very softly and got under the bed Then she coughed just the way Doctor Dolittle used to cough Polynesia could mimic any one The King opened his eyes and said sleepily Is that you Ermintrude He thought it was the Queen come back from the dance Then the parrot coughed again loud like a man And the King sat up wide awake and said Who s that I am Doctor Dolittle said the parrot just the way the Doctor would have said it What are you doing in my bedroom cried the King How dare you get out of prison Where are you I don t see you But the parrot just laughed a long deep jolly laugh like the Doctor s Stop laughing and come here at once so I can see you said the King Foolish King answered Polynesia Have you forgotten that you are talking to John Dolittle M D the most wonderful man on earth Of course you cannot see me I have made myself invisible There is nothing I cannot do Now listen I have come here to night to warn you If you don t let me and my animals travel through your kingdom I will make you and all your people sick like the monkeys For I can make people well and I can make people ill just by raising my little finger Send your soldiers at once to open the dungeon door or you shall have mumps before the morning sun has risen on the hills of Jolliginki Then the King began to tremble and was very much afraid Doctor he cried it shall be as you say Do not raise your little finger please And he jumped out of bed and ran to tell the soldiers to open the prison door As soon as he was gone Polynesia crept downstairs and left the palace by the pantry window But the Queen who was just letting herself in at the backdoor with a latch key saw the parrot getting out through the broken glass And when the King came back to bed she told him what she had seen Then the King understood that he had been tricked and he was dreadfully angry He hurried back to the prison at once But he was too late The door stood open The dungeon was empty The Doctor and all his animals were gone THE SEVENTH CHAPTER THE BRIDGE OF APES QUEEN ERMINTRUDE had never in her life seen her husband so terrible as he got that night He gnashed his teeth with rage 
403_126855_000003_000002	train-clean-100	He called everybody a fool 
none	none	He threw his tooth brush at the palace cat He rushed round in his night shirt and woke up all his army and sent them into the jungle to catch the Doctor Then he made all his servants go too his cooks and his gardeners and his barber and Prince Bumpo s tutor even the Queen who was tired from dancing in a pair of tight shoes was packed off to help the soldiers in their search All this time the Doctor and his animals were running through the forest towards the Land of the Monkeys as fast as they could go Gub Gub with his short legs soon got tired and the Doctor had to carry him which made it pretty hard when they had the trunk and the hand bag with them as well The King of the Jolliginki thought it would be easy for his army to find them because the Doctor was in a 
101_126859_000031_000002	train-clean-360	strange 
none	none	land and would not know his way But he was wrong because the monkey Chee Chee knew all the paths through the jungle better even than the King s men did And he led the Doctor and his pets to the very thickest part of the forest a place where no man had ever been before and hid them all in a big hollow tree between high rocks We had better wait here said Chee Chee till the soldiers have gone back to bed Then we can go on into the Land of the Monkeys So there they stayed the whole night through They often heard the King s men searching and talking in the jungle round about But they were quite safe for no one knew of that hiding place but Chee Chee not even the other monkeys At last when daylight began to come through the thick leaves overhead they heard Queen Ermintrude saying in a very tired voice that it was no use looking any more that they might as well go back and get some sleep As soon as the soldiers had all gone home Chee Chee brought the Doctor and his animals out of the hiding place and they set off for the Land of the Monkeys It was a long long way and they often got very tired especially Gub Gub 
403_126855_000012_000001	train-clean-100	But when he cried they gave him milk out of the cocoanuts which he was very fond of 
none	none	They always had plenty to eat and drink because Chee Chee and Polynesia knew all the different kinds of fruits and vegetables that grow in the jungle and where to find them like dates and figs and ground nuts and ginger and yams 
403_126855_000013_000001	train-clean-100	They used to make their lemonade out of the juice of wild oranges sweetened with honey which they got from the bees nests in hollow trees 
none	none	No matter what it was they asked for Chee Chee and Polynesia always seemed to be able to get it for them or something like it 
403_126855_000013_000003	train-clean-100	They even got the Doctor some tobacco one day when he had finished what he had brought with him and wanted to smoke 
403_126855_000014_000000	train-clean-100	At night they slept in tents made of palm leaves on thick soft beds of dried grass 
none	none	And after a while they got used to walking such a lot and did not get so tired and enjoyed the life of travel very much But they were always glad when the night came and they stopped for their resting time Then the Doctor used to make a little fire of sticks and after they had had their supper they would sit round it in a ring listening to Polynesia singing songs about the sea or to Chee Chee telling stories of the jungle And many of the tales that Chee Chee told were very interesting Because although the monkeys had no history books of their own before Doctor Dolittle came to write them for them they remember everything that happens by telling stories to their children And Chee Chee spoke of many things his grandmother had told him tales of long long long ago before Noah and the Flood of the days when men dressed in bear skins and lived in holes in the rock and ate their mutton raw because they did not know what cooking was having never seen a fire And he told them of the Great Mammoths and Lizards as long as a train that wandered over the mountains in those times nibbling from the tree tops And often they got so interested listening that when he had finished they found their fire had gone right out and they had to scurry round to get more sticks and build a new one Now when the King s army had gone back and told the King that they couldn t find the Doctor the King sent them out again and told them they must stay in the jungle till they caught him 
403_126855_000017_000001	train-clean-100	So all this time while the Doctor and his animals were going along towards the Land of the Monkeys thinking themselves quite safe they were still being followed by the King s men 
none	none	If Chee Chee had known this he would most likely have hidden them again But he didn t know it 
403_126855_000018_000000	train-clean-100	One day Chee Chee climbed up a high rock and looked out over the tree tops 
none	none	And when he came down he said they were now quite close to the Land of the Monkeys and would soon be there 
403_126855_000019_000000	train-clean-100	And that same evening sure enough they saw Chee Chee s cousin and a lot of other monkeys who had not yet got sick sitting in the trees by the edge of a swamp looking and waiting for them 
none	none	And when they saw the famous doctor really come these monkeys made a tremendous noise cheering and waving leaves and swinging out of the branches to greet him They wanted to carry his bag and his trunk and everything he had and one of the bigger ones even carried Gub Gub who had got tired again Then two of them rushed on in front to tell the sick monkeys that the great doctor had come at last 
403_126855_000021_000000	train-clean-100	But the King s men who were still following had heard the noise of the monkeys cheering and they at last knew where the Doctor was and hastened on to catch him 
none	none	The big monkey carrying Gub Gub was coming along behind slowly and he saw the Captain of the army sneaking through the trees So he hurried after the Doctor and told him to run Then they all ran harder than they had ever run in their lives and the King s men coming after them began to run too and the Captain ran hardest of all Then the Doctor tripped over his medicine bag and fell down in the mud and the Captain thought he would surely catch him this time But the Captain had very long ears though his hair was very short And as he sprang forward to take hold of the Doctor one of his ears caught fast in a tree and the rest of the army had to stop and help him By this time the Doctor had picked himself up and on they went again running and running And Chee Chee shouted
403_126855_000027_000000	train-clean-100	 It s all right 
none	none	We haven t far to go now But before they could get into the Land of the Monkeys they came to a steep cliff with a river flowing below This was the end of the Kingdom of Jolliginki and the Land of the Monkeys was on the other side across the river And Jip the dog looked down over the edge of the steep steep cliff and said Golly 
403_126855_000030_000001	train-clean-100	How are we ever going to get across 
403_126855_000031_000000	train-clean-100	 Oh dear said Gub Gub 
403_126855_000031_000001	train-clean-100	 The King s men are quite close now Look at them 
403_126855_000031_000002	train-clean-100	I am afraid we are going to be taken back to prison again And he began to weep 
none	none	But the big monkey who was carrying the pig dropped him on the ground and cried out to the other monkeys
403_126855_000033_000000	train-clean-100	 Boys a bridge

none	none	A bridge A bridge The Doctor began to wonder what they were going to make a bridge out of and he gazed around to see if they had any boards hidden any place 
403_126855_000035_000000	train-clean-100	But when he looked back at the cliff there hanging across the river was a bridge all ready for him made of living monkeys 
none	none	For while his back was turned the monkeys quick as a flash had made themselves into a bridge just by holding hands and feet 
403_126855_000036_000000	train-clean-100	And the big one shouted to the Doctor Walk over 
403_126855_000036_000001	train-clean-100	Walk over all of you hurry 
403_126855_000037_000000	train-clean-100	Gub Gub was a bit scared walking on such a narrow bridge at that dizzy height above the river 
none	none	But he got over all right and so did all of them John Dolittle was the last to cross And just as he was getting to the other side the King s men came rushing up to the edge of the cliff Then they shook their fists and yelled with rage For they saw they were too late The Doctor and all his animals were safe in the Land of the Monkeys and the bridge was pulled across to the other side Then Chee Chee turned to the Doctor and said Many great explorers and gray bearded naturalists have lain long weeks hidden in the jungle waiting to see the monkeys do that trick But we never let a white man get a glimpse of it before 
403_126855_000041_000002	train-clean-100	You are the first to see the famous Bridge of Apes 
403_126855_000042_000000	train-clean-100	And the Doctor felt very pleased 
none	none	THE EIGHTH CHAPTER THE LEADER OF THE LIONS JOHN DOLITTLE now became dreadfully awfully busy He found hundreds and thousands of monkeys sick gorillas orangoutangs chimpanzees dog faced baboons marmosettes gray monkeys red ones all kinds And many had died The first thing he did was to separate the sick ones from the well ones Then he got Chee Chee and his cousin to build him a little house of grass The next thing he made all the monkeys who were still well come and be vaccinated And for three days and three nights the monkeys kept coming from the jungles and the valleys and the hills to the little house of grass where the Doctor sat all day and all night vaccinating and vaccinating Then he had another house made a big one with a lot of beds in it and he put all the sick ones in this house But so many were sick there were not enough well ones to do the nursing So he sent messages to the other animals like the lions and the leopards and the antelopes to come and help with the nursing But the Leader of the Lions was a very proud creature And when he came to the Doctor s big house full of beds he seemed angry and scornful Do you dare to ask me Sir he said glaring at the Doctor Do you dare to ask me ME THE KING OF BEASTS to wait on a lot of dirty monkeys Why I wouldn t even eat them between meals Although the lion looked very terrible the Doctor tried hard not to seem afraid of him I didn t ask you to eat them he said quietly And besides they re not dirty They ve all had a bath this morning YOUR coat looks as though it needed brushing badly Now listen and I ll tell you something the day may come when the lions get sick And if you don t help the other animals now the lions may find themselves left all alone when THEY are in trouble That often happens to proud people The lions are never IN trouble they only MAKE trouble said the Leader turning up his nose And he stalked away into the jungle feeling he had been rather smart and clever Then the leopards got proud too and said they wouldn t help And then of course the antelopes although they were too shy and timid to be rude to the Doctor like the lion THEY pawed the ground and smiled foolishly and said they had never been nurses before And now the poor Doctor was worried frantic wondering where he could get help enough to take care of all these thousands of monkeys in bed But the Leader of the Lions when he got back to his den saw his wife the Queen Lioness come running out to meet him with her hair untidy One of the cubs won t eat she said I don t know WHAT to do with him He hasn t taken a thing since last night And she began to cry and shake with nervousness for she was a good mother even though she was a lioness So the Leader went into his den and looked at his children two very cunning little cubs lying on the floor And one of them seemed quite poorly Then the lion told his wife quite proudly just what he had said to the Doctor And she got so angry she nearly drove him out of the den You never DID have a grain of sense she screamed All the animals from here to the Indian Ocean are talking about this wonderful man and how he can cure any kind of sickness and how kind he is the only man in the whole world who can talk the language of the animals And now NOW when we have a sick baby on our hands you must go and offend him You great booby Nobody but a fool is ever rude to a GOOD doctor You and she started pulling her husband s hair Go back to that white man at once she yelled and tell him you re sorry And take all the other empty headed lions with you and those stupid leopards and antelopes Then do everything the Doctor tells you Work hard And perhaps he will be kind enough to come and see the cub later Now be off HURRY I tell you You re not fit to be a father And she went into the den next door where another mother lion lived and told her all about it So the Leader of the Lions went back to the Doctor and said I happened to be passing this way and thought I d look in Got any help yet No said the Doctor I haven t And I m dreadfully worried Help s pretty hard to get these days said the lion Animals don t seem to want to work any more You can t blame them in a way Well seeing you re in difficulties I don t mind doing what I can just to oblige you so long as I don t have to wash the creatures And I have told all the other hunting animals to come and do their share The leopards should be here any minute now Oh and by the way we ve got a sick cub at home I don t think there s much the matter with him myself But the wife is anxious If you are around that way this evening you might take a look at him will you Then the Doctor was very happy for all the lions and the leopards and the antelopes and the giraffes and the zebras all the animals of the forests and the mountains and the plains came to help him in his work There were so many of them that he had to send some away and only kept the cleverest And now very soon the monkeys began to get better At the end of a week the big house full of beds was half empty And at the end of the second week the last monkey had got well Then the Doctor s work was done and he was so tired he went to bed and slept for three days without even turning over THE NINTH CHAPTER THE MONKEYS COUNCIL CHEE CHEE stood outside the Doctor s door keeping everybody away till he woke up Then John Dolittle told the monkeys that he must now go back to Puddleby They were very surprised at this for they had thought that he was going to stay with them forever And that night all the monkeys got together in the jungle to talk it over And the Chief Chimpanzee rose up and said Why is it the good man is going away Is he not happy here with us But none of them could answer him Then the Grand Gorilla got up and said I think we all should go to him and ask him to stay Perhaps if we make him a new house and a bigger bed and promise him plenty of monkey servants to work for him and to make life pleasant for him perhaps then he will not wish to go Then Chee Chee got up and all the others whispered Sh Look Chee Chee the great Traveler is about to speak And Chee Chee said to the other monkeys My friends I am afraid it is useless to ask the Doctor to stay He owes money in Puddleby and he says he must go back and pay it And the monkeys asked him What is MONEY Then Chee Chee told them that in the Land of the White Men you could get nothing without money you could DO nothing without money that it was almost impossible to LIVE without money And some of them asked But can you not even eat and drink without paying But Chee Chee shook his head And then he told them that even he when he was with the organ grinder had been made to ask the children for money And the Chief Chimpanzee turned to the Oldest Orangoutang and said Cousin surely these Men be strange creatures Who would wish to live in such a land My gracious how paltry Then Chee Chee said When we were coming to you we had no boat to cross the sea in and no money to buy food to eat on our journey So a man lent us some biscuits and we said we would pay him when we came back And we borrowed a boat from a sailor but it was broken on the rocks when we reached the shores of Africa Now the Doctor says he must go back and get the sailor another boat because the man was poor and his ship was all he had And the monkeys were all silent for a while sitting quite still upon the ground and thinking hard At last the Biggest Baboon got up and said I do not think we ought to let this good man leave our land till we have given him a fine present to take with him so that he may know we are grateful for all that he has done for us And a little tiny red monkey who was sitting up in a tree shouted down I think that too And then they all cried out making a great noise Yes yes Let us give him the finest present a White Man ever had Now they began to wonder and ask one another what would be the best thing to give him And one said Fifty bags of cocoanuts And another A hundred bunches of bananas At least he shall not have to buy his fruit in the Land Where You Pay to Eat But Chee Chee told them that all these things would be too heavy to carry so far and would go bad before half was eaten If you want to please him he said give him an animal You may be sure he will be kind to it Give him some rare animal they have not got in the menageries And the monkeys asked him What are MENAGERIES Then Chee Chee explained to them that menageries were places in the Land of the White Men where animals were put in cages for people to come and look at And the monkeys were very shocked and said to one another These Men are like thoughtless young ones stupid and easily amused Sh It is a prison he means So then they asked Chee Chee what rare animal it could be that they should give the Doctor one the White Men had not seen before And the Major of the Marmosettes asked Have they an iguana over there But Chee Chee said Yes there is one in the London Zoo And another asked Have they an okapi But Chee Chee said Yes In Belgium where my organ grinder took me five years ago they had an okapi in a big city they call Antwerp And another asked Have they a pushmi pullyu Then Chee Chee said No No White Man has ever seen a pushmi pullyu Let us give him that 
29-126858-0000	train-other-500	THE TENTH CHAPTER THE RAREST ANIMAL OF ALL PUSHMI PULLYUS are now extinct That means there aren t any more
none	none	 But long ago when Doctor Dolittle was alive there were some of them still left in the deepest jungles of Africa and even then they were very very scarce They had no tail 
29-126858-0001	train-other-500	but a head at each end and sharp horns on each head They were very shy and terribly hard to catch The black men get most of their animals by sneaking up behind them while they are not looking
29-126858-0002	train-other-500	But you could not do this with the pushmi pullyu because no matter which way you came towards him he was always facing you And besides only one half of him slept at a time The other head was always awake
none	none	 and watching This was why they were never caught and never seen in Zoos Though many of the greatest huntsmen and the cleverest menagerie keepers spent years of their lives searching through the jungles 
29-126858-0003	train-other-500	in all weathers for pushmi pullyus not a single one had ever been caught Even then years ago he was the only animal in the world with two heads Well
none	none	 the monkeys set out hunting for this animal through the forest 
29-126858-0004	train-other-500	And after they had gone a good many miles one of them found peculiar footprints near the edge of a river and they knew that a pushmi pullyu must be very near that spot Then
none	none	 they went along the bank of the river a little way and they saw a place where the grass was high and thick and they guessed that he was in there So they all joined hands and made a great circle round the high grass 
29-126858-0005	train-other-500	The pushmi pullyu heard them coming and he tried hard to break through the ring of monkeys But he couldn t do it When he saw that it was no use trying to escape he sat down and waited to see what they wanted
29-126858-0006	train-other-500	They asked him if he would go with Doctor Dolittle and be put on show in the Land of the White Men But he shook both his heads hard and said Certainly not
29-126858-0007	train-other-500	They explained to him that he would not be shut up in a menagerie but would just be looked at They told him that the Doctor was a very kind man but hadn t any money and people would pay to see a two headed animal and the Doctor would get rich
29-126858-0008	train-other-500	and could pay for the boat he had borrowed to come to Africa in But he answered No You know how shy I am I hate being stared at And he almost began to cry
none	none	 Then for three days they tried to persuade him And at the end of the third day 
29-126858-0009	train-other-500	he said he would come with them and see what kind of a man the Doctor was first So the monkeys traveled back with the pushmi pullyu And when they came to where the Doctor s little house of grass was they knocked on the door The duck
29-126858-0010	train-other-500	who was packing the trunk said Come in And Chee Chee very proudly took the animal inside and showed him to the Doctor What in the world is it asked John Dolittle gazing at the strange creature
29-126858-0011	train-other-500	Lord save us cried the duck How does it make up its mind It doesn t look to me as though it had any said Jip the dog
29-126858-0012	train-other-500	This Doctor said Chee Chee is the pushmi pullyu the rarest animal of the African jungles the only two headed beast in the world Take him home with you
29-126858-0013	train-other-500	and your fortune s made People will pay any money to see him But I don t want any money said the Doctor Yes you do said Dab Dab the duck
none	none	 Don t you remember how we had to pinch and scrape to pay the butcher s bill in Puddleby And how are you going to get the sailor the new boat you spoke of unless we have the money to buy it I was going to make him one said the Doctor 
29-126858-0014	train-other-500	Oh do be sensible cried Dab Dab Where would you get all the wood and the nails to make one with And besides what are we going to live on We shall be poorer than ever when we get back Chee Chee s perfectly right
29-126858-0015	train-other-500	take the funny looking thing along do Well perhaps there is something in what you say murmured the Doctor It certainly would make a nice new kind of pet But does the er
none	none	 what do you call it 
29-126858-0016	train-other-500	really want to go abroad Yes I ll go said the pushmi pullyu who saw at once from the Doctor s face that he was a man to be trusted You have been so kind to the animals here
29-126858-0017	train-other-500	and the monkeys tell me that I am the only one who will do But you must promise me that if I do not like it in the Land of the White Men you will send me back Why certainly of course of course said the Doctor
29-126858-0018	train-other-500	Excuse me surely you are related to the Deer Family are you not Yes
none	none	 said the pushmi pullyu 
29-126858-0019	train-other-500	to the Abyssinian Gazelles and the Asiatic Chamois on my mother s side My father s great grandfather was the last of the Unicorns Most interesting murmured the Doctor
29-126858-0020	train-other-500	and he took a book out of the trunk which Dab Dab was packing and began turning the pages Let us see if Buffon says anything
none	none	 I notice said the duck that you only talk with one of your mouths 
29-126858-0021	train-other-500	Can t the other head talk as well Oh yes said the pushmi pullyu But I keep the other mouth for eating mostly In that way I can talk while I am eating without being rude Our people have always been very polite
29-126858-0022	train-other-500	When the packing was finished and everything was ready to start the monkeys gave a grand party for the Doctor and all the animals of the jungle came And they had pineapples and mangoes and honey
29-126858-0023	train-other-500	and all sorts of good things to eat and drink After they had all finished eating the Doctor got up and said My friends I am not clever at speaking long words after dinner like some men
29-126858-0024	train-other-500	and I have just eaten many fruits and much honey But I wish to tell you that I am very sad at leaving your beautiful country Because I have things to do in the Land of the White Men I must go
none	none	 After I have gone remember never to let the flies settle on your food before you eat it and do not sleep on the ground when the rains are coming I er er I hope you will all live happily ever after 
29-126858-0025	train-other-500	When the Doctor stopped speaking and sat down all the monkeys clapped their hands a long time and said to one another Let it be remembered always among our people that he sat and ate with us here under the trees
29-126858-0026	train-other-500	For surely he is the Greatest of Men And the Grand Gorilla who had the strength of seven horses in his hairy arms rolled a great rock up to the head of the table and said This stone
none	none	 for all time shall mark the spot 
29-126858-0027	train-other-500	And even to this day in the heart of the Jungle that stone still is there And monkey mothers passing through the forest with their families still point down at it from the branches
none	none	 and whisper to their children Sh There it is look where the Good White Man sat and ate food with us in the Year of the Great Sickness Then when the party was over 
29-126858-0028	train-other-500	the Doctor and his pets started out to go back to the seashore
none	none	 And all the monkeys went with him as far as the edge of their country carrying his trunk and bags to see him off THE ELEVENTH CHAPTER THE BLACK PRINCE 
101_126859_000003_000000	train-clean-360	BY the edge of the river they stopped and said farewell 
none	none	This took a long time because all those thousands of monkeys wanted to shake John Dolittle by the hand 
101_126859_000005_000000	train-clean-360	Afterwards when the Doctor and his pets were going on alone Polynesia said 
101_126859_000006_000000	train-clean-360	 We must tread softly and talk low as we go through the land of the Jolliginki 
101_126859_000006_000001	train-clean-360	If the King should hear us he will send his soldiers to catch us again for I am sure he is still very angry over the trick I played on him 
101_126859_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 What I am wondering said the Doctor is where we are going to get another boat to go home in 
none	none	Oh well perhaps we ll find one lying about on the beach that nobody is using
101_126859_000007_000002	train-clean-360	 Never lift your foot till you come to the stile 
101_126859_000008_000000	train-clean-360	One day while they were passing through a very thick part of the forest Chee Chee went ahead of them to look for cocoanuts 
101_126859_000008_000001	train-clean-360	And while he was away the Doctor and the rest of the animals who did not know the jungle paths so well got lost in the deep woods 
none	none	They wandered around and around but could not find their way down to the seashore 
101_126859_000009_000000	train-clean-360	Chee Chee when he could not see them anywhere was terribly upset 
101_126859_000009_000001	train-clean-360	He climbed high trees and looked out from the top branches to try and see the Doctor s high hat he waved and shouted he called to all the animals by name 
101_126859_000009_000002	train-clean-360	But it was no use 
101_126859_000009_000003	train-clean-360	They seemed to have disappeared altogether 
101_126859_000010_000000	train-clean-360	Indeed they had lost their way very badly 
101_126859_000010_000001	train-clean-360	They had strayed a long way off the path and the jungle was so thick with bushes and creepers and vines that sometimes they could hardly move at all and the Doctor had to take out his pocket knife and cut his way along 
none	none	They stumbled into wet boggy places they got all tangled up in thick convolvulus runners they scratched themselves on thorns and twice they nearly lost the medicine bag in the under brush 
101_126859_000010_000003	train-clean-360	There seemed no end to their troubles and nowhere could they come upon a path 
101_126859_000011_000000	train-clean-360	At last after blundering about like this for many days getting their clothes torn and their faces covered with mud they walked right into the King s back garden by mistake 
101_126859_000011_000001	train-clean-360	The King s men came running up at once and caught them 
none	none	But Polynesia flew into a tree in the garden without anybody seeing her and hid herself The Doctor and the rest were taken before the King Ha ha cried the King
101_126859_000013_000001	train-clean-360	 So you are caught again 
101_126859_000013_000002	train-clean-360	This time you shall not escape 
101_126859_000013_000003	train-clean-360	Take them all back to prison and put double locks on the door 
101_126859_000013_000004	train-clean-360	This White Man shall scrub my kitchen floor for the rest of his life 
101_126859_000014_000000	train-clean-360	So the Doctor and his pets were led back to prison and locked up 
101_126859_000014_000001	train-clean-360	And the Doctor was told that in the morning he must begin scrubbing the kitchen floor 
none	none	They were all very unhappy
101_126859_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 This is a great nuisance said the Doctor 
none	none	I really must get back to Puddleby That poor sailor will think I ve stolen his ship if I don t get home soon I wonder if those hinges are loose But the door was very strong and firmly locked There seemed no chance of getting out 
101_126859_000017_000002	train-clean-360	Then Gub Gub began to cry again 
none	none	All this time Polynesia was still sitting in the tree in the palace garden She was saying nothing and blinking her eyes 
101_126859_000019_000000	train-clean-360	This was always a very bad sign with Polynesia 
101_126859_000019_000001	train-clean-360	Whenever she said nothing and blinked her eyes it meant that somebody had been making trouble and she was thinking out some way to put things right 
101_126859_000019_000002	train-clean-360	People who made trouble for Polynesia or her friends were nearly always sorry for it afterwards 
101_126859_000020_000000	train-clean-360	Presently she spied Chee Chee swinging through the trees still looking for the Doctor 
101_126859_000020_000001	train-clean-360	When Chee Chee saw her he came into her tree and asked her what had become of him 
none	none	The Doctor and all the animals have been caught by the King s men and locked up again whispered Polynesia
101_126859_000021_000001	train-clean-360	 We lost our way in the jungle and blundered into the palace garden by mistake 
none	none	But couldn t you guide them asked Chee Chee and he began to scold the parrot for letting them get lost while he was away looking for the cocoanuts
101_126859_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 It was all that stupid pig s fault said Polynesia 
none	none	He would keep running off the path hunting for ginger roots 
101_126859_000023_000002	train-clean-360	And I was kept so busy catching him and bringing him back that I turned to the left instead of the right when we reached the swamp Sh Look 
none	none	There s Prince Bumpo coming into the garden He must not see us Don t move whatever you do 
101_126859_000024_000000	train-clean-360	And there sure enough was Prince Bumpo the King s son opening the garden gate 
101_126859_000024_000001	train-clean-360	He carried a book of fairy tales under his arm 
101_126859_000024_000002	train-clean-360	He came strolling down the gravel walk humming a sad song till he reached a stone seat right under the tree where the parrot and the monkey were hiding 
none	none	Then he lay down on the seat and began reading the fairy stories to himself 
101_126859_000025_000000	train-clean-360	Chee Chee and Polynesia watched him keeping very quiet and still 
none	none	After a while the King s son laid the book down and sighed a weary sigh If I were only a WHITE prince said he with a dreamy far away look in his eyes 
101_126859_000028_000000	train-clean-360	Then the parrot talking in a small high voice like a little girl said aloud 
101_126859_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 Bumpo some one might turn thee into a white prince perchance 
101_126859_000030_000000	train-clean-360	The King s son started up off the seat and looked all around 
none	none	What is this I hear he cried Methought the sweet music of a fairy s silver voice rang from yonder bower Strange Worthy Prince said Polynesia keeping very still so Bumpo couldn t see her thou sayest winged words of truth 
101_126859_000032_000001	train-clean-360	For tis I Tripsitinka the Queen of the Fairies that speak to thee 
none	none	I am hiding in a rose bud
101_126859_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh tell me Fairy Queen cried Bumpo clasping his hands in joy who is it can turn me white 
none	none	In thy father s prison said the parrot there lies a famous wizard John Dolittle by name Many things he knows of medicine and magic and mighty deeds has he performed Yet thy kingly father leaves him languishing long and lingering hours 
101_126859_000034_000003	train-clean-360	Go to him brave Bumpo secretly when the sun has set and behold thou shalt be made the whitest prince that ever won fair lady 
101_126859_000034_000004	train-clean-360	I have said enough 
none	none	I must now go back to Fairyland Farewell
101_126859_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 Farewell cried the Prince 
101_126859_000035_000001	train-clean-360	 A thousand thanks good Tripsitinka 
none	none	And he sat down on the seat again with a smile upon his face waiting for the sun to set THE TWELFTH CHAPTER MEDICINE AND MAGIC VERY very quietly making sure that no one should see her Polynesia then slipped out at the back of the tree and flew across to the prison 
101_126860_000005_000000	train-clean-360	She found Gub Gub poking his nose through the bars of the window trying to sniff the cooking smells that came from the palace kitchen She told the pig to bring the Doctor to the window because she wanted to speak to him 
101_126860_000005_000001	train-clean-360	So Gub Gub went and woke the Doctor who was taking a nap 
none	none	Listen whispered the parrot when John Dolittle s face appeared Prince Bumpo is coming here to night to see you 
101_126860_000006_000001	train-clean-360	And you ve got to find some way to turn him white 
none	none	But be sure to make him promise you first that he will open the prison door and find a ship for you to cross the sea in This is all very well said the Doctor
101_126860_000007_000001	train-clean-360	 But it isn t so easy to turn a black man white 
none	none	You speak as though he were a dress to be re dyed It s not so simple Shall the leopard change his spots or the Ethiopian his skin you know
101_126860_000008_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t know anything about that said Polynesia impatiently 
none	none	But you MUST turn this man white Think of a way think hard You ve got plenty of medicines left in the bag 
101_126860_000008_000004	train-clean-360	He ll do anything for you if you change his color 
101_126860_000008_000005	train-clean-360	It is your only chance to get out of prison 
101_126860_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 Well I suppose it MIGHT be possible said the Doctor 
none	none	Let me see and he went over to his medicine bag murmuring something about liberated chlorine on animal pigment perhaps zinc ointment as a temporary measure spread thick 
101_126860_000010_000000	train-clean-360	Well that night Prince Bumpo came secretly to the Doctor in prison and said to him 
101_126860_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 White Man I am an unhappy prince 
none	none	Years ago I went in search of The Sleeping Beauty whom I had read of in a book And having traveled through the world many days I at last found her and kissed the lady very gently to awaken her as the book said I should Tis true indeed that she awoke 
101_126860_000011_000004	train-clean-360	But when she saw my face she cried out Oh he s black And she ran away and wouldn t marry me but went to sleep again somewhere else 
101_126860_000011_000005	train-clean-360	So I came back full of sadness to my father s kingdom 
none	none	Now I hear that you are a wonderful magician and have many powerful potions 
101_126860_000011_000007	train-clean-360	So I come to you for help 
101_126860_000011_000008	train-clean-360	If you will turn me white so that I may go back to The Sleeping Beauty I will give you half my kingdom and anything besides you ask 
none	none	Prince Bumpo said the Doctor looking thoughtfully at the bottles in his medicine bag supposing I made your hair a nice blonde color would not that do instead to make you happy
101_126860_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 No said Bumpo 
none	none	Nothing else will satisfy me 
101_126860_000013_000002	train-clean-360	I must be a white prince 
101_126860_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 You know it is very hard to change the color of a prince said the Doctor one of the hardest things a magician can do 
101_126860_000014_000001	train-clean-360	You only want your face white do you not 
101_126860_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes that is all said Bumpo 
none	none	Because I shall wear shining armor and gauntlets of steel like the other white princes and ride on a horse Must your face be white all over asked the Doctor
101_126860_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes all over said Bumpo and I would like my eyes blue too but I suppose that would be very hard to do 
101_126860_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes it would said the Doctor quickly 
101_126860_000018_000001	train-clean-360	 Well I will do what I can for you 
none	none	You will have to be very patient though you know with some medicines you can never be very sure 
101_126860_000018_000003	train-clean-360	I might have to try two or three times 
101_126860_000018_000004	train-clean-360	You have a strong skin yes 
none	none	Well that s all right 
101_126860_000018_000006	train-clean-360	Now come over here by the light Oh but before I do anything you must first go down to the beach and get a ship ready with food in it to take me across the sea 
none	none	Do not speak a word of this to any one And when I have done as you ask you must let me and all my animals out of prison Promise by the crown of Jolliginki So the Prince promised and went away to get a ship ready at the seashore 
101_126860_000020_000000	train-clean-360	When he came back and said that it was done the Doctor asked Dab Dab to bring a basin 
101_126860_000020_000001	train-clean-360	Then he mixed a lot of medicines in the basin and told Bumpo to dip his face in it 
none	none	The Prince leaned down and put his face in right up to the ears 
101_126860_000022_000000	train-clean-360	He held it there a long time so long that the Doctor seemed to get dreadfully anxious and fidgety standing first on one leg and then on the other looking at all the bottles he had used for the mixture and reading the labels on them again and again 
101_126860_000022_000001	train-clean-360	A strong smell filled the prison like the smell of brown paper burning 
101_126860_000023_000000	train-clean-360	At last the Prince lifted his face up out of the basin breathing very hard 
none	none	And all the animals cried out in surprise For the Prince s face had turned as white as snow and his eyes which had been mud colored were a manly gray When John Dolittle lent him a little looking glass to see himself in he sang for joy and began dancing around the prison But the Doctor asked him not to make so much noise about it and when he had closed his medicine bag in a hurry he told him to open the prison door 
101_126860_000026_000000	train-clean-360	Bumpo begged that he might keep the looking glass as it was the only one in the Kingdom of Jolliginki and he wanted to look at himself all day long 
none	none	But the Doctor said he needed it to shave with 
101_126860_000027_000000	train-clean-360	Then the Prince taking a bunch of copper keys from his pocket undid the great double locks 
101_126860_000027_000001	train-clean-360	And the Doctor with all his animals ran as fast as they could down to the seashore while Bumpo leaned against the wall of the empty dungeon smiling after them happily his big face shining like polished ivory in the light of the moon 
101_126860_000028_000000	train-clean-360	When they came to the beach they saw Polynesia and Chee Chee waiting for them on the rocks near the ship 
101_126860_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 I feel sorry about Bumpo said the Doctor 
none	none	I am afraid that medicine I used will never last Most likely he will be as black as ever when he wakes up in the morning that s one reason why I didn t like to leave the mirror with him But then again he MIGHT stay white I had never used that mixture before To tell the truth I was surprised myself that it worked so well 
101_126860_000030_000004	train-clean-360	But I had to do something didn t I I couldn t possibly scrub the King s kitchen for the rest of my life 
101_126860_000030_000005	train-clean-360	It was such a dirty kitchen I could see it from the prison window Well well Poor Bumpo 
101_126860_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh of course he will know we were just joking with him said the parrot 
none	none	They had no business to lock us up said Dab Dab waggling her tail angrily We never did them any harm 
101_126860_000032_000002	train-clean-360	Serve him right if he does turn black again 
101_126860_000032_000003	train-clean-360	I hope it s a dark black 
101_126860_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 But HE didn t have anything to do with it said the Doctor 
none	none	It was the King his father who had us locked up it wasn t Bumpo s fault I wonder if I ought to go back and apologize Oh well I ll send him some candy when I get to Puddleby 
101_126860_000033_000002	train-clean-360	And who knows he may stay white after all 
none	none	The Sleeping Beauty would never have him even if he did said Dab Dab He looked better the way he was I thought But he d never be anything but ugly no matter what color he was made
101_126860_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 Still he had a good heart said the Doctor romantic of course but a good heart 
101_126860_000035_000001	train-clean-360	After all handsome is as handsome does 
101_126860_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t believe the poor booby found The Sleeping Beauty at all said Jip the dog 
none	none	Most likely he kissed some farmer s fat wife who was taking a snooze under an apple tree Can t blame her for getting scared 
101_126860_000036_000003	train-clean-360	I wonder who he ll go and kiss this time 
101_126860_000036_000004	train-clean-360	Silly business 
none	none	Then the pushmi pullyu the white mouse Gub Gub Dab Dab Jip and the owl Too Too went on to the ship with the Doctor But Chee Chee Polynesia and the crocodile stayed behind because Africa was their proper home the land where they were born 
101_126860_000038_000000	train-clean-360	And when the Doctor stood upon the boat he looked over the side across the water 
none	none	And then he remembered that they had no one with them to guide them back to Puddleby The wide wide sea looked terribly big and lonesome in the moonlight and he began to wonder if they would lose their way when they passed out of sight of land 
101_126860_000040_000000	train-clean-360	But even while he was wondering they heard a strange whispering noise high in the air coming through the night 
101_126860_000040_000001	train-clean-360	And the animals all stopped saying Good by and listened 
none	none	The noise grew louder and bigger 
101_126860_000041_000001	train-clean-360	It seemed to be coming nearer to them a sound like the Autumn wind blowing through the leaves of a poplar tree or a great great rain beating down upon a roof 
101_126860_000042_000000	train-clean-360	And Jip with his nose pointing and his tail quite straight said 
101_126860_000043_000000	train-clean-360	 Birds millions of them flying fast that s it 
101_126860_000044_000000	train-clean-360	And then they all looked up 
none	none	And there streaming across the face of the moon like a huge swarm of tiny ants they could see thousands and thousands of little birds Soon the whole sky seemed full of them and still more kept coming more and more 
101_126860_000044_000003	train-clean-360	There were so many that for a little they covered the whole moon so it could not shine and the sea grew dark and black like when a storm cloud passes over the sun 
101_126860_000045_000000	train-clean-360	And presently all these birds came down close skimming over the water and the land and the night sky was left clear above and the moon shone as before 
none	none	Still never a call nor a cry nor a song they made no sound but this great rustling of feathers which grew greater now than ever 
101_126860_000045_000002	train-clean-360	When they began to settle on the sands along the ropes of the ship anywhere and everywhere except the trees the Doctor could see that they had blue wings and white breasts and very short feathered legs 
none	none	As soon as they had all found a place to sit suddenly there was no noise left anywhere all was quiet all was still 
101_126860_000046_000000	train-clean-360	And in the silent moonlight John Dolittle spoke 
none	none	I had no idea that we had been in Africa so long 
101_126860_000047_000001	train-clean-360	It will be nearly Summer when we get home 
101_126860_000047_000002	train-clean-360	For these are the swallows going back Swallows I thank you for waiting for us 
none	none	It is very thoughtful of you Now we need not be afraid that we will lose our way upon the sea 
101_126860_000047_000005	train-clean-360	Pull up the anchor and set the sail 
101_126860_000048_000000	train-clean-360	When the ship moved out upon the water those who stayed behind Chee Chee Polynesia and the crocodile grew terribly sad 
none	none	For never in their lives had they known any one they liked so well as Doctor John Dolittle of Puddleby on the Marsh And after they had called Good by to him again and again and again they still stood there upon the rocks crying bitterly and waving till the ship was out of sight THE THIRTEENTH CHAPTER RED SAILS AND BLUE WINGS 
101_126861_000004_000000	train-clean-360	SAILING homeward the Doctor s ship had to pass the coast of Barbary This coast is the seashore of the Great Desert 
none	none	It is a wild lonely place all sand and stones 
101_126861_000004_000002	train-clean-360	And it was here that the Barbary pirates lived 
101_126861_000005_000000	train-clean-360	These pirates a bad lot of men used to wait for sailors to be shipwrecked on their shores 
101_126861_000005_000001	train-clean-360	And often if they saw a boat passing they would come out in their fast sailing ships and chase it 
none	none	When they caught a boat like this at sea they would steal everything on it and after they had taken the people off they would sink the ship and sail back to Barbary singing songs and feeling proud of the mischief they had done 
101_126861_000005_000003	train-clean-360	Then they used to make the people they had caught write home to their friends for money 
none	none	And if the friends sent no money the pirates often threw the people into the sea Now one sunshiny day the Doctor and Dab Dab were walking up and down on the ship for exercise a nice fresh wind was blowing the boat along and everybody was happy Presently Dab Dab saw the sail of another ship a long way behind them on the edge of the sea It was a red sail I don t like the look of that sail said Dab Dab
101_126861_000007_000001	train-clean-360	 I have a feeling it isn t a friendly ship 
none	none	I am afraid there is more trouble coming to us 
101_126861_000008_000000	train-clean-360	Jip who was lying near taking a nap in the sun began to growl and talk in his sleep 
101_126861_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 I smell roast beef cooking he mumbled underdone roast beef with brown gravy over it 
none	none	Good gracious cried the Doctor
101_126861_000010_000001	train-clean-360	 What s the matter with the dog Is he SMELLING in his sleep as well as talking 
none	none	I suppose he is said Dab Dab All dogs can smell in their sleep
101_126861_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 But what is he smelling asked the Doctor 
none	none	There is no roast beef cooking on our ship No said Dab Dab The roast beef must be on that other ship over there But that s ten miles away said the Doctor He couldn t smell that far surely
101_126861_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh yes he could said Dab Dab 
none	none	You ask him 
101_126861_000016_000000	train-clean-360	Then Jip still fast asleep began to growl again and his lip curled up angrily showing his clean white teeth 
none	none	I smell bad men he growled the worst men I ever smelt 
101_126861_000017_000001	train-clean-360	I smell trouble 
none	none	I smell a fight six bad scoundrels fighting against one brave man 
101_126861_000017_000003	train-clean-360	I want to help him 
none	none	Woof oo WOOF 
101_126861_000017_000005	train-clean-360	Then he barked loud and woke himself up with a surprised look on his face 
101_126861_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 See cried Dab Dab 
101_126861_000018_000001	train-clean-360	 That boat is nearer now 
101_126861_000018_000002	train-clean-360	You can count its three big sails all red 
none	none	Whoever it is they are coming after us 
101_126861_000018_000004	train-clean-360	I wonder who they are 
101_126861_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 They are bad sailors said Jip and their ship is very swift 
none	none	They are surely the pirates of Barbary
101_126861_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 Well we must put up more sails on our boat said the Doctor so we can go faster and get away from them 
none	none	Run downstairs Jip and fetch me all the sails you see 
101_126861_000021_000000	train-clean-360	The dog hurried downstairs and dragged up every sail he could find 
none	none	But even when all these were put up on the masts to catch the wind the boat did not go nearly as fast as the pirates which kept coming on behind closer and closer
101_126861_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 This is a poor ship the Prince gave us said Gub Gub the pig the slowest he could find I should think 
none	none	Might as well try to win a race in a soup tureen as hope to get away from them in this old barge 
101_126861_000023_000002	train-clean-360	Look how near they are now You can see the mustaches on the faces of the men six of them 
101_126861_000023_000003	train-clean-360	What are we going to do 
none	none	Then the Doctor asked Dab Dab to fly up and tell the swallows that pirates were coming after them in a swift ship and what should he do about it 
101_126861_000025_000000	train-clean-360	When the swallows heard this they all came down on to the Doctor s ship and they told him to unravel some pieces of long rope and make them into a lot of thin strings as quickly as he could 
101_126861_000025_000001	train-clean-360	Then the ends of these strings were tied on to the front of the ship and the swallows took hold of the strings with their feet and flew off pulling the boat along 
101_126861_000026_000000	train-clean-360	And although swallows are not very strong when only one or two are by themselves it is different when there are a great lot of them together 
none	none	And there tied to the Doctor s ship were a thousand strings and two thousand swallows were pulling on each string all terribly swift fliers And in a moment the Doctor found himself traveling so fast he had to hold his hat on with both hands for he felt as though the ship itself were flying through waves that frothed and boiled with speed 
101_126861_000028_000000	train-clean-360	And all the animals on the ship began to laugh and dance about in the rushing air for when they looked back at the pirates ship they could see that it was growing smaller now instead of bigger 
none	none	The red sails were being left far far behind THE FOURTEENTH CHAPTER THE RATS WARNING DRAGGING a ship through the sea is hard work And after two or three hours the swallows began to get tired in the wings and short of breath Then they sent a message down to the Doctor to say that they would have to take a rest soon and that they would pull the boat over to an island not far off and hide it in a deep bay till they had got breath enough to go on And presently the Doctor saw the island they had spoken of It had a very beautiful high green mountain in the middle of it When the ship had sailed safely into the bay where it could not be seen from the open sea the Doctor said he would get off on to the island to look for water because there was none left to drink on his ship And he told all the animals to get out too and romp on the grass to stretch their legs Now as they were getting off the Doctor noticed that a whole lot of rats were coming up from downstairs and leaving the ship as well Jip started to run after them because chasing rats had always been his favorite game But the Doctor told him to stop And one big black rat who seemed to want to say something to the Doctor now crept forward timidly along the rail watching the dog out of the corner of his eye And after he had coughed nervously two or three times and cleaned his whiskers and wiped his mouth he said Ahem er you know of course that all ships have rats in them Doctor do you not And the Doctor said Yes And you have heard that rats always leave a sinking ship Yes said the Doctor so I ve been told People said the rat always speak of it with a sneer as though it were something disgraceful But you can t blame us can you After all who WOULD stay on a sinking ship if he could get off it It s very natural said the Doctor very natural I quite understand Was there Was there anything else you wished to say Yes said the rat I ve come to tell you that we are leaving this one But we wanted to warn you before we go This is a bad ship you have here It isn t safe The sides aren t strong enough Its boards are rotten Before to morrow night it will sink to the bottom of the sea But how do you know asked the Doctor We always know answered the rat The tips of our tails get that tingly feeling like when your foot s asleep This morning at six o clock while I was getting breakfast my tail suddenly began to tingle At first I thought it was my rheumatism coming back So I went and asked my aunt how she felt you remember her the long piebald rat rather skinny who came to see you in Puddleby last Spring with jaundice Well and she said HER tail was tingling like everything Then we knew for sure that this boat was going to sink in less than two days and we all made up our minds to leave it as soon as we got near enough to any land It s a bad ship Doctor Don t sail in it any more or you ll be surely drowned Good by We are now going to look for a good place to live on this island Good by said the Doctor And thank you very much for coming to tell me Very considerate of you very Give my regards to your aunt I remember her perfectly Leave that rat alone Jip Come here Lie down So then the Doctor and all his animals went off carrying pails and saucepans to look for water on the island while the swallows took their rest I wonder what is the name of this island said the Doctor as he was climbing up the mountainside It seems a pleasant place What a lot of birds there are Why these are the Canary Islands said Dab Dab Don t you hear the canaries singing The Doctor stopped and listened Why to be sure of course he said How stupid of me I wonder if they can tell us where to find water And presently the canaries who had heard all about Doctor Dolittle from birds of passage came and led him to a beautiful spring of cool clear water where the canaries used to take their bath and they showed him lovely meadows where the bird seed grew and all the other sights of their island And the pushmi pullyu was glad they had come because he liked the green grass so much better than the dried apples he had been eating on the ship And Gub Gub squeaked for joy when he found a whole valley full of wild sugarcane A little later when they had all had plenty to eat and drink and were lying on their backs while the canaries sang for them two of the swallows came hurrying up very flustered and excited Doctor they cried the pirates have come into the bay and they ve all got on to your ship They are downstairs looking for things to steal They have left their own ship with nobody on it If you hurry and come down to the shore you can get on to their ship which is very fast and escape But you ll have to hurry That s a good idea said the Doctor splendid And he called his animals together at once said Good by to the canaries and ran down to the beach When they reached the shore they saw the pirate ship with the three red sails standing in the water and just as the swallows had said there was nobody on it all the pirates were downstairs in the Doctor s ship looking for things to steal So John Dolittle told his animals to walk very softly and they all crept on to the pirate ship THE FIFTEENTH CHAPTER THE BARBARY DRAGON EVERYTHING would have gone all right if the pig had not caught a cold in his head while eating the damp sugar cane on the island This is what happened After they had pulled up the anchor without a sound and were moving the ship very very carefully out of the bay Gub Gub suddenly sneezed so loud that the pirates on the other ship came rushing upstairs to see what the noise was As soon as they saw that the Doctor was escaping they sailed the other boat right across the entrance to the bay so that the Doctor could not get out into the open sea Then the leader of these bad men who called himself Ben Ali The Dragon shook his fist at the Doctor and shouted across the water Ha Ha You are caught my fine friend You were going to run off in my ship eh But you are not a good enough sailor to beat Ben Ali the Barbary Dragon I want that duck you ve got and the pig too We ll have pork chops and roast duck for supper to night And before I let you go home you must make your friends send me a trunk full of gold Poor Gub Gub began to weep and Dab Dab made ready to fly to save her life But the owl Too Too whispered to the Doctor Keep him talking Doctor Be pleasant to him Our old ship is bound to sink soon the rats said it would be at the bottom of the sea before to morrow night and the rats are never wrong Be pleasant till the ship sinks under him Keep him talking What until to morrow night said the Doctor Well I ll do my best Let me see What shall I talk about Oh let them come on said Jip We can fight the dirty rascals There are only six of them Let them come on I d love to tell that collie next door when we get home that I had bitten a real pirate Let em come We can fight them But they have pistols and swords said the Doctor No that would never do I must talk to him Look here Ben Ali But before the Doctor could say any more the pirates began to sail the ship nearer laughing with glee and saying one to another Who shall be the first to catch the pig Poor Gub Gub was dreadfully frightened and the pushmi pullyu began to sharpen his horns for a fight by rubbing them on the mast of the ship while Jip kept springing into the air and barking and calling Ben Ali bad names in dog language But presently something seemed to go wrong with the pirates they stopped laughing and cracking jokes they looked puzzled something was making them uneasy Then Ben Ali staring down at his feet suddenly bellowed out Thunder and Lightning Men THE BOAT S LEAKING And then the other pirates peered over the side and they saw that the boat was indeed getting lower and lower in the water And one of them said to Ben Ali But surely if this old boat were sinking we should see the rats leaving it And Jip shouted across from the other ship You great duffers there are no rats there to leave They left two hours ago Ha ha to you my fine friends But of course the men did not understand him Soon the front end of the ship began to go down and down faster and faster till the boat looked almost as though it were standing on its head and the pirates had to cling to the rails and the masts and the ropes and anything to keep from sliding off Then the sea rushed roaring in and through all the windows and the doors And at last the ship plunged right down to the bottom of the sea making a dreadful gurgling sound and the six bad men were left bobbing about in the deep water of the bay Some of them started to swim for the shores of the island while others came and tried to get on to the boat where the Doctor was But Jip kept snapping at their noses so they were afraid to climb up the side of the ship Then suddenly they all cried out in great fear THE SHARKS The sharks are coming Let us get on to the ship before they eat us Help help The sharks The sharks And now the Doctor could see all over the bay the backs of big fishes swimming swiftly through the water And one great shark came near to the ship and poking his nose out of the water he said to the Doctor Are you John Dolittle the famous animal doctor Yes said Doctor Dolittle That is my name Well said the shark we know these pirates to be a bad lot especially Ben Ali If they are annoying you we will gladly eat them up for you and then you won t be troubled any more Thank you said the Doctor This is really most attentive But I don t think it will be necessary to eat them Don t let any of them reach the shore until I tell you just keep them swimming about will you And please make Ben Ali swim over here that I may talk to him So the shark went off and chased Ben Ali over to the Doctor Listen Ben Ali said John Dolittle leaning over the side You have been a very bad man and I understand that you have killed many people These good sharks here have just offered to eat you up for me and twould indeed be a good thing if the seas were rid of you But if you will promise to do as I tell you I well let you go in safety What must I do asked the pirate looking down sideways at the big shark who was smelling his leg under the water You must kill no more people said the Doctor you must stop stealing you must never sink another ship you must give up being a pirate altogether But what shall I do then asked Ben Ali How shall I live You and all your men must go on to this island and be bird seed farmers the Doctor answered You must grow bird seed for the canaries The Barbary Dragon turned pale with anger GROW BIRD SEED he groaned in disgust Can t I be a sailor No said the Doctor you cannot You have been a sailor long enough and sent many stout ships and good men to the bottom of the sea For the rest of your life you must be la peaceful farmer The shark is waiting Do not waste any more of his time Make up your mind Thunder and Lightning Ben Ali muttered BIRD SEED Then he looked down into the water again and saw the great fish smelling his other leg Very well he said sadly We ll be farmers And remember said the Doctor that if you do not keep your promise if you start killing and stealing again I shall hear of it because the canaries will come and tell me And be very sure that I will find a way to punish you For though I may not be able to sail a ship as well as you so long as the birds and the beasts and the fishes are my friends I do not have to be afraid of a pirate chief even though he call himself The Dragon of Barbary Now go and be a good farmer and live in peace Then the Doctor turned to the big shark and waving his hand he said All right Let them swim safely to the land

253-126864-0001	train-other-500	TOO TOO THE LISTENER HAVING thanked the sharks again for their kindness the Doctor and his pets set off once more on their journey home in the swift ship with the three red sails As they moved out into the open sea
253-126864-0002	train-other-500	the animals all went downstairs to see what their new boat was like inside while the Doctor leant on the rail at the back of the ship with a pipe in his mouth watching the Canary Islands fade away in the blue dusk of the evening
253-126864-0003	train-other-500	While he was standing there wondering how the monkeys were getting on and what his garden would look like when he got back to Puddleby
none	none	 Dab Dab came tumbling up the stairs all smiles and full of news Doctor she cried This ship of the pirates is simply beautiful absolutely The beds downstairs are made of primrose silk with hundreds of big pillows and cushions 
253-126864-0004	train-other-500	there are thick soft carpets on the floors the dishes are made of silver and there are all sorts of good things to eat and drink special things

253-126864-0006	train-other-500	door locked and we are all crazy to get in and see what s inside Jip says it must be where the pirates kept their treasure But we
none	none	 can t open the door 
253-126864-0007	train-other-500	Come down and see if you can let us in So the Doctor went downstairs and he saw that it was indeed a beautiful ship He found the animals gathered round a little door all talking at once trying to guess what was inside
253-126864-0008	train-other-500	The Doctor turned the handle but it wouldn t open Then they all started to hunt for the key They looked under the mat
none	none	 they looked under all the carpets 
253-126864-0009	train-other-500	they looked in all the cupboards and drawers and lockers in the big chests in the ship s dining room they looked everywhere While they were doing this they discovered a lot of new and wonderful things that the pirates must have stolen from other ships
none	none	 Kashmir shawls as thin as a cobweb 
253-126864-0010	train-other-500	embroidered with flowers of gold jars of fine tobacco from Jamaica carved ivory boxes full of Russian tea an old violin with a string broken and a picture on the back

253-126864-0012	train-other-500	six wine glasses with turquoise and silver round the rims and a lovely great sugar bowl made of mother o pearl But nowhere in the whole boat could they find a key to fit that lock
253-126864-0013	train-other-500	So they all came back to the door and Jip peered through the key hole But something had been stood against the wall on the inside and he could see nothing While they were standing around wondering what they should do the owl
none	none	 Too Too suddenly said Sh Listen 
253-126864-0014	train-other-500	I do believe there s some one in there They all kept still a moment Then the Doctor said You must be mistaken Too Too I don t hear anything
none	none	 I m sure of it 
253-126864-0015	train-other-500	said the owl Sh There it is again Don t you hear that No I do not said the Doctor What kind of a sound is it
253-126864-0016	train-other-500	I hear the noise of some one putting his hand in his pocket said the owl But that makes hardly any sound at all said the Doctor You couldn t hear that out here
253-126864-0017	train-other-500	Pardon me but I can said Too Too I tell you there is some one on the other side of that door putting his hand in his pocket Almost
253-126864-0018	train-other-500	everything makes SOME noise if your ears are only sharp enough to catch it Bats can hear a mole walking in his tunnel under the earth
253-126864-0019	train-other-500	and they think they re good hearers
none	none	 But we owls can tell you 
253-126864-0020	train-other-500	using only one ear the color of a kitten from the way it winks in the dark Well well said the Doctor You surprise me That s very interesting
253-126864-0021	train-other-500	Listen again and tell me what he s doing now I m not sure yet said Too Too if it s a man at all Maybe it s a woman
253-126864-0022	train-other-500	Lift me up and let me listen at the key hole and I ll soon tell you
none	none	 So the Doctor lifted the owl up and held him close to the lock of the door 
253-126864-0023	train-other-500	After a moment Too Too said
none	none	 Now he s rubbing his face with his left hand It is a small hand and a small face It MIGHT be a woman No 
253-126864-0024	train-other-500	Now he pushes his hair back off his forehead It s a man all right Women sometimes do that said the Doctor True said the owl
253-126864-0025	train-other-500	But when they do their long hair makes quite a different sound
none	none	 Sh Make that fidgety pig keep still 
253-126864-0026	train-other-500	Now all hold your breath a moment so I can listen well
none	none	 This is very difficult 
253-126864-0027	train-other-500	what I m doing now
none	none	 and the pesky door is so thick Sh 
253-126864-0028	train-other-500	Everybody quite still shut your eyes and don t breathe Too Too leaned down and listened again very hard and long At last he looked up into the Doctor s face and said
253-126864-0029	train-other-500	The man in there is unhappy He weeps He has taken care not to blubber or sniffle lest we should find out that he is crying But I heard
none	none	 quite distinctly the sound of a tear falling on his sleeve How do you know it wasn t a drop of water falling off the ceiling on him asked Gub Gub Pshaw 
253-126864-0030	train-other-500	Such ignorance sniffed Too Too A drop of water falling off the ceiling would have made ten times as much noise Well said the Doctor
253-126864-0031	train-other-500	if the poor fellow s unhappy we ve got to get in and see what s the matter with him
none	none	 Find me an axe and I ll chop the door down THE SEVENTEENTH CHAPTER 
253-126865-0000	train-other-500	THE OCEAN GOSSIPS RIGHT away an axe was found And the Doctor soon chopped a hole in the door big enough to clamber through At first he could see nothing at all it was so dark inside So he struck a match
253-126865-0001	train-other-500	The room was quite small no window the ceiling low For furniture there was only one little stool
none	none	 All round the room big barrels stood against the walls 
253-126865-0002	train-other-500	fastened at the bottom so they wouldn t tumble with the rolling of the ship and above the barrels pewter jugs of all sizes hung from wooden pegs There was a strong winey smell And in the middle of the floor sat a little boy
253-126865-0003	train-other-500	about eight years old crying bitterly
none	none	 I declare it is the pirates rum room 
253-126865-0004	train-other-500	said Jip in a whisper Yes Very rum said Gub Gub The smell makes me giddy
253-126865-0005	train-other-500	The little boy seemed rather frightened to find a man standing there before him and all those animals staring in through the hole in the broken door But as soon as he saw John Dolittle s face by the light of the match he stopped crying and got up
253-126865-0006	train-other-500	You aren t one of the pirates are you he asked And when the Doctor threw back his head and laughed long and loud the little boy smiled too and came and took his hand You laugh like a friend
253-126865-0007	train-other-500	he said not like a pirate Could you tell me where my uncle is I am afraid I can t said the Doctor When did you see him last It was the day before yesterday said the boy
none	none	 I and my uncle were out fishing in our little boat 
253-126865-0008	train-other-500	when the pirates came and caught us They sunk our fishing boat and brought us both on to this ship They told my uncle that they wanted him to be a pirate like them for he was clever at sailing a ship in all weathers
253-126865-0009	train-other-500	But he said he didn t want to be a pirate because killing people and stealing was no work for a good fisherman to do Then the leader Ben Ali got very angry and gnashed his teeth
253-126865-0010	train-other-500	and said they would throw my uncle into the sea if he didn t do as they said They sent me downstairs and I heard the noise of a fight going on above And when they let me come up again next day
253-126865-0011	train-other-500	my uncle was nowhere to be seen I asked the pirates where he was but they wouldn t tell me I am very much afraid they threw him into the sea and drowned him
253-126865-0012	train-other-500	And the little boy began to cry again Well now wait a minute said the Doctor Don t cry Let s go and have tea in the dining room and we ll talk it over Maybe your uncle is quite safe all the time
none	none	 You don t KNOW that he was drowned do you 
253-126865-0013	train-other-500	And that s something Perhaps we can find him for you First we ll go and have tea with strawberry jam
none	none	 and then we will see what can be done All the animals had been standing around listening with great curiosity 
253-126865-0014	train-other-500	And when they had gone into the ship s dining room and were having tea Dab Dab came up behind the Doctor s chair and whispered Ask the porpoises if the boy s uncle was drowned they ll know All right said the Doctor
253-126865-0015	train-other-500	taking a second piece of bread and jam What are those funny clicking noises you are making with your tongue asked the boy Oh I just said a couple of words in duck language the Doctor answered
253-126865-0016	train-other-500	This is Dab Dab one of my pets I didn t even know that ducks had a language said the boy Are all these other animals your pets too What is that strange looking thing with two heads
253-126865-0017	train-other-500	Sh the Doctor whispered That is the pushmi pullyu Don t let him see we re talking about him he gets so dreadfully embarrassed Tell me how did you come to be locked up in that little room
253-126865-0018	train-other-500	The pirates shut me in there when they were going off to steal things from another ship When I heard some one chopping on the door I didn t know who it could be I was very glad to find it was you
253-126865-0019	train-other-500	Do you think you will be able to find my uncle for me Well we are going to try very hard said the Doctor Now what was your uncle like to look at He had red hair the boy answered very red hair
253-126865-0020	train-other-500	and the picture of an anchor tattooed on his arm He was a strong man a kind uncle and the best sailor in the South Atlantic His fishing boat was called The Saucy Sally a cutter rigged sloop
253-126865-0021	train-other-500	What s cutterigsloop whispered Gub Gub turning to Jip Sh That s the kind of a ship the man had said Jip
253-126865-0022	train-other-500	Keep still can t you Oh said the pig is that all I thought it was something to drink So the Doctor left the boy to play with the animals in the dining room
253-126865-0023	train-other-500	and went upstairs to look for passing porpoises And soon a whole school came dancing and jumping through the water on their way to Brazil When they saw the Doctor leaning on the rail of his ship they came over to see how he was getting on
253-126865-0024	train-other-500	And the Doctor asked them if they had seen anything of a man with red hair and an anchor tattooed on his arm
none	none	 Do you mean the master of The Saucy Sally 
253-126865-0025	train-other-500	asked the porpoises Yes said the Doctor That s the man Has he been drowned
none	none	 His fishing sloop was sunk 
253-126865-0026	train-other-500	said the porpoises for we saw it lying on the bottom of the sea But there was nobody inside it because we went and looked His little nephew is on the ship with me here said the Doctor And he is terribly afraid that the pirates threw his uncle into the sea
253-126865-0027	train-other-500	Would you be so good as to find out for me for sure whether he has been drowned or not
none	none	 Oh 
253-126865-0028	train-other-500	he isn t drowned said the porpoises If he were we would be sure to have heard of it from the deep sea Decapods We hear all the salt water news The shell fish call us The Ocean Gossips No tell the little boy we are sorry we do not know where his uncle is
253-126865-0029	train-other-500	but we are quite certain he hasn t been drowned in the sea So the Doctor ran downstairs with the news and told the nephew who clapped his hands with happiness And the pushmi pullyu took the little boy on his back and gave him a ride round the dining room table
none	none	 while all the other animals followed behind beating the dish covers with spoons pretending it was a parade THE EIGHTEENTH CHAPTER SMELLS YOUR uncle must now be FOUND said the Doctor that is the next thing now that we know he wasn t thrown into the sea Then Dab Dab came up to him again and whispered Ask the eagles to look for the man No living creature can see better than an eagle When they are miles high in the air they can count the ants crawling on the ground Ask the eagles So the Doctor sent one of the swallows off to get some eagles And in about an hour the little bird came back with six different kinds of eagles a Black Eagle a Bald Eagle a Fish Eagle a Golden Eagle an Eagle Vulture and a White tailed Sea Eagle Twice as high as the boy they were each one of them And they stood on the rail of the ship like round shouldered soldiers all in a row stern and still and stiff while their great gleaming black eyes shot darting glances here and there and everywhere Gub Gub was scared of them and got behind a barrel He said he felt as though those terrible eyes were looking right inside of him to see what he had stolen for lunch And the Doctor said to the eagles A man has been lost a fisherman with red hair and an anchor marked on his arm Would you be so kind as to see if you can find him for us This boy is the man s nephew Eagles do not talk very much And all they answered in their husky voices was You may be sure that we will do our best for John Dolittle Then they flew off and Gub Gub came out from behind his barrel to see them go Up and up and up they went higher and higher and higher still Then when the Doctor could only just see them they parted company and started going off all different ways North East South and West looking like tiny grains of black sand creeping across the wide blue sky My gracious said Gub Gub in a hushed voice What a height I wonder they don t scorch their feathers so near the sun They were gone a long time And when they came back it was almost night And the eagles said to the Doctor We have searched all the seas and all the countries and all the islands and all the cities and all the villages in this half of the world But we have failed In the main street of Gibraltar we saw three red hairs lying on a wheel barrow before a baker s door But they were not the hairs of a man they were the hairs out of a fur coat Nowhere on land or water could we see any sign of this boy s uncle And if WE could not see him then he is not to be seen For John Dolittle we have done our best Then the six great birds flapped their big wings and flew back to their homes in the mountains and the rocks Well said Dab Dab after they had gone what are we going to do now The boy s uncle MUST be found there s no two ways about that The lad isn t old enough to be knocking around the world by himself Boys aren t like ducklings they have to be taken care of till they re quite old I wish Chee Chee were here He would soon find the man Good old Chee Chee I wonder how he s getting on If we only had Polynesia with us said the white mouse SHE would soon think of some way Do you remember how she got us all out of prison the second time My but she was a clever one I don t think so much of those eagle fellows said Jip They re just conceited They may have very good eyesight and all that but when you ask them to find a man for you they can t do it and they have the cheek to come back and say that nobody else could do it They re just conceited like that collie in Puddleby And I don t think a whole lot of those gossipy old porpoises either All they could tell us was that the man isn t in the sea We don t want to know where he ISN T we want to know where he IS Oh don t talk so much said Gub Gub It s easy to talk but it isn t so easy to find a man when you have got the whole world to hunt him in Maybe the fisherman s hair has turned white worrying about the boy and that was why the eagles didn t find him You don t know everything You re just talking You are not doing anything to help You couldn t find the boy s uncle any more than the eagles could you couldn t do as well Couldn t I said the dog That s all you know you stupid piece of warm bacon I haven t begun to try yet have I You wait and see Then Jip went to the Doctor and said Ask the boy if he has anything in his pockets that belonged to his uncle will you please So the Doctor asked him And the boy showed them a gold ring which he wore on a piece of string around his neck because it was too big for his finger He said his uncle gave it to him when they saw the pirates coming Jip smelt the ring and said That s no good Ask him if he has anything else that belonged to his uncle Then the boy took from his pocket a great big red handkerchief and said This was my uncle s too As soon as the boy pulled it out Jip shouted SNUFF by Jingo Black Rappee snuff Don t you smell it His uncle took snuff Ask him Doctor The Doctor questioned the boy again and he said Yes My uncle took a lot of snuff Fine said Jip The man s as good as found Twill be as easy as stealing milk from a kitten Tell the boy I ll find his uncle for him in less than a week Let us go upstairs and see which way the wind is blowing But it is dark now said the Doctor You can t find him in the dark I don t need any light to look for a man who smells of Black Rappee snuff said Jip as he climbed the stairs If the man had a hard smell like string now or hot water it would be different But SNUFF Tut tut Does hot water have a smell asked the Doctor Certainly it has said Jip Hot water smells quite different from cold water It is warm water or ice that has the really difficult smell Why I once followed a man for ten miles on a dark night by the smell of the hot water he had used to shave with for the poor fellow had no soap Now then let us see which way the wind is blowing Wind is very important in long distance smelling It mustn t be too fierce a wind and of course it must blow the right way A nice steady damp breeze is the best of all Ha This wind is from the North Then Jip went up to the front of the ship and smelt the wind and he started muttering to himself Tar Spanish onions kerosene oil wet raincoats crushed laurel leaves rubber burning lace curtains being washed No my mistake lace curtains hanging out to dry and foxes hundreds of em cubs and Can you really smell all those different things in this one wind asked the Doctor Why of course said Jip And those are only a few of the easy smells the strong ones Any mongrel could smell those with a cold in the head Wait now and I ll tell you some of the harder scents that are coming on this wind a few of the dainty ones Then the dog shut his eyes tight poked his nose straight up in the air and sniffed hard with his mouth half open For a long time he said nothing He kept as still as a stone He hardly seemed to be breathing at all When at last he began to speak it sounded almost as though he were singing sadly in a dream Bricks he whispered very low old yellow bricks crumbling with age in a garden wall the sweet breath of young cows standing in a mountain stream the lead roof of a dove cote or perhaps a granary with the mid day sun on it black kid gloves lying in a bureau drawer of walnut wood a dusty road with a horses drinking trough beneath the sycamores little mushrooms bursting through the rotting leaves and and and Any parsnips asked Gub Gub No said Jip You always think of things to eat No parsnips whatever And no snuff plenty of pipes and cigarettes and a few cigars But no snuff We must wait till the wind changes to the South Yes it s a poor wind that said Gub Gub I think you re a fake Jip Who ever heard of finding a man in the middle of the ocean just by smell I told you you couldn t do it Look here said Jip getting really angry You re going to get a bite on the nose in a minute You needn t think that just because the Doctor won t let us give you what you deserve that you can be as cheeky as you like Stop quarreling said the Doctor Stop it Life s too short Tell me Jip where do you think those smells are coming from From Devon and Wales most of them said Jip The wind is coming that way Well well said the Doctor You know that s really quite remarkable quite I must make a note of that for my new book I wonder if you could train me to smell as well as that But no perhaps I m better off the way I am Enough is as good as a feast they say Let s go down to supper I m quite hungry So am I said Gub Gub THE NINETEENTH CHAPTER THE ROCK UP they got early next morning out of the silken beds and they saw that the sun was shining brightly and that the wind was blowing from the South Jip smelt the South wind for half an hour Then he came to the Doctor shaking his head I smell no snuff as yet he said We must wait till the wind changes to the East But even when the East wind came at three o clock that afternoon the dog could not catch the smell of snuff The little boy was terribly disappointed and began to cry again saying that no one seemed to be able to find his uncle for him But all Jip said to the Doctor was Tell him that when the wind changes to the West I ll find his uncle even though he be in China so long as he is still taking Black Rappee snuff Three days they had to wait before the West wind came This was on a Friday morning early just as it was getting light A fine rainy mist lay on the sea like a thin fog And the wind was soft and warm and wet As soon as Jip awoke he ran upstairs and poked his nose in the air Then he got most frightfully excited and rushed down again to wake the Doctor up Doctor he cried I ve got it Doctor Doctor Wake up Listen I ve got it The wind s from the West and it smells of nothing but snuff Come upstairs and start the ship quick So the Doctor tumbled out of bed and went to the rudder to steer the ship Now I ll go up to the front said Jip and you watch my nose whichever way I point it you turn the ship the same way The man cannot be far off with the smell as strong as this And the wind s all lovely and wet Now watch me So all that morning Jip stood in the front part of the ship sniffing the wind and pointing the way for the Doctor to steer while all the animals and the little boy stood round with their eyes wide open watching the dog in wonder About lunch time Jip asked Dab Dab to tell the Doctor that he was getting worried and wanted to speak to him So Dab Dab went and fetched the Doctor from the other end of the ship and Jip said to him The boy s uncle is starving We must make the ship go as fast as we can How do you know he is starving asked the Doctor Because there is no other smell in the West wind but snuff said Jip If the man were cooking or eating food of any kind I would be bound to smell it too But he hasn t even fresh water to drink All he is taking is snuff in large pinches We are getting nearer to him all the time because the smell grows stronger every minute But make the ship go as fast as you can for I am certain that the man is starving All right said the Doctor and he sent Dab Dab to ask the swallows to pull the ship the same as they had done when the pirates were chasing them So the stout little birds came down and once more harnessed themselves to the ship And now the boat went bounding through the waves at a terrible speed It went so fast that the fishes in the sea had to jump for their lives to get out of the way and not be run over And all the animals got tremendously excited and they gave up looking at Jip and turned to watch the sea in front to spy out any land or islands where the starving man might be But hour after hour went by and still the ship went rushing on over the same flat flat sea and no land anywhere came in sight And now the animals gave up chattering and sat around silent anxious and miserable The little boy again grew sad And on Jip s face there was a worried look At last late in the afternoon just as the sun was going down the owl Too Too who was perched on the tip of the mast suddenly startled them all by crying out at the top of his voice Jip Jip I see a great great rock in front of us look way out there where the sky and the water meet See the sun shine on it like gold Is the smell coming from there And Jip called back Yes That s it That is where the man is At last at last And when they got nearer they could see that the rock was very large as large as a big field No trees grew on it no grass nothing The great rock was as smooth and as bare as the back of a tortoise Then the Doctor sailed the ship right round the rock But nowhere on it could a man be seen All the animals screwed up their eyes and looked as hard as they could and John Dolittle got a telescope from downstairs But not one living thing could they spy not even a gull nor a star fish nor a shred of sea weed They all stood still and listened straining their ears for any sound But the only noise they heard was the gentle lapping of the little waves against the sides of their ship Then they all started calling Hulloa there HULLOA till their voices were hoarse But only the echo came back from the rock And the little boy burst into tears and said I am afraid I shall never see my uncle any more What shall I tell them when I get home But Jip called to the Doctor He must be there he must HE MUST The smell goes on no further He must be there I tell you Sail the ship close to the rock and let me jump out on it So the Doctor brought the ship as close as he could and let down the anchor Then he and Jip got out of the ship on to the rock Jip at once put his nose down close to the ground and began to run all over the place Up and down he went back and forth zig zagging twisting doubling and turning And everywhere he went the Doctor ran behind him close at his heels till he was terribly out of breath At last Jip let out a great bark and sat down And when the Doctor came running up to him he found the dog staring into a big deep hole in the middle of the rock The boy s uncle is down there said Jip quietly No wonder those silly eagles couldn t see him It takes a dog to find a man So the Doctor got down into the hole which seemed to be a kind of cave or tunnel running a long way under the ground Then he struck a match and started to make his way along the dark passage with Jip following behind The Doctor s match soon went out and he had to strike another and another and another At last the passage came to an end and the Doctor found himself in a kind of tiny room with walls of rock And there in the middle of the room his head resting on his arms lay a man with very red hair fast asleep Jip went up and sniffed at something lying on the ground beside him The Doctor stooped and picked it up It was an enormous snuff box And it was full of Black Rappee THE TWENTIETH CHAPTER THE FISHERMAN S TOWN GENTLY then very gently the Doctor woke the man up But just at that moment the match went out again And the man thought it was Ben Ali coming back and he began to punch the Doctor in the dark But when John Dolittle told him who it was and that he had his little nephew safe on his ship the man was tremendously glad and said he was sorry he had fought the Doctor He had not hurt him much though because it was too dark to punch properly Then he gave the Doctor a pinch of snuff And the man told how the Barbary Dragon had put him on to this rock and left him there when he wouldn t promise to become a pirate and how he used to sleep down in this hole because there was no house on the rock to keep him warm And then he said For four days I have had nothing to eat or drink I have lived on snuff There you are said Jip What did I tell you So they struck some more matches and made their way out through the passage into the daylight and the Doctor hurried the man down to the boat to get some soup When the animals and the little boy saw the Doctor and Jip coming back to the ship with a red headed man they began to cheer and yell and dance about the boat And the swallows up above started whistling at the top of their voices thousands and millions of them to show that they too were glad that the boy s brave uncle had been found The noise they made was so great that sailors far out at sea thought that a terrible storm was coming Hark to that gale howling in the East they said And Jip was awfully proud of himself though he tried hard not to look conceited When Dab Dab came to him and said Jip I had no idea you were so clever he just tossed his head and answered Oh that s nothing special But it takes a dog to find a man you know Birds are no good for a game like that Then the Doctor asked the red haired fisherman where his home was And when he had told him the Doctor asked the swallows to guide the ship there first And when they had come to the land which the man had spoken of they saw a little fishing town at the foot of a rocky mountain and the man pointed out the house where he lived And while they were letting down the anchor the little boy s mother who was also the man s sister came running down to the shore to meet them laughing and crying at the same time She had been sitting on a hill for twenty days watching the sea and waiting for them to return And she kissed the Doctor many times so that he giggled and blushed like a school girl And she tried to kiss Jip too but he ran away and hid inside the ship It s a silly business this kissing he said I don t hold by it Let her go and kiss Gub Gub if she MUST kiss something The fisherman and his sister didn t want the Doctor to go away again in a hurry They begged him to spend a few days with them So John Dolittle and his animals had to stay at their house a whole Saturday and Sunday and half of Monday And all the little boys of the fishing village went down to the beach and pointed at the great ship anchored there and said to one another in whispers Look That was a pirate ship Ben Ali s the most terrible pirate that ever sailed the Seven Seas That old gentleman with the high hat who s staying up at missus Trevelyan s HE took the ship away from The Barbary Dragon and made him into a farmer Who d have thought it of him him so gentle like and all Look at the great red sails Ain t she the wicked looking ship and fast My All those two days and a half that the Doctor stayed at the little fishing town the people kept asking him out to teas and luncheons and dinners and parties all the ladies sent him boxes of flowers and candies and the village band played tunes under his window every night At last the Doctor said Good people I must go home now You have really been most kind I shall always remember it But I must go home for I have things to do Then just as the Doctor was about to leave the Mayor of the town came down the street and a lot of other people in grand clothes with him And the Mayor stopped before the house where the Doctor was living and everybody in the village gathered round to see what was going to happen After six page boys had blown on shining trumpets to make the people stop talking the Doctor came out on to the steps and the Mayor spoke Doctor John Dolittle said he It is a great pleasure for me to present to the man who rid the seas of the Dragon of Barbary this little token from the grateful people of our worthy Town And the Mayor took from his pocket a little tissue paper packet and opening it he handed to the Doctor a perfectly beautiful watch with real diamonds in the back Then the Mayor pulled out of his pocket a still larger parcel and said Where is the dog Then everybody started to hunt for Jip And at last Dab Dab found him on the other side of the village in a stable yard where all the dogs of the country side were standing round him speechless with admiration and respect When Jip was brought to the Doctor s side the Mayor opened the larger parcel and inside was a dog collar made of solid gold And a great murmur of wonder went up from the village folk as the Mayor bent down and fastened it round the dog s neck with his own hands For written on the collar in big letters were these words JIP THE CLEVEREST DOG IN THE WORLD Then the whole crowd moved down to the beach to see them off And after the red haired fisherman and his sister and the little boy had thanked the Doctor and his dog over and over and over again the great swift ship with the red sails was turned once more towards Puddleby and they sailed out to sea while the village band played music on the shore THE LAST CHAPTER HOME AGAIN MARCH winds had come and gone April s showers were over May s buds had opened into flower and the June sun was shining on the pleasant fields when John Dolittle at last got back to his own country But he did not yet go home to Puddleby First he went traveling through the land with the pushmi pullyu in a gipsy wagon stopping at all the country fairs And there with the acrobats on one side of them and the Punch and Judy show on the other they would hang out a big sign which read COME AND SEE THE MARVELOUS TWO HEADED ANIMAL FROM THE JUNGLES OF AFRICA Admission SIXPENCE And the pushmi pullyu would stay inside the wagon while the other animals would lie about underneath The Doctor sat in a chair in front taking the sixpences and smiling on the people as they went in and Dab Dab was kept busy all the time scolding him because he would let the children in for nothing when she wasn t looking And menagerie keepers and circus men came and asked the Doctor to sell them the strange creature saying they would pay a tremendous lot of money for him But the Doctor always shook his head and said No The pushmi pullyu shall never be shut up in a cage He shall be free always to come and go like you and me Many curious sights and happenings they saw in this wandering life but they all seemed quite ordinary after the great things they had seen and done in foreign lands It was very interesting at first being sort of part of a circus but after a few weeks they all got dreadfully tired of it and the Doctor and all of them were longing to go home But so many people came flocking to the little wagon and paid the sixpence to go inside and see the pushmi pullyu that very soon the Doctor was able to give up being a showman And one fine day when the hollyhocks were in full bloom he came back to Puddleby a rich man to live in the little house with the big garden And the old lame horse in the stable was glad to see him and so were the swallows who had already built their nests under the eaves of his roof and had young ones And Dab Dab was glad too to get back to the house she knew so well although there was a terrible lot of dusting to be done with cobwebs everywhere And after Jip had gone and shown his golden collar to the conceited collie next door he came back and began running round the garden like a crazy thing looking for the bones he had buried long ago and chasing the rats out of the tool shed while Gub Gub dug up the horseradish which had grown three feet high in the corner by the garden wall And the Doctor went and saw the sailor who had lent him the boat and he bought two new ships for him and a rubber doll for his baby and he paid the grocer for the food he had lent him for the journey to Africa And he bought another piano and put the white mice back in it because they said the bureau drawer was drafty Even when the Doctor had filled the old money box on the dresser shelf he still had a lot of money left and he had to get three more money boxes just as big to put the rest in Money he said is a terrible nuisance But it s nice not to have to worry Yes said Dab Dab who was toasting muffins for his tea it is indeed And when the Winter came again and the snow flew against the kitchen window the Doctor and his animals would sit round the big warm fire after supper and he would read aloud to them out of his books But far away in Africa where the monkeys chattered in the palm trees before they went to bed under the big yellow moon they would say to one another I wonder what The Good Man s doing now over there in the Land of the White Men Do you think he ever will come back And Polynesia would squeak out from the vines I think he will I guess he will I hope he will And then the crocodile would grunt up at them from the black mud of the river I m SURE he will Go to sleep End
