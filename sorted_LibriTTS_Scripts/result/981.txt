none	none	To him an heir was afterward born a son in his halls whom heaven sent to favor the folk feeling their woe that erst they had lacked an earl for leader so long a while the Lord endowed him the Wielder of Wonder with world s renown Famed was this Beowulf far flew the boast of him son of Scyld in the Scandian lands So becomes it a youth to quit him well with his father s friends by fee and gift that to aid him aged in after days come warriors willing should war draw nigh liegemen loyal by lauded deeds shall an earl have honor in every clan Forth he fared at the fated moment sturdy Scyld to the shelter of God Then they bore him over to ocean s billow loving clansmen as late he charged them while wielded words the winsome Scyld the leader beloved who long had ruled In the roadstead rocked a ring dight vessel ice flecked outbound atheling s barge there laid they down their darling lord on the breast of the boat the breaker of rings by the mast the mighty one Many a treasure fetched from far was freighted with him No ship have I known so nobly dight with weapons of war and weeds of battle with breastplate and blade on his bosom lay a heaped hoard that hence should go far o er the flood with him floating away No less these loaded the lordly gifts thanes huge treasure than those had done who in former time forth had sent him sole on the seas a suckling child High o er his head they hoist the standard a gold wove banner let billows take him gave him to ocean Grave were their spirits mournful their mood No man is able to say in sooth no son of the halls no hero neath heaven who harbored that freight I Now Beowulf bode in the burg of the Scyldings leader beloved and long he ruled in fame with all folk since his father had gone away from the world till awoke an heir haughty Healfdene who held through life sage and sturdy the Scyldings glad Then one after one there woke to him to the chieftain of clansmen children four Heorogar then Hrothgar then Halga brave and I heard that was s queen the Heathoscylfing s helpmate dear To Hrothgar was given such glory of war such honor of combat that all his kin obeyed him gladly till great grew his band of youthful comrades It came in his mind to bid his henchmen a hall uprear a master mead house mightier far than ever was seen by the sons of earth and within it then to old and young he would all allot that the Lord had sent him save only the land and the lives of his men Wide I heard was the work commanded for many a tribe this mid earth round to fashion the folkstead It fell as he ordered in rapid achievement that ready it stood there of halls the noblest Heorot he named it whose message had might in many a land Not reckless of promise the rings he dealt treasure at banquet there towered the hall high gabled wide the hot surge waiting of furious flame Nor far was that day when father and son in law stood in feud for warfare and hatred that woke again With envy and anger an evil spirit endured the dole in his dark abode that he heard each day the din of revel high in the hall there harps rang out clear song of the singer He sang who knew tales of the early time of man how the Almighty made the earth fairest fields enfolded by water set triumphant sun and moon for a light to lighten the land dwellers and braided bright the breast of earth with limbs and leaves made life for all of mortal beings that breathe and move So lived the clansmen in cheer and revel a winsome life till one began to fashion evils that field of hell Grendel this monster grim was called march riever mighty in moorland living in fen and fastness fief of the giants the hapless wight a while had kept since the Creator his exile doomed On kin of Cain was the killing avenged by sovran God for slaughtered Abel Ill fared his feud and far was he driven for the slaughter s sake from sight of men Of Cain awoke all that woful breed Etins and elves and evil spirits as well as the giants that warred with God weary while but their wage was paid them II WENT he forth to find at fall of night that haughty house and heed wherever the Ring Danes outrevelled to rest had gone Found within it the atheling band asleep after feasting and fearless of sorrow of human hardship Unhallowed wight grim and greedy he grasped betimes wrathful reckless from resting places thirty of the thanes and thence he rushed fain of his fell spoil faring homeward laden with slaughter his lair to seek Then at the dawning as day was breaking the might of Grendel to men was known then after wassail was wail uplifted loud moan in the morn The mighty chief atheling excellent unblithe sat labored in woe for the loss of his thanes when once had been traced the trail of the fiend spirit accurst too cruel that sorrow too long too loathsome Not late the respite with night returning anew began ruthless murder he recked no whit firm in his guilt of the feud and crime They were easy to find who elsewhere sought in room remote their rest at night bed in the bowers when that bale was shown was seen in sooth with surest token the hall thane s hate Such held themselves far and fast who the fiend outran Thus ruled unrighteous and raged his fill one against all until empty stood that lordly building and long it bode so Twelve years tide the trouble he bore sovran of Scyldings sorrows in plenty boundless cares There came unhidden tidings true to the tribes of men in sorrowful songs how ceaselessly Grendel harassed Hrothgar what hate he bore him what murder and massacre many a year feud unfading refused consent to deal with any of Daneland s earls make pact of peace or compound for gold still less did the wise men ween to get great fee for the feud from his fiendish hands But the evil one ambushed old and young death shadow dark and dogged them still lured or lurked in the livelong night of misty moorlands men may say not where the haunts of these Hell Runes be Such heaping of horrors the hater of men lonely roamer wrought unceasing harassings heavy O er Heorot he lorded gold bright hall in gloomy nights and ne er could the prince approach his throne twas judgment of God or have joy in his hall Sore was the sorrow to Scyldings friend heart rending misery Many nobles sat assembled and searched out counsel how it were best for bold hearted men against harassing terror to try their hand Whiles they vowed in their heathen fanes altar offerings asked with words that the slayer of souls would succor give them for the pain of their people Their practice this their heathen hope twas Hell they thought of in mood of their mind Almighty they knew not Doomsman of Deeds and dreadful Lord nor Heaven s Helmet heeded they ever Wielder of Wonder Woe for that man who in harm and hatred hales his soul to fiery embraces nor favor nor change awaits he ever But well for him that after death day may draw to his Lord and friendship find in the Father s arms III THUS seethed unceasing the son of Healfdene with the woe of these days not wisest men assuaged his sorrow too sore the anguish loathly and long that lay on his folk most baneful of burdens and bales of the night This heard in his home Hygelac s thane great among Geats of Grendel s doings He was the mightiest man of valor in that same day of this our life stalwart and stately A stout wave walker he bade make ready Yon battle king said he far o er the swan road he fain would seek the noble monarch who needed men The prince s journey by prudent folk was little blamed though they loved him dear they whetted the hero and hailed good omens And now the bold one from bands of Geats comrades chose the keenest of warriors e er he could find with fourteen men the sea wood he sought and sailor proved led them on to the land s confines Time had now flown afloat was the ship boat under bluff On board they climbed warriors ready waves were churning sea with sand the sailors bore on the breast of the bark their bright array their mail and weapons the men pushed off on its willing way the well braced craft Then moved o er the waters by might of the wind that bark like a bird with breast of foam till in season due on the second day the curved prow such course had run that sailors now could see the land sea cliffs shining steep high hills headlands broad Their haven was found their journey ended Up then quickly the Weders clansmen climbed ashore anchored their sea wood with armor clashing and gear of battle God they thanked or passing in peace o er the paths of the sea Now saw from the cliff a Scylding clansman a warden that watched the water side how they bore o er the gangway glittering shields war gear in readiness wonder seized him to know what manner of men they were Straight to the strand his steed he rode Hrothgar s henchman with hand of might he shook his spear and spake in parley Who are ye then ye armed men mailed folk that yon mighty vessel have urged thus over the ocean ways here o er the waters A warden I sentinel set o er the sea march here lest any foe to the folk of Danes with harrying fleet should harm the land No aliens ever at ease thus bore them linden wielders yet word of leave clearly ye lack from clansmen here my folk s agreement A greater ne er saw I of warriors in world than is one of you yon hero in harness No henchman he worthied by weapons if witness his features his peerless presence I pray you though tell your folk and home lest hence ye fare suspect to wander your way as spies in Danish land Now dwellers afar ocean travellers take from me simple advice the sooner the better I hear of the country whence ye came IV To him the stateliest spake in answer the warriors leader his word hoard unlocked We are by kin of the clan of Geats and Hygelac s own hearth fellows we To folk afar was my father known noble atheling Ecgtheow named Full of winters he fared away aged from earth he is honored still through width of the world by wise men all To thy lord and liege in loyal mood we hasten hither to Healfdene s son people protector be pleased to advise us To that mighty one come we on mickle errand to the lord of the Danes nor deem I right that aught be hidden We hear thou knowest if sooth it is the saying of men that amid the Scyldings a scathing monster dark ill doer in dusky nights shows terrific his rage unmatched hatred and murder To Hrothgar I in greatness of soul would succor bring so the Wise and Brave may worst his foes if ever the end of ills is fated of cruel contest if cure shall follow and the boiling care waves cooler grow else ever afterward anguish days he shall suffer in sorrow while stands in place high on its hill that house unpeered Astride his steed the strand ward answered clansman unquailing The keen souled thane must be skilled to sever and sunder duly words and works if he well intends I gather this band is graciously bent to the Scyldings master March then bearing weapons and weeds the way I show you I will bid my men your boat meanwhile to guard for fear lest foemen come your new tarred ship by shore of ocean faithfully watching till once again it waft o er the waters those well loved thanes winding neck d wood to Weders bounds heroes such as the hest of fate shall succor and save from the shock of war They bent them to march the boat lay still fettered by cable and fast at anchor broad bosomed ship Then shone the boars over the cheek guard chased with gold keen and gleaming guard it kept o er the man of war as marched along heroes in haste till the hall they saw broad of gable and bright with gold that was the fairest mid folk of earth of houses neath heaven where Hrothgar lived and the gleam of it lightened o er lands afar The sturdy shieldsman showed that bright burg of the boldest bade them go straightway thither his steed then turned hardy hero and hailed them thus Tis time that I fare from you Father Almighty in grace and mercy guard you well safe in your seekings Seaward I go gainst hostile warriors hold my watch V STONE BRIGHT the street it showed the way to the crowd of clansmen Corselets glistened hand forged hard on their harness bright the steel ring sang as they strode along in mail of battle and marched to the hall There weary of ocean the wall along they set their bucklers their broad shields down and bowed them to bench the breastplates clanged war gear of men their weapons stacked spears of the seafarers stood together gray tipped ash that iron band was worthily weaponed A warrior proud asked of the heroes their home and kin Whence now bear ye burnished shields harness gray and helmets grim spears in multitude Messenger I Hrothgar s herald Heroes so many ne er met I as strangers of mood so strong Tis plain that for prowess not plunged into exile for high hearted valor Hrothgar ye seek Him the sturdy in war bespake with words proud earl of the Weders answer made hardy neath helmet Hygelac s we fellows at board I am Beowulf named I am seeking to say to the son of Healfdene this mission of mine to thy master lord the doughty prince if he deign at all grace that we greet him the good one now Wulfgar spake the Wendles chieftain whose might of mind to many was known his courage and counsel The king of Danes the Scyldings friend I fain will tell the Breaker of Rings as the boon thou askest the famed prince of thy faring hither and swiftly after such answer bring as the doughty monarch may deign to give Hied then in haste to where Hrothgar sat white haired and old his earls about him till the stout thane stood at the shoulder there of the Danish king good courtier he Wulfgar spake to his winsome lord Hither have fared to thee far come men o er the paths of ocean people of Geatland and the stateliest there by his sturdy band is Beowulf named This boon they seek that they my master may with thee have speech at will nor spurn their prayer to give them hearing gracious Hrothgar In weeds of the warrior worthy they methinks of our liking their leader most surely a hero that hither his henchmen has led VI HROTHGAR answered helmet of Scyldings I knew him of yore in his youthful days his aged father was Ecgtheow named to whom at home gave Hrethel the Geat his only daughter Their offspring bold fares hither to seek the steadfast friend And seamen too have said me this who carried my gifts to the Geatish court thither for thanks he has thirty men s heft of grasp in the gripe of his hand the bold in battle Blessed God out of his mercy this man hath sent to Danes of the West as I ween indeed against horror of Grendel I hope to give the good youth gold for his gallant thought Be thou in haste and bid them hither clan of kinsmen to come before me and add this word they are welcome guests to folk of the Danes To the door of the hall Wulfgar went and the word declared To you this message my master sends East Danes king that your kin he knows hardy heroes and hails you all welcome hither o er waves of the sea Ye may wend your way in war attire and under helmets Hrothgar greet but let here the battle shields bide your parley and wooden war shafts wait its end Uprose the mighty one ringed with his men brave band of thanes some bode without battle gear guarding as bade the chief Then hied that troop where the herald led them under Heorot s roof the hero strode hardy neath helm till the hearth he neared Beowulf spake his breastplate gleamed war net woven by wit of the smith Thou Hrothgar hail Hygelac s I kinsman and follower Fame a plenty have I gained in youth These Grendel deeds I heard in my home land heralded clear Seafarers say how stands this hall of buildings best for your band of thanes empty and idle when evening sun in the harbor of heaven is hidden away So my vassals advised me well brave and wise the best of men O sovran Hrothgar to seek thee here for my nerve and my might they knew full well Themselves had seen me from slaughter come blood flecked from foes where five I bound and that wild brood worsted I the waves I slew nicors by night in need and peril avenging the Weders whose woe they sought crushing the grim ones Grendel now monster cruel be mine to quell in single battle So from thee thou sovran of the Shining Danes Scyldings bulwark a boon I seek and Friend of the folk refuse it not O Warriors shield now I ve wandered far that I alone with my liegemen here this hardy band may Heorot purge More I hear that the monster dire in his wanton mood of weapons recks not hence shall I scorn so Hygelac stay king of my kindred kind to me brand or buckler to bear in the fight gold colored targe but with gripe alone must I front the fiend and fight for life foe against foe Then faith be his in the doom of the Lord whom death shall take Fain I ween if the fight he win in this hall of gold my Geatish band will he fearless eat as oft before my noblest thanes Nor need saint thou then to hide my head for his shall I be dyed in gore if death must take me and my blood covered body he ll bear as prey ruthless devour it the roamer lonely with my life blood redden his lair in the fen no further for me need saint food prepare To Hygelac send if Hild should take me best of war weeds warding my breast armor excellent heirloom of Hrethel and work of Wayland Fares Wyrd as she must VII HROTHGAR spake the Scyldings helmet For fight defensive Friend my Beowulf to succor and save thou hast sought us here Thy father s combat a feud enkindled when Heatholaf with hand he slew among the Wylfings his Weder kin for horror of fighting feared to hold him Fleeing he sought our South Dane folk over surge of ocean the Honor Scyldings when first I was ruling the folk of Danes wielded youthful this widespread realm this hoard hold of heroes Heorogar was dead my elder brother had breathed his last Healfdene s bairn he was better than I Straightway the feud with fee I settled to the Wylfings sent o er watery ridges treasures olden oaths he swore me Sore is my soul to say to any of the race of man what ruth for me in Heorot Grendel with hate hath wrought what sudden harryings Hall folk fail me my warriors wane for Wyrd hath swept them into Grendel s grasp But God is able this deadly foe from his deeds to turn Boasted full oft as my beer they drank earls o er the ale cup armed men that they would bide in the beer hall here Grendel s attack with terror of blades Then was this mead house at morning tide dyed with gore when the daylight broke all the boards of the benches blood besprinkled gory the hall I had heroes the less doughty dear ones that death had reft But sit to the banquet unbind thy words hardy hero as heart shall prompt thee Gathered together the Geatish men in the banquet hall on bench assigned sturdy spirited sat them down hardy hearted A henchman attended carried the carven cup in hand served the clear mead Oft minstrels sang blithe in Heorot Heroes revelled no dearth of warriors Weder and Dane VIII UNFERTH spake the son of Ecglaf who sat at the feet of the Scyldings lord unbound the battle runes Beowulf s quest sturdy seafarer s sorely galled him ever he envied that other men should more achieve in middle earth of fame under heaven than he himself Art thou that Beowulf Breca s rival who emulous swam on the open sea when for pride the pair of you proved the floods and wantonly dared in waters deep to risk your lives No living man or lief or loath from your labor dire could you dissuade from swimming the main Ocean tides with your arms ye covered with strenuous hands the sea streets measured swam o er the waters Winter s storm rolled the rough waves In realm of sea a sennight strove ye In swimming he topped thee had more of main Him at morning tide billows bore to the Battling Reamas whence he hied to his home so dear beloved of his liegemen to land of Brondings fastness fair where his folk he ruled town and treasure In triumph o er thee Beanstan s bairn his boast achieved So ween I for thee a worse adventure though in buffet of battle thou brave hast been in struggle grim if Grendel s approach thou darst await through the watch of night Beowulf spake bairn of Ecgtheow What a deal hast uttered dear my Unferth drunken with beer of Breca now told of his triumph Truth I claim it that I had more of might in the sea than any man else more ocean endurance We twain had talked in time of youth and made our boast we were merely boys striplings still to stake our lives far at sea and so we performed it Naked swords as we swam along we held in hand with hope to guard us against the whales Not a whit from me could he float afar o er the flood of waves haste o er the billows nor him I abandoned Together we twain on the tides abode five nights full till the flood divided us churning waves and chillest weather darkling night and the northern wind ruthless rushed on us rough was the surge Now the wrath of the sea fish rose apace yet me gainst the monsters my mailed coat hard and hand linked help afforded battle sark braided my breast to ward garnished with gold There grasped me firm and haled me to bottom the hated foe with grimmest gripe Twas granted me though to pierce the monster with point of sword with blade of battle huge beast of the sea was whelmed by the hurly through hand of mine IX ME thus often the evil monsters thronging threatened With thrust of my sword the darling I dealt them due return Nowise had they bliss from their booty then to devour their victim vengeful creatures seated to banquet at bottom of sea but at break of day by my brand sore hurt on the edge of ocean up they lay put to sleep by the sword And since by them on the fathomless sea ways sailor folk are never molested Light from east came bright God s beacon the billows sank so that I saw the sea cliffs high windy walls For Wyrd oft saveth earl undoomed if he doughty be And so it came that I killed with my sword nine of the nicors Of night fought battles ne er heard I a harder neath heaven s dome nor adrift on the deep a more desolate man Yet I came unharmed from that hostile clutch though spent with swimming The sea upbore me flood of the tide on Finnish land the welling waters No wise of thee have I heard men tell such terror of falchions bitter battle

none	none	Too closely held him he who of men in might was strongest in that same day of this our life XII NOT in any wise would the earls defence suffer that slaughterous stranger to live useless deeming his days and years to men on earth Now many an earl of Beowulf brandished blade ancestral fain the life of their lord to shield their praised prince if power were theirs never they knew as

hateful alive was each to other The outlaw dire took mortal hurt a mighty wound showed on his shoulder and sinews cracked and the bone frame burst To Beowulf now the glory was given and Grendel thence death sick his den in the dark moor sought noisome abode he knew too well that here was the last of life an end of his days on earth To all the Danes by that bloody battle the boon had come From ravage had rescued the roving stranger Hrothgar s hall the hardy and wise one had purged it anew His night work pleased him his deed and its honor To Eastern Danes had the valiant Geat his vaunt made good all their sorrow and ills assuaged their bale of battle borne so long and all the dole they erst endured pain a plenty Twas proof of this when the hardy in fight a hand laid down arm and shoulder all indeed of Grendel s gripe neath the gabled roof XIII MANY at morning as men have told me warriors gathered the gift hall round folk leaders faring from far and near o er wide stretched ways the wonder to view trace of the traitor Not troublous seemed the enemy s end to any man who saw by the gait of the graceless foe how the weary hearted away from thence baffled in battle and banned his steps death marked dragged to the devils mere Bloody the billows were boiling there turbid the tide of tumbling waves horribly seething with sword blood hot by that doomed one dyed who in den of the moor laid forlorn his life adown his heathen soul and hell received it Home then rode the hoary clansmen from that merry journey and many a youth on horses white the hardy warriors back from the mere Then Beowulf s glory eager they echoed and all averred that from sea to sea or south or north there was no other in earth s domain under vault of heaven more valiant found of warriors none more worthy to rule On their lord beloved they laid no slight gracious Hrothgar a good king he From time to time the tried in battle their gray steeds set to gallop amain and ran a race when the road seemed fair From time to time a thane of the king who had made many vaunts and was mindful of verses stored with sagas and songs of old bound word to word in well knit rime welded his lay this warrior soon of Beowulf s quest right cleverly sang and artfully added an excellent tale in well ranged words of the warlike deeds he had heard in saga of Sigemund Strange the story he said it all the Waelsing s wanderings wide his struggles which never were told to tribes of men the feuds and the frauds save to Fitela only when of these doings he deigned to speak uncle to nephew as ever the twain stood side by side in stress of war and multitude of the monster kind they had felled with their swords Of Sigemund grew when he passed from life no little praise for the doughty in combat a dragon killed that herded the hoard under hoary rock the atheling dared the deed alone fearful quest nor was Fitela there Yet so it befell his falchion pierced that wondrous worm on the wall it struck best blade the dragon died in its blood Thus had the dread one by daring achieved over the ring hoard to rule at will himself to pleasure a sea boat he loaded and bore on its bosom the beaming gold son of Waels the worm was consumed He had of all heroes the highest renown among races of men this refuge of warriors for deeds of daring that decked his name since the hand and heart of Heremod grew slack in battle He swiftly banished to mingle with monsters at mercy of foes to death was betrayed for torrents of sorrow had lamed him too long a load of care to earls and athelings all he proved Oft indeed in earlier days for the warrior s wayfaring wise men mourned who had hoped of him help from harm and bale and had thought their sovran s son would thrive follow his father his folk protect the hoard and the stronghold heroes land home of Scyldings But here thanes said the kinsman of Hygelac kinder seemed to all the other was urged to crime And afresh to the race the fallow roads by swift steeds measured The morning sun was climbing higher Clansmen hastened to the high built hall those hardy minded the wonder to witness Warden of treasure crowned with glory the king himself with stately band from the bride bower strode and with him the queen and her crowd of maidens measured the path to the mead house fair XIV HROTHGAR spake to the hall he went stood by the steps the steep roof saw garnished with gold and Grendel s hand For the sight I see to the Sovran Ruler be speedy thanks A throng of sorrows I have borne from Grendel but God still works wonder on wonder the Warden of Glory It was but now that I never more for woes that weighed on me waited help long as I lived when laved in blood stood sword gore stained this stateliest house widespread woe for wise men all who had no hope to hinder ever foes infernal and fiendish sprites from havoc in hall This hero now by the Wielder s might a work has done that not all of us erst could ever do by wile and wisdom Lo well can she say whoso of women this warrior bore among sons of men if still she liveth that the God of the ages was good to her in the birth of her bairn Now Beowulf thee of heroes best I shall heartily love as mine own my son preserve thou ever this kinship new thou shalt never lack wealth of the world that I wield as mine Full oft for less have I largess showered my precious hoard on a punier man less stout in struggle Thyself hast now fulfilled such deeds that thy fame shall endure through all the ages As ever he did well may the Wielder reward thee still Beowulf spake bairn of Ecgtheow This work of war most willingly we have fought this fight and fearlessly dared force of the foe Fain too were I hadst thou but seen himself what time the fiend in his trappings tottered to fall Swiftly I thought in strongest gripe on his bed of death to bind him down that he in the hent of this hand of mine should breathe his last but he broke away Him I might not the Maker willed not hinder from flight and firm enough hold the life destroyer too sturdy was he the ruthless in running For rescue however he left behind him his hand in pledge arm and shoulder nor aught of help could the cursed one thus procure at all None the longer liveth he loathsome fiend sunk in his sins but sorrow holds him tightly grasped in gripe of anguish in baleful bonds where bide he must evil outlaw such awful doom as the Mighty Maker shall mete him out More silent seemed the son of Ecglaf in boastful speech of his battle deeds since athelings all through the earl s great prowess beheld that hand on the high roof gazing foeman s fingers the forepart of each of the sturdy nails to steel was likest heathen s hand spear hostile warrior s claw uncanny Twas clear they said that him no blade of the brave could touch how keen soever or cut away that battle hand bloody from baneful foe XV THERE was hurry and hest in Heorot now for hands to bedeck it and dense was the throng of men and women the wine hall to cleanse the guest room to garnish Gold gay shone the hangings that were wove on the wall and wonders many to delight each mortal that looks upon them Though braced within by iron bands that building bright was broken sorely rent were its hinges the roof alone held safe and sound when seared with crime the fiendish foe his flight essayed of life despairing No light thing that the flight for safety essay it who will Forced of fate he shall find his way to the refuge ready for race of man for soul possessors and sons of earth and there his body on bed of death shall rest after revel Arrived was the hour when to hall proceeded Healfdene s son the king himself would sit to banquet Ne er heard I of host in haughtier throng more graciously gathered round giver of rings Bowed then to bench those bearers of glory fain of the feasting Featly received many a mead cup the mighty in spirit kinsmen who sat in the sumptuous hall Hrothgar and Hrothulf Heorot now was filled with friends the folk of Scyldings ne er yet had tried the traitor s deed To Beowulf gave the bairn of Healfdene a gold wove banner guerdon of triumph broidered battle flag breastplate and helmet and a splendid sword was seen of many borne to the brave one Beowulf took cup in hall for such costly gifts he suffered no shame in that soldier throng For I heard of few heroes in heartier mood with four such gifts so fashioned with gold on the ale bench honoring others thus O er the roof of the helmet high a ridge wound with wires kept ward o er the head lest the relict of files should fierce invade sharp in the strife when that shielded hero should go to grapple against his foes Then the earls defence on the floor bade lead coursers eight with carven head gear adown the hall one horse was decked with a saddle all shining and set in jewels twas the battle seat of the best of kings when to play of swords the son of Healfdene was fain to fare Ne er failed his valor in the crush of combat when corpses fell To Beowulf over them both then gave the refuge of Ingwines right and power o er war steeds and weapons wished him joy of them Manfully thus the mighty prince hoard guard for heroes that hard fight repaid with steeds and treasures contemned by none who is willing to say the sooth aright XVI AND the lord of earls to each that came with Beowulf over the briny ways an heirloom there at the ale bench gave precious gift and the price bade pay in gold for him whom Grendel erst murdered and fain of them more had killed had not wisest God their Wyrd averted and the man s brave mood The Maker then ruled human kind as here and now Therefore is insight always best and forethought of mind How much awaits him of lief and of loath who long time here through days of warfare this world endures Then song and music mingled sounds in the presence of Healfdene s head of armies and harping was heard with the hero lay as Hrothgar s singer the hall joy woke along the mead seats making his song of that sudden raid on the sons of Finn Healfdene s hero Hnaef the Scylding was fated to fall in the Frisian slaughter Hildeburh needed not hold in value her enemies honor Innocent both were the loved ones she lost at the linden play bairn and brother they bowed to fate stricken by spears twas a sorrowful woman None doubted why the daughter of Hoc bewailed her doom when dawning came and under the sky she saw them lying kinsmen murdered where most she had kenned of the sweets of the world By war were swept too Finn s own liegemen and few were left in the parleying place he could ply no longer weapon nor war could he wage on Hengest and rescue his remnant by right of arms from the prince s thane A pact he offered another dwelling the Danes should have hall and high seat and half the power should fall to them in Frisian land and at the fee gifts Folcwald s son day by day the Danes should honor the folk of Hengest favor with rings even as truly with treasure and jewels with fretted gold as his Frisian kin he meant to honor in ale hall there Pact of peace they plighted further on both sides firmly Finn to Hengest with oath upon honor openly promised that woful remnant with wise men s aid nobly to govern so none of the guests by word or work should warp the treaty or with malice of mind bemoan themselves as forced to follow their fee giver s slayer lordless men as their lot ordained Should Frisian moreover with foeman s taunt that murderous hatred to mind recall then edge of the sword must seal his doom Oaths were given and ancient gold heaped from hoard The hardy Scylding battle thane best on his balefire lay All on the pyre were plain to see the gory sark the gilded swine crest boar of hard iron and athelings many slain by the sword at the slaughter they fell It was Hildeburh s hest at Hnaef s own pyre the bairn of her body on brands to lay his bones to burn on the balefire placed at his uncle s side In sorrowful dirges bewept them the woman great wailing ascended Then wound up to welkin the wildest of death fires roared o er the hillock heads all were melted gashes burst and blood gushed out from bites of the body Balefire devoured greediest spirit those spared not by war out of either folk their flower was gone XVII THEN hastened those heroes their home to see friendless to find the Frisian land houses and high burg Hengest still through the death dyed winter dwelt with Finn holding pact yet of home he minded though powerless his ring decked prow to drive over the waters now waves rolled fierce lashed by the winds or winter locked them in icy fetters Then fared another year to men s dwellings as yet they do the sunbright skies that their season ever duly await Far off winter was driven fair lay earth s breast and fain was the rover the guest to depart though more gladly he pondered on wreaking his vengeance than roaming the deep and how to hasten the hot encounter where sons of the Frisians were sure to be So he escaped not the common doom when Hun with Lafing the light of battle best of blades his bosom pierced its edge was famed with the Frisian earls On fierce heart Finn there fell likewise on himself at home the horrid sword death for Guthlaf and Oslaf of grim attack had sorrowing told from sea ways landed mourning their woes Finn s wavering spirit bode not in breast The burg was reddened with blood of foemen and Finn was slain king amid clansmen the queen was taken To their ship the Scylding warriors bore all the chattels the chieftain owned whatever they found in Finn s domain of gems and jewels The gentle wife o er paths of the deep to the Danes they bore led to her land The lay was finished the gleeman s song Then glad rose the revel bench joy brightened Bearers draw from their wonder vats wine Comes Wealhtheow forth under gold crown goes where the good pair sit uncle and nephew true each to the other one kindred in amity Unferth the spokesman at the Scylding lord s feet sat men had faith in his spirit his keenness of courage though kinsmen had found him unsure at the sword play The Scylding queen spoke Quaff of this cup my king and lord breaker of rings and blithe be thou gold friend of men to the Geats here speak such words of mildness as man should use Be glad with thy Geats of those gifts be mindful or near or far which now thou hast Men say to me as son thou wishest yon hero to hold Thy Heorot purged jewel hall brightest enjoy while thou canst with many a largess and leave to thy kin folk and realm when forth thou goest to greet thy doom For gracious I deem my Hrothulf willing to hold and rule nobly our youths if thou yield up first prince of Scyldings thy part in the world I ween with good he will well requite offspring of ours when all he minds that for him we did in his helpless days of gift and grace to gain him honor Then she turned to the seat where her sons wereplaced Hrethric and Hrothmund with heroes bairns young men together the Geat too sat there Beowulf brave the brothers between XVIII A CUP she gave him with kindly greeting and winsome words Of wounden gold she offered to honor him arm jewels twain corselet and rings and of collars the noblest that ever I knew the earth around Ne er heard I so mighty neath heaven s dome a hoard gem of heroes since Hama bore to his bright built burg the Brisings necklace jewel and gem casket Jealousy fled he Eormenric s hate chose help eternal Hygelac Geat grandson of Swerting on the last of his raids this ring bore with him under his banner the booty defending the war spoil warding but Wyrd o erwhelmed him what time in his daring dangers he sought feud with Frisians Fairest of gems he bore with him over the beaker of waves sovran strong under shield he died Fell the corpse of the king into keeping of Franks gear of the breast and that gorgeous ring weaker warriors won the spoil after gripe of battle from Geatland s lord and held the death field Din rose in hall Wealhtheow spake amid warriors and said This jewel enjoy in thy jocund youth Beowulf lov d these battle weeds wear a royal treasure and richly thrive Preserve thy strength and these striplings here counsel in kindness requital be mine Hast done such deeds that for days to come thou art famed among folk both far and near so wide as washeth the wave of Ocean his windy walls Through the ways of life prosper O prince I pray for thee rich possessions To son of mine be helpful in deed and uphold his joys Here every earl to the other is true mild of mood to the master loyal Thanes are friendly the throng obedient liegemen are revelling list and obey Went then to her place That was proudest of feasts flowed wine for the warriors Wyrd they knew not destiny dire and the doom to be seen by many an earl when eve should come and Hrothgar homeward hasten away royal to rest The room was guarded by an army of earls as erst was done They bared the bench boards abroad they spread beds and bolsters One beer carouser in danger of doom lay down in the hall At their heads they set their shields of war bucklers bright on the bench were there over each atheling easy to see the high battle helmet the haughty spear the corselet of rings Twas their custom so ever to be for battle prepared at home or harrying which it were even as oft as evil threatened their sovran king They were clansmen good XIX THEN sank they to sleep With sorrow one bought his rest of the evening as ofttime had happened when Grendel guarded that golden hall evil wrought till his end drew nigh slaughter for sins Twas seen and told how an avenger survived the fiend as was learned afar The livelong time after that grim fight Grendel s mother monster of women mourned her woe She was doomed to dwell in the dreary waters cold sea courses since Cain cut down with edge of the sword his only brother his father s offspring outlawed he fled marked with murder from men s delights warded the wilds There woke from him such fate sent ghosts as Grendel who war wolf horrid at Heorot found a warrior watching and waiting the fray with whom the grisly one grappled amain But the man remembered his mighty power the glorious gift that God had sent him in his Maker s mercy put his trust for comfort and help so he conquered the foe felled the fiend who fled abject reft of joy to the realms of death mankind s foe And his mother now gloomy and grim would go that quest of sorrow the death of her son to avenge To Heorot came she where helmeted Danes slept in the hall Too soon came back old ills of the earls when in she burst the mother of Grendel Less grim though that terror e en as terror of woman in war is less might of maid than of men in arms when hammer forged the falchion hard sword gore stained through swine of the helm crested with keen blade carves amain Then was in hall the hard edge drawn the swords on the settles and shields a many firm held in hand nor helmet minded nor harness of mail whom that horror seized Haste was hers she would hie afar and save her life when the liegemen saw her Yet a single atheling up she seized fast and firm as she fled to the moor He was for Hrothgar of heroes the dearest of trusty vassals betwixt the seas whom she killed on his couch a clansman famous in battle brave Nor was Beowulf there another house had been held apart after giving of gold for the Geat renowned Uproar filled Heorot the hand all had viewed blood flecked she bore with her bale was returned dole in the dwellings twas dire exchange where Dane and Geat were doomed to give the lives of loved ones Long tried king the hoary hero at heart was sad when he knew his noble no more lived and dead indeed was his dearest thane To his bower was Beowulf brought in haste dauntless victor As daylight broke along with his earls the atheling lord with his clansmen came where the king abode waiting to see if the Wielder of All would turn this tale of trouble and woe Strode o er floor the famed in strife with his hand companions the hall resounded wishing to greet the wise old king Ingwines lord he asked if the night had passed in peace to the prince s mind XX HROTHGAR spake helmet of Scyldings Ask not of pleasure Pain is renewed to Danish folk Dead is Aeschere of Yrmenlaf the elder brother my sage adviser and stay in council shoulder comrade in stress of fight when warriors clashed and we warded our heads hewed the helm boars hero famed should be every earl as Aeschere was But here in Heorot a hand hath slain him of wandering death sprite I wot not whither proud of the prey her path she took fain of her fill The feud she avenged that yesternight unyieldingly Grendel in grimmest grasp thou killedst seeing how long these liegemen mine he ruined and ravaged Reft of life in arms he fell Now another comes keen and cruel her kin to avenge faring far in feud of blood so that many a thane shall think who e er sorrows in soul for that sharer of rings this is hardest of heart bales The hand lies low that once was willing each wish to please Land dwellers here and liegemen mine who house by those parts I have heard relate that such a pair they have sometimes seen march stalkers mighty the moorland haunting wandering spirits one of them seemed so far as my folk could fairly judge of womankind and one accursed in man s guise trod the misery track of exile though huger than human bulk Grendel in days long gone they named him folk of the land his father they knew not nor any brood that was born to him of treacherous spirits Untrod is their home by wolf cliffs haunt they and windy headlands fenways fearful where flows the stream from mountains gliding to gloom of the rocks underground flood Not far is it hence in measure of miles that the mere expands and o er it the frost bound forest hanging sturdily rooted shadows the wave By night is a wonder weird to see fire on the waters So wise lived none of the sons of men to search those depths Nay though the heath rover harried by dogs the horn proud hart this holt should seek long distance driven his dear life first on the brink he yields ere he brave the plunge to hide his head tis no happy place Thence the welter of waters washes up wan to welkin when winds bestir evil storms and air grows dusk and the heavens weep Now is help once more with thee alone The land thou knowst not place of fear where thou findest out that sin flecked being Seek if thou dare I will reward thee for waging this fight with ancient treasure as erst I did with winding gold if thou winnest back XXI BEOWULF spake bairn of Ecgtheow Sorrow not sage It beseems us better friends to avenge than fruitlessly mourn them Each of us all must his end abide in the ways of the world so win who may glory ere death When his days are told that is the warrior s worthiest doom Rise O realm warder Ride we anon and mark the trail of the mother of Grendel No harbor shall hide her heed my promise enfolding of field or forested mountain or floor of the flood let her flee where she will But thou this day endure in patience as I ween thou wilt thy woes each one Leaped up the graybeard God he thanked mighty Lord for the man s brave words For Hrothgar soon a horse was saddled wave maned steed The sovran wise stately rode on his shield armed men followed in force The footprints led along the woodland widely seen a path o er the plain where she passed and trod the murky moor of men at arms she bore the bravest and best one dead him who with Hrothgar the homestead ruled On then went the atheling born o er stone cliffs steep and strait defiles narrow passes and unknown ways headlands sheer and the haunts of the Nicors Foremost he fared a few at his side of the wiser men the ways to scan till he found in a flash the forested hill hanging over the hoary rock a woful wood the waves below were dyed in blood The Danish men had sorrow of soul and for Scyldings all for many a hero twas hard to bear ill for earls when Aeschere s head they found by the flood on the foreland there Waves were welling the warriors saw hot with blood but the horn sang oft battle song bold The band sat down and watched on the water worm like things sea dragons strange that sounded the deep and nicors that lay on the ledge of the ness such as oft essay at hour of morn on the road of sails their ruthless quest and sea snakes and monsters These started away swollen and savage that song to hear that war horn s blast The warden of Geats with bolt from bow then balked of life of wave work one monster amid its heart went the keen war shaft in water it seemed less doughty in swimming whom death had seized Swift on the billows with boar spears well hooked and barbed it was hard beset done to death and dragged on the headland wave roamer wondrous Warriors viewed the grisly guest Then girt him Beowulf in martial mail nor mourned for his life His breastplate broad and bright of hues woven by hand should the waters try well could it ward the warrior s body that battle should break on his breast in vain nor harm his heart by the hand of a foe And the helmet white that his head protected was destined to dare the deeps of the flood through wave whirl win twas wound with chains decked with gold as in days of yore the weapon smith worked it wondrously with swine forms set it that swords nowise brandished in battle could bite that helm Nor was that the meanest of mighty helps which Hrothgar s orator offered at need Hrunting they named the hilted sword of old time heirlooms easily first iron was its edge all etched with poison with battle blood hardened nor blenched it at fight in hero s hand who held it ever on paths of peril prepared to go to folkstead of foes Not first time this it was destined to do a daring task For he bore not in mind the bairn of Ecglaf sturdy and strong that speech he had made drunk with wine now this weapon he lent to a stouter swordsman Himself though durst not under welter of waters wager his life as loyal liegeman So lost he his glory honor of earls With the other not so who girded him now for the grim encounter XXII BEOWULF spake bairn of Ecgtheow Have mind thou honored offspring of Healfdene gold friend of men now I go on this quest sovran wise what once was said if in thy cause it came that I should lose my life thou wouldst loyal bide to me though fallen in father s place Be guardian thou to this group of my thanes my warrior friends if War should seize me and the goodly gifts thou gavest me Hrothgar beloved to Hygelac send Geatland s king may ken by the gold Hrethel s son see when he stares at the treasure that I got me a friend for goodness famed and joyed while I could in my jewel bestower And let Unferth wield this wondrous sword earl far honored this heirloom precious hard of edge with Hrunting I seek doom of glory or Death shall take me After these words the Weder Geat lord boldly hastened biding never answer at all the ocean floods closed o er the hero Long while of the day fled ere he felt the floor of the sea Soon found the fiend who the flood domain sword hungry held these hundred winters greedy and grim that some guest from above some man was raiding her monster realm She grasped out for him with grisly claws and the warrior seized yet scathed she not his body hale the breastplate hindered as she strove to shatter the sark of war the linked harness with loathsome hand Then bore this brine wolf when bottom she touched the lord of rings to the lair she haunted whiles vainly he strove though his valor held weapon to wield against wondrous monsters that sore beset him sea beasts many tried with fierce tusks to tear his mail and swarmed on the stranger But soon he marked he was now in some hall he knew not which where water never could work him harm nor through the roof could reach him ever fangs of the flood Firelight he saw beams of a blaze that brightly shone Then the warrior was ware of that wolf of the deep mere wife monstrous For mighty stroke he swung his blade and the blow withheld not Then sang on her head that seemly blade its war song wild But the warrior found the light of battle was loath to bite to harm the heart its hard edge failed the noble at need yet had known of old strife hand to hand and had helmets cloven doomed men s fighting gear First time this for the gleaming blade that its glory fell Firm still stood nor failed in valor heedful of high deeds Hygelac s kinsman flung away fretted sword featly jewelled the angry earl on earth it lay steel edged and stiff His strength he trusted hand gripe of might So man shall do whenever in war he weens to earn him lasting fame nor fears for his life Seized then by shoulder shrank not from combat the Geatish war prince Grendel s mother Flung then the fierce one filled with wrath his deadly foe that she fell to ground Swift on her part she paid him back with grisly grasp and grappled with him Spent with struggle stumbled the warrior fiercest of fighting men fell adown On the hall guest she hurled herself hent her short sword broad and brown edged the bairn to avenge the sole born son On his shoulder lay braided breast mail barring death withstanding entrance of edge or blade Life would have ended for Ecgtheow s son under wide earth for that earl of Geats had his armor of war not aided him battle net hard and holy God wielded the victory wisest Maker The Lord of Heaven allowed his cause and easily rose the earl erect XXIII MID the battle gear saw he a blade triumphant old sword of Eotens with edge of proof warriors heirloom weapon unmatched save only twas more than other men to bandy of battle could bear at all as the giants had wrought it ready and keen Seized then its chain hilt the Scyldings chieftain bold and battle grim brandished the sword reckless of life and so wrathfully smote that it gripped her neck and grasped her hard her bone rings breaking the blade pierced through that fated one s flesh to floor she sank Bloody the blade he was blithe of his deed Then blazed forth light Twas bright within as when from the sky there shines unclouded heaven s candle The hall he scanned By the wall then went he his weapon raised high by its hilts the Hygelac thane angry and eager That edge was not useless to the warrior now He wished with speed Grendel to guerdon for grim raids many for the war he waged on Western Danes oftener far than an only time when of Hrothgar s hearth companions he slew in slumber in sleep devoured fifteen men of the folk of Danes and as many others outward bore his horrible prey Well paid for that the wrathful prince For now prone he saw Grendel stretched there spent with war spoiled of life so scathed had left him Heorot s battle The body sprang far when after death it endured the blow sword stroke savage that severed its head Soon then saw the sage companions who waited with Hrothgar watching the flood that the tossing waters turbid grew blood stained the mere Old men together hoary haired of the hero spake the warrior would not they weened again proud of conquest come to seek their mighty master To many it seemed the wolf of the waves had won his life The ninth hour came The noble Scyldings left the headland homeward went the gold friend of men But the guests sat on stared at the surges sick in heart and wished yet weened not their winsome lord again to see Now that sword began from blood of the fight in battle droppings war blade to wane twas a wondrous thing that all of it melted as ice is wont when frosty fetters the Father loosens unwinds the wave bonds wielding all seasons and times the true God he Nor took from that dwelling the duke of the Geats save only the head and that hilt withal blazoned with jewels the blade had melted burned was the bright sword her blood was so hot so poisoned the hell sprite who perished within there Soon he was swimming who safe saw in combat downfall of demons up dove through the flood The clashing waters were cleansed now waste of waves where the wandering fiend her life days left and this lapsing world Swam then to strand the sailors refuge sturdy in spirit of sea booty glad of burden brave he bore with him Went then to greet him and God they thanked the thane band choice of their chieftain blithe that safe and sound they could see him again Soon from the hardy one helmet and armor deftly they doffed now drowsed the mere water neath welkin with war blood stained Forth they fared by the footpaths thence merry at heart the highways measured well known roads Courageous men carried the head from the cliff by the sea an arduous task for all the band the firm in fight since four were needed on the shaft of slaughter strenuously to bear to the gold hall Grendel s head So presently to the palace there foemen fearless fourteen Geats marching came Their master of clan mighty amid them the meadow ways trod Strode then within the sovran thane fearless in fight of fame renowned hardy hero Hrothgar to greet And next by the hair into hall was borne Grendel s head where the henchmen were drinking an awe to clan and queen alike a monster of marvel the men looked on XXIV BEOWULF spake bairn of Ecgtheow Lo now this sea booty son of Healfdene Lord of Scyldings we ve lustily brought thee sign of glory thou seest it here Not lightly did I with my life escape In war under water this work I essayed with endless effort and even so my strength had been lost had the Lord not shielded me Not a whit could I with Hrunting do in work of war though the weapon is good yet a sword the Sovran of Men vouchsafed me to spy on the wall there in splendor hanging old gigantic how oft He guides the friendless wight and I fought with that brand felling in fight since fate was with me the house s wardens That war sword then all burned bright blade when the blood gushed o er it battle sweat hot but the hilt I brought back from my foes So avenged I their fiendish deeds death fall of Danes as was due and right And this is my hest that in Heorot now safe thou canst sleep with thy soldier band and every thane of all thy folk both old and young no evil fear Scyldings lord from that side again aught ill for thy earls as erst thou must Then the golden hilt for that gray haired leader hoary hero in hand was laid giant wrought old So owned and enjoyed it after downfall of devils the Danish lord wonder smiths work since the world was rid of that grim souled fiend the foe of God murder marked and his mother as well Now it passed into power of the people s king best of all that the oceans bound who have scattered their gold o er Scandia s isle Hrothgar spake the hilt he viewed heirloom old where was etched the rise of that far off fight when the floods o erwhelmed raging waves the race of giants fearful their fate a folk estranged from God Eternal whence guerdon due in that waste of waters the Wielder paid them So on the guard of shining gold in runic staves it was rightly said for whom the serpent traced sword was wrought best of blades in bygone days and the hilt well wound The wise one spake son of Healfdene silent were all Lo so may he say who sooth and right follows mid folk of far times mindful a land warden old that this earl belongs to the better breed So borne aloft thy fame must fly O friend my Beowulf far and wide o er folksteads many Firmly thou shalt all maintain mighty strength with mood of wisdom Love of mine will I assure thee as awhile ago I promised thou shalt prove a stay in future in far off years to folk of thine to the heroes a help Was not Heremod thus to offspring of Ecgwela Honor Scyldings nor grew for their grace but for grisly slaughter for doom of death to the Danishmen He slew wrath swollen his shoulder comrades companions at board So he passed alone chieftain haughty from human cheer Though him the Maker with might endowed delights of power and uplifted high above all men yet blood fierce his mind his breast hoard grew no bracelets gave he to Danes as was due he endured all joyless strain of struggle and stress of woe long feud with his folk Here find thy lesson Of virtue advise thee This verse I have said for thee wise from lapsed winters Wondrous seems how to sons of men Almighty God in the strength of His spirit sendeth wisdom estate high station He swayeth all things Whiles He letteth right lustily fare the heart of the hero of high born race in seat ancestral assigns him bliss his folk s sure fortress in fee to hold puts in his power great parts of the earth empire so ample that end of it this wanter of wisdom weeneth none So he waxes in wealth nowise can harm him illness or age no evil cares shadow his spirit no sword hate threatens from ever an enemy all the world wends at his will no worse he knoweth till all within him obstinate pride waxes and wakes while the warden slumbers the spirit s sentry sleep is too fast which masters his might and the murderer nears stealthily shooting the shafts from his bow

none	none	XXVII CAME now to ocean the ever courageous hardy henchmen their harness bearing woven war sarks The warden marked trusty as ever the earl s return From the height of the hill no hostile words reached the guests as he rode to greet them but Welcome he called to that Weder clan as the sheen mailed spoilers to ship marched on Then on the strand with steeds and treasure and armor their roomy and ring dight ship was heavily laden high its mast rose over Hrothgar s hoarded gems A sword to the boat guard Beowulf gave mounted with gold on the mead bench since he was better esteemed that blade possessing heirloom old Their ocean keel boarding they drove through the deep and Daneland left A sea cloth was set a sail with ropes firm to the mast the flood timbers moaned nor did wind over billows that wave swimmer blow across from her course The craft sped on foam necked it floated forth o er the waves keel firm bound over briny currents till they got them sight of the Geatish cliffs home known headlands High the boat stirred by winds on the strand updrove Helpful at haven the harbor guard stood who long already for loved companions by the water had waited and watched afar He bound to the beach the broad bosomed ship with anchor bands lest ocean billows that trusty timber should tear away Then Beowulf bade them bear the treasure gold and jewels no journey far was it thence to go to the giver of rings Hygelac Hrethling at home he dwelt by the sea wall close himself and clan Haughty that house a hero the king high the hall and Hygd right young wise and wary though winters few in those fortress walls she had found a home Haereth s daughter Nor humble her ways nor grudged she gifts to the Geatish men of precious treasure Not Thryth s pride showed she folk queen famed or that fell deceit Was none so daring that durst make bold save her lord alone of the liegemen dear that lady full in the face to look but forged fetters he found his lot bonds of death And brief the respite soon as they seized him his sword doom was spoken and the burnished blade a baleful murder proclaimed and closed No queenly way for woman to practise though peerless she that the weaver of peace from warrior dear by wrath and lying his life should reave But Hemming s kinsman hindered this For over their ale men also told that of these folk horrors fewer she wrought onslaughts of evil after she went gold decked bride to the brave young prince atheling haughty and Offa s hall o er the fallow flood at her father s bidding safely sought where since she prospered royal throned rich in goods fain of the fair life fate had sent her and leal in love to the lord of warriors He of all heroes I heard of ever from sea to sea of the sons of earth most excellent seemed Hence Offa was praised for his fighting and feeing by far off men the spear bold warrior wisely he ruled over his empire Eomer woke to him help of heroes Hemming s kinsman Grandson of Garmund grim in war XXVIII HASTENED the hardy one henchmen with him sandy strand of the sea to tread and widespread ways The world s great candle sun shone from south They strode along with sturdy steps to the spot they knew where the battle king young his burg within slayer of Ongentheow shared the rings shelter of heroes To Hygelac Beowulf s coming was quickly told that there in the court the clansmen s refuge the shield companion sound and alive hale from the hero play homeward strode With haste in the hall by highest order room for the rovers was readily made By his sovran he sat come safe from battle kinsman by kinsman His kindly lord he first had greeted in gracious form with manly words The mead dispensing came through the high hall Haereth s daughter winsome to warriors wine cup bore to the hands of the heroes Hygelac then his comrade fairly with question plied in the lofty hall sore longing to know what manner of sojourn the Sea Geats made What came of thy quest my kinsman Beowulf when thy yearnings suddenly swept thee yonder battle to seek o er the briny sea combat in Heorot Hrothgar couldst thou aid at all the honored chief in his wide known woes With waves of care my sad heart seethed I sore mistrusted my loved one s venture long I begged thee by no means to seek that slaughtering monster but suffer the South Danes to settle their feud themselves with Grendel Now God be thanked that safe and sound I can see thee now Beowulf spake the bairn of Ecgtheow Tis known and unhidden Hygelac Lord to many men that meeting of ours struggle grim between Grendel and me which we fought on the field where full too many sorrows he wrought for the Scylding Victors evils unending These all I avenged No boast can be from breed of Grendel any on earth for that uproar at dawn from the longest lived of the loathsome race in fleshly fold But first I went Hrothgar to greet in the hall of gifts where Healfdene s kinsman high renowned soon as my purpose was plain to him assigned me a seat by his son and heir The liegemen were lusty my life days never such merry men over mead in hall have I heard under heaven The high born queen people s peace bringer passed through the hall cheered the young clansmen clasps of gold ere she sought her seat to sundry gave Oft to the heroes Hrothgar s daughter to earls in turn the ale cup tendered she whom I heard these hall companions Freawaru name when fretted gold she proffered the warriors Promised is she gold decked maid to the glad son of Froda Sage this seems to the Scylding s friend kingdom s keeper he counts it wise the woman to wed so and ward off feud store of slaughter But seldom ever when men are slain does the murder spear sink but briefest while though the bride be fair Nor haply will like it the Heathobard lord and as little each of his liegemen all when a thane of the Danes in that doughty throng goes with the lady along their hall and on him the old time heirlooms glisten hard and ring decked Heathobard s treasure weapons that once they wielded fair until they lost at the linden play liegeman leal and their lives as well Then over the ale on this heirloom gazing some ash wielder old who has all in mind that spear death of men he is stern of mood heavy at heart in the hero young tests the temper and tries the soul and war hate wakens with words like these Canst thou not comrade ken that sword which to the fray thy father carried in his final feud neath the fighting mask dearest of blades when the Danish slew him and wielded the war place on Withergild s fall after havoc of heroes those hardy Scyldings Now the son of a certain slaughtering Dane proud of his treasure paces this hall joys in the killing and carries the jewel that rightfully ought to be owned by thee Thus he urges and eggs him all the time with keenest words till occasion offers that Freawaru s thane for his father s deed after bite of brand in his blood must slumber losing his life but that liegeman flies living away for the land he kens And thus be broken on both their sides oaths of the earls when Ingeld s breast wells with war hate and wife love now after the care billows cooler grows So I hold not high the Heathobards faith due to the Danes or their during love and pact of peace But I pass from that turning to Grendel O giver of treasure and saying in full how the fight resulted hand fray of heroes When heaven s jewel had fled o er far fields that fierce sprite came night foe savage to seek us out where safe and sound we sentried the hall To Hondscio then was that harassing deadly his fall there was fated He first was slain girded warrior Grendel on him turned murderous mouth on our mighty kinsman and all of the brave man s body devoured Yet none the earlier empty handed would the bloody toothed murderer mindful of bale outward go from the gold decked hall but me he attacked in his terror of might with greedy hand grasped me A glove hung by him wide and wondrous wound with bands and in artful wise it all was wrought by devilish craft of dragon skins Me therein an innocent man the fiendish foe was fain to thrust with many another He might not so when I all angrily upright stood Twere long to relate how that land destroyer I paid in kind for his cruel deeds yet there my prince this people of thine got fame by my fighting He fled away and a little space his life preserved but there staid behind him his stronger hand left in Heorot heartsick thence on the floor of the ocean that outcast fell Me for this struggle the Scyldings friend paid in plenty with plates of gold with many a treasure when morn had come and we all at the banquet board sat down Then was song and glee The gray haired Scylding much tested told of the times of yore Whiles the hero his harp bestirred wood of delight now lays he chanted of sooth and sadness or said aright legends of wonder the wide hearted king or for years of his youth he would yearn at times for strength of old struggles now stricken with age hoary hero his heart surged full when wise with winters he wailed their flight Thus in the hall the whole of that day at ease we feasted till fell o er earth another night Anon full ready in greed of vengeance Grendel s mother set forth all doleful Dead was her son through war hate of Weders now woman monstrous with fury fell a foeman she slew avenged her offspring From Aeschere old loyal councillor life was gone nor might they e en when morning broke those Danish people their death done comrade burn with brands on balefire lay the man they mourned Under mountain stream she had carried the corpse with cruel hands For Hrothgar that was the heaviest sorrow of all that had laden the lord of his folk The leader then by thy life besought me sad was his soul in the sea waves coil to play the hero and hazard my being for glory of prowess my guerdon he pledged I then in the waters tis widely known that sea floor guardian savage found Hand to hand there a while we struggled billows welled blood in the briny hall her head I hewed with a hardy blade from Grendel s mother and gained my life though not without danger My doom was not yet Then the haven of heroes Healfdene s son gave me in guerdon great gifts of price XXIX So held this king to the customs old that I wanted for nought in the wage I gained the meed of my might he made me gifts Healfdene s heir for my own disposal Now to thee my prince I proffer them all gladly give them Thy grace alone can find me favor Few indeed have I of kinsmen save Hygelac thee Then he bade them bear him the boar head standard the battle helm high and breastplate gray the splendid sword then spake in form Me this war gear the wise old prince Hrothgar gave and his hest he added that its story be straightway said to thee A while it was held by Heorogar king for long time lord of the land of Scyldings yet not to his son the sovran left it to daring Heoroweard dear as he was to him his harness of battle Well hold thou it all And I heard that soon passed o er the path of this treasure all apple fallow four good steeds each like the others arms and horses he gave to the king So should kinsmen be not weave one another the net of wiles or with deep hid treachery death contrive for neighbor and comrade His nephew was ever by hardy Hygelac held full dear and each kept watch o er the other s weal I heard too the necklace to Hygd he presented wonder wrought treasure which Wealhtheow gave him sovran s daughter three steeds he added slender and saddle gay Since such gift the gem gleamed bright on the breast of the queen Thus showed his strain the son of Ecgtheow as a man remarked for mighty deeds and acts of honor At ale he slew not comrade or kin nor cruel his mood though of sons of earth his strength was greatest a glorious gift that God had sent the splendid leader Long was he spurned and worthless by Geatish warriors held him at mead the master of clans failed full oft to favor at all Slack and shiftless the strong men deemed him profitless prince but payment came to the warrior honored for all his woes Then the bulwark of earls bade bring within hardy chieftain Hrethel s heirloom garnished with gold no Geat e er knew in shape of a sword a statelier prize The brand he laid in Beowulf s lap and of hides assigned him seven thousand with house and high seat They held in common land alike by their line of birth inheritance home but higher the king because of his rule o er the realm itself Now further it fell with the flight of years with harryings horrid that Hygelac perished and Heardred too by hewing of swords under the shield wall slaughtered lay when him at the van of his victor folk sought hardy heroes Heatho Scilfings in arms o erwhelming Hereric s nephew Then Beowulf came as king this broad realm to wield and he ruled it well fifty winters a wise old prince warding his land until One began in the dark of night a Dragon to rage In the grave on the hill a hoard it guarded in the stone barrow steep A strait path reached it unknown to mortals Some man however came by chance that cave within to the heathen hoard In hand he took a golden goblet nor gave he it back stole with it away while the watcher slept by thievish wiles for the warden s wrath prince and people must pay betimes XXX THAT way he went with no will of his own in danger of

now with the dragon to strive With comrades eleven the lord of Geats swollen in rage went seeking the dragon He had heard whence all the harm arose and the killing of clansmen that cup of price on the lap of the lord had been laid by the finder In the throng was this one thirteenth man starter of all the strife and ill care laden captive cringing thence forced and reluctant he led them on till he came in ken of that cavern hall the barrow delved near billowy surges flood of ocean Within twas full of wire gold and jewels a jealous warden warrior trusty the treasures held lurked in his lair Not light the task of entrance for any of earth born men Sat on the headland the hero king spake words of hail to his hearth companions gold friend of Geats All gloomy his soul wavering death bound Wyrd full nigh stood ready to greet the gray haired man to seize his soul hoard sunder apart life and body Not long would be the warrior s spirit enwound with flesh Beowulf spake the bairn of Ecgtheow

with food and fee faithful in kinship Ne er while I lived there he loathlier found me bairn in the burg than his birthright sons Herebeald and Haethcyn and Hygelac mine For the eldest of these by unmeet chance by kinsman s deed was the death bed strewn when Haethcyn killed him with horny bow his own dear liege laid low with an arrow missed the mark and his mate shot down one brother the other with bloody shaft A feeless fight and a fearful sin horror to Hrethel yet hard as it was unavenged must the atheling die Too awful it is for an aged man to bide and bear that his bairn so young rides on the gallows A rime he makes sorrow song for his son there hanging as rapture of ravens no rescue now can come from the old disabled man Still is he minded as morning breaks of the heir gone elsewhere another he hopes not he will bide to see his burg within as ward for his wealth now the one has found doom of death that the deed incurred Forlorn he looks on the lodge of his son wine hall waste and wind swept chambers reft of revel The rider sleepeth the hero far hidden no harp resounds in the courts no wassail as once was heard XXXIII THEN he goes to his chamber a grief song chants alone for his lost Too large all seems homestead and house So the helmet of Weders hid in his heart for Herebeald waves of woe No way could he take to avenge on the slayer slaughter so foul nor e en could he harass that hero at all with loathing deed though he loved him not And so for the sorrow his soul endured men s gladness he gave up and God s light chose Lands and cities he left his sons as the wealthy do when he went from earth There was strife and struggle twixt Swede and Geat o er the width of waters war arose hard battle horror when Hrethel died and Ongentheow s offspring grew strife keen bold nor brooked o er the seas pact of peace but pushed their hosts to harass in hatred by Hreosnabeorh Men of my folk for that feud had vengeance for woful war tis widely known though one of them bought it with blood of his heart a bargain hard for Haethcyn proved fatal that fray for the first of Geats At morn I heard was the murderer killed by kinsman for kinsman with clash of sword when Ongentheow met Eofor there Wide split the war helm wan he fell hoary Scylfing the hand that smote him of feud was mindful nor flinched from the death blow For all that he gave me my gleaming sword repaid him at war such power I wielded for lordly treasure with land he entrusted me homestead and house He had no need from Swedish realm or from Spear Dane folk or from men of the Gifths to get him help some warrior worse for wage to buy Ever I fought in the front of all sole to the fore and so shall I fight while I bide in life and this blade shall last that early and late hath loyal proved since for my doughtiness Daeghrefn fell slain by my hand the Hugas champion Nor fared he thence to the Frisian king with the booty back and breast adornments but slain in struggle that standard bearer fell atheling brave Not with blade was he slain but his bones were broken by brawny gripe his heart waves stilled The sword edge now hard blade and my hand for the hoard shall strive Beowulf spake and a battle vow made his last of all I have lived through many wars in my youth now once again old folk defender feud will I seek do doughty deeds if the dark destroyer forth from his cavern come to fight me Then hailed he the helmeted heroes all for the last time greeting his liegemen dear comrades of war I should carry no weapon no sword to the serpent if sure I knew how with such enemy else my vows I could gain as I did in Grendel s day But fire in this fight I must fear me now and poisonous breath so I bring with me breastplate and board From the barrow s keeper no footbreadth flee I One

Hardily I shall win that wealth or war shall seize cruel killing your king and lord Up stood then with shield the sturdy champion stayed by the strength of his single manhood and hardy neath helmet his harness bore under cleft of the cliffs no coward s path Soon spied by the wall that warrior chief survivor of many a victory field where foemen fought with furious clashings an arch of stone and within a stream that broke from the barrow The brooklet s wave was hot with fire The hoard that way he never could hope unharmed to near or endure those deeps for the dragon s flame Then let from his breast for he burst with rage the Weder Geat prince a word outgo stormed the stark heart stern went ringing and clear his cry neath the cliff rocks gray The hoard guard heard a human voice his rage was enkindled No respite now for pact of peace The poison breath of that foul worm first came forth from the cave hot reek of fight the rocks resounded Stout by the stone way his shield he raised lord of the Geats against the loathed one while with courage keen that coiled foe came seeking strife The sturdy king had drawn his sword not dull of edge heirloom old and each of the two felt fear of his foe though fierce their mood Stoutly stood with his shield high raised the warrior king as the worm now coiled together amain the mailed one waited Now spire by spire fast sped and glided that blazing serpent The shield protected soul and body a shorter while for the hero king than his heart desired could his will have wielded the welcome respite but once in his life But Wyrd denied it and victory s honors His arm he lifted lord of the Geats the grim foe smote with atheling s heirloom Its edge was turned brown blade on the bone and bit more feebly than its noble master had need of then in his baleful stress Then the barrow s keeper waxed full wild for that weighty blow cast deadly flames wide drove and far those vicious fires No victor s glory the Geats lord boasted his brand had failed naked in battle as never it should excellent iron Twas no easy path that Ecgtheow s honored heir must tread over the plain to the place of the foe for against his will he must win a home elsewhere far as must all men leaving this lapsing life Not long it was ere those champions grimly closed again The hoard guard was heartened high heaved his breast once more and by peril was pressed again enfolded

found out when once in fight the foes had met Wiglaf spake and his words were sage sad in spirit he said to his comrades I remember the time when mead we took what promise we made to this prince of ours in the banquet hall to our breaker of rings for gear of combat to give him requital for hard sword and helmet if hap should bring stress of this sort Himself who chose us from all his army to aid him now urged us to glory and gave these treasures because he counted us keen with the spear and hardy neath helm though this hero work our leader hoped unhelped and alone to finish for us folk defender who hath got him glory greater than all men for daring deeds Now the day is come that our noble master has need of the might of warriors stout Let us stride along the hero to help while the heat is about him glowing and grim For God is my witness I am far more fain the fire should seize along with my lord these limbs of mine Unsuiting it seems our shields to bear homeward hence save here we essay to fell the foe and defend the life of the Weders lord I wot twere shame on the law of our land if alone the king out of Geatish warriors woe endured and sank in the struggle My sword and helmet breastplate and board for us both shall serve Through slaughter reek strode he to succor his chieftain his battle helm bore and brief words spake Beowulf dearest do all bravely as in youthful days of yore thou vowedst that while life should last thou wouldst let no wise thy glory droop Now great in deeds atheling steadfast with all thy strength shield thy life I will stand to help thee At the words the worm came once again murderous monster mad with rage with fire billows flaming its foes to seek the hated men In heat waves burned that board to the boss and the breastplate failed to shelter at all the spear thane young Yet quickly under his kinsman s shield went eager the earl since his own was now all burned by the blaze The bold king again had mind of his glory with might his glaive was driven into the dragon s head blow nerved by hate But Naegling was shivered broken in battle was Beowulf s sword old and gray Twas granted him not that ever the edge of iron at all could help him at strife too strong was his hand so the tale is told and he tried too far with strength of stroke all swords he wielded though sturdy their steel they steaded him nought Then for the third time thought on its feud that folk destroyer fire dread dragon and rushed on the hero where room allowed battle grim burning its bitter teeth closed on his neck and covered him with waves of blood from his breast that welled XXXV TWAS now men say in his sovran s need that the earl made known his noble strain craft and keenness and courage enduring Heedless of harm though his hand was burned hardy hearted he helped his kinsman A little lower the loathsome beast he smote with sword his steel drove in bright and burnished that blaze began to lose and lessen At last the king wielded his wits again war knife drew a biting blade by his breastplate hanging and the Weders helm smote that worm asunder felled the foe flung forth its life So had they killed it kinsmen both athelings twain thus an earl should be in danger s day Of deeds of valor this conqueror s hour of the king was last of his work in the world The wound began which that dragon of earth had erst inflicted to swell and smart and soon he found in his breast was boiling baleful and deep pain of poison The prince walked on wise in his thought to the wall of rock then sat and stared at the structure of giants where arch of stone and steadfast column upheld forever that hall in earth Yet here must the hand of the henchman peerless lave with water his winsome lord the king and conqueror covered with blood with struggle spent and unspan his helmet Beowulf spake in spite of his hurt his mortal wound full well he knew his portion now was past and gone of earthly bliss and all had fled of his file of days and death was near I would fain bestow on son of mine this gear of war were given me now that any heir should after me come of my proper blood This people I ruled fifty winters No folk king was there none at all of the neighboring clans who war would wage me with warriors friends and threat me with horrors At home I bided what fate might come and I cared for mine own feuds I sought not nor falsely swore ever on oath For all these things though fatally wounded fain am I From the Ruler of Man no wrath shall seize me when life from my frame must flee away for killing of kinsmen Now quickly go and gaze on that hoard neath the hoary rock Wiglaf loved now the worm lies low sleeps heart sore of his spoil bereaved And fare in haste I would fain behold the gorgeous heirlooms golden store have joy in the jewels and gems lay down softlier for sight of this splendid hoard my life and the lordship I long have held XXXVI I HAVE heard that swiftly the son of Weohstan at wish and word of his wounded king war sick warrior woven mail coat battle sark bore neath the barrow s roof Then the clansman keen of conquest proud passing the seat saw store of jewels and glistening gold the ground along by the wall were marvels and many a vessel in the den of the dragon the dawn flier old unburnished bowls of bygone men reft of richness rusty helms of the olden age and arm rings many wondrously woven Such wealth of gold booty from barrow can burden with pride each human wight let him hide it who will His glance too fell on a gold wove banner high o er the hoard of handiwork noblest brilliantly broidered so bright its gleam all the earth floor he easily saw and viewed all these vessels No vestige now was seen of the serpent the sword had ta en him Then I heard the hill of its hoard was reft old work of giants by one alone he burdened his bosom with beakers and plate at his own good will and the ensign took brightest of beacons The blade of his lord its edge was iron had injured deep one that guarded the golden hoard many a year and its murder fire spread hot round the barrow in horror billows at midnight hour till it met its doom Hasted the herald the hoard so spurred him his track to retrace he was troubled by doubt high souled hero if haply he d find alive where he left him the lord of Weders weakening fast by the wall of the cave So he carried the load His lord and king he found all bleeding famous chief at the lapse of life The liegeman again plashed him with water till point of word broke through the breast hoard Beowulf spake sage and sad as he stared at the gold For the gold and treasure to God my thanks to the Wielder of Wonders with words I say for what I behold to Heaven s Lord for the grace that I give such gifts to my folk or ever the day of my death be run Now I ve bartered here for booty of treasure the last of my life so look ye well to the needs of my land No longer I tarry A barrow bid ye the battle fanned raise for my ashes Twill shine by the shore of the flood to folk of mine memorial fair on Hrones Headland high uplifted that ocean wanderers oft may hail Beowulf s Barrow as back from far they drive their keels o er the darkling wave From his neck he unclasped the collar of gold valorous king to his vassal gave it with bright gold helmet breastplate and ring to the youthful thane bade him use them in joy Thou art end and remnant of all our race the Waegmunding name For Wyrd hath swept them all my line to the land of doom earls in their glory I after them go This word was the last which the wise old man harbored in heart ere hot death waves of balefire he chose From his bosom fled his soul to seek the saints reward XXXVII IT was heavy hap for that hero young on his lord beloved to look and find him lying on earth with life at end sorrowful sight But the slayer too awful earth dragon empty of breath lay felled in fight nor fain of its treasure could the writhing monster rule it more For edges of iron had ended its days hard and battle sharp hammers leaving and that flier afar had fallen to ground hushed by its hurt its hoard all near no longer lusty aloft to whirl at midnight making its merriment seen proud of its prizes prone it sank by the handiwork of the hero king Forsooth among folk but few achieve though sturdy and strong as stories tell me and never so daring in deed of valor the perilous breath of a poison foe to brave and to rush on the ring board hall whenever his watch the warden keeps bold in the barrow Beowulf paid the price of death for that precious hoard and each of the foes had found the end of this fleeting life Befell erelong that the laggards in war the wood had left trothbreakers cowards ten together fearing before to flourish a spear in the sore distress of their sovran lord Now in their shame their shields they carried armor of fight where the old man lay and they gazed on Wiglaf Wearied he sat at his sovran s shoulder shieldsman good to wake him with water Nowise it availed Though well he wished it in world no more could he barrier life for that leader of battles nor baffle the will of all wielding God Doom of the Lord was law o er the deeds of every man as it is to day Grim was the answer easy to get from the youth for those that had yielded to fear Wiglaf spake the son of Weohstan mournful he looked on those men unloved Who sooth will speak can say indeed that the ruler who gave you golden rings and the harness of war in which ye stand for he at ale bench often times bestowed on hall folk helm and breastplate lord to liegemen the likeliest gear which near of far he could find to give threw away and wasted these weeds of battle on men who failed when the foemen came Not at all could the king of his comrades in arms venture to vaunt though the Victory Wielder God gave him grace that he got revenge sole with his sword in stress and need To rescue his life twas little that I could serve him in struggle yet shift I made hopeless it seemed to help my kinsman Its strength ever waned when with weapon I struck that fatal foe and the fire less strongly flowed from its head Too few the heroes in throe of contest that thronged to our king Now gift of treasure and girding of sword joy of the house and home delight shall fail your folk his freehold land every clansman within your kin shall lose and leave when lords high born hear afar of that flight of yours a fameless deed Yea death is better for liegemen all than a life of shame XXXVIII THAT battle toil bade he at burg to announce at the fort on the cliff where full of sorrow all the morning earls had sat daring shieldsmen in doubt of twain would they wail as dead or welcome home their lord beloved Little kept back of the tidings new but told them all the herald that up the headland rode Now the willing giver to Weder folk in death bed lies the Lord of Geats on the slaughter bed sleeps by the serpent s deed And beside him is stretched that slayer of men with knife wounds sick no sword availed on the awesome thing in any wise to work a wound There Wiglaf sitteth Weohstan s bairn by Beowulf s side the living earl by the other dead and heavy of heart a head watch keeps o er friend and foe Now our folk may look for waging of war when once unhidden to Frisian and Frank the fall of the king is spread afar The strife began when hot on the Hugas Hygelac fell and fared with his fleet to the Frisian land Him there the Hetwaras humbled in war plied with such prowess their power o erwhelming that the bold in battle bowed beneath it and fell in fight To his friends no wise could that earl give treasure And ever since the Merowings favor has failed us wholly Nor aught expect I of peace and faith from Swedish folk Twas spread afar how Ongentheow reft at Ravenswood Haethcyn Hrethling of hope and life when the folk of Geats for the first time sought in wanton pride the Warlike Scylfings Soon the sage old sire of Ohtere ancient and awful gave answering blow the sea king he slew and his spouse redeemed his good wife rescued though robbed of her gold mother of Ohtere and Onela Then he followed his foes who fled before him sore beset and stole their way bereft of a ruler to Ravenswood With his host he besieged there what swords had left the weary and wounded woes he threatened the whole night through to that hard pressed throng some with the morrow his sword should kill some should go to the gallows tree for rapture of ravens But rescue came with dawn of day for those desperate men when they heard the horn of Hygelac sound tones of his trumpet the trusty king had followed their trail with faithful band

Great hero of the epic Kenning for king or chieftain of a comitatus he breaks off gold from the spiral rings often worn on the arm and so rewards his followers That is The Hart or Stag so called from decorations in the gables that resembled the antlers of a deer This hall has been carefully described in a pamphlet by Heyne The building was rectangular with opposite doors mainly west and east and a hearth in the middle of th single room A row of pillars down each side at some distance from the walls made a space which was raised a little above the main floor and was furnished with two rows of seats On one side usually south was the high seat midway between the doors Opposite this on the other raised space was another seat of honor At the banquet soon to be described Hrothgar sat in the south or chief high seat and Beowulf opposite to him The scene for a flying see below v four hundred ninety nine was thus very effectively set Planks on trestles the board of later English literature formed the tables just in front of the long rows of seats and were taken away after banquets when the retainers were ready to stretch themselves out for sleep on the benches Fire was the usual end of these halls See v seven hundred eighty one below One thinks of the splendid scene at the end of the Nibelungen of the Nialssaga of Saxo s story of Amlethus and many a less famous instance It is to be supposed that all hearers of this poem knew how Hrothgar s hall was burnt perhaps in the unsuccessful attack made on him by his son in law Ingeld A skilled minstrel The Danes are heathens as one is told presently but this lay of beginnings is taken from Genesis A disturber of the border one who sallies from his haunt in the fen and roams over the country near by This probably pagan nuisance is now furnished with biblical credentials as a fiend or devil in good standing so that all Christian Englishmen might read about him Grendel may mean one who grinds and crushes Cain s Giants The smaller buildings within the main enclosure but separate from the hall Grendel Sorcerers of hell Hrothgar who is the Scyldings friend of one hundred seventy That is in formal or prescribed phrase Ship That is since Beowulf selected his ship and led his men to the harbor One of the auxiliary names of the Geats Or Not thus openly ever came warriors hither yet Hrothgar Beowulf s helmet has several boar images on it he is the man of war and the boar helmet guards him as typical representative of the marching party as a whole The boar was sacred to Freyr who was the favorite god of the Germanic tribes about the North Sea and the Baltic Rude representations of warriors show the boar on the helmet quite as large as the helmet itself Either merely paved the strata via of the Romans or else thought of as a sort of mosaic an extravagant touch like the reckless waste of gold on the walls and roofs of a hall The nicor says Bugge is a hippopotamus a walrus says Ten Brink But that water goblin who covers the space from Old Nick of jest to the Neckan and Nix of poetry and tale is all one needs and Nicor is a good name for him His own people the Geats That is cover it as with a face cloth There will be no need of funeral rites Personification of Battle The Germanic Vulcan This mighty power whom the Christian poet can still revere has here the general force of Destiny There is no irrelevance here Hrothgar sees in Beowulf s mission a heritage of duty a return of the good offices which the Danish king rendered to Beowulf s father in time of dire need Money for wergild or man price Ecgtheow Beowulf s sire Began the fight Breca Murder Beowulf the one That is he was a lost soul doomed to hell Kenning for Beowulf Guarded the treasure Sc Heremod The singer has sung his lays and the epic resumes its story The time relations are not altogether good in this long passage which describes the rejoicings of the day after but the present shift from the riders on the road to the folk at the hall is not very violent and is of a piece with the general style Unferth Beowulf s sometime opponent in the flyting There is no horrible inconsistency here such as the critics strive and cry about In spite of the ruin that Grendel and Beowulf had made within the hall the framework and roof held firm and swift repairs made the interior habitable Tapestries were hung on the walls and willing hands prepared the banquet From its formal use in other places this phrase to take cup in hall or on the floor would seem to mean that Beowulf stood up to receive his gifts drink to the donor and say thanks Kenning for sword Hrothgar He is also the refuge of the friends of Ing below Ing belongs to myth Horses are frequently led or ridden into the hall where folk sit at banquet so in Chaucer s Squire s tale in the ballad of King Estmere and in the romances Man price wergild Beowulf s Hrothgar There is no need to assume a gap in the Ms As before about Sigemund and Heremod so now though at greater length about Finn and his feud a lay is chanted or recited and the epic poet counting on his readers familiarity with the story a fragment of it still exists simply gives the headings The exact story to which this episode refers in summary is not to be determined but the following account of it is reasonable and has good support among scholars Finn a Frisian chieftain who nevertheless has a castle outside the Frisian border marries Hildeburh a Danish princess and her brother Hnaef with many other Danes pays Finn a visit Relations between the two peoples have been strained before Something starts the old feud anew and the visitors are attacked in their quarters Hnaef is killed so is a son of Hildeburh Many fall on both sides Peace is patched up a stately funeral is held and the surviving visitors become in a way vassals or liegemen of Finn going back with him to Frisia So matters rest a while Hengest is now leader of the Danes but he is set upon revenge for his former lord Hnaef Probably he is killed in feud but his clansmen Guthlaf and Oslaf gather at their home a force of sturdy Danes come back to Frisia storm Finn s stronghold kill him and carry back their kinswoman Hildeburh The enemies must be the Frisians Battlefield Hengest is the prince s thane companion of Hnaef Folcwald s son is Finn That is Finn would govern in all honor the few Danish warriors who were left provided of course that none of them tried to renew the quarrel or avenge Hnaef their fallen lord If again one of Finn s Frisians began a quarrel he should die by the sword Hnaef The high place chosen for the funeral see description of Beowulf s funeral pile at the end of the poem Wounds That is these two Danes escaping home had told the story of the attack on Hnaef the slaying of Hengest and all the Danish woes Collecting a force they return to Frisia and kill Finn in his home Nephew to Hrothgar with whom he subsequently quarrels and elder cousin to the two young sons of Hrothgar and Wealhtheow their natural guardian in the event of the king s death There is something finely feminine in this speech of Wealhtheow s apart from its somewhat irregular and irrelevant sequence of topics Both she and her lord probably distrust Hrothulf but she bids the king to be of good cheer and turning to the suspect heaps affectionate assurances on his probity My own Hrothulf will surely not forget these favors and benefits of the past but will repay them to the orphaned boy They had laid their arms on the benches near where they slept He surmises presently where she is The connection is not difficult The words of mourning of acute grief are said and according to Germanic sequence of thought inexorable here the next and only topic is revenge But is it possible Hrothgar leads up to his appeal and promise with a skillful and often effective description of the horrors which surround the monster s home and await the attempt of an avenging foe Hrothgar is probably meant Meeting place Kenning for sword Hrunting is bewitched laid under a spell of uselessness along with all other swords This brown of swords evidently meaning burnished bright continues to be a favorite adjective in the popular ballads After the killing of the monster and Grendel s decapitation Hrothgar The blade slowly dissolves in blood stained drops like icicles Spear That is whoever has as wide authority as I have and can remember so far back so many instances of heroism may well say as I say that no better hero ever lived than Beowulf That is he is now undefended by conscience from the temptations shafts of the devil Kenning for the sun This is a strange role for the raven He is the warrior s bird of battle exults in slaughter and carnage his joy here is a compliment to the sunrise That is he might or might not see Beowulf again Old as he was the latter chance was likely but he clung to the former hoping to see his young friend again and exchange brave words in the hall With the speed of the boat Queen to Hygelac She is praised by contrast with the antitype Thryth just as Beowulf was praised by contrast with Heremod Kenning for wife Beowulf gives his uncle the king not mere gossip of his journey but a statesmanlike forecast of the outcome of certain policies at the Danish court Talk of interpolation here is absurd As both Beowulf and Hygelac know and the folk for whom the Beowulf was put together also knew Froda was king of the Heathobards probably the Langobards once near neighbors of Angle and Saxon tribes on the continent and had fallen in fight with the Danes Hrothgar will set aside this feud by giving his daughter as peace weaver and wife to the young king Ingeld son of the slain Froda But Beowulf on general principles and from his observation of the particular case foretells trouble Note Play of shields battle A Danish warrior cuts down Froda in the fight and takes his sword and armor leaving them to a son This son is selected to accompany his mistress the young princess Freawaru to her new home when she is Ingeld s queen Heedlessly he wears the sword of Froda in hall An old warrior points it out to Ingeld and eggs him on to vengeance At his instigation the Dane is killed but the murderer afraid of results and knowing the land escapes So the old feud must break out again That is their disastrous battle and the slaying of their king The sword Beowulf returns to his forecast Things might well go somewhat as follows he says sketches a little tragic story and with this prophecy by illustration returns to the tale of his adventure Not an actual glove but a sort of bag Hygelac This is generally assumed to mean hides though the text simply says seven thousand A hide in England meant about one hundred twenty acres though the size of the acre varied On the historical raid into Frankish territory between five hundred twelve and five hundred twenty A D The subsequent course of events as gathered from hints of this epic is partly told in Scandinavian legend The chronology of this epic as scholars have worked it out would make Beowulf well over ninety years of age when he fights the dragon But the fifty years of his reign need not be taken as historical fact The text is here hopelessly illegible and only the general drift of the meaning can be rescued For one thing we have the old myth of a dragon who guards hidden treasure But with this runs the story of some noble last of his race who hides all his wealth within this barrow and there chants his farewell to life s glories After his death the dragon takes possession of the hoard and watches over it A condemned or banished man desperate hides in the barrow discovers the treasure and while the dragon sleeps makes off with a golden beaker or the like and carries it for propitiation to his master The dragon discovers the loss and exacts fearful penalty from the people round about Literally loan days days loaned to man Chattuarii a tribe that dwelt along the Rhine and took part in repelling the raid of Hygelac Chocilaicus Onla son of Ongentheow who pursues his two nephews Eanmund and Eadgils to Heardred s court where they have taken refuge after their unsuccessful rebellion In the fighting Heardred is killed That is Beowulf supports Eadgils against Onela who is slain by Eadgils in revenge for the care paths of exile into which Onela forced him That is the king could claim no wergild or man price from one son for the killing of the other Usual euphemism for death Sc in the grave Eofor for Wulf The immediate provocation for Eofor in killing the hoary Scylfing Ongentheow is that the latter has just struck Wulf down but the king Haethcyn is also avenged by the blow See the detailed description below Hygelac Shield The hollow passage That is although Eanmund was brother s son to Onela the slaying of the former by Weohstan is not felt as cause of feud and is rewarded by gift of the slain man s weapons Both Wiglaf and the sword did their duty The following is one of the classic passages for illustrating the comitatus as the most conspicuous Germanic institution and its underlying sense of duty based partly on the idea of loyalty and partly on the practical basis of benefits received and repaid Sc than to bide safely here a common figure of incomplete comparison Wiglaf s wooden shield Gering would translate kinsman of the nail as both are made of iron That is swords Where Beowulf lay What had been left or made by the hammer well forged Trying to revive him Nothing Dead Death watch guard of honor lyke wake A name for the Franks Ongentheow Haethcyn The line may mean till Hrethelings stormed on the hedged shields i e the shield wall or hedge of defensive war Hrethelings of course are Geats Eofor brother to Wulf Wonreding Sc value in hides and the weight of the gold Not at all Laid on it when it was put in the barrow This spell or in our days the curse either prevented discovery or brought dire ills on the finder and taker Probably the fugitive is meant who discovered the hoard Ten Brink and Gering assume that the dragon is meant Hid may well mean here took while in hiding That is one and a few others But Beowulf seems to be indicated Ten Brink points out the strongly heathen character of this part of the epic Beowulf s end came so the old tradition ran from his unwitting interference with spell bound treasure A
