7752_113336_000000_000000	train-clean-360	When he was four years old his father moved to the town of Chatham near the old city of Rochester 
7752_113336_000000_000001	train-clean-360	Round about are chalk hills green lanes forests and marshes and amid such scenes the little Charles s genius first began to show itself 
7752_113336_000001_000000	train-clean-360	He did not like the rougher sports of his school fellows and preferred to amuse himself in his own way or to wander about with his older sister Fanny whom he especially loved 
7752_113336_000001_000001	train-clean-360	They loved to watch the stars together and there was one particular star which they used to pretend was their own 
7752_113336_000001_000002	train-clean-360	People called him a very queer small boy because he was always thinking or reading instead of playing 
none	none	The children of the neighborhood would gather around him to listen while he told them stories or sang comic songs to them and when he was only eight years old he taught them to act in plays which he invented He was fond of reading books of travel and most of all he loved The Arabian Nights and Robinson Crusoe 
7752_113336_000002_000000	train-clean-360	He had a great affection for Chatham and Rochester and after he began to write stories that were printed he often used to put these places into them 
none	none	It was at Chatham that poor little David in the story David Copperfield lay down to sleep when he was running away from London to find his aunt Miss Betsy Trotwood It was to Rochester that mister Pickwick in Pickwick Papers rode with Jingle Rochester was really the Cloisterham where the wicked choir master John Jasper killed his nephew in The Mystery of Edwin Drood And it was in those very marshes near by that Magwitch the escaped convict in Great Expectations so frightened little Pip 
7752_113336_000002_000005	train-clean-360	It is easy to see that the young Charles Dickens noted carefully and remembered everything he saw and this habit was of great use to him all his life 
7752_113336_000003_000000	train-clean-360	These happy years were not to last long 
7752_113336_000003_000001	train-clean-360	When he was nine years old his father became poor and the family was obliged to move to London where it lived in a shabby house in a poor suburb 
7752_113336_000003_000002	train-clean-360	Before another year had passed his father was put into prison for debt the same prison in which Little Dorrit in the story of that name grew up 
none	none	A very bitter period followed for the solitary ten year old boy a time in which he long afterward wrote but for the mercy of God he might easily have become for any care that was taken of him a little robber or a little vagabond The earlier history of David in David Copperfield is really and truly a history of the real Charles Dickens in London He was left to the city streets or to earn a hard and scanty living in a dirty warehouse by pasting labels on pots of blacking All of this wretched experience he has written in David Copperfield and the sad scenes of the debtors prison he has put into Pickwick Papers and into Little Dorrit Even missus Pipchin of whom he told in Dombey and Son and mister Micawber in David Copperfield were real people whom he knew in these years of poverty and despair Dickens s life at this time was so miserable that always afterward he dreaded to speak of it and never could bear even to walk in the street where the blacking warehouse of his boyhood had stood 
7752_113336_000004_000000	train-clean-360	Better days however came at last 
none	none	He was able to begin school again and though the head master was ignorant and brutal just such a one as mister Creakle in David Copperfield yet Dickens profited by such teaching as he received After two or three years of school he found employment as clerk in a lawyer s office 
7752_113336_000005_000001	train-clean-360	This did not content him and he made up his mind to learn to write shorthand so as to become a reporter in the Houses of Parliament for a newspaper 
7752_113336_000005_000002	train-clean-360	This was by no means an easy task 
7752_113336_000005_000003	train-clean-360	But Dickens had great strength of will and a determination to do well whatever he did at all and he succeeded just as David Copperfield did in the story 
7752_113336_000006_000000	train-clean-360	And like the latter too about this time Dickens fell in love 
7752_113336_000006_000001	train-clean-360	He did not marry on this occasion as did David but how much he was in love one may see by the story of David s Dora 
7752_113336_000007_000000	train-clean-360	The theater had always a great attraction for Dickens 
7752_113336_000007_000001	train-clean-360	Throughout his life he loved to act in plays got up and often written too by himself and his friends 
7752_113336_000007_000002	train-clean-360	Some of his early experiences of this kind he has told in the adventures of Nicholas Nickleby at mister Crummles s theater 
7752_113336_000007_000003	train-clean-360	But his acting was for his own amusement and it is doubtful if he ever thought seriously of adopting the stage as a profession 
7752_113336_000007_000004	train-clean-360	If he did his success as a reporter soon determined him otherwise 
7752_113336_000008_000000	train-clean-360	When he was twenty one he saw his first printed sketch in a monthly magazine 
7752_113336_000008_000001	train-clean-360	He had dropped it into a letter box with mingled hope and fear and read it now through tears of joy and pride 
7752_113336_000008_000002	train-clean-360	He followed this with others as successful signed Boz the child nickname of one of his younger brothers 
7752_113336_000008_000003	train-clean-360	This was his beginning 
none	none	He was soon on the road to a comfortable fortune and when at length Pickwick Papers appeared Dickens s fame was assured 
7752_113336_000008_000005	train-clean-360	This was his first long story 
7752_113336_000008_000006	train-clean-360	It became almost at once the most popular book of its day perhaps indeed the most popular book ever published in England 
7752_113336_000008_000007	train-clean-360	Soon after the appearance of its first chapters Dickens married Miss Catherine Hogarth daughter of the editor of one of the London newspapers who had helped him in his career 
none	none	Many have tried to explain the marvelous popularity of Pickwick Papers 
7752_113336_000009_000001	train-clean-360	Certainly its honest fun its merriment its quaintness good humor and charity appealed to every reader 
7752_113336_000009_000002	train-clean-360	More than all it made people acquainted with a new company of characters none of whom had ever existed or could ever exist and yet whose manners and appearance were pictured so really that they seemed to be actual persons whom one might meet and laugh with anywhere 
none	none	With such a success and the money it brought him Dickens had leisure to begin the wonderful series of stories which endeared him to the whole English speaking world and made him the most famous author of his day Oliver Twist came first and it was followed by Nicholas Nickleby and The Old Curiosity Shop In the first two of these stories one may see most clearly the principle that underlay almost all of Dickens s work 
7752_113336_000011_000001	train-clean-360	He was never content merely to tell an interesting story 
7752_113336_000011_000002	train-clean-360	He wrote with a purpose 
none	none	In Oliver Twist that purpose was first to better the poorhouse system and second to show that even in the lowest and wickedest paths of life the life wherein lived Fagin with his pupils in crime and Bill Sikes the brutal burglar there could yet be found as in the case of poor Nancy real kindness and sacrifice In Nicholas Nickleby the purpose was to show what terrible wrongs were done to children in country schools numbers of which at that time were managed by men almost as cruel and inhuman as was Squeers in the story 
7752_113336_000011_000005	train-clean-360	It is good to learn that as a result of this novel an end was made of many such boys schools 
7752_113336_000011_000006	train-clean-360	True artist as he was Dickens seldom wrote without having in his mind the thought of showing some defect in the law or some wrong condition of affairs which might be righted 
none	none	No one could read Pickwick Papers or Little Dorrit without realizing how much wrong and misery was caused by the law which made it possible to throw a man into prison for debt Nor can one read Bleak House without seeing that the legal system which robbed quaint Miss Flite of her mind and kept poor Richard Carstone from his fortune till the fortune itself had disappeared was a very wrong legal system indeed 
7752_113336_000011_000009	train-clean-360	Often too Dickens s stories are in a sense sermons against very human sins 
none	none	In The Old Curiosity Shop it is the sin of gambling which brings about the death of Little Nell In Great Expectations it is the sin of pride which Pip has to fight In Martin Chuzzlewit the evil and folly of selfishness is what Dickens had in mind 
7752_113336_000012_000000	train-clean-360	With his increasing wealth Dickens had of course changed his manner of life 
7752_113336_000012_000001	train-clean-360	He lived part of the time in the country near London in Brighton in Dover and in France and Italy 
7752_113336_000012_000002	train-clean-360	He liked best however a little English watering place called Broadstairs a tiny fishing village built on a cliff with the sea rolling and dashing beneath it In such a place he felt that he could write best but he greatly missed his London friends 
7752_113336_000012_000003	train-clean-360	He used to say that being without them was like losing his arms and legs 
none	none	The first great grief of his life came to him at this time in the death of his wife s sister Mary Hogarth a gentle lovable girl of seventeen No sorrow ever touched him as this did After she died he wrote years afterward I dreamed of her every night for many weeks and always with a kind of quiet happiness so that I never lay down at night without a hope of the vision coming back Hers was the character he drew in Little Nell in The Old Curiosity Shop When he came to the part of the story which tells of Little Nell s death he could scarcely write the chapter When he ended it he said It seems as though dear Mary died but yesterday 
7752_113336_000014_000000	train-clean-360	When he was less than thirty Dickens was invited to visit Scotland and there he received his first great national tribute 
7752_113336_000014_000001	train-clean-360	A public banquet was given him in Edinburgh and he was much sought after and entertained 
7752_113336_000014_000002	train-clean-360	Up to this time he had never seen the United States he decided now to visit this country and meet his American readers face to face 
7752_113336_000015_000000	train-clean-360	He landed at Boston accompanied by his wife in eighteen forty two and visited many of the greater cities of the Eastern states 
none	none	Everywhere he was counted the guest of the nation and the four months of his stay were one continual welcome 
7752_113336_000015_000002	train-clean-360	Unfortunately however Dickens had taken a dislike to American ways and this dislike appeared in many things he wrote after his return to England 
none	none	The pictures he drew of American life in Martin Chuzzlewit were both unjust and untrue and made him for a time lose a large part of the good opinion which American readers had had for him Dickens soon came to regret the writing of these chapters and when twenty five years later he visited the United States a second time he did all in his power to show his kindly feeling and America admired and loved him so much that it gradually forgot the incident in the great pleasure with which it read his stories 
7752_113336_000016_000000	train-clean-360	Dickens was a very active man and his life was simple and full of work and exercise 
7752_113336_000016_000001	train-clean-360	He rose early and almost every day might have been seen tramping for miles along the country roads or riding horseback with his dogs racing after him 
7752_113336_000016_000002	train-clean-360	He liked best to wander along the cliffs or across the downs by the sea 
7752_113336_000016_000003	train-clean-360	When he was in London he often walked the streets half the night thinking out his stories or searching for the odd characters which he put in them 
none	none	This natural activity and restlessness even led him sometimes to make political speeches and finally to the establishment of a new London newspaper the Daily News of which he was the first editor Before this he had started a weekly journal in which several of his stories had appeared but it had not been very successful 
7752_113336_000016_000006	train-clean-360	It was not long before he withdrew also from this second venture 
7752_113336_000017_000000	train-clean-360	In the meantime he had met with both joy and sorrow 
none	none	Several children had been born to him 
7752_113336_000017_000002	train-clean-360	His much loved sister his father and his own little daughter the youngest of his family had died 
7752_113336_000017_000003	train-clean-360	These sorrows made him throw himself into his work with greater earnestness 
none	none	He even found leisure to organize a theatrical company in which he himself acted with a number of other famous writers of the time which gave several plays for the benefit of charity 
7752_113336_000017_000005	train-clean-360	One of these was performed before Queen Victoria 
7752_113336_000018_000000	train-clean-360	People have often wondered how Dickens found time to accomplish so many different things 
7752_113336_000018_000001	train-clean-360	One of the secrets of this no doubt was his love of order 
7752_113336_000018_000002	train-clean-360	He was the most systematic of men 
7752_113336_000018_000003	train-clean-360	Everything he did went like clockwork and he prided himself on his punctuality 
7752_113336_000018_000004	train-clean-360	He could not work in a room unless everything in it was in its proper place 
7752_113336_000018_000005	train-clean-360	As a consequence of this habit of regularity he never wasted time 
none	none	The work of editorship was very pleasant to Dickens and scarcely three years after his leaving the Daily News he began the publication of a new magazine which he called Household Words 
7752_113336_000019_000001	train-clean-360	His aim was to make it cheerful useful and at the same time cheap so that the poor could afford to buy it as well as the rich 
none	none	His own story Hard Times first appeared in this with the earliest work of more than one writer who later became celebrated 
7752_113336_000019_000003	train-clean-360	Dickens loved to encourage young writers and would just as quickly accept a good story or poem from an unknown author as from the most famous 
none	none	It was while engaged in this work that Dickens wrote the best one of all his tales David Copperfield the one which is in so large a part the history of his own early life 
7752_113336_000021_000000	train-clean-360	This book brought Dickens to the height of his career 
7752_113336_000021_000001	train-clean-360	He was now both famous and rich 
7752_113336_000021_000002	train-clean-360	He bought a house on Gad s Hill a place near Chatham where he had spent the happiest part of his childhood and settled down to a life of comfort and labor 
7752_113336_000021_000003	train-clean-360	When he was a little boy his father had pointed out this fine house to him and told him he might even come to live there some day if he were very persevering and worked hard 
7752_113336_000021_000004	train-clean-360	And so indeed it had proved 
none	none	Perhaps it is in connection with this house on Gad s Hill that the world oftenest remembers Dickens now 
7752_113336_000022_000001	train-clean-360	Everyone old and young throughout the neighborhood liked him 
7752_113336_000022_000002	train-clean-360	Children dogs and horses were his friends 
7752_113336_000022_000003	train-clean-360	His hand was open for charity and he was always the champion of the poor the helpless and the outcast 
7752_113336_000022_000004	train-clean-360	Everyone he thought had some good in him and in all he met he was on the lookout to find it 
none	none	The great purpose underneath all his writings was after all to teach that every man and woman however degraded has his or her better side 
7752_113336_000022_000006	train-clean-360	So earnest was he in this that he was not pleased at all when a person praised one of his stories unless the other showed that he had grasped the lesson that lay beneath it 
none	none	The text of Dickens s whole life and work is best expressed in his own words I hope to do some solid good and I mean to be as cheery and pleasant as I can The wrongs and sufferings of the young especially appealed to him and perhaps the most beautiful speech he ever made was one asking for money for the support of the London Hospital for Sick Children He spoke often in behalf of workingmen and once he spoke for the benefit of a company of poor actors when unknown to him a little child of his own was lying dead at home 
7752_113336_000023_000000	train-clean-360	With such a tender heart for all the world he was more than an affectionate father to his own children and gave much thought to their happiness and education 
none	none	In order that they should properly learn of their own country he went to the labor of preparing a Child s History of England for them and at another time he wrote out the story of the Gospels to help them in their study of the New Testament 
7752_113336_000023_000002	train-clean-360	As the years went by his letters to his oldest son told of his own work and plans When his youngest son sailed away to live in Australia he wrote Poor Plorn is gone 
7752_113336_000023_000003	train-clean-360	It was a hard parting at the last 
none	none	He seemed to me to become once more my youngest and favorite child as the day drew near and I did not think I could have been so shaken When he moved to Gad s Hill it seemed as though Dickens had gained almost all of the things men strive most for But he was not to be happy there nor perhaps was he ever again to be really happy anywhere He and his wife were very different in all their tastes and habits and had never loved each other as well as people should when they marry Perhaps after all it would have been better if in his youth he had married his Dora the one whom he had pictured in the love story of David Copperfield and his child wife 
7752_113336_000024_000003	train-clean-360	But however this may be Dickens and his wife had not lived happily together and now decided to part and from that time though they wrote to each other he never saw her again 
7752_113336_000024_000004	train-clean-360	It is sad to reflect that he who has painted so beautifully for others the joys and sorrows of perfect love and home was himself destined to know neither 
7752_113336_000025_000000	train-clean-360	The years that followed this separation were years of constant labor for Dickens 
7752_113336_000025_000001	train-clean-360	His restlessness perhaps also his lack of happiness drove him to work without rest 
none	none	He wrote to a friend I am quite confident I should rust break and die if I spared myself 
7752_113336_000025_000003	train-clean-360	Much better to die doing The idea of giving public readings from his stories suggested itself to him and he was soon engaged in preparation 
none	none	I must do something he wrote or I shall wear my heart away That heart his physician had declared out of order and this effort was destined to wear it away in quite another sense though for some time Dickens felt no ill effects 
7752_113336_000026_000000	train-clean-360	He gave readings not only in England but also in Scotland and Ireland and everywhere he met with enormous success 
7752_113336_000026_000001	train-clean-360	The first series was hardly over when he was at work on a new story and this was scarcely completed when he was planning more readings 
none	none	The strain of several seasons of such work told on his health 
7752_113336_000026_000003	train-clean-360	A serious illness followed and afterward he was troubled with an increasing lameness the first real warning of the end 
7752_113336_000027_000000	train-clean-360	In spite of his weakness he decided on another trip to America and here in eighteen sixty seven he began a series of readings which left him in a far worse condition 
7752_113336_000027_000001	train-clean-360	Often at the close of an evening he would become so faint that he would have to lie down 
7752_113336_000027_000002	train-clean-360	He was unable to sleep and his appetite entirely failed him 
none	none	Yet his wonderful determination and energy made him able to complete the task

Neighboring Towns Time eighteen forty CHARACTERS Little Nell An orphan girl mister Trent Her aged grandfather Proprietor of The Old Curiosity Shop The Stranger mister Trent s brother Christopher Nubbles Little Nell s friend and protector Known as Kit Quilp A dwarf missus Quilp His wife missus Jarley Proprietress of Jarley s Waxwork Brass A dishonest lawyer Sally Brass His sister Dick Swiveller Brass s clerk THE OLD CURIOSITY SHOP I LITTLE NELL In a narrow side street in London there once stood a shabby building called The Old Curiosity Shop because all sorts of curious things were kept for sale there such as rusty swords china figures quaint carvings and old fashioned furniture A little old man named Trent owned the shop and he looked as old as anything in it He was thin and bent with long gray hair and bright blue eyes and his face was wrinkled and full of care He had an orphan grandchild who lived with him a pretty little golden haired girl whom every one called Little Nell who kept the shop clean and neat and cooked the meals just as a grown woman would have done She slept in a back room in a bed so small it might almost have been a fairy s She lived a very lonely life but she kept a cheerful face and did not complain She had only one protector besides her grandfather and that was a big awkward boy named Christopher Nubbles called Kit for short He had a very large mouth and a turned up nose and when he spoke he had a habit of standing sidewise and twisting his head back over his shoulder Everything he did seemed funny and little Nell laughed at him all the while though she loved him almost as much as she did her grandfather He ran errands for them and in the long winter evenings she used to teach him to read and write Kit liked to be taught and even liked to be laughed at and always ended by laughing himself with his mouth wide open and his eyes shut He was the best natured lad in the world and would have given his life to make little Nell happy She was not as happy as she seemed to her grandfather s eyes There was some mystery about the old man that she could not understand Almost every night he left her to go to bed all alone in the shop and went away and did not come back till sunrise when the door bell woke her and she let him in And too he always talked of the great fortune she was to have sometime if only some mysterious plan he was working on turned out right the carriages and fine frocks and jewels But the plan seemed always to go wrong and the poor old man grew sadder and sadder as he grew more feeble Often at night little Nell sat at the upper window watching for him crying and fearing that he might die or lose his mind she never knew that Kit used to stand in the shadow of an archway opposite and watch to see that no harm came to her till she vanished and he knew she had gone to bed What troubled little Nell most of all was a strange visitor her grandfather used to have This was a hideous man named Quilp with the body of a dwarf and the head of a giant His black eyes were sharp and cunning his face was always covered with a stubby beard and he had a cruel smile that made him look like a panting dog He had grizzled tangled hair crooked finger nails and wore a dirty handkerchief tied around his neck instead of a collar He used to bring money to her grandfather and little Nell more than once saw him look at her and at the contents of the shop in a gloating way that made her shiver Indeed everybody who ever met Quilp was afraid of him and most afraid of all was his wife He had a habit of drinking scalding tea and of eating boiled eggs shell and all that quite terrified her Besides he treated the poor woman cruelly Sometimes for instance when she displeased him he made her sit bolt upright in a chair all night without moving or going to bed while he sat smoking and making faces at her Little Nell often had to carry messages from her grandfather to the dwarf and came to know that he had somehow fallen into Quilp s power The fact was that the old man had been borrowing money from the dwarf for a long time and had spent it on the great plan which he had thought sure to succeed and he now owed the other much more than all the shop and everything in it was worth Quilp had loaned the money because he thought when the wonderful plan succeeded he would make the grandfather give him back very much more than he had loaned him But when the old man continually wanted to borrow more money and yet paid none back the dwarf grew suspicious and tried hard to find out what the great plan was To do this he used to question little Nell and try to persuade her to tell how her grandfather passed the time She would never tell him anything but one day when she had brought a message to his house the dwarf hid in a closet and listened while the child told his wife how her grandfather every night after Quilp had brought him money went out and did not come home till daybreak and always sadly then You see little Nell was in such trouble that she had to tell somebody about it and ask advice and the dwarf s wife had always been very kind to her When Quilp heard the story he guessed the secret that her grandfather hoping to win more for little Nell had gambled away all the money He was full of rage and sent word that he would loan no more The old man was in great grief at this His mind had not been strong for a long time or this foolish and wrong plan would never have misled him and now at the thought that he would have no more chance to win the fortune for his grandchild he fell ill The child did her best to comfort him but he told her that if Quilp deserted them they would be no better than beggars Let us be beggars then and be happy said little Nell putting her arms around his neck I would rather beg than live as we do now If you are sorrowful now let me know it If you are weaker let me be your nurse It breaks my heart to see you so and not to know why Let us leave this place and sleep in the fields in the country and never think of money again and I will beg for us both Neither had heard the dwarf who had stolen into the shop behind them Little Nell shrieked when she saw him and her grandfather sent her into her own room So that is the way all the money I have loaned you has gone sneered Quilp Your precious scheme to make a fortune was the gaming table The old man cried out at this trembling that he had done it all for little Nell that he had never staked a single penny for himself or without praying that it might win for her good He told how he had begun gambling months before knowing he must soon die hoping thus to leave her enough to live on how after losing all his own savings he had borrowed and lost all that too And he begged the dwarf to loan him a little more so that he might tempt luck again Any one but Quilp would have pitied the poor old man but not he He refused and thinking of a lie which would make the other yet more miserable he told him as he left that it was Kit who had told him where the money was going The first Kit knew of this was that night when little Nell came to tell him her grandfather was very ill and that he raved continually against Kit so that he must never come to the shop again Kit was stupefied at this but there was no help for it so little Nell went sorrowfully back alone The Old Curiosity Shop belonged to the dwarf now and he at once moved into the parlor He took little Nell s own bed for himself and she had to sleep on a pallet on the floor up stairs She was busy nursing her grandfather for he was very ill for some time and she scarcely ever came down because she was so afraid of the dwarf Quilp was waiting for the old man to die thinking that then he would have the shop for his own and meantime he did a hundred disagreeable things such as filling the house with strong tobacco smoke from a big pipe he used all the time and driving every one away who came to ask how the sick man was He even drove off Kit when he came below the window to beg little Nell to come and bring her grandfather to live at his own mother s house The old man would certainly have died if little Nell had not nursed him so faithfully all alone till he grew better and at length was able to sit up But it was a bitter thing to live as they did and one day little Nell begged her grandfather to come away with her to wander anywhere in the world only so it was under God s sky and away from every one that pursued them and he agreed So that night they dressed and stole down stairs very quietly in order not to waken the dwarf who was snoring frightfully in the back room and went through the shop to the front door The bolts were rusty and creaked loudly and worst of all they found the key was not in the lock Little Nell had to take off her shoes and creep into the back room to get it out of the dwarf s pocket She was terribly frightened at the sight of Quilp for he was having a bad dream and was hanging so far out of bed that he was almost standing on his head his ugly mouth was wide open and his breath came in a sort of growl But she found the key at last and they unlocked the door and came safely into the dark street The old man did not know where to go but little Nell took his hand and led him gently away II THE WANDERERS It was a bright June morning They walked through many city streets then through more scattered suburbs and at last came to the open country 
7933_113272_000003_000002	train-clean-360	That night they slept at a cottage where the people were kind to them and all the next day they walked on and on 
7933_113272_000004_000000	train-clean-360	At sunset they stopped to rest in a churchyard where two men were sitting patching a Punch and Judy show booth while the figures of Punch the doctor the executioner and the devil were lying on the grass waiting to be mended 
7933_113272_000005_000000	train-clean-360	The men were mending the dolls very badly so little Nell took a needle and sewed them all neatly 
none	none	They were delighted at this and took the pair to the inn where they were to show the Punch and Judy and there they found them a place to sleep in an empty loft The next day the wanderers went on with the showmen Whenever they came to a village the booth was pitched and the show took place and they never left a town without a pack of ragged children at their heels The Punch and Judy show grew tiresome but the company seemed better than none Little Nell was weary with walking but she tried to hide it from her grandfather The inn at which they lodged the next night was full of showmen with trained dogs conjurers and others hurrying to a town where there was to be a fair with horse races to which the Punch and Judy partners were bound and little Nell began to distrust their company To tell the truth the others believed the child and the old man were running away from their friends and that a reward might be obtained for giving them up The way in which the men watched them frightened little Nell and when they reached the scene of the fair she had determined to escape 
7933_113272_000009_000000	train-clean-360	It was the second day of the races before a chance came and then while the showmen s backs were turned they slipped away in the crowd to the open fields again 
7933_113272_000010_000000	train-clean-360	These alarms and the exposure had begun to affect the old man 
7933_113272_000010_000001	train-clean-360	He seemed to understand that he was not wholly in his right mind 
none	none	He was full of the fear that he would be taken from her and chained in a dungeon and little Nell had great trouble in cheering him At evening when they were both worn out they came to a village where stood a cottage with the sign SCHOOL in big letters in its window 
7933_113272_000011_000001	train-clean-360	The pale old schoolmaster sat smoking in the garden 
none	none	He was a sad solitary man and loved little Nell when he first saw her because she was like a favorite pupil he once had 
7933_113272_000011_000003	train-clean-360	He made them sleep in the school room that night and he begged them to stay longer next day but little Nell was anxious to get as far as possible from London and from the dwarf who she was all the time in fear might find them 
7933_113272_000011_000004	train-clean-360	So they bade the schoolmaster good by and walked on 
none	none	Another day s journey left them so exhausted they could scarcely keep moving 
7933_113272_000012_000001	train-clean-360	They had almost reached another village when they came to a tiny painted house on wheels with horses to draw it 
none	none	At its door sat a stout lady wearing a large bonnet taking tea with a big drum for a table The lady as it happened had seen them at the fair and had wondered then to see them in company with a Punch and Judy show Noticing how tired they were she gave them tea and then took them into the wagon with her to help them on their way The inside of the wagon was like a cozy room It had a little bed in one end and a kitchen in the other and had two curtained windows 
7933_113272_000014_000002	train-clean-360	As the wheels rattled on the old man fell asleep and the stout lady made little Nell sit by her and talk 
none	none	In the wagon was a big canvas sign that read JARLEY S WAXWORK ONE HUNDRED FIGURES THE FULL SIZE OF LIFE NOW EXHIBITED WITHIN I am missus Jarley the woman said and my waxwork is gone to the next town where it is to be exhibited She thought little Nell and her grandfather were in the show business too and when she found they were not that they had no home and did not even know where they were going she held up her hands in astonishment 
7933_113272_000017_000000	train-clean-360	But it was easy to see that they were not ordinary beggars and she was kind hearted and wanted to help them 
7933_113272_000017_000001	train-clean-360	So after much thought she asked little Nell if they would take a situation with her 
7933_113272_000017_000002	train-clean-360	She explained that the child s duty would be to point out the wax figures to the visitors and tell their names while her grandfather could help dust them 
7933_113272_000018_000000	train-clean-360	They accepted this offer very thankfully for almost all the money they had brought was now spent and when the wagon arrived at the place of exhibition and the waxwork had been set up missus Jarley put a long wand in little Nell s hand and taught her to point out each figure and describe it 
7933_113272_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 This ladies and gentlemen little Nell learned to say is Jasper Packlemerton who murdered fourteen wives by tickling the soles of their feet or this is Queen Elizabeth s maid of honor who died from pricking her finger while sewing on Sunday 
7933_113272_000020_000000	train-clean-360	She was quick to learn and soon became a great favorite with the visitors 
none	none	missus Jarley was kind and but for the fact that her grandfather s mind failed more and more every day little Nell would have been quite happy One evening the two walked into the country beyond the town and a sudden thunder storm arose They took shelter at an inn on the highroad and while they waited there some rough men began a noisy game of cards behind a screen The talk and the chink of the money roused the old man s failing senses He imagined himself still gambling to win the old fortune for little Nell 
7933_113272_000022_000001	train-clean-360	He made her give him the money she had earned from the waxwork joined the gamblers and in a few hours had lost it all 
none	none	His insanity had made him forget the presence of the child he so loved and when the game was done it was too late to leave the inn that night Little Nell had now only one piece of money left a gold piece sewed in her dress 
7933_113272_000023_000001	train-clean-360	This she had to change into silver and to pay a part for their lodging 
7933_113272_000023_000002	train-clean-360	When she was abed she could not sleep for fear of the wicked men she had seen gambling 
7933_113272_000024_000000	train-clean-360	When at last she fell asleep she waked suddenly to see a figure in the room 
7933_113272_000024_000001	train-clean-360	She was too frightened to scream and lay very still and trembled The robber searched her clothing took the rest of the money and went out 
7933_113272_000024_000002	train-clean-360	She was dreadfully afraid he might return to harm her 
7933_113272_000024_000003	train-clean-360	If she could get to her grandfather she thought she would be safe 
none	none	She opened the door softly and in the moonlight saw the figure entering the old man s room 
7933_113272_000025_000001	train-clean-360	She caught a view of his face and then she knew that the figure was her own grandfather and that crazed by the gambling scene he himself had robbed her 
8005-113329-0007	train-other-500	All that night
none	none	 little Nell lay and cried 
7933_113272_000026_000001	train-clean-360	She knew to be sure that her grandfather was not a thief and that he did not know what he was doing when he stole her money but she knew too that if people found out he was crazy they would take him away from her and shut him up where she could not be with him and of this she could not bear to think 
none	none	The next day when they had gone back to the waxwork she was in even greater terror for fear he should rob missus Jarley their benefactress So to lessen the chance of this each day she gave him every penny she earned 
7933_113272_000027_000001	train-clean-360	This she soon knew he gambled away for often he was out all night and even seemed to shun her so she was sad and took many long walks alone through the fields 
none	none	One evening it happened that she passed a meadow where beside a hedge a fire was burning with three men sitting and lying around it She was in the shadow and they did not see her 
7933_113272_000028_000002	train-clean-360	One she saw was her grandfather and the others were the gamblers with whom he had played at the inn on the night of the storm 
7933_113272_000029_000000	train-clean-360	Little Nell crept close 
7933_113272_000029_000001	train-clean-360	They were tempting the poor daft old man to steal the money from missus Jarley s strong box and while she listened he consented 
7933_113272_000030_000000	train-clean-360	She ran home in terrible grief 
7933_113272_000030_000001	train-clean-360	She tried to sleep but could not 
7933_113272_000030_000002	train-clean-360	At last she could bear it no longer 
7933_113272_000030_000003	train-clean-360	She went to the old man s room and wakened him 
none	none	I have had a dreadful dream she told him a dream of an old gray haired man like you robbing people of their gold 
7933_113272_000031_000001	train-clean-360	I can not stay 
none	none	I can not leave you here 
7933_113272_000031_000003	train-clean-360	We must go 
none	none	To the crazy old man she seemed an angel 
7933_113272_000032_000001	train-clean-360	He dressed himself in fear and with her little basket on her arm she led him out of the house on away from the town into the country far away from missus Jarley who had been so kind to them and from the new home they had found 
none	none	They climbed a high hill just as the sun was rising and far behind them little Nell caught a last view of the village As she looked back and thought how contented they had been there at first and of the further wandering that lay before them now poor little Nell burst into tears But at length she bravely dried her tears lest they sadden her grandfather and they went on When the sun grew warm they fell asleep on the bank of the canal and when they awoke in the afternoon some rough canal men took them aboard their dirty craft as far as the next town The men were well meaning enough and meant the travelers no harm but after a while they began to drink and quarreled and fought among themselves and little Nell sat all night wet with the rain and sang to them to quiet them 
7933_113272_000036_000000	train-clean-360	The place to which they finally came was a town of wretched workmen who toiled all day in iron furnaces for little wages and were almost as miserable and hungry as the wanderers themselves 
none	none	No one gave them anything and they lived for three days with only two penny loaves to eat for all their money was now gone and slept at night in the ashes of some poor laborer s hut The fourth day they dragged themselves into the country again Little Nell s shoes were worn through to the bare ground her feet were bleeding her limbs ached and she was deadly faint 
7933_113272_000037_000002	train-clean-360	They begged but no one would help them 
7933_113272_000038_000000	train-clean-360	The child s strength was almost gone when they met a traveler who was reading in a book as he walked along 
7933_113272_000038_000001	train-clean-360	He looked up as they came near 
none	none	It was the kind old schoolmaster in whose school they had slept before they met missus Jarley in her house on wheels 
7933_113272_000038_000003	train-clean-360	When she saw him little Nell shrieked and fell unconscious at his feet 
7933_113272_000039_000000	train-clean-360	The schoolmaster carried her to an inn near by where she was put to bed and doctored under his care for she was very weak 
7933_113272_000039_000001	train-clean-360	She told him all the story of their wanderings and he heard it with astonishment and wonder to find such a great heart and heroism in a child 
7933_113272_000040_000000	train-clean-360	He had been appointed schoolmaster he told her in another town to which he was then on his way and he declared they should go with him and he would care for them 
none	none	He hired a farm wagon to carry little Nell and he and the old man walked beside it and so they came to their new place Next door to the school house was the church A very old woman nearly a hundred years old had lived in a tenement near by to keep the keys and open the church for services The old woman was now dead and the schoolmaster went to the clergyman and asked that her place be given to the grandfather so that he and little Nell could live in the house next to his own dwelling 
7933_113272_000042_000000	train-clean-360	The child sewed the tattered curtains and mended the worn carpet and the schoolmaster trimmed the long grass and trained the ivy before the door In the evening a bright fire was kindled and they all three took their supper together and then the schoolmaster said a prayer before they went gladly to bed 
7933_113272_000043_000000	train-clean-360	They were very happy in this new home 
none	none	The old man lost the insane thirst for gaming and the mad look faded from his eyes but poor little Nell grew paler and more fragile every day The long days of hunger and nights of exposure had sowed the seeds of illness The whole village soon grew to love her Many came to visit her and the schoolmaster read to her each day so that she was content even when she could no longer walk abroad as she had always done As she lay looking out at the peaceful churchyard where so many whose lives were over lay sleeping it seemed to her that the painful past was only an ugly vision And at night she often dreamed of the roof opening and a column of bright faces rising far into the sky looking down on her asleep The quiet spot outside remained the same save that the air was full of music and a sound of angels wings 
7933_113272_000046_000000	train-clean-360	So the weeks passed into winter and though she came soon to know that she was not long for earth she thought of death without regret and of heaven with joy 
none	none	III THE SEARCH It is not to be supposed of course that the flight of little Nell and her grandfather from the Old Curiosity Shop was not noticed All the time while they were wandering about homeless and wretched more than one went searching everywhere for them without success 
7933_113273_000000_000000	train-clean-360	One of these was Quilp the ugly dwarf 
7933_113273_000000_000001	train-clean-360	He had loaned the grandfather more money than the shop would bring and he made up his mind now that the old man had a secret hoard somewhere which might be his if he could find it 
7933_113273_000000_000002	train-clean-360	He soon learned that if Kit knew anything about it he would not tell so he and his lawyer a sleek oily rascal named Brass made many plans for finding them 
7933_113273_000000_000003	train-clean-360	But for a long time Quilp could get no trace 
7933_113273_000001_000000	train-clean-360	Another who tried to find them was a curious lodger who roomed in Brass s house 
none	none	He seemed to have plenty of money but was very eccentric Nobody knew even his name and so they called him The Stranger 
7933_113273_000002_000000	train-clean-360	He kept in his room a big box like trunk in which was a silver stove that he used to cook his meals 
7933_113273_000002_000001	train-clean-360	The stove had a lot of little openings In one he would put an egg in another some coffee in another a piece of meat and in the fourth some water 
7933_113273_000002_000002	train-clean-360	Then he would light a lamp that stood under it and in five minutes the egg would be cooked the coffee boiled and the meat done all ready to eat 
7933_113273_000003_000000	train-clean-360	He was the queerest sort of boarder 
7933_113273_000003_000001	train-clean-360	The strangest habit he had was this He seemed to be very fond of Punch and Judy shows and whenever he heard one on the street he would run out without his hat make the showmen perform in front of the house and then invite them to his rooms where he would question them for a long time 
none	none	This habit used to puzzle both Brass and Quilp the dwarf and they never could guess why he did it The truth was the mysterious Stranger was a long missing brother of little Nell s grandfather A misunderstanding had come between them many years before when both were young men 
7933_113273_000004_000002	train-clean-360	The younger had become a traveler in many countries and had never seen his brother since 
7933_113273_000004_000003	train-clean-360	But he dreamed often of the days when they had been children and at last he forgot the thing that had driven them apart 
7933_113273_000004_000004	train-clean-360	He had come back now to England a rich man to find the other had vanished with little Nell his grandchild 
7933_113273_000004_000005	train-clean-360	He had soon learned the story of their misfortune and how the fear of Quilp had driven them away 
7933_113273_000004_000006	train-clean-360	After much inquiry he had discovered they had been seen with a Punch and Judy show and now he was trying to find the showmen 
7933_113273_000004_000007	train-clean-360	And finally in this way he did find the very same pair the wanderers had met 
none	none	He learned from them all they could tell him that the child and the old man had disappeared at the fair and that since then so they had heard a pair resembling them had been seen with the Jarley waxwork exhibition The Stranger easily discovered where missus Jarley was and determined to set out to her at once 
7933_113273_000005_000001	train-clean-360	But he remembered that his brother little Nell s grandfather could not be expected to know him after all the years he had been gone and as for little Nell herself she had never seen him and he was afraid if they heard a strange man had come for them they would take fright and run away again 
7933_113273_000005_000002	train-clean-360	So he tried to find some one they had loved to go with him to show that he intended only kindness 
7933_113273_000006_000000	train-clean-360	He was not long in hearing of Kit who had found a situation as footman and he gained his employer s leave to take the lad with him 
7933_113273_000006_000001	train-clean-360	When Kit learned that The Stranger had discovered where little Nell was he was overjoyed but he knew he himself was not the one to go because before they disappeared she had told him he must never come to the Old Curiosity Shop again and that her grandfather blamed him as the cause of their misfortune 
7933_113273_000006_000002	train-clean-360	But Kit promised the Stranger that his mother should go in his place and went to tell her at once 
none	none	Kit found his mother was at church but the matter was so urgent that he went straight to the pew and brought her out which caused even the minister to pause in his sermon and made all the congregation look surprised 
7933_113273_000007_000001	train-clean-360	Kit took her home packed her box and bundled her into the coach which the Stranger brought and away they went to find the wanderers 
7933_113273_000008_000000	train-clean-360	Now Quilp had all along suspected that Kit and his mother knew something of their whereabouts and he had made it his business to watch either one or the other 
7933_113273_000008_000001	train-clean-360	The dwarf in fact was in the church when Kit came for his mother and he followed 
7933_113273_000008_000002	train-clean-360	When she left with the Stranger he took another coach and pursued feeling certain he was on the right track 
7933_113273_000009_000000	train-clean-360	But they were all too late 
none	none	When the Stranger found missus Jarley next day she could only tell him that little Nell and her grandfather had disappeared again and he had to return with Kit s mother much discouraged to London 
7933_113273_000010_000000	train-clean-360	The part Kit had played in this made the dwarf hate him if possible more than ever and he agreed to pay Brass his rascally lawyer to ruin the lad by making a false charge of theft against him 
7933_113273_000011_000000	train-clean-360	One day when Kit came to Brass s house to see the Stranger who lodged up stairs the lawyer cunningly hid a five pound note in the lad s hat and as soon as he left ran after him seized him in the street and accused him of taking it from his office desk 
7933_113273_000012_000000	train-clean-360	Kit was arrested and the note of course was found on his person 
7933_113273_000012_000001	train-clean-360	The evidence seemed so strong that the poor fellow was quickly tried found guilty and sentenced to prison for a long time 
7933_113273_000013_000000	train-clean-360	All might have gone wrong but for a little maid servant of Brass s whom the lawyer had starved and mistreated for years 
7933_113273_000013_000001	train-clean-360	He used to keep her locked in the moldy cellar and gave her so little to eat that she would creep into the office at night she had found a key that fitted the door to pick up the bits of bread that Dick Swiveller Brass s clerk had left when he ate his luncheon 
7933_113273_000014_000000	train-clean-360	One night while this little drudge was prowling about above stairs she overheard Brass telling his sister Sally who was his partner and colder and crueler and more wicked even than he was the trick he was going to play 
7933_113273_000014_000001	train-clean-360	After Kit was arrested she ran away from Brass s house and told her story to Kit s employer who had all along believed in his innocence 
none	none	Brass in the meantime had gone to Quilp to get his reward for this evil deed but the terrible dwarf now only laughed at him and pretended to remember nothing at all about the bargain This so enraged the lawyer that when he was brought face to face with the little maid s evidence and found that he himself was caught he made full confession of the part Quilp had played and told the whole story to revenge himself on the dwarf 
7933_113273_000017_000000	train-clean-360	Officers were sent at once to arrest Quilp at a dingy dwelling on a wharf in the river where he often slept with the object of terrifying his wife by his long absences 
7933_113273_000017_000001	train-clean-360	Here he had set up the battered figurehead of a wrecked ship and imagining that its face resembled that of Kit whom he so fiendishly hated he used to amuse himself by screwing gimlets into its breast sticking forks into its eyes and beating it with a poker 
7933_113273_000018_000000	train-clean-360	A few minutes before the officers arrived the dwarf received warning from Sally Brass but he had no time to get away 
none	none	When he heard the knocking on the gates and knew that the law he had so long defied was at last upon him he fell into a panic and did not know which way to turn 
7933_113273_000018_000002	train-clean-360	He tried to cover the light of the fire but only succeeded in upsetting the stove 
none	none	Then he ran out of the house on to the dock in the darkness 
7933_113273_000019_000000	train-clean-360	It was a black foggy night and he could not see a foot before him 
7933_113273_000019_000001	train-clean-360	He thought he could climb over the wall to the next wharf and so escape but in his fright he missed his way and fell over the edge of the platform into the swift flowing river 
7933_113273_000020_000000	train-clean-360	He screamed in terror but the water filled his throat and the knocking on the gates was so loud that no one heard him 
7933_113273_000020_000001	train-clean-360	The water swept him close to a ship but its keel was smooth and slippery and there was nothing to cling to 
7933_113273_000020_000002	train-clean-360	He had been so wicked that he was afraid to die and he fought desperately but the rapid tide smothered his cries and dragged him down to death 
7933_113273_000021_000000	train-clean-360	The waves threw his drowned body finally on the edge of a dismal swamp in the red glare of the blazing ruin which the overturned stove that night made of the building in which he had framed his evil plots 
7933_113273_000021_000001	train-clean-360	And this was the end of Quilp the dwarf 
7933_113273_000022_000000	train-clean-360	As for Kit he found himself all at once not only free but a hero 
none	none	His employer came to the jail to tell him that he was free and that everyone knew now of his innocence and they made him eat and drink and everybody shook hands with him Then he was put into a coach and they drove straight home where his mother was waiting to kiss him and cry over him with joy And last but by no means least of all his new good fortune he learned then that the Stranger who had been searching so long for little Nell and her grandfather had found certainly where they were and that Kit was to go with him and his employer at once and bring them back again to London They started the next day and on the long road they talked much of little Nell and the strange chance by which the lost had been found 
7933_113273_000024_000001	train-clean-360	A gentleman who lived in the village to which they were now bound who had himself been kind to the child and to the old man whom the new schoolmaster had brought with him had written of the pair to Kit s employer and the letter had been the lost clue so long sought to their hiding place 
7933_113273_000025_000000	train-clean-360	Snow began falling as the daylight wore away and the coach wheels made no noise 
7933_113273_000025_000001	train-clean-360	All night and all the next day they rode and it was midnight before they came to the town where the two wanderers had taken refuge 
7933_113273_000026_000000	train-clean-360	The village was very still and the air was frosty and cold 
7933_113273_000026_000001	train-clean-360	Only a single light was to be seen coming from a window beside a church 
none	none	This was the house which the Stranger knew sheltered those they sought but both he and Kit felt a strange fear as they saw that light the only one in the whole village 
7933_113273_000027_000000	train-clean-360	They left the driver to take the horses to the inn and approached the building afoot 
7933_113273_000027_000001	train-clean-360	They went quite close and looked through the window 
7933_113273_000027_000002	train-clean-360	In the room an old man bent low over a fire crooning to himself and Kit seeing that it was his old master opened the door ran in knelt by him and caught his hand 
7933_113273_000028_000000	train-clean-360	The old grandfather did not recognize Kit 
none	none	He believed him a spirit as he thought many spirits had talked to him that day 
7933_113273_000028_000002	train-clean-360	He was much changed and it seemed as if some great blow or grief had crazed him 
7933_113273_000028_000003	train-clean-360	He had a dress of little Nell s in his hand and smoothed and patted it as he muttered that she had been asleep asleep a long time now and was marble cold and would not wake 
none	none	Her little homely dress he said
7933_113273_000029_000001	train-clean-360	 And see here these shoes how worn they are 
7933_113273_000029_000002	train-clean-360	You see where her feet went bare upon the ground 
7933_113273_000029_000003	train-clean-360	They told me afterward that the stones had cut and bruised them 
7933_113273_000029_000004	train-clean-360	She never told me that 
7933_113273_000029_000005	train-clean-360	No no God bless her 
7933_113273_000029_000006	train-clean-360	And I have remembered since how she walked behind me that I might not see how lame she was but yet she had my hand in hers and seemed to lead me still 
7933_113273_000030_000000	train-clean-360	So he muttered on and the cheeks of the others were wet with tears for they had begun to understand the sad truth 
none	none	Kit could not speak but the Stranger did You speak of little Nell he said Do you remember long ago another child too who loved you when you were a child yourself 
7933_113273_000031_000002	train-clean-360	Say that you had a brother long forgotten who now at last came back to you to be what you were then to him 
7933_113273_000031_000003	train-clean-360	Give me but one word dear brother to say you know me and life will still be precious to us again 
none	none	The old man shook his head for grief had killed all memory 
7933_113273_000032_000001	train-clean-360	Pushing them aside he went into the next room calling little Nell s name softly as he went 
7933_113273_000033_000000	train-clean-360	They followed 
none	none	Kit sobbed as they entered for there on her bed little Nell lay dead Dear gentle patient noble Nell 
7933_113273_000034_000001	train-clean-360	The schoolmaster told them of her last hours 
7933_113273_000034_000002	train-clean-360	They had read and talked to her a while and then she had sunk peacefully to sleep 
none	none	They knew by what she said in her dreams that they were of her wanderings and of the people who had helped them for often she whispered God bless you And she spoke once of beautiful music that was in the air 
7933_113273_000035_000000	train-clean-360	Opening her eyes at last she begged that they would kiss her once again 
7933_113273_000035_000001	train-clean-360	That done she turned to the old man with a lovely smile on her face such he said as he had never seen and threw both arms about his neck 
7933_113273_000035_000002	train-clean-360	They did not know at first that she was dead 
7933_113273_000036_000000	train-clean-360	They laid little Nell to rest the next day in the churchyard where she had so often sat 
none	none	The old man never realized quite what had happened He thought she would come back to him some day and that then they would go away together He used to sit beside her grave and watch for her each afternoon 
7933_113273_000037_000000	train-clean-360	One day he did not return at the usual hour and they went to look for him 
7933_113273_000037_000001	train-clean-360	He was lying dead upon the stone 
7933_113273_000038_000000	train-clean-360	They buried him beside the child he had loved and there in the churchyard where they had often talked together they both lie side by side 
7933_113273_000039_000000	train-clean-360	None of those who had known little Nell ever forgot her story 
7933_113273_000039_000001	train-clean-360	After the death of the old man his brother the Stranger who had sought them so long traveled in the footsteps of the two wanderers to search out and reward all who had been kind to them missus 
7933_113273_000039_000002	train-clean-360	Jarley of the waxwork the Punch and Judy showmen he found them all 
7933_113273_000039_000003	train-clean-360	Even the rough canal boatmen were not forgotten 
7933_113273_000040_000000	train-clean-360	Kit s story got abroad and he found himself with hosts of friends who gave him a good position and secured his mother from want 
7933_113273_000040_000001	train-clean-360	So that his greatest misfortune turned out after all to be his greatest good 
7933_113273_000041_000000	train-clean-360	The little maid whose evidence cleared Kit of the terrible charge against him lived to marry Dick Swiveller the clerk of Brass the lawyer while meek missus Quilp after her husband s drowning married a clever young man and lived a pleasant life on the dead dwarf s money 
7933_113273_000042_000000	train-clean-360	The fate of the others whose wickedness has been a part of this story was not so pleasant 
none	none	The two gamblers who tempted the old man to steal missus Jarley s strong box were detected in another crime and sent to jail Brass became a convict condemned to walk on a treadmill chained to a long line of other evil men and dragging wherever he went a heavy iron ball After he was released he joined his wicked sister Sally and the two sank lower and lower till they might even be seen on dark nights on narrow London streets searching in refuse boxes for bits of food like twin spirits of wickedness and crime When Kit had grown to be a man and had children of his own he often took them to the spot where stood what had been The Old Curiosity Shop and told them over and over the story of little Nell And he always ended by saying that if they were good like her they might go some time where they could see and know her as he had done when he was a boy THE ADVENTURES OF OLIVER TWIST Published eighteen thirty seven Scene London and Neighboring Towns Time eighteen twenty five to eighteen thirty seven CHARACTERS Oliver Twist A foundling mister Bumble The master of the poorhouse missus Bumble The mistress of the poorhouse Monks Oliver s half brother and his enemy mister Brownlow Oliver s benefactor missus Maylie Oliver s benefactress Miss Rose missus Maylie s adopted niece In reality Oliver s aunt Fagin A Jew Leader of a gang of thieves in London Bill Sikes A burglar Nancy Sikes s partner in crime The Artful Dodger A youthful pickpocket OLIVER TWIST I HOW OLIVER CAME TO LONDON AND WHAT HE FOUND THERE Oliver Twist was the son of a poor lady who was found lying in the street one day in an English village 
7883-113274-0000	train-other-500	almost starved and very ill She had walked a long way for her shoes were worn to pieces but where she came from or where she was going nobody knew As she had no money she was taken to the poorhouse
none	none	 where she died the next day without even telling her name leaving behind her only a gold locket which was around her neck and a baby 
7883-113274-0001	train-other-500	The locket fell into the hands of the mistress of the poorhouse who was named missus Bumble It contained the dead mother s wedding ring and as missus Bumble was a dishonest woman
7883-113274-0002	train-other-500	she hid both locket and ring intending sometime to sell them The baby was left with no one to care for it
none	none	 to grow up at the poorhouse with the other wretched orphan children who wore calico dresses all alike 
7883-113274-0003	train-other-500	and had little to eat and many whippings mister Bumble the master of the poorhouse was a pompous self important bully who browbeat every one weaker than himself
7883-113274-0004	train-other-500	and scolded and cuffed the paupers to his heart s content It was he who named the baby Oliver Twist He used to name all the babies as they came along by the letters of the alphabet
7883-113274-0005	train-other-500	The one before Oliver was named Swubble then came Oliver with a T the next would be Unwin the next Vilkins
none	none	 and so on down to Z 
7883-113274-0006	train-other-500	Then he would begin the alphabet all over again Little Oliver the baby grew without any idea of who he was When he was a year old he was sent to the poor farm where an old woman took care of orphan children
7883-113274-0007	train-other-500	for a very small sum apiece each week This money which was paid by the town was hardly enough to buy them food but nevertheless the old woman took good care to save the bigger share for herself
7883-113274-0008	train-other-500	He lived there till he was a pale handsome boy of nine years and then he was taken to the workhouse where with many other boys of his own age or older he had to work hard all day picking oakum
7883-113274-0009	train-other-500	The boys had nothing but thin gruel for their meals with an onion twice a week and half a roll on Sundays They ate in a great stone hall in one end of which stood the big copper of gruel
7883-113274-0010	train-other-500	which mister Bumble ladled out Each boy got only one helping and the bowls never needed washing because when the meal was through there was not a drop of gruel left in them
7883-113274-0011	train-other-500	After each meal they all sat staring at the copper and sucking their fingers but nobody dared ask for more One day they felt so terribly hungry
7883-113274-0012	train-other-500	that one of the biggest boys said unless he got another helping of gruel he was afraid he would have to eat the boy who slept next him The little boys all believed this and cast lots to see who should ask for more
7883-113274-0013	train-other-500	It fell to Oliver Twist So that night after supper though he was dreadfully frightened Oliver rose and went up to the end of the room and said to mister Bumble Please sir
7883-113274-0014	train-other-500	I want some more mister Bumble was so surprised he turned pale What he gasped Please sir said Oliver again I want some more
7883-113274-0015	train-other-500	mister Bumble picked up the ladle and struck Oliver on the head with it then he pounced on him and shook him When he was tired shaking him he dragged him away and shut him up in a dark room
7883-113274-0016	train-other-500	where he stayed a whole week and was only taken out once a day to be whipped Then to make an example of him a notice was pasted on the gate of the workhouse
none	none	 offering a reward to anybody who would take poor Oliver away 
7883-113274-0017	train-other-500	and do what he liked with him The first one who came by was a middle aged chimney sweep who wanted a boy to climb up the insides of chimneys and clean out the soot This was a dangerous thing to do for sometimes the boys who did it
none	none	 got burned or choked with the smoke and when Oliver found what they were going to do with him and looked at the man s cruel face 
7883-113274-0018	train-other-500	he burst out crying so that a kind hearted magistrate interfered and would not let the chimney sweep have him mister Bumble finally gave him to the village undertaker
7883-113274-0019	train-other-500	and there he had to mind the shop and do all the chores He slept under the counter among piles of empty coffins The undertaker s wife beat him often and whenever he was not at work he had to attend funerals
7883-113274-0020	train-other-500	which was by no means amusing so that he found life no better than it had been at the workhouse The undertaker had an apprentice too who kicked him whenever he came near
7883-113274-0021	train-other-500	All this wretchedness Oliver bore as well as he could without complaining But one day the cowardly apprentice began to say unkind things of Oliver s dead mother and this he could not stand
7883-113274-0022	train-other-500	His anger made him stronger even than his tormentor though the latter was more than a head taller and much older and he sprang upon him caught him by the throat and after shaking him till his teeth rattled
7883-113274-0023	train-other-500	knocked him flat on the floor The big bully screamed for help and cried that he was being murdered so that the undertaker and his wife came running in Oliver told them what the apprentice had said but that made no difference
none	none	 The undertaker sent for mister Bumble and between them they flogged him till he could hardly stand 
7883-113274-0024	train-other-500	and sent him to bed without anything to eat Till then Oliver had not shed a tear but now alone in the dark he felt so miserable that he cried for a long time There was nothing to do
7883-113274-0025	train-other-500	he thought at last but to run away So he tied up his few belongings in a handkerchief and waiting till the first beam of sunrise he unbarred the door
7883-113274-0026	train-other-500	and ran away as fast as he could through the town into the country He hid behind hedges whenever he saw anybody for fear the undertaker or mister Bumble were after him
7883-113274-0027	train-other-500	and before long he found a road that he knew led to London Oliver had never seen a city but he thought where there were so many people there would certainly be something for a boy to do to earn his living
7883-113274-0028	train-other-500	so he trudged stoutly on and before nightfall had walked twenty miles He begged a crust of bread at a cottage and slept under a hayrick The next day and night he was so very hungry and cold
7883-113274-0029	train-other-500	that when morning came again he could scarcely walk at all He sat down finally at the edge of a village wondering whether he was going to die when he saw coming along the queerest looking boy
7883-113274-0030	train-other-500	He was about Oliver s age with a snub nose bow legs and little sharp eyes
none	none	 His face was very dirty and he wore a man s coat 
7883-113274-0031	train-other-500	whose ragged tails came to his heels The boy saw Oliver s plight and asked him what the matter was mixing his words with such a lot of strange slang that Oliver could hardly understand him
7883-113274-0032	train-other-500	When Oliver explained that he had been walking a number of days and was very hungry the other took him to a shop near by bought him some bread and ham and watched him eat it with great attention asking him many questions
7883-113274-0033	train-other-500	whether he had any money or knew any place in London where he could stay Oliver answered no Don t fret about that said the other I know a spectable old genelman as lives there wot ll give you lodgings for nothing
7883-113274-0034	train-other-500	if I interduce you Oliver did not think his new host looked very respectable himself but he thought it might be as well for him to know the old gentleman particularly as he had nowhere else to go
7883-113274-0035	train-other-500	So they set off It was night when they reached London and it was so big and crowded that Oliver kept close to his guide
none	none	 He noticed however that the streets they passed through were narrow and dirty 
7883-113274-0036	train-other-500	and the houses old and hideously filthy The people too seemed low and wretched He was just wondering if he had not better run away when the boy pushed open a door
7883-113274-0037	train-other-500	drew Oliver inside up a broken stairway and into a back room Here frying some sausages over a stove was a shriveled old Jew in a greasy flannel gown He was very ugly
7883-113274-0038	train-other-500	and his matted red hair hung down over his villainous face In a corner stood a clothes horse on which hung hundreds of silk handkerchiefs and four or five boys as dirty and oddly dressed
7883-113274-0039	train-other-500	as the one who had brought Oliver sat about a table smoking pipes like rough grown men Oliver s guide introduced him to the Jew whose name was Fagin
7883-113274-0040	train-other-500	and the boys crowded around him putting their hands into his pockets which he thought a queer joke Fagin grinned horribly as he shook hands with him and told him he was very welcome which did not tend to reassure him
7883-113274-0041	train-other-500	and then the sausages were passed around The Jew gave Oliver a glass of something to drink and as soon as he drank it he became very sleepy and knew nothing more till the following morning
none	none	 The next few days Oliver saw much to wonder at When he woke up Fagin was sorting over a great box full of watches which he hid away when he saw Oliver was looking Every day the boy who had brought him there 
7883-113274-0042	train-other-500	whom they called the Artful Dodger came in and gave the Jew some pocketbooks and handkerchiefs Oliver thought he must have made the pocketbooks only they did not look new and some seemed to have money in them
7883-113274-0043	train-other-500	He noticed too that whenever the Artful Dodger came home empty handed Fagin seemed angry and cuffed and kicked him and sent him to bed supperless but when he brought home a good number everything was very jolly
7883-113274-0044	train-other-500	Whenever there was nothing else to do the old Jew played a very curious game with the boys This was the way they played it Fagin would put a snuff box in one pocket a watch in another and a handkerchief in a third
7883-113274-0045	train-other-500	then he would walk about the room just as any old gentleman would walk about the street stopping now and then as if he were looking into shop windows All the time the boys followed him closely sometimes treading on his toes
7883-113274-0046	train-other-500	or stumbling against him and when this happened one of them would slip a hand into his pocket and take out either the watch or the snuff box or the handkerchief If the Jew felt a hand in his pocket he cried out
7883-113274-0047	train-other-500	which it was and then the game began all over again At last Fagin made Oliver try if he could take something out of his pocket without his knowing it and when Oliver succeeded he patted his head and seemed well pleased
7883-113274-0048	train-other-500	But Oliver grew very tired of the dirty room and the same game He longed for the open air and begged to be allowed to go out so one day the Jew put him in charge of the Artful Dodger and they went upon the streets
7883-113274-0049	train-other-500	Oliver wondering where in the world he was going to be taught to make pocketbooks He was on the point of asking when the Artful Dodger signed to him to be silent
7883-113274-0050	train-other-500	and slunk behind an old gentleman who was reading a book in front of a book stall You can imagine Oliver s horror when he saw him thrust his hand into the old gentleman s pocket
7883-113274-0051	train-other-500	draw out a silk handkerchief and run off at full speed In an instant Oliver understood the mystery of the handkerchiefs the watches the purses
7883-113274-0052	train-other-500	and the curious game he had learned at Fagin s He knew then that the Artful Dodger was a pickpocket He was so frightened that for a minute he lost his wits and ran off as fast as he could go
7883-113274-0053	train-other-500	Just then the old gentleman found his handkerchief was gone and seeing Oliver running away shouted Stop thief which frightened the poor boy even more and made him run all the faster Everybody joined the chase
none	none	 and before he had gone far a burly fellow overtook Oliver and knocked him down 
7883-113274-0054	train-other-500	A policeman was at hand and he was dragged more dead than alive to the police court followed by the angry old gentleman The moment the latter saw the boy s face
7883-113274-0055	train-other-500	however he could not believe it was the face of a thief and refused to appear against him but the magistrate was in a bad humor and was about to sentence Oliver to prison anyway
7883-113274-0056	train-other-500	when the owner of the book stall came hurrying in He had seen the theft and knew Oliver was not guilty so the magistrate was obliged to let him go But the terror and the blow he had received had been too much for Oliver
7883-113274-0057	train-other-500	He fell down in a faint and the old gentleman whose name was mister Brownlow overcome with pity put him into a coach and drove him to his own home
none	none	 determined if the boy had no parents to adopt him as his own son II OLIVER S ADVENTURES 
7883-113275-0000	train-other-500	While Oliver was resting in such good hands very strange things were occurring in the house of Fagin When the Artful Dodger told him of the arrest the Jew was full of anger He had intended to make a clever thief of Oliver
7883-113275-0001	train-other-500	and compel him to bring him many stolen things now he had not only failed in this and lost the boy s help but he was also afraid that Oliver would tell all about the wicked practices he had seen and show the officers where he had lived
7883-113275-0002	train-other-500	This he thought was likely to happen at any time unless he could get the boy into his power again Something had occurred too meantime that made Fagin almost crazy with rage at losing him
7883-113275-0003	train-other-500	It was this A wicked man so wicked that he was afraid of thunder who went by the name of Monks had come to him and told him he would pay a large sum of money
7883-113275-0004	train-other-500	if he could succeed in making Oliver a thief and so ruin his reputation and his good name It was plain enough that for some reason the man hated Oliver but cunning as Fagin was
7883-113275-0005	train-other-500	he would never have guessed why For Monks was really Oliver s older half brother A little while before this story began Oliver s father had been obliged to go on a trip to a foreign country
none	none	 where he died very suddenly But before he died he made a will in which he left all his fortune to be divided between the baby Oliver and his mother He left only a small sum to his older son because he knew that he was wicked and did not deserve any 
7883-113275-0006	train-other-500	The will declared Oliver should have the money only on condition that he never stain his name with any act of meanness dishonor cowardice or wrong If he did do this
7883-113275-0007	train-other-500	then half the money was to go to the older son The dying man also wrote a letter to Oliver s mother telling her that he had made the will and that he was dying but the older son who was with him when he died
7883-113275-0008	train-other-500	found the letter and destroyed it So Oliver s poor mother knowing nothing of all this when his father did not come back thought at last that he had deserted her
7883-113275-0009	train-other-500	and in her shame stole away from her home poor and ill clad to die finally in the poorhouse The older brother who had taken the name of Monks hunted and hunted for them
7883-113275-0010	train-other-500	because he hated Oliver on account of their father s will and wanted to do him all the harm he could
none	none	 He discovered that they had been taken into the poorhouse and went there 
7883-113275-0011	train-other-500	but this was after Oliver had run away He found however to his satisfaction that the boy knew nothing about his parentage or his real name
none	none	 and Monks made up his mind to prevent his ever learning 
7883-113275-0012	train-other-500	There was only one person who could have told Oliver and that one was missus Bumble She knew through the locket she had kept which had belonged to Oliver s mother
7883-113275-0013	train-other-500	and which contained the dead woman s wedding ring with her name engraved inside it
none	none	 When missus Bumble heard that a man named Monks was searching for news of Oliver 
7883-113275-0014	train-other-500	she thought it a capital chance to make some money She went therefore to Monks s house and sold the locket and ring to him These Monks thought
7883-113275-0015	train-other-500	were the only proofs in the world that could ever show Oliver who he was and to make it impossible for him ever to see them he dropped them through a trap door in his house down into the river
7883-113275-0016	train-other-500	where they could never be found But Monks did not give up searching for Oliver and at last on the very day that Oliver was arrested he saw him coming from Fagin s house with the Artful Dodger
7883-113275-0017	train-other-500	From his wonderful resemblance to their dead father he guessed at once
none	none	 that Oliver was the half brother whose very name he hated 
7883-113275-0018	train-other-500	Knowing the other now to be in London Monks was afraid that by some accident he might yet find out what a fortune had been willed him If he could only make Oliver dishonest Monks reflected
none	none	 half their father s fortune would become his own With this thought in mind he had gone to Fagin 
7883-113275-0019	train-other-500	and had made him his offer of money to make the boy a thief Fagin of course had agreed and now to find his victim was out of his power made the Jew grind his teeth with rage
7883-113275-0020	train-other-500	All these things made Fagin determined to gain possession of Oliver again and to do this he got the help of two others a young woman named Nancy and her lover a brutal robber named Bill Sikes
7883-113275-0021	train-other-500	These two discovered that Oliver was at mister Brownlow s house and lay in wait to kidnap him if he ever came out The chance they waited for occurred before many days
none	none	 mister Brownlow sent Oliver to take some money to the very book stall in front of which 
7883-113275-0022	train-other-500	the Artful Dodger had stolen the handkerchief and Oliver went without dreaming of any danger Suddenly a young woman in a cap and apron screamed out behind him very loudly Oh my dear little brother
7883-113275-0023	train-other-500	and threw her arms tight around him Oh my gracious I ve found him she cried Come home directly you naughty boy For shame to treat your poor mother so
7883-113275-0024	train-other-500	Oliver struggled but to no purpose Nancy for it was she told the people that crowded about them that it was her little brother who had run away from home and nearly broken his mother s heart
7883-113275-0025	train-other-500	and that she wanted to take him back Oliver insisted that he didn t know her at all and hadn t any sister but just then Bill Sikes appeared as he had planned
7883-113275-0026	train-other-500	and said the young woman was telling the truth and that Oliver was a little rascal and a liar The people were all convinced at this and when Sikes struck Oliver and seized him by the collar they said Serves him right
7883-113275-0027	train-other-500	And so Oliver found himself dragged away from mister Brownlow to the filthy house where lived Fagin The wily old Jew was overjoyed to see them
none	none	 He smiled such a fiendish smile that Oliver screamed for help as loud as he could and at this Fagin picked up a great jagged club to beat him with Now Nancy had been very wicked all her life 
7883-113275-0028	train-other-500	but in spite of this there was a little good in her She had already begun to repent having helped steal the boy and now his plight touched her heart She seized the club and threw it into the fire
7883-113275-0029	train-other-500	and so saved him the beating for that time For many days Oliver was kept a prisoner He was free to wander about the mildewed old house
7883-113275-0030	train-other-500	but every outer door was locked and every window had closed iron shutters All the light came in through small round holes at the top which made the rooms gloomy and full of shadows
none	none	 Spiderwebs were over all the walls and often the mice would go scampering across the floor 
7883-113275-0031	train-other-500	There was only one window to look out of and that was in a back garret but it had iron bars and looked out only on to the housetops He found only one book to read this was a history of the lives of great criminals
7883-113275-0032	train-other-500	and was full of stories of secret thefts and murders For the old Jew having tortured his mind by loneliness and gloom had left the volume in his way hoping it would instil into his soul the poison that would blacken it for ever
7883-113275-0033	train-other-500	But Oliver s blood ran cold as he read and he pushed the book away in horror and falling on his knees prayed that he might be spared from such deeds and rescued from that terrible place
none	none	 He was still on his knees when Nancy came in and told him he must get ready at once 
7883-113275-0034	train-other-500	to go on a journey with Bill Sikes
none	none	 She had been crying and her face was bruised as though she had been beaten 
7883-113275-0035	train-other-500	Oliver saw she was very sorry for him and indeed she told him she would help him if she could but that there was no use trying to escape now because they were watched all the time and if he got away Sikes would certainly kill her
7883-113275-0036	train-other-500	Nancy took him to the house where Sikes lived and the next morning the latter started out making Oliver go with him
7883-113275-0037	train-other-500	Sikes had a loaded pistol in his overcoat pocket and he showed this to Oliver and told him if he spoke to anybody on the road or tried to get away he would shoot him with it They walked a long way out of London
7883-113275-0038	train-other-500	once or twice riding in carts which were going in their direction Whenever this happened Sikes kept his hand in the pocket where the pistol was so that Oliver was afraid to appeal for help
7883-113275-0039	train-other-500	Late at night they came to an old deserted mansion in the country and in the basement of this where a fire had been kindled they joined two other men whom Oliver had seen more than once in Fagin s house in London
none	none	 The journey had been cold and long and Oliver was very hungry but he could scarcely eat the supper that was given him for fear of what they intended to do with him in that lonely spot He was so tired however that he finally went fast asleep and knew nothing more 
7883-113275-0040	train-other-500	till two o clock in the morning when Sikes woke him roughly and bade him come with them It was foggy and cold and dark outside Sikes and one of the others each took one of Oliver s hands
7883-113275-0041	train-other-500	and so they walked a quarter of a mile to where was a fine house with a high wall around it They made him climb over the wall with them and pulling him along crept toward the house
none	none	 It was not till now that Oliver knew what they intended that they were going to rob the house and make him help them 
7883-113275-0042	train-other-500	so that he too would be a burglar His limbs began to tremble and he sank to his knees begging them to have mercy and to let him run away and die in the fields rather than to make him steal
7883-113275-0043	train-other-500	But Sikes drew his pistol with a frightful oath and dragged him on In the back of the house was a window which was not fastened because it was much too small for a man to get through But Oliver was so little that he could do it easily
none	none	 With the pistol in his hand Sikes put Oliver through the window gave him a lantern and bade him go and unlock the front door for them Illustration The Artful Dodger introducing Oliver Twist to Fagin See page fifty five Oliver had made up his mind that as soon as he got beyond the range of Sikes s pistol he would scream and wake everybody in the house but just then there was a sound from inside and Sikes called to him to come back Suddenly there was a loud shout from the top of the stairs a flash a report and Oliver staggered back with a terrible pain in his arm 
7883-113275-0044	train-other-500	and with everything swimming before his eyes He heard cries and the loud ringing of a bell and felt Sikes drag him backward through the window
none	none	 He felt himself being carried along rapidly and then a cold sensation crept over his heart and he knew no more III HOW EVERYTHING TURNED OUT RIGHT FOR OLIVER IN THE END After a long long time Oliver came to himself The morning was breaking He tried to rise and found that his arm was wounded and his clothes wet with blood He was so dizzy he could hardly stand but it was freezing cold and he knew if he stayed there he must die So he staggered on till he came to a road where a little way off he saw a house There he thought he might get help But when he came closer he saw that it was the very house the men had tried to rob that night Fear came over him then and he would have run away but he was too weak He had just strength left to push open the gate totter across the lawn and knock at the door then he sank in a faint on the steps In the house lived a lady named missus Maylie just as kind hearted as was mister Brownlow who had rescued Oliver at the police station and with her lived a beautiful girl whom she had adopted named Rose The servants when they came to the door made sure Oliver was one of the robbers and sent at once for policemen to take him in charge but Miss Rose the moment she saw what a good face the boy had and how little he looked like a thief made them put him to bed and send at once for the doctor When the good doctor arrived and saw Oliver who was still unconscious he thought Miss Rose was right and when the boy had come to himself and told them how he had suffered he was certain of it They were both sorry the policemen had been sent for because the doctor was sure they would not believe Oliver s story especially as he had been arrested once before He would have taken him away but he was too sick to be moved So when the officers came the doctor told them that the boy had been accidentally shot and had come to the house for assistance when the servants had mistaken him for one of the burglars This was not exactly the truth but it seemed necessary to deceive the policemen if Oliver was to be saved Of course the servant that had fired the pistol was not able to swear that he had hit anybody at all so the officers had to go away without arresting anybody After this Oliver was ill for a long time but he was carefully nursed especially by Miss Rose who grew as fond of him as if she had been his sister As soon as he grew better she wrote a letter for him to mister Brownlow the old gentleman who had rescued him from the police station but to Oliver s grief she found that he had gone to the West Indies Thus the time passed till Oliver was quite well and then Miss Rose first carefully instructing the servant who went with them not to lose sight of him for a moment for fear of his old enemies took him with her for a visit to London Meantime there had been a dreadful scene in Fagin s house when Bill Sikes got back to London and told the old Jew that the robbery had failed and that Oliver was lost again They were more afraid than ever that they would be caught and sent to prison Fagin swore at Sikes and Monks cursed Fagin and between them all they determined that Oliver must either be captured or killed While they were plotting afresh Nancy who had been feeling sorrier and sorrier for what she had done overheard them and so found out that Monks was Oliver s half brother and why he so hated him and she made up her mind to save the boy from his last and greatest danger So one evening when she was alone with him she gave Sikes some laudanum in a glass of liquor and when he was asleep she slipped away found Miss Rose and told her all about it Bad as Nancy was however she was not willing to betray Fagin or Bill Sikes so she only told her of Monks Miss Rose was greatly astonished for she had never heard of him before but she pitied Nancy because she had tried to help Oliver and of course she herself wanted very much to help him discover who he was and who his parents had been She thanked Nancy and begged her to come to see her again Nancy was afraid to do this because Bill Sikes watched her so closely but she promised that on the next Sunday at midnight she would be on a certain bridge where Miss Rose might see her Then Nancy hurried back before Sikes should wake up Miss Rose was in trouble now for there was no one in London with her then who could help her But the same afternoon whom should Oliver see at a distance walking into his house but mister Brownlow He came back in great joy to tell Miss Rose and she concluded that the old gentleman would be the very one to aid her She took Oliver to the house and sure enough there was the boy s old benefactor Very glad indeed he was to hear what she told him For the old gentleman when Oliver had disappeared with the money he had given him to take to the bookseller had been reluctant to think the boy he had befriended was after all a liar and a thief He had advertised for him but the only result had been a call from mister Bumble who told him terrible tales of Oliver s wickedness To find now after all this time that Oliver had not run away and that mister Bumble s tales were lying ones was a joyful surprise to mister Brownlow After he had heard the whole and when Oliver had gone into the garden Miss Rose told him of Nancy s visit and of the man Monks who still pursued the boy to do him harm It was fortunate that she had come to mister Brownlow for as it happened he knew a great deal about Monks and his evil life Years before the old gentleman himself had been a friend of Oliver s father He knew all about his death in a foreign country and had watched his older son s career of shame with sorrow The very trip he had made to the West Indies had acquainted him with a crime Monks had committed there from which he had fled to England But while mister Brownlow knew of the curious will Oliver s father had made what had become of the baby to which the latter referred he had never known Now from the story Miss Rose told him he was assured that Oliver was indeed this baby half brother of Monks But it was one thing to know this and quite another to enable Oliver to prove it The old gentleman was quick to see that they must get possession of Monks and frighten him into confessing the fact whose only proofs had been lost when he threw the locket and ring into the river mister Brownlow for this reason agreed with Miss Rose that they should both meet Nancy on the bridge on the coming Sunday to hear all she had been able to find out They said not a word of this to Oliver and when Sunday night came they drove to the spot where Nancy had promised to meet them She had kept her word She was there before them and mister Brownlow heard her story over again from her own lips But some one else was there too hidden behind a pillar where he could hear every word she said and this listener was a spy of Fagin s Nancy had cried so much and acted so strangely that the old Jew had grown suspicious and had set some one to watch her And who do you suppose this spy was No other than the cowardly apprentice who had bullied Oliver until he ran away from the undertaker s house The apprentice had finally run away too had come to London and begun a wicked life He was too big a coward to rob any one but little children who had been sent to the shop to buy something so Fagin had given him spying work to do and in this being by nature a sneak he proved very successful The spy lay hid till he had heard all Nancy said then he slipped out and ran as fast as his legs would carry him back to Fagin The latter sent for Bill Sikes knowing him to be the most brutal and bloodthirsty ruffian of all and told him what Nancy had done The knowledge as the Jew expected turned Sikes into a demon He rushed to where Nancy lived She had returned and was asleep on her couch but she woke as he entered and saw by his face that he meant to murder her Through all her evil career Nancy had been true to Sikes and would not have betrayed him But he would not listen now though she pleaded with him pitifully to come with her to some foreign country as Miss Rose had begged her to do where they might both lead better lives Fury had made him mad As she clung to his knees he seized a heavy club and struck her down So poor Nancy died with only time for a feeble prayer to God for mercy Of all bad deeds that Sikes had ever done that was the worst The sun shone through the window and lit the room where Nancy lay He tried to shut it out but he could not He grew suddenly afraid Horror came upon him He crept out of the room locked the door behind him and plunged into the crowded street He walked for miles and miles here and there without purpose Whichever way he went he could not rid himself of that horror When night came he crawled into a disused shed but he could not sleep Whenever he closed his eyes he seemed to see Nancy s eyes looking at him He got up and wandered on again desperately lonely for some one to talk to He heard a man telling another about the murder as he read the account in a newspaper and knew that he must hide He hastened then to a den he knew in a house beside the river dirty and dismal and the haunt of thieves Some of his old companions were there but even they shrank from him He had been seen to enter the place however and in a few minutes the street was full of people all yelling for his capture He barred the doors and windows but they began to break down the shutters with sledge hammers He ran to the roof with a rope thinking to let himself down on the side next the river and so escape Here he fastened one end of the rope to the chimney and making a loop in the other end put it over his head Just at that instant he imagined he saw Nancy s eyes again looking at him He staggered back in terror missed his footing and fell over the edge of the roof He had not had time to draw the noose down under his arms so that it slipped up around his neck and there he hung dead with a broken neck Meanwhile mister Brownlow had acted very quickly so that Monks had got no warning He had had men watching for the latter and now having found out all he wanted to know he had him seized in the street put into a coach and driven to his office where he brought him face to face with Oliver The old gentleman told Monks he could do one of two things either he could confess before witnesses the whole infamous plot he had framed against Oliver and so restore to him his rights and name or else he could refuse in which case he would at once be arrested and sent to prison Seeing that mister Brownlow knew all about the part he had played Monks to save himself made a full confession how he had planned to keep his half brother from his inheritance And he also confessed what no one there had guessed that Miss Rose who had been adopted in her infancy was really the sister of Oliver s dead mother his aunt indeed This was the happiest of all Oliver s surprises that day for he had learned to love Miss Rose very dearly Monks thus bought his own freedom and cheap enough he probably thought it for before he had finished his story word came that Fagin the Jew had been captured by the police and was to be tried without delay for his life Oliver no longer had anything to fear and came into possession of his true name and his fortune mister Brownlow adopted him as his own son and moved to the village where Oliver had been cared for in the family of Miss Rose and where they all lived happily ever afterward The company of thieves was broken up with Fagin s arrest Fagin himself was found guilty and died on the gallows shrieking with fear Monks sailed for America where he was soon detected in crime and died in prison The wicked apprentice who had been the real cause of poor Nancy s murder was so frightened at the fate of Fagin that he reformed and became a spy for the police and by his aid the Artful Dodger who continued to pick pockets soon found himself in jail As for mister and missus Bumble they of course lost their positions and sank from bad to worse till they finally became paupers and were sent to the very same poorhouse where they had tortured little

missus Rudge also Not only did he let her live rent free in a house he owned but he did many a kind deed secretly for her half witted son as he grew older Barnaby Rudge grew up a strange weird creature His hair was long and red and hung in disorder about his shoulders His skin was pale his eyes bright and his clothes he trimmed most curiously with bits of gaudy lace and bright ribbons and glass toys He wore a cluster of broken peacock feathers in his hat and girded at his side was the broken hilt of an old sword without a blade But strangest of all was a little wicker basket he always carried on his back When he set this down and opened it there hopped out a tame raven who would cock its head on one side and say hoarsely and very knowingly Hello Hello Hello What s the matter here Keep up your spirits Never say die I m a devil I m a devil I m a devil Hurrah Then it would whistle or make a noise like the drawing of a cork out of a bottle repeated a great many times and flap its wings against its sides as if it were bursting with laughter This raven was named Grip and was Barnaby s constant companion The neighbors used to say it was one hundred and twenty years old for ravens live a very long time and some said it knew altogether too much to be only a bird But Barnaby would hear nothing said against it and next to his mother loved it better than anything in the world Barnaby knew that folks called him half witted but he cared little for that Sometimes he would laugh at what they said Why he would say how much better to be silly than as wise as you You don t see shadowy people like those that live in sleep not you Nor eyes in the knotted panes of glass nor swift ghosts when it blows hard nor do you hear voices in the air nor see men stalking in the sky not you I lead a merrier life than you with all your cleverness You re the dull men We re the bright ones Ha ha I ll not change with you not I Haredale who had been so kind to Barnaby s mother was a burly stern man who had few acquaintances and lived much alone When first he came to live at The Warren an enemy of his Sir John Chester had circulated suspicious rumors about him so that some came half to believe he himself had had something to do with his brother s murder These whispers so affected Haredale that as time passed he grew gloomy and morose and lived in seclusion thinking only how he could solve the mystery of the murder and loving more and more the little Emma as she grew into a beautiful girl He neglected The Warren so that the property looked quite desolate and ruined and at length superstitious people in the neighborhood came to mutter that it was haunted by the ghost of Rudge the steward whose body had been found in the pond The old bell ringer of the near by church even said he had seen this ghost once when he went late one night to wind the church clock But of course others who knew there were no such things as ghosts only smiled at these stories Sir John Chester who so hated Haredale was just as smooth and smiling and elegant as the other was rough Haredale had been Sir John s drudge and scapegoat at school and the latter had always despised him And as the years went by Sir John came to hate him His own son Edward had fallen in love with Emma Haredale s niece and she loved him in return Sir John had been all his life utterly selfish and without conscience He had little money and was much in debt and wanted his son to marry an heiress so that he himself could continue his life of pleasure Edward however gave his father to understand that he would never give up his love for Emma Sir John believed that if Haredale chose he could make his niece dislike Edward and because he did not Sir John hated Haredale the more bitterly Emma had a close friend named Dolly Varden the daughter of a locksmith Dolly was a pretty dimpled roguish little flirt as rosy and sparkling and fresh as an apple and she had a great many lovers One of these was her father s apprentice who lived in the same house His name was Simon Tappertit a conceited bragging empty headed young man with a great opinion of his own good looks When he looked at his thin legs which he admired exceedingly he could not see how it was that Dolly could help worshiping him Tappertit had ambitions of his own and thought himself a great man who was kept down by a tyrannical master though the good natured locksmith was the kindest man in London He had formed a society of apprentices whose toast was Death to all masters life to all apprentices and love to all fair damsels He was their leader He had made them all keys to fit their masters doors and at night when they were supposed to be asleep in bed they would steal out to meet in a dirty cellar owned by an old blind man where they kept a skull and cross bones and signed high sounding oaths with a pen dipped in blood and did other silly things The object of the society was to hurt annoy wrong and pick quarrels with such of their masters as happened not to please them With such cheap fooleries Tappertit had convinced himself that he was fit to be a great general But with all his smirking Dolly Varden only laughed at him To tell the truth she was very fond of young Joe Willet whose father kept the Maypole Inn very near The Warren where her friend Emma Haredale lived Joe was a good brave fellow and was head over ears in love with Dolly but Dolly was a coquette and never let him know how much she cared for him Joe was not contented at home for his father seemed to think him a child and did not treat him according to his years so that but for leaving Dolly Varden he would long ago have run away to seek his fortune Both Joe and Dolly knew how Edward Chester loved Emma Haredale and they used sometimes to carry notes from one to the other since the hatred of Sir John for Emma s uncle often prevented the lovers from meeting Sir John found this out and bribed a hostler at the Maypole Inn to spy for him and prevent if he could these letters passing The hostler was an uncouth drunken giant that people called Maypole Hugh as strong as an ox and cruel and cunning Hugh watched carefully and from time to time would go to Sir John s house in London and report what he had seen II THE MYSTERIOUS STRANGER AND WHO HE WAS About this time residents in the neighborhood of The Warren and the Maypole Inn began to tell tales of a mysterious man who roamed about the country side He was seen often and by many persons always at night skulking in the shadow or riding furiously on a horse He was fierce and haggard and discourteous to travelers wore a slouch hat which he never took off and generally kept the lower part of his face muffled in a handkerchief He always went alone Some said he slept in church yards others that he never slept at all and still others that he was a wicked man who had sold his soul to the Evil One One night he rested at the Maypole Inn and a little while after he had gone Varden the locksmith Dolly s father as he drove home found Edward Chester lying in the road having been wounded and robbed of his money Barnaby Rudge had seen the attack and was bending over him He had been too frightened to give aid but from his description Varden knew the robber was the stranger who had stopped at the inn The honest locksmith took Edward into his chaise drove him to Barnaby s house which was near by and left him in care of missus Rudge where a doctor soon dressed the wound which was not serious Next day mister Varden came to see how the wounded man was As he sat talking with missus Rudge a tapping came at the window She went to the door The locksmith heard her cry out and sprang forward to find standing there to his astonishment the robber of the night before He grasped at him but the woman threw herself before him clasped his arm and besought him for her life s sake not to pursue the man The locksmith had known Barnaby s mother all his life but so strange was her action now especially since she refused to answer any question begging him to ask her nothing that he almost wondered if she herself could be in league with a crime doer Her apparent agony touched him however and raising no alarm he went home in great puzzle of mind He would have been far more disturbed if he had known the whole truth For the mysterious stranger he had seen who by night had haunted the neighborhood was none other than missus Rudge s husband Barnaby s father the steward who everybody believed had been murdered with his master and whose body had been found in the pond Rudge himself had committed that wicked deed He had killed both master and gardener and to cover the crime had put his own clothes his watch and ring on the latter s body and sunk it in the pond When on the night of the murder he told his wife what he had done she had shrunk fearfully from him declaring that although being his wife she would not give him up to justice yet she would never own him or shelter him He had fled then with the money he had stolen and that night while she lay sick with horror Barnaby had been born with his poor crazed brain the look of terror in his baby face and the birth mark of blood on his wrist For many years the guilty wretch had wandered the earth but he could not escape the knowledge of his deed And at last his conscience had driven him back to the scene of his crime friendless penniless fearful of the sunlight slinking by night like a ghost about the house in which he had murdered his master and hounding his miserable wife for money with which to buy food and drink The poor woman had kept her terrible secret giving him every coin she could save striving so that Barnaby unhappily born as he was should never know the shame of having his father suffer death on the gallows When Rudge had come to her house that day he had thought her alone and she had saved him from capture only by begging the locksmith to stay his hand After his hairbreadth escape from Varden Rudge hid himself in a narrow street When the next dawn came as he searched for some dark den in which he might lie sheltered till another night he saw Simon Tappertit issuing with his noisy apprentice crew from the cellar in which they held their meetings He entered its door made friends with the villainous blind man who kept it and there established his headquarters Once more one night after the wounded Edward had been taken to his own home Rudge hunted out his trembling wife and demanded money threatening to bring harm to Barnaby if she refused him and she gave him all she had But this time dread of him made her desperate When morning came she went to Haredale and told him that she and her son could no longer live on his bounty The next day with Barnaby who carried on his back his beloved raven Grip she left the house afoot telling no one where they were going lest her husband find her out and pushed far into the country to find a home in some obscure village And though Rudge the murderer and the blind man who was much more crafty and cunning than many men with eyesight searched for them everywhere it was a long time before they found any trace Perhaps Joe and Dolly Varden missed poor cheery Barnaby more than did any one else But several events occurred soon after this that gave them other things to think of Maypole Hugh the savage hostler had continued his spying work for Edward s father and Sir John determined it was high time to break off his son s attachment for Emma Haredale One day Dolly was carrying a letter from Emma at The Warren to Edward and as she passed through the fields Hugh attacked her throwing his arms around her and pretending to make coarse love to her She was dreadfully frightened and screamed as loud as she could Joe as it happened was walking within sound of her voice and ran like the wind to her aid In another moment Hugh had leaped the hedge and disappeared and Dolly was sobbing in her rescuer s arms She was afraid to tell Joe who had frightened her for fear the hostler would take his revenge by harming him so she only said she had been attacked by a man whom she had never seen In her scare she had forgotten all about the letter she had carried and now she discovered it was gone It was nowhere to be found This of course was because Hugh had stolen it It was to get the letter that he had frightened her and he was soon on his way to carry it to Sir John Dolly did not guess this She wrote to Emma telling her of the mishap and this note Joe to whom she intrusted it knowing no reason to distrust the hostler gave to Hugh to deliver So Sir John got both missives in the end Emma Haredale not understanding why Edward returned no answer to her letter was hurt and thought him cold Sir John seizing his opportunity told her one day pretending sorrow while he did so that his son naturally fickle had fallen in love with some one else to whom he was soon to be married Emma not dreaming the father of the man she loved could be such a false liar believed him and when Edward wrote her speaking of his poverty and telling her he was going to leave England to try to better his prospects she thought his manly letter only an excuse to part from her Proud though heartbroken she did not answer it and so thanks to his father s selfish scheming Edward sailed away to the West Indies hopeless and despairing Another left England at the same time whose going meant far more to Dolly Varden This was Joe His father the innkeeper had been restraining him more and more until his treatment had become the jest of the country side and Joe had chafed to the point of rebellion at the gibes that continually met him One day at the jeer of an old enemy of his his wrath boiled over He sprang upon him and thrashed him soundly in the inn before the assembled guests Then knowing his father would never forgive him he went to his own room and barricaded the door That night Joe let himself down from his window and before daylight was in London He went first to the locksmith s house to tell Dolly he had run away and that he loved her but Dolly being a flirt only laughed To tell the truth she was so very fond of Joe that she didn t like to show him how sorry she was So the poor fellow went away thinking she cared very little though as soon as he was out of sight she nearly cried her eyes out and enlisted as a soldier That same night Joe started from London to fight in the war in America And it was a long time before either he or Edward Chester was heard of again III BARNABY GETS INTO TROUBLE Five years went by and Edward Chester remained in the West Indies and prospered For five years Joe Willet fought in the war in America And for five years Barnaby Rudge with his mother and Grip the raven lived unmolested in their little village and were happy At the end of the five years three things happened at about the same time Edward started back to England from the West Indies with a fair fortune in his pocket Joe was sent back from America with one arm gone and Barnaby and his mother left their village home again secretly and set out for London hoping to lose themselves in its hugeness The wily blind man the companion now of Rudge the murderer had found them out He came one day and made missus Rudge give him all the money she had been able to lay by in these five years except a single gold piece He told her he would return in a week for more and that if she had not got it then he would entice Barnaby away to join in the evil life of his father So she left the village the very next morning and she and Barnaby trudged afoot all the weary way to the great city Though they knew nothing of it there was great excitement in London Lord George Gordon a well meaning but crack brained nobleman led astray by flatterers till he believed he had a God given mission to drive all Catholics out of England had sometime before this begun to hold meetings and to stir up the people with the cry of No Popery He declared that the religion of the country was in danger of being overthrown and that the Pope of Rome was plotting to make his religion supreme And this idea he talked wherever he went He was a slender sallow man who dressed in severe black and wore his hair smoothly combed and his bright restless eyes and his look of uncertainty made it clear that he was no man to lead but was rather himself the misled dupe of others One of these schemers who ruled him was his secretary Gashford a man of ugly face with beetling brows and great flapped ears He had been a thief and a scoundrel all his life and had wormed himself into Lord George s confidence by flattery He easily fooled his master into believing that the rabble who flocked to hear him and the idle loungers who yelled themselves hoarse at what he said were crowds of honest citizens who believed as he did and were ready to follow his leadership Gashford had added to his followers even Dennis the hangman of London and the foolish nobleman not knowing the ruffian s true calling thought him a man to trust For many weeks this banding together of all the lawless ragamuffins of London had gone on till one had only to shout No Popery on any street corner to draw together a crowd bent on mischief Respectable people grew afraid and kept to their houses and criminals and street vagabonds grew bolder and bolder As may be guessed Simon Tappertit the one time apprentice of Varden the locksmith rejoiced at this excitement as at a chance to show his talent for leadership His apprentice society had now become the United Bulldogs and he himself helping the schemes of Gashford strutted about among the crowds with an air of vast importance Sir John Chester watched the trouble gathering with glee His old enemy Haredale he knew was a Catholic and as this movement if it grew bold enough meant harm to all of that religion he hoped for its success He was too cunning to aid it publicly but he sent Maypole Hugh who was still his spy to Gashford and the brawny hostler who savagely longed for fighting and plunder joined with the secretary and with Dennis the hangman to help increase the tumult A day had been set on which Lord George Gordon had vowed he would march to Parliament at the head of forty thousand men to demand the passing of a law to forbid all Catholics to enter the country This vast rabble army gathered in a great field under the command of these sorry leaders the misguided lord Dennis the hangman Tappertit Hugh the hostler Gashford the secretary and other rowdies picked for their boldness and daring The mob thus formed covered an immense space All wore blue cockades in their hats or carried blue flags and from them went up a hoarse roar of oaths shouts and ribald songs Such was the scene on which Barnaby and his mother came as they walked into London They knew nothing of its cause or its meaning missus Rudge saw its rough disorder with terror but the confusion the waving flags and the shouts had got into Barnaby s brain To him this seemed a splendid host marching to some noble cause He watched with sparkling eyes longing to join it Suddenly Maypole Hugh rushed from the crowd with a shout of recognition and thrusting a flagstaff into Barnaby s hands drew him into the ranks His mother shrieked and ran forward but she was thrown to the ground Barnaby was whirled away into the moving mass and she saw him no more Barnaby enjoyed that hour of march with all his soul and the louder the howling the more he was thrilled The crowd surrounded the houses of Parliament and fought the police At length a regiment of mounted soldiers charged them Barnaby thought this brave work and held his ground valiantly even knocking one soldier off his horse with the flagstaff until others dragged him to a place of safety That night the drunken mob grown bolder tore down pillaged and burned all the Catholic chapels within their reach and with Hugh and Dennis the hangman poor crazed Barnaby ran at its head covered with dirt his garments torn to rags singing and leaping with delight He thought he was the most courageous of all that he was helping to destroy the country s enemies and that when the fighting was over he and his mother would be rich and she would always be proud that he was so noble and so brave The golden cups the candlesticks and the money they stole from the burned chapels Hugh and the hangman buried under a heap of straw in the tavern which they had made their headquarters and left Barnaby to guard the place He counted this a sacred trust and when soldiers came to arrest all in the building he refused to fly in time He even fought them single handed and felled two before he was knocked down with the butt of a musket and handcuffed While he had been resisting Grip had been busily plucking away the straw from the hidden plunder now his hoarse croak showed them the hoard and they unearthed it all At length closing ranks around Barnaby they marched him off to a barracks from which he was taken to Newgate Prison where a blacksmith put irons on his arms and legs and he and the raven were locked in a cell While Barnaby was guarding the tavern room Hugh egged on by his master Sir John Chester had proposed the burning of The Warren where Haredale still lived with Emma his niece and Dolly Varden now her companion The crowd agreed gladly since Haredale was a Catholic and that same day in London had given evidence to the police against the rioters who had burned the chapels They rushed away marched hastily across the fields tied the old host of the Maypole Inn to his chair drank all the liquor they could find and then rushed to The Warren There they put the servants to flight burst in the doors staved the wine casks in the cellar split up the costly furniture with hammers and axes and set fire to the building so that it soon burned to the ground Haredale in London saw the red glare in the sky and rode post haste to the place but found on his arrival only ruins and ashes He believed that Emma and Dolly had had time to escape to safety but while he was searching the grounds for some sign of them he saw in the starlight a man hiding in a broken turret He drew his sword and advanced As the figure moved into the light he rushed forward flung himself upon him and clutched his throat Villain he cried in a terrible voice dead and buried as all men supposed at last at last I have you You Rudge slayer of my brother and of his faithful servant Double murderer and monster I arrest you in the name of God Bound and fettered in his carriage Haredale took Rudge back to London and had him locked in Newgate Prison IV BARNABY PROSPERS AT LAST Haredale searched vainly next day for Emma and Dolly Varden He could not believe they had lost their lives in the burning building yet he was filled with anxiety because of their disappearance Could he have known what had happened he would have been even more fearful Simon Tappertit had seen his chance at last to win for himself the lovely Dolly who had scorned him when he was an apprentice of the locksmith He had bribed Hugh and the hangman to aid him While the mob was occupied at the front of the house this precious pair had entered from the back seized the two girls and put them into a coach This they guarded at a distance till the burning was done then with Tappertit on the box and surrounded by his ruffians the coach was driven into the city Emma had spent the day in the fear that her uncle had been killed with other Catholics in London and at this new and surpassing fright she had fainted Dolly though no less concerned had fought her captors bravely though vainly Often in that long ride she wished that Joe her vanished lover were there to rescue her as he had rescued her once from Maypole Hugh She had determined when she reached the London streets to scream as loudly as she could for help but before they came to the city Hugh climbed into the carriage and sat between them threatening to choke either if she made a noise In this wise they were driven to a miserable cottage and in the dirty apartment to which they were taken Dolly threw herself upon the unconscious Emma and wept pitifully unmindful of the jeers of Hugh and of the hangman When Tappertit entered the room suddenly Dolly not knowing his part in the plot screamed with joy and threw herself into his arms crying I knew it My dear father s at the door Heaven bless you for rescuing us But she saw in an instant her mistake when the ridiculous braggart laid his hand on his breast and told her now that he no longer was an apprentice but a famous leader of the people he had chosen to be her husband With this announcement he left them Meanwhile missus Rudge day and night had searched everywhere for Barnaby In one of the riots she was injured and was taken to a hospital and while she lay there she heard with agony that her son had been so active in the disturbances that a price had been put by the Government on his head But in his present trouble Barnaby had unexpectedly found an old friend Joe Willet just returned with one empty sleeve from his five years of soldiering in America had been with the soldiers in the barracks when Barnaby had been brought there on his way to prison He soon discovered who the boy s rioting companions had been and took them word of his plight for he knew it meant death to Barnaby unless he escaped Maypole Hugh Tappertit and the hangman were all itching for more disorder and this news gave them an excuse They went out at once and gathered the mob together to attack Newgate Prison and to release all the prisoners They themselves led the procession The house of Varden Dolly s father was on their way they stopped there and in spite of the lusty fight he made carried the locksmith with them to compel him to open the prison gates with his tools This he refused to do and they would doubtless have killed him but for two men who dragged him from their clutches in the nick of time These two men were the one armed Joe and Edward Chester just returned from the West Indies whom the former had met by accident that day They took the locksmith to his home while the raging crowd brought furniture from neighboring houses and built a bonfire of it to burn down the great prison gate From this same mob Haredale himself had a narrow escape He was staying at a house near by which belonging to a Catholic was attacked He tried to escape across the roof but was recognized from the street by the giant Hugh The cellar luckily had a back door opening into a lane and with the assistance of Joe and Edward who had hastened to the rear to aid him he escaped that way Maypole Hugh during this terrible time while the mob was burning houses everywhere and the soldiers firing on the rioters in every quarter of London seemed to bear a charmed life He rode a great brewer s horse and carried an ax and wherever the fight was thickest there he was to be found Never had such a sight been seen in London as when the prison gate fell and the crowd rushed from cell to cell smashing the iron doors to release the prisoners some of whom being under sentence of death had never expected to be free again Rudge the murderer knowing nothing of what the uproar meant suffered tortures thinking in his guilty fear that the hordes were howling for his life When he was finally released and in the open street he found Barnaby beside him They broke off their fetters and that night took refuge in a shed in a field Next day Rudge sent Barnaby to try to find the blind man his cunning partner in whose wits he trusted to help them get away Barnaby brought the blind man and brought also Hugh whom he found wounded in the street but in so doing he was seen by Dennis the hangman This villainous sneak knowing that the daring of the rioters had reached its limit and that they must soon be scattered and captured and thinking to buy pardon for himself by a piece of treachery without delay brought soldiers who surrounded the shed The blind man attempting to run away was shot dead and the others Rudge Hugh and poor innocent Barnaby were captured Then well satisfied with his work Dennis set out for the house where Simon Tappertit had confined Emma Haredale and Dolly Varden The hangman wanted them well out of the way so they could not testify that he had helped to burn The Warren and to kidnap them He had thought of a plan to have them taken to a boat in the river and conveyed where their friends would never find them and to carry them off he chose Gashford Lord George Gordon s secretary who was the more willing as he had fallen in love with Emma s beauty But this wicked plan was never to be carried out The very hour that Gashford came on this pitiless errand while he roughly bade Emma prepare to depart the doors flew open Men poured in led by Edward Chester who knocked Gashford down and in another moment Emma was clasped in her uncle s embrace and Dolly laughing and crying at the same time fell into the arms of her father Their place of concealment had been discovered a few hours before and the three men had lost no time in planning their capture Dennis the hangman in spite of his previous treachery caught in the trap was taken straight way to jail and Simon Tappertit wounded and raging watched Dolly s departure from the floor where he lay with his wonderful legs the pride and glory of his life broken and crushed into shapeless ugliness The famous riots were over Lord George Gordon was a prisoner hundreds were being arrested and London was again growing quiet missus Rudge poor mother at last found Barnaby where he lay chained in his cell and condemned to death Day after day she never left him while Varden the locksmith and Haredale worked hard for his release They carried his case even to the King and at the last moment while he rode on his way to execution his pardon was granted Of the rest who died on the scaffold Rudge the murderer was hanged cursing all men to the last Maypole Hugh died glorying in his evil life and with a jest on his lips and Dennis the hangman was dragged to the gallows cringing and shrieking for mercy A few weeks later Emma Haredale was married to Edward Chester and sailed with him back to the West Indies where he had established a flourishing business Before this however his father Sir John Chester was well punished for his hard heart and bad deeds by the discovery that Maypole Hugh the hostler was really his own unacknowledged son whose mother he had deserted many years before But even this blow and the marriage of his son Edward to the niece of his lifelong enemy did not soften him He still hated Haredale with his old venom and loved to go to the ruins of The Warren and gloat over its destruction On one of these visits he met and taunted Haredale beyond all endurance The two men drew their swords and fought a duel which ended by Haredale s running Sir John through the heart Haredale left England at once entered a convent in a foreign country and spent his few remaining years in penance and remorse Lord George Gordon the poor deluded noble who had been the cause of all this disorder finally died harmless and quite crazy in Newgate Prison Simon Tappertit in spite of his active part in the riots was luckier for he got off with two wooden legs and lived for many years a corner boot black Joe of course married Dolly Varden and the locksmith gave her such a generous marriage portion that he was able to set up in business succeeding his father as landlord of the old Maypole Inn and there they lived long and happily Barnaby Rudge after the death of his father gradually became more rational and was everywhere a great favorite with old and young He and his mother lived always on the Maypole farm and there were never two more contented souls than they As for Grip the raven he soon forgot his jail experience and grew sleek and glossy again For a whole year he never uttered a word till one sunny morning he suddenly broke out with I m a devil I m a devil I m a devil in extraordinary rapture From that time on he talked more and more and as he was only one hundred and fifty years old when Barnaby was gray headed a mere infant for a raven he is very probably talking yet THE PERSONAL HISTORY

Miss Betsy s lawyer Agnes His daughter Uriah Heep His clerk Later his partner Doctor Strong David s schoolmaster in Dover Dora Spenlow The daughter of David s employer and his child wife DAVID COPPERFIELD I DAVID S EARLY UPS AND DOWNS There was once a little boy by the name of David Copperfield whose father had died before he was born The night he was born his great aunt Miss Betsy Trotwood a grim lady with a black cap tied under her chin and a great gold watch chain came to the house to ask his mother to name the baby which she took for granted was a girl after her but as soon as she found it was a boy she flounced out in anger and never came back again The first thing David remembered was living in a big country house in England with his pretty golden haired mother and with Peggotty his nurse a red faced kindly woman with a habit of wearing her dresses so tight that whenever she hugged him some buttons would fly off the back He loved his mother dearly so dearly that when a tall handsome man named Murdstone began to come to see her in the evenings David was jealous and sad mister Murdstone acted as if he liked him and even took him riding on his horse but there was something in his face that David could not like One summer day David was sent off with Peggotty for a two weeks visit to her brother s house in Yarmouth Yarmouth was a queer fishing town on the sea coast and the house they went to was the queerest thing in it It was made of an old barge drawn up high and dry on the beach It had a chimney on one side and little windows and there were sea shells around the door David s room was in the stern and the window was the hole which the rudder had once passed through Everything smelled of salt water and lobsters and David thought it was the most wonderful house in the world He soon made friends with the family mister Peggotty a big fisherman with a laugh like a gale of wind Ham his nephew a big overgrown boy who carried David from the coach on his back and missus Gummidge who was the widow of mister Peggotty s drowned partner And last of all there was a beautiful little girl with curly hair and a string of blue beads around her neck whom they called Little Em ly She was an orphan niece of Peggotty s None of these people belonged to mister Peggotty but though he was only a poor fisherman himself he was so kind that he gave them all a home David played with little Em ly and went out in the boat with mister Peggotty and enjoyed his visit greatly though he grew anxious to see his mother again He had no idea what had happened to her till he got back home with Peggotty Then he found why he had been sent off on his visit While he was away his mother had married mister Murdstone David found things sadly altered after this mister Murdstone was a hard cruel master He cared nothing for the little boy and was harsh to him in everything He even took away David s own cozy bedroom and made him sleep in a gloomy chamber When he was sad mister Murdstone called him obstinate and locked him up and forbade his mother to pet or comfort him David s mother loved him but she loved her new husband too and it was a most unhappy state of things To make it worse mister Murdstone s sister came to live with them She was an unlovely old maid with big black eyebrows and liked David no better than her brother did After this there were no more pleasant hours of sitting with his mother or walking with her to church for mister Murdstone and his sister kept them apart The only happy moments David spent were in a little upper room where there was a collection of books left by his dead father He got some comfort from reading these mister Murdstone made David s mother give him hard tasks and lessons to do and when David recited them he and his sister both sat and listened To feel their presence and disapproval confused the little fellow so much that even when he knew his lesson he failed One day when he came to recite he saw mister Murdstone finishing the handle of a whip he had been making This frightened him so that he could scarcely remember a word mister Murdstone grasped him then and led him to his room to whip him Poor little David was so terrified that he hardly knew what he was doing and in his agony and terror while the merciless blows were falling he seized the hand that held him and bit it as hard as he could mister Murdstone then beat him almost to death and locked him in the room He was kept there for five days with only bread and milk to eat Every day he was taken down for family prayers and then taken back again and during prayers he was made to sit in a corner where he could not even see his mother s face He had to sit all day long with nothing to do but think of mister Peggotty s house boat and of little Em ly and wish he was there The last night Peggotty his nurse crept up and whispered through the keyhole that mister Murdstone was going to send him away the next day to a school near London The next morning he started in a carrier s cart His mother was so much in awe of mister Murdstone that she hardly dared kiss David good by and he saw nothing of Peggotty But as he was crying Peggotty came running from behind a hedge and jumped into the cart and hugged him so hard that all the buttons flew off the back of her dress The man who drove the cart was named Barkis He seemed to be very much taken with Peggotty and after she had gone back David told him all about her Before they parted he made David promise to write her a message for him It was a very short message Barkis is willin David didn t know in the least what the driver meant but he promised and he sent the message in his very first letter Probably Peggotty knew what he meant though for before David came back again mister Barkis and she were courting However that has not much to do with this part of the story The school to which mister Murdstone had sent him was a bare building with gratings on all the windows like a prison and a high brick wall around it It was owned by a man named Creakle who had begun by raising hops and had gone into the school business because he had lost all of his own and his wife s money and had no other way to live He was fat and spoke always in a whisper and he was so cruel and bad tempered that not only the boys but his wife too was terribly afraid of him He nearly twisted David s ear off the first day and he made one of the teachers tie a placard to David s back this he said was by mister Murdstone s order which read TAKE CARE OF HIM HE BITES To have to wear this before everybody made David sorrowful and ashamed but luckily a good natured boy named Tommy Traddles who liked David s looks said it was a shame to make him wear it and as Tommy Traddles was very popular all the other boys said it was a shame too So beyond calling him Towser for a few days and saying Lie down sir as if he were a dog they did not make much fun of him while he wore it Besides Tommy Traddles David liked best the head boy James Steerforth the oldest boy in the school and the only one Creakle did not dare beat or mistreat Steerforth took David under his wing and helped him with his lessons while in return David used to tell him stories from the books he had read What with the beatings and tasks David was glad enough when vacation time came But his home coming was anything but pleasant He found his mother with a little baby and she looked careworn and ill mister Murdstone he saw at once hated him as much as ever and Miss Murdstone would not let him even so much as touch his baby brother He was forbidden to sit in the kitchen with Peggotty and when he crept away to the upper room with the books mister Murdstone called him sullen and obstinate David was so miserable every day that he was almost glad to bid his mother good by and as he rode away to look back at her as she stood there at the gate holding up her baby for David to see That was the last picture David carried in his heart of his pretty mother One day not long after he was called from the school room to the parlor and there mister Creakle told him that his mother was dead and that the baby had died too David reached home the next day Peggotty took him into her arms at the door and called his mother her dear poor pretty and comforted him but he was very sad It seemed to him that life could never be bright again After the funeral Miss Murdstone discharged Peggotty and probably not knowing what else to do with him let David go with the faithful old servant down to the old house boat at Yarmouth where he had been visiting when his mother was married to mister Murdstone The wonderful house on the beach was just the same mister Peggotty and Ham and missus Gummidge were still there with everything smelling just as usual of salt water and lobsters and little Em ly was there too grown to be quite a big girl It seemed somehow like coming back to a dear old quiet home where nothing changed and where all was restful and good But this happiness was not to last David had to go home again and there it was worse than ever He was utterly neglected He was sent to no school taught nothing allowed to make no friends And at last mister Murdstone as if he could think of nothing worse apprenticed him as a chore boy in a warehouse in London The building where David now was compelled to work was on a wharf on the river bank and was dirty and dark and overrun with rats Here he had to labor hard for bare living wages among rough boys and rougher men with no counselor hearing their coarse oaths about him and fearing that one day he would grow up to be no better than they He was given a bedroom in the house of a mister Micawber and this man was in his way a friend There was never a better hearted man than mister Micawber but he seemed to be always unlucky He had a head as bald as an egg wore a tall pointed collar and carried for ornament an eye glass which he never used He never had any money was owing everybody who would lend him any and was always as he said waiting for something to turn up With this exception David had not a friend in London and finally mister Micawber himself was put in prison for debt and his relatives who paid his debts to release him did so on condition that he leave London So at length David had not even this one friend David bore this friendless and wretched life as long as he could but at length he felt that he could stay at the warehouse no longer and made up his mind to run away The only one in the world he could think of who might help him was whom do you think His great aunt Miss Betsy Trotwood who had left his mother s house the night he was born because he did not happen to be a girl She was the only real relative he had in the world She lived Peggotty had told him in Dover and that was seventy miles away but the distance did not daunt him So one day he put all his things into a box and hired a boy with a cart to take it to the coach office But the boy robbed him of all the money he had a gold piece Peggotty had sent him and drove off with his box besides and poor David crying set out afoot without a penny in the direction he thought Dover lay That evening he sold his waistcoat to a clothes dealer for a few pennies and when night came he slept on the ground under the walls of mister Creakle s old school where he had known Steerforth and Tommy Traddles The next day he offered his jacket for sale to a half crazy old store keeper who took the coat but would not pay him at first and David had to sit all day on the door step before the other would give him the money The next four nights he slept under haystacks greatly in fear of tramps and at length on the sixth day ragged sunburned dusty and almost dead from weariness he got to Dover He had to ask many people before he could find out where Miss Betsy Trotwood lived It was outside the town in a cottage with a little garden Here she lived all alone except for a simple minded old man whom she called mister Dick who was a relative of hers and who did nothing all day but fly big kites and write petitions to the king which he began every morning and never finished All the neighbors thought Miss Betsy Trotwood a most queer old woman but those who knew her best knew that she had a very kind heart under her grim appearance When David reached the house Miss Betsy was digging at some flowers in the garden All she saw was a ragged dirty little boy and she called out without even turning her head Go away no boys here But David was so wretched that he went right in at the gate and went up behind her and said If you please aunt I m your nephew His aunt was so startled at his looks and at what he said that she sat down plump on the ground and David his misery getting all at once the better of him sobbed out all the pitiful tale of his wrongs and sorrows since his mother had died Miss Betsy Trotwood s heart was touched She seized David by the collar led him into the house made him drink something and then made him lie down on the sofa while she fed him hot broth Then she had a warm bath prepared and at last very tired and comfortable and wrapped up in a big shawl David fell asleep on the sofa That night he was put to bed in a clean room and before he slept he prayed that he might never be homeless and friendless again II LITTLE EM LY Good fortune was with David now His aunt wrote to mister Murdstone and he and his sister came fully expecting to take the boy back with them but instead Miss Betsy told mister Murdstone plainly that he was a stony hearted hypocrite who had broken his wife s heart and tortured her son and she ordered him and his sister from the house David was so delighted at this that he threw his arms around her neck and kissed her and from that moment Miss Betsy Trotwood began to love him as if he had been her own son David loved her in return He drove out with her and helped mister Dick fly his kites and was very grateful And at length his aunt placed him in a school in Dover and found him pleasant lodgings there in the house of her lawyer mister Wickfield It was a different sort of school from what his first had been His teacher was a Doctor Strong and the school boys were not the frightened ill treated lot he had known at mister Creakle s house He was happy there but his happiest hours of all were those spent after school was out at mister Wickfield s The lawyer had an only daughter Agnes just David s age a sweet gentle girl who seemed to live for her father and whom David came to consider before long almost as a sister One person connected with the lawyer s household whom he did not like so well was Uriah Heep Heep was a high shouldered red headed bony young man with no eyebrows or eyelashes and with long skeleton fingers He dressed all in black and his hands were clammy and cold like a fish so that it chilled one to touch them He never smiled the nearest he could come to it was to make two creases down his cheeks He was always cringing and pretending to be humble but really he was a sneak and a scoundrel at heart David detested him without knowing why the more so when he came to see that Heep was gaining an influence over Agnes s father All the while too Heep pretended to like David though David knew very well he did not So time went on David studied hard and was a favorite with both pupils and teachers At length he was head boy himself and at seventeen his school life was finished He parted regretfully from Doctor Strong and from Agnes and after paying his aunt Miss Betsy Trotwood a visit he started off to Yarmouth to see his old nurse now the wife of Barkis the driver and just as fond of David as ever On his way through London as it happened David met the old school fellow whom he had so liked James Steerforth and loath to part with him so quickly he proposed that the latter accompany him to Yarmouth Steerforth agreed and they went together They took dinner at Peggotty s and spent the first evening in the old house boat where mister Peggotty still lived with Ham and missus Gummidge and little Em ly the latter now grown to be a lovely girl and engaged to marry Ham They spent some weeks there each amusing himself in his own way and soon Steerforth was as popular as David had always been for he sang beautifully and talked entertainingly and all from mister Peggotty to little Em ly thought they had never seen so brilliant and handsome a lad If David could have read the thoughts that were in Steerforth s mind he would have grieved that he had ever brought him to that peaceful innocent spot For Steerforth had changed since the old school days when David had been so fond of him He had learned wickedness and now while he was exerting himself in every way to make the Peggottys like and admire him in his heart he was trying to fascinate little Em ly and to steal her love that she had given to Ham till she would leave her home and run away with him to a foreign country This however David could not guess nor could any of the others who regretted when the two friends visit was over Now that his school days were finished David s aunt had planned for him to study law in an office in London and accordingly David began his new life there very near the street where he had once toiled a wretched friendless helper in the dirty warehouse on the dock He found Tommy Traddles who had stood his friend at mister Creakle s school studying now to be a lawyer also and boarding curiously enough at the house of mister Micawber who had drifted back to London still as poor and as hopeful as ever and still waiting for something to turn up In spite of these and all his new acquaintances David was very lonely at first and missed Agnes who all through his life at Doctor Strong s school had been his friend and adviser He saw her once when she was visiting in London and then she had bad news to tell him her father had been steadily failing in health and business and little by little Uriah Heep his red headed clerk with the clammy hands had got him and his affairs into his power and made himself a partner in the firm David guessed that Heep had planned to entrap her father so as to compel Agnes herself to marry him and this suspicion made David despise the clerk more and more But he knew of no way to help All this time he often saw Steerforth but never guessed how often the latter had been secretly to see little Em ly or of the wicked part he was playing But one day David heard that Barkis Peggotty s husband whose early courtship he himself had aided when he took her the message Barkis is willin had died and David went at once to Yarmouth to try to comfort his old nurse in her loss While he was there the blow came which caused such sorrow to all who lived in the old house boat Little Em ly the pride and joy of mister Peggotty s tender heart ran away with Steerforth She left a letter begging them to forgive her especially her uncle mister Peggotty and bidding them all good by It broke mister Peggotty s heart and Ham s too And David was scarcely less sorrowful Because for what he had done Steerforth whose friendship had been so much to him could never be his friend again But nothing could change mister Peggotty s love for little Em ly He determined to start out and search throughout the world for her and meantime Ham and missus Gummidge were to stay there in the old home to keep it looking just the same with a lighted candle in the window every night so that if little Em ly by any chance came back it would be bright and warm to welcome her mister Peggotty s parting words to David were I m a going to seek her far and wide If any hurt should come to me remember that the last word I left for her was My unchanged love is with my darling child and I forgive her III DAVID AND HIS CHILD WIFE Though Agnes always held a large place in his heart David was very impressionable In the next few years he thought himself in love a good many times but when finally he met Dora Spenlow the daughter of one of the members of the law firm with which he was studying he knew that all his other love affairs had been only fancies Dora was blue eyed with cheeks like a pink sea shell and looked like a fairy David fell head over ears in love with her the first time he ever saw her He lost his appetite and took to wearing tight gloves and shoes too small for him and he used to put on his best clothes and walk around her house in the moonlight and do other extravagant things They found a good deal of trouble in their love making for Dora was under the care of none other than the terrible sister of mister Murdstone who had made David so miserable in his childhood but he and Dora used to meet sometimes and they sent each other letters through one of Dora s girl friends David perhaps would not have done this if he had thought he would have a fair chance to win Dora but with his old enemy Miss Murdstone against him he was afraid to tell her father of his love But one day he told it to Dora and she promised to marry him Good luck however never comes without a bit of bad luck Soon after this David came home to his rooms one night to find his aunt Miss Betsy Trotwood there with her trunk and mister Dick kites and all She told David she had no other place to go that she had lost all of her money and was quite ruined This was misfortune indeed for it seemed to put his hope of marrying Dora a great deal further away but David faced the situation bravely and began at once to look for something to do outside of the law office to earn money enough to support them all In this trouble Agnes was his true friend He had written her already of his love for Dora and she had advised him Through her now he found employment as secretary to his old schoolmaster Doctor Strong who had given up the school at Dover and had moved to London He told Dora of course all about his changed prospects but Dora was like a little butterfly who knew only how to fly about among flowers she hardly knew what poverty meant and thought he was scolding when he told her David worked hard in the morning at Doctor Strong s in the afternoons at the law office and in the evenings he studied shorthand so he might come to be a newspaper reporter And all this while he wrote to Dora every day It was one of these letters that at last betrayed their secret Dora dropped it from her pocket and Miss Murdstone picked it up She showed it to Dora s father and he sent at once for David and told him angrily that he could never marry his child and that he must not see Dora any more And David went home disconsolate This might have ended their engagement for ever but that same day Dora s father dropped dead of heart disease Instead of being rich he was found to have left no money at all and Dora was taken to live with two aunts on the outskirts of London David did not know what was best to do now so he went to Dover to ask Agnes s advice He was shocked at the changes he found there Her father looked ill and scarcely seemed himself Uriah Heep his new partner with his ugly fawning way and clammy hands was living in their house and eating with them at their table He had obtained more and more power over mister Wickfield and gloried in it And the other seemed no longer to dare to oppose Uriah in anything But in spite of all this Agnes talked bravely and cheerfully with David Under her direction he wrote a letter to Dora s aunts declaring his love and asking permission to call and they pleased with his frankness gave their permission Before the year was out David began to earn money with his shorthand reporting speeches in Parliament for a newspaper He had discovered besides that he could write stories that the magazines were glad to buy So one day David married Dora and they went to housekeeping in a tiny house of their own Life seemed very sweet to them both though Dora while she was the most loving little wife in the world knew no more about housekeeping than a bird The servants stole the silver spoons and the storekeepers overcharged them and the house was never tidy or comfortable For a while David tried to make Dora learn these things but when he chid her the tears would come and she would throw her arms around his neck and sob that she was only his child wife after all and he would end by kissing her and telling her not to mind She was most like a beautiful toy and like a toy she seemed made only to play with just as she played with her dog Jip instead of helping and encouraging David in his work But at length Dora fell ill so ill that they knew she was too frail and weak to get well and strong again David carried her down stairs every day and every day the burden grew lighter She never complained but called him her poor dear boy and one day she whispered that she was only his child wife and could never have been more so that it was better as it was Agnes came and was there when Dora died But for her comfort all the world would have been blank for poor David as he sat alone longing for the child wife who could never be his again IV DAVID FINDS ALL WELL AT LAST More than once during this life of David s with his child wife he had seen mister Peggotty The brave old man had searched Europe for little Em ly in vain then he had come back to London feeling somehow that some day she would stray there He used to walk the streets by night looking at every face he passed In the room where he lived he kept a candle always lighted and one of her dresses hanging on a chair for her After Dora s death David joined in the search and at length they did find poor little Em ly Steerforth had treated her cruelly and finally deserted her and she had crept back to London heartbroken and repentant hoping for nothing but to die within sight of those who had loved her so But nothing had dimmed mister Peggotty s love Wretched as she was he caught her in his arms held her to his breast as he had done so often when she was a child and told her she was still his own little Em ly just as she had always been She was ill but he nursed her back to health Then he went to Yarmouth to fetch missus Gummidge and they and the little Em ly that had been found took passage for Australia where they might forget the dark past and find happiness in a new life But before they sailed fate had brought to naught the villainous plot that had been woven by Uriah Heep about Agnes and her father And the one whom they had most to thank for this was mister Micawber Heep had met mister Micawber once when the latter as usual was in money difficulties and thinking to make a tool of him had hired him for his clerk Little by little Heep had then got the other into his debt till mister Micawber saw no prospect before him but the debtors prison Threatening him with this Heep tried to compel him to do various bits of dirty and dishonest work at which the other s soul revolted until at length he made up his mind to expose his employer So pretending obedience mister Micawber wormed himself into all of the sneaking Heep s affairs found out the evidence of his guilt and finally taking all the books and papers from the office safe sent for David and his friend Tommy Traddles and told them all he had discovered They found it was by forgery that Heep had got Agnes s father into his power in the first place and that among others whom he had robbed was David s aunt Miss Betsy Trotwood whose fortune he had stolen David and Tommy Traddles sent for Miss Betsy and for Agnes and her father and they faced Uriah all together He tried to brazen it out but when he saw the empty safe he knew that all was known They told him the only way he could save himself from prison was by giving back the business to Agnes s father just as it had been years before when David had lived there and by restoring to Miss Betsy Trotwood every cent he had robbed her of This he did with no very good grace and with an especial curse for David whom he seemed to blame for it all In reward for mister Micawber s good services Miss Betsy and Agnes s father paid off all his debts and gave him money enough to take him and his family to Australia They sailed in the same vessel that carried mister Peggotty and little Em ly Before it sailed little Em ly had written a letter to Ham whose promised wife she had been before she ran away with Steerforth begging his forgiveness and this letter she had asked David to give him after they had gone Accordingly one day he went to Yarmouth to do this That night a terrible storm arose The wind was so strong that it uprooted trees and threw down chimneys and rolled waves mountain high on the sand where stood the old deserted house boat of the Peggottys Next morning David was awakened with the news that a Spanish ship had gone ashore and was fast going to pieces and he ran to the beach where all the town was gathered He could see the doomed vessel plainly where the surf broke over her Her masts had snapped short off and at every wave she rolled and beat the sand as if she would pound herself to fragments Several figures were clinging to the broken masts and one by one the waves beat them off and they went down for ever At length but one was left and he held on so long that a shout of encouragement went up from the throng At this Ham the bravest and strongest of all the hardy boatmen there tied a rope about his waist and plunged into the sea to try to save him But it was not to be The same huge wave that dashed the vessel to pieces threw the rescuer back on the sand dead The body of the man he had tried to save was washed ashore too and it was that of James Steerforth who had so wronged little Em ly So poor great souled Ham died honest and faithful to the last giving his life for the man who had injured him And so too James Steerforth met his fate on the very spot where he had done such evil for his corpse was found among the fragments of the old Peggotty house boat which the tempest tore down that night After this David went abroad and stayed three years He lived in Switzerland and wrote novels that were printed in London and made him famous there And now alone he had time to think of all that made up his past He thought of Dora his child wife and sorrowed for her and of the Peggottys and little Em ly but most of all he found himself thinking of Agnes who throughout his youth had seemed like his guiding star So one day he went back to England and told her and asked her if she would marry him And with her sweet face on his breast she whispered that she had loved him all her life David and Agnes lived long and happily and their children had three guardians who loved them all Miss Betsy Trotwood David s old nurse Peggotty and white haired mister Dick who taught them to fly kites and thought them the greatest children in the world Tommy Traddles when he had become a famous lawyer often visited them and once too mister Peggotty older but still hale and strong came back from Australia to tell them how he had prospered and grown rich and had always his little Em ly beside him and how mister Micawber had ceased to owe everybody money and had become a magistrate and many other things David had one thing however to tell mister Peggotty and that was of a certain prisoner he had seen in one of the country s greatest prisons sentenced for life for an attempt to rob the Bank of England and whose name was Uriah Heep GREAT EXPECTATIONS Published eighteen sixty eighteen sixty one Scene London Neighboring Towns and the Country Time eighteen thirty to eighteen sixty CHARACTERS Philip Pirrip An

Pocket His son Pip s comrade in London GREAT EXPECTATIONS I PIP AND THE CONVICT In England in a lonely village not far from London there once lived a little orphan boy named Philip Pirrip whom everybody called for short Pip His parents had died when he was a baby and he had been brought up by his older sister the wife of Joe Gargery a blacksmith whose forge looked out across wide marshes and a river that flowed through them Joe the blacksmith was a fair faced man with flaxen whiskers and very bright blue eyes He was a mild honest good natured sweet tempered easy going foolish dear fellow tender hearted and kind to little Pip and yet a Hercules for strength Very different indeed was missus Joe as everybody spoke of her She was tall and bony and had black hair a red skin and a continual habit of scolding She may have loved Pip in her way but that way was a very cross grained one She treated Joe the big blacksmith and Pip the little boy just alike and they were both equally in dread of her This made them quite like partners Whenever Pip came into the house he used to look at Joe s fingers if Joe crossed them that was a sign missus Joe was cross and that Pip was to look out for himself Joe had an uncle named Pumblechook who was a corn seller in the next town and a pompous old hypocrite He had a way of standing Pip before him rumpling up his hair and asking him hard questions out of the multiplication table And whenever he told a story of any one who was ungrateful or wicked he would glower at Pip in a way that made him feel very uncomfortable Another who came as often and was almost as dismal to see was Wopsle the clerk who read the lesson in church every Sunday He had an idea he would make a great actor and used to recite whole pages from Shakespeare when he could find any one to listen to him Worst of all was a workman of Joe s named Orlick He was a loose limbed swarthy slouching giant with a hangdog look He used to tell Pip that the devil lived in a certain corner of the forge and once in every seven years the fire had to be rekindled with a live boy Orlick at heart disliked everybody especially harmless little Pip and often quarreled with missus Joe Beside the blacksmith the only one who understood Pip was a little girl named Biddy about his own age and an orphan too She liked him and used to help him with his lessons at school But in spite of Joe and Biddy Pip was sometimes so lonely and miserable that he would steal off alone to the village churchyard where his father and mother lay buried to cry One afternoon it was the day before Christmas Pip was more wretched than usual and was sitting crying among the graves when suddenly a rough voice spoke behind him Keep still you little imp it said or I ll cut your throat With the words a man rose up from behind a tombstone and seized him He was a fearful looking man dressed all in gray clothes with a great iron band riveted on his leg His shoes were torn he had no hat and wore a ragged dirty handkerchief tied around his head He was soaked with water caked with mud and limped and shivered as he walked He set Pip on a tombstone and tilted him so far back that the church steeple seemed to turn a somersault growling at him in a terrible voice Pip had never been so frightened in his life With a trembling voice he begged his captor to spare him The man asked him his name and where he lived and told him he would let him go on one condition He had to promise to come next morning at daybreak to a certain spot in the marshes and to bring a file and something to eat And the man said if Pip did not do so or if he told any one what he was going to do he would catch him again and cut out his heart and eat it This terrible threat frightened poor little Pip more than ever His voice shook so that he could hardly promise and when the man set him down he ran home as fast as his legs would carry him The evening was a miserable one Pip thought he would save his own supper for the man in case he should not be able to get into his sister s pantry so instead of eating his bread and butter he slipped it down his trouser leg Before long a great gun began to boom and he asked Joe what it was The blacksmith told him that in the river across the marshes were anchored some big hulks of ships like wicked Noah s arks where convicts were kept prisoners and that the gun was a signal that some of these convicts had escaped Then Pip knew the man he had promised to help was a criminal perhaps a murderer who had got away and was hiding from the soldiers All night he did not sleep He hated to steal the food but he felt certain he would be killed if he did not So at dawn he slipped down stairs got a file from the forge unlocked the pantry took some bread and cheese and a pork pie that Uncle Pumblechook had sent for Christmas dinner and ran out through the foggy morning to the marshes He had not got quite there when he came on a man in gray sitting on the ground with an iron fetter on his leg Pip thought he was the one he was in search of but as soon as the other turned his face he saw by a bruise on the cheek that he was not This second man in gray as soon as he saw him sprang to his feet and ran away Greatly wondering Pip went on and at the right spot he found the man who had frightened him in the graveyard He seemed now to be almost starved for he snatched the food and ate it like a hungry dog He asked Pip if he had seen any one else on his way there and Pip told him of the other man in gray who also wore an iron on his leg He asked Pip to describe the other and when Pip told of the bruised cheek the man he was feeding flew into a rage He began to curse and seizing the file set to filing like mad at his fetter Pip could see that he hated the other convict and was sorry he had escaped but he had fulfilled his promise now so he turned and ran home again and the last thing he heard was the rasp of the file as the man worked madly at the iron Very guilty Pip felt all that Christmas morning He went to church with Joe and after service Uncle Pumblechook Wopsle the clerk and other company came to dinner He could not enjoy the good things to eat for he knew now his sister must discover that the pork pie was gone Just as she went to get it he got up from the table to run away but as he opened the door he ran plump into a file of soldiers He was sure at first they had come to arrest him for helping the convict but he was soon relieved when the officer at their head explained that they were on their way to search the marshes for the escaped men and wanted the blacksmith to mend a broken handcuff In the flurry of their arrival the pork pie was forgotten while Joe mended the handcuff in the forge When the soldiers left the blacksmith set Pip on his broad shoulder and he and Wopsle went striding with them to see the result of the hunt It was sunset as the party entered the marshes and the searchers opened out into a wide line On a sudden all stopped for a confused shouting had come from the distance They ran toward it cocking their guns and Wopsle and Joe with Pip on his shoulder followed The shouts became plainer and plainer All at once they came to a ditch and in it the convict Pip had fed and the one with the bruised cheek were struggling fiercely together The soldiers seized and handcuffed them both the man with the bruised cheek pale and trembling the other boasting that he had dragged the man he hated back to captivity even though it cost him his own freedom While the soldiers were preparing to take their prisoners back Pip s convict saw the boy standing there with Joe Pip hoped he would not think he had had anything to do with bringing the soldiers He was pretty sure the man did not because he presently told the officer in every one s hearing that the night before he had broken into a house where a blacksmith lived near a church and had stolen a pork pie Joe heard this and so Pip knew that he himself would be clear of any blame The convicts were taken back to their cells and Joe and Pip went home to tell the company of their adventure But neither then nor ever afterward did Pip find courage to tell Joe the part he had played for Pip loved the honest blacksmith and did not want him to think him worse than he really was Time went on and Pip grew older and bigger and though he never forgot the adventure of the churchyard yet the memory of it grew dimmer In the next few years only one thing happened to recall it to him One evening missus Joe sent Pip to the village inn The Three Jolly Bargemen with a message Pip found Joe there sitting with a stranger a secret looking man who held his head on one side and kept one eye perpetually shut as if he were taking aim with a gun This man when he heard Pip s name looked at him with a curious wink and when no one but Pip was looking he took out of his pocket to stir his drink with the very file Pip had stolen from Joe s forge Pip knew that minute that the man was a friend of the convict he had aided When Pip left the inn the stranger called him back and gave him a shilling wrapped up in a piece of paper When he got home missus Joe who took the prize away from him discovered that the piece of paper was in reality two bank notes and both Joe and she wondered at it The blacksmith tried next day to find the stranger to restore the money but he had left the inn So it always remained a mystery to all but Pip of course who knew in his heart that the convict had remembered his aid and had taken this means of repaying him II THE QUEER MISS HAVISHAM One day when Pip was considerably older Uncle Pumblechook brought missus Joe word that a Miss Havisham a lady who lived in his own town had heard of Pip and wanted him to come to her house to see her Miss Havisham was a very queer lady indeed so queer that some said she was crazy But she was rich and for this reason missus Joe scrubbed Pip and dressed him in his best clothes and sent him off in care of Uncle Pumblechook who took him as far as Miss Havisham s gate Miss Havisham when a beautiful young lady had been engaged to marry a man named Compeyson whom she loved very much He was a wicked heartless villain however and had made her love him only that he might persuade her to give him great sums of money The marriage day finally was fixed her wedding clothes were bought the house was decorated for the ceremony the bride cake was put on the table in the dining room and the guests arrived But Compeyson the bridegroom did not come Miss Havisham was dressing for the wedding when she received a cruel note from him telling her he did not intend to marry her She had put on her white wedding gown and her lace veil and one of her satin slippers the other lay on the dressing table It was exactly twenty minutes to nine o clock when she read the note She fainted and afterward lay for a long time ill When she recovered she laid the whole place waste She never afterward let the light of day into the old mansion The shutters were closed candles were kept always lighted and all the clocks in the house were stopped at exactly twenty minutes to nine o clock Not a thing in any room was changed The bride cake rotted on the table the decorations faded on the walls and day after day Miss Havisham sat in the dressing room clad in her wedding gown and veil with one slipper on the dead flowers on her table and the trunks for her wedding journey scattered about half packed In time she became shrunken and old and the white satin and lace became faded yellow but she never varied this habit of life Soon after her love disappointment she had written to her lawyer in London who was named Jaggers asking him to find a baby girl for her to adopt as her own Now mister Jaggers had just defended in court a man named Abel Magwitch the tool of Compeyson who had broken Miss Havisham s heart Compeyson had tempted Magwitch into passing some stolen money and they had both been arrested At the trial Compeyson sneak and liar as he was threw all the blame on his comrade who was duller and less sharp than he and as a consequence while Compeyson got a light sentence Magwitch though really the more innocent of the two had been sent to the prison ship for a term of many years These two men by the way were the pair who escaped from the hulks into the marshes Magwitch was Pip s convict of the churchyard and Compeyson was the one he had dragged back to capture This Magwitch at the time of his arrest had a baby daughter who had fallen into mister Jaggers s care and in answer to Miss Havisham s request the lawyer had sent the little girl to her telling her nothing whatever of the child s parentage Miss Havisham had named the child Estella and seeing she would be a very beautiful woman had determined to bring her up heartless and cold to ruin as many men s lives as possible so as to avenge her own wrongs and broken heart So Estella had grown up in the dismal house Miss Havisham s only companion Day by day she became more lovely and even while she was still a little girl the same age as Pip Miss Havisham was impatient to begin teaching her her lesson This was the reason Pip had received his invitation to Miss Havisham s house Though he had no idea of it he was intended only as practice for little Estella who under Miss Havisham s teaching was growing up very fond of admiration and very cold hearted too Pip thought Miss Havisham the strangest lady he had ever seen and the yellow satin the candle lighted rooms and the stopped clocks seemed to him very odd But Estella was so pretty that from the first moment he saw her he had no eyes for anything else Even though she called him clumsy and common and seemed to delight in hurting his feelings Pip fell in love with her and could not help himself Miss Havisham made them play together and told him to come again the next week Pip went home in very bad humor on account of all the hurts which Estella had given his feelings Uncle Pumblechook being very curious to know all about his trip bullied and questioned him so beginning as usual with the multiplication table that Pip perfectly frantic told him the most impossible tales He said Miss Havisham was in a black coach inside the house and had cake and wine handed to her through the coach window on a golden plate and that he and she played with flags and swords while four dogs fought for veal cutlets out of a silver basket But when Uncle Pumblechook told Joe these wonders Pip was remorseful He went to the forge and confessed to Joe that he had been telling a falsehood and promised he would never do so again This visit was the first of many that Pip paid to the gloomy house whose shutters were always closed Next time he went he was taken into the chamber where the decayed wedding cake sat on the table The room was full of relatives of Miss Havisham for it was her birthday who spent their lives flattering and cringing hoping when she died she would leave them some money After a time Pip went into the garden and there he met another relative in the person of a pale young gentleman about his own age but larger who promptly lowered his head butted Pip in the stomach and invited him to fight Pip was so sure nobody else s head belonged in the pit of his stomach that he obliged him at once and as practice at the forge had made him tough it was not many minutes before the pale young gentleman was lying on his back looking up at him out of an exceedingly black eye and with a bleeding countenance When Estella let Pip out of the gate that day he guessed that she had seen the encounter and that somehow it had pleased her for she gave him her cheek to kiss Yet he knew that at heart she thought him only a coarse common boy fit to be treated rudely and insolently This thought rankled more and more in him He made up his mind to study and learn and he got faithful little Biddy to teach him all she knew Pip saw no more of the pale young gentleman though for almost a year he went to Miss Havisham s every other day Each time he saw Estella and found himself loving her more and more But she was always unkind and often when she had been ruder than usual he saw that Miss Havisham seemed to take delight in his mortification Sometimes she would fondle Estella s hand and he would hear her say That s right Break their hearts my pride and hope Break their hearts and have no mercy One day Miss Havisham sent for Joe the blacksmith and gave him a bag of money telling him that he was not to send Pip to her any more but that he should put him to work and teach him the trade of blacksmithing So Uncle Pumblechook took Pip to town that very day and had him bound to Joe as an apprentice This was just what Pip had once looked forward to with pleasure But now it made him wretched Through Estella s jeers he had come to feel that blacksmithing was common and low As he helped Joe to blow the forge fire he thought constantly of Estella s looks of disdain yet in spite of all he longed to see her On his first half holiday he went to call on Miss Havisham But there was no Estella Miss Havisham told him she had sent her abroad to be educated as a lady and when the miserable tears sprang to Pip s eyes she laughed When he got home he confided in Biddy He told her how he loved Estella and that he wanted more than anything else in the world to be a gentleman Meanwhile he began to study hard in any spare time he had and Biddy helped him all she could Pip might have fallen in love with Biddy if he had not had Estella always in his mind Orlick Joe s helper indeed thought he had done so and it made him hate Pip more than ever for he was in love with Biddy himself He grew morose and quarrelsome and spoke so roughly to missus Joe one day that she was not satisfied till the blacksmith took off his singed apron and knocked the surly Orlick flat in the coal dust This was a costly revenge for missus Joe however Orlick never forgave it and a few nights after when no one was at home but herself he crept in behind her in the kitchen and struck her a terrible blow on the head with a piece of iron Hours afterward Joe found her lying senseless and though she lived to recover a part of her senses she never scolded or spoke again She grew well enough at last to sit all day in her chair but was so helpless that Biddy came to the house to be her nurse It chanced that a prisoner had escaped from the prison boats on the night missus Joe was injured and he was thought to be the one who attacked her But Pip suspected Orlick all the while So time went on Once a year on his birthday Pip went to see Miss Havisham but he never saw Estella there And nothing else of particular importance occurred till he had been for four years Joe s apprentice One night as Pip sat with Joe before the fire in The Three Jolly Bargemen they were called out by a gentleman whom Pip remembered to have seen once at Miss Havisham s It was as a matter of fact mister Jaggers her lawyer who had sent Estella to her as a baby The lawyer walked home with them for he had a wonderful piece of news to relate It was that an unknown benefactor whose name he was not permitted to tell intended when he died to leave Pip a fortune In the meantime he wished to have him educated to become a gentleman and as a lad of Great Expectations and the better to accomplish this he wished Pip to go without delay to London This great good fortune seemed so marvelous that Pip could hardly believe it He had never imagined Miss Havisham intended to befriend him but now he guessed at once that she was this unknown benefactor And he jumped next to another conclusion even more splendid that she intended him sometime to marry Estella and was even then educating her for him Pip went home almost in a dream too full of his own prospects to see how sad Biddy was beneath her gladness for him or how sorrowful the good news made Joe That night Estella s face came before him more full of disdain than ever As he thought of her and of the fine gentleman he was to be the humble kitchen and forge seemed to grow commoner and meaner by contrast He began to become a little spoiled and disdainful himself The news soon spread about and every one who had looked down upon Pip now gave him smiles and flattery Uncle Pumblechook wept on his shoulder and instead of telling him as usual that he was sure to come to a bad end reminded him that he had always been his favorite mister Jaggers had given Pip a generous amount of money to buy new clothes with and these tended to make him more spoiled than ever He began to feel condescending toward Biddy and found himself wondering whether when he should be rich and educated Joe s manners would not make him blush if they should meet And even when the day came for him to bid them good by and he climbed aboard the coach for London he thought more of these things and his own good luck than of the home he was parting from for ever or of the true and loving hearts he was leaving behind him This was an ignoble beginning for Pip and one that he came afterward to remember with shame III PIP DISCOVERS HIS BENEFACTOR mister Jaggers the lawyer in whose care Pip found himself in London was sharp and secret and was so feared by criminals that they would never go near his house though he never locked his door even at night He had a crusty clerk named Wemmick as secret as he and a deal queerer Wemmick lived in a little wooden cottage that he called The Castle and which had its top cut out like a fort It had a ditch all around it with a plank drawbridge When he got home from the office in the evening he pulled up the drawbridge and ran up a flag on a flagstaff planted there And exactly at nine every night he fired off a brass cannon that he kept in a latticework fortress beside it Wemmick was the first one Pip met in London and the clerk took him to the rooms where mister Jaggers had arranged for Pip to live with the son of a gentleman who was to be his teacher This gentleman was a mister Pocket a relative as Pip discovered of Miss Havisham which fact made him all the more certain that she was his unknown friend mister Pocket s son was named Herbert and the minute he and Pip first saw each other they burst out laughing For Herbert was none other than the pale young gentleman who years before in Miss Havisham s garden Pip had last seen looking up at him out of a very black eye They were excellent friends from that hour They occupied the rooms together when they were in London and Pip also had a room of his own at mister Pocket s house in the country mister Pocket was a helpless scholarly man who depended on missus Pocket to manage everything and she depended on the servants There were seven little Pockets of various ages tumbling about the house and missus Pocket s only idea of management seemed to be to send them all to bed when any one of them was troublesome At such times mister Pocket would groan put his hands in his hair lift himself several inches out of his chair and then let himself down again In spite of his oddities however mister Pocket was an excellent teacher and Pip in some ways made progress But his Great Expectations taught him bad habits He found it so easy to spend money that he soon overstepped the allowance mister Jaggers had told him was his and not only had got into debt himself but had led Herbert who was far poorer into debt also Joe came to see him only once and then Pip s spoiled eyes overlooked his true rugged manliness and noted more clearly his awkward manners and halting speech Joe was quick to see this difference in the Pip he had known and he did not stay long only long enough to leave a message from Miss Havisham that Estella had returned from abroad and would be glad to see him if he came Pip lost no time in making this visit and started the very next day The old house looked just the same but a new servant opened the gate for him it was Orlick as low browed and sullen and surly as ever and Pip saw at the first glance that his old hatred was still smoldering Miss Havisham was in her room dressed in the same worn wedding dress and beside her with diamonds on her neck and hair sat Estella Pip hardly knew her she had grown so beautiful But she was proud and wilful as of old and though he felt the old love growing stronger every moment he felt no nearer to her than in those past wretched days of his boyhood Before he left Miss Havisham asked him eagerly if Estella was not more lovely and as he sat by her alone she drew his head close to her lips and whispered fiercely Love her love her love her If she favors you love her If she tears your heart to pieces love her love her love her Though this visit took him so near the old forge Pip did not go to see Joe and Biddy Indeed only once in the months that followed did he see them when he went to attend the funeral of missus Joe After that he had no need to leave the city to see Estella for Miss Havisham soon sent her to live in London From there she required her to write letters weekly telling how many men she had fascinated and made wretched Pip saw her constantly and tortured himself with the growing belief that Miss Havisham s training the purpose of which he had begun to guess was really succeeding in crushing her heart and was leaving her with no power to love any one Thus between hope and despair Pip became of age mister Jaggers now told him that a certain large sum was his to spend each year He was deeply in debt and a great part of his first year s portion went to pay his creditors But with the remainder he did a good and unselfish deed he bought secretly a share in a good business for Herbert so that his comrade became a partner in it A great blow was now to fall upon Pip without warning something that changed the whole course of his life One rainy night when Herbert was away from London as he sat alone in their rooms a heavy step stumbled up the stair and a man entered He was coarse and rough looking and tanned with exposure with a furrowed bald head tufted at the sides with gray hair There was something strangely familiar to Pip in his face but at first he did not recognize him Seeing this the stranger threw down his hat twisted a handkerchief around his head took a file from his pocket and walked across the room with a curious shivering gait that brought back to Pip s mind like a lightning flash the scene in the churchyard so many years ago when he had sat perched on a tombstone looking in terror at that same man s face And he knew all at once that the man was the escaped convict of that day It was a strange tale the new comer told then one that Pip s heart sank to hear Miss Havisham had not been his benefactor after all The one whose money had educated him had set him there in London to live the life of a gentleman the one to whom he was indebted for every penny he owned was Abel Magwitch a criminal the convict for whom he had once stolen food years before Pip sank into a chair trembling as Magwitch in a hoarse voice told his story He told how the man Compeyson had led him into crime and then deserted him How he had hated the other so fiercely that after they both had escaped from the prison hulks he had dragged Compeyson back to imprisonment even at the loss of his own liberty How for that attempt to escape he had been sentenced to transportation for life and had been sent to Botany Bay in Australia where in time he became in a measure free though forbidden under penalty of death to return to England How he had never forgotten the little Pip who had tried to aid him and how he had sworn that he would repay him many times over How he had taken to sheep raising and prospered and became a rich man How he had written to mister Jaggers the lawyer who had defended him and paid him to find Pip and educate him And how at last he had dared even the death penalty to come to England to see how he fared His voice shook as he told how he had slaved through all the years looking forward only to this moment when he should come back to see the little Pip whom he had made into a gentleman Poor Pip It was an end to all his dreams of Miss Havisham and of Estella He shrank from Magwitch horrified at the bare thought of what he owed to him He forced himself to utter some trembling words and set food before the convict watching him as he ate like a ravenous old dog His heart was like lead all his plans knocked askew Even while he pitied the old man he shrank from him as if from a wild beast with all his childish dread increased a hundredfold At length Pip put Magwitch in Herbert s room to sleep but all that night he himself lay tossing and sleepless staring into the darkness and listening to the rain outside IV PIP COMES TO HIMSELF The days that followed were one long agony to Pip When Herbert returned he told him the whole story Herbert was shocked and surprised but he was true to his friendship and together they planned what to do It was clear to Pip that he could not spend any more of Magwitch s money indeed recoiling from him as he did he would gladly have repaid every penny if it had been possible To make the matter worse it seemed that Magwitch had brought a great deal of money with him and was determined that Pip should move into a fashionable house buy fast horses keep servants and live most expensively Pip hesitated to tell Magwitch his decision however for what the convict now planned showed how much he had thought of him and loved him in his rough way during all his years in Australia Meanwhile he and Herbert kept Magwitch hidden as much as possible and gave out that the old man was Pip s uncle on a visit from the country Unluckily however Magwitch s presence in London had been seen He had been recognized in the street and followed to Pip s rooms And the man who saw him was his bitterest enemy Compeyson the breaker of Miss Havisham s heart who had first made Magwitch a criminal and whom the convict so hated Compeyson had served out his term and was now free He saw his chance to pay the old grudge with Magwitch s life In order however to make sure of his capture he decided to entice Pip away and bring the police upon Magwitch when he would have no one to warn him Meanwhile unconscious of this plot Pip made a last visit to Miss Havisham He felt now that he was again poor and without prospects and with small hope of winning Estella But finding her there in Miss Havisham s presence he told her how dearly he had always loved her since the first day they had met She seemed moved by his distress but her heart had not yet awakened She told him that she was about to marry one whom he knew for a coarse brutal man in every way beneath her And then Pip knew for certain that Miss Havisham s bitter teaching had borne its fruit at last and that Estella was to marry this man not because she loved him but merely as a final stab to all the other worthier ones In spite of her years of self torture and revengeful thoughts Miss Havisham had still a spark of real pity As Pip reminded her of the wreck she had made of him through Estella and through allowing him falsely to believe her his benefactor his agony struck her with remorse She put her hand to her heart as he ended and as he left them he saw through his own tears her hand still pressed to her side and her faded face ghastly in the candlelight Sick with despair Pip went back to London to learn from Wemmick mister Jaggers s friendly clerk that the rooms were being watched and that he and Herbert who in the absence of Pip had confided in him had removed Magwitch to another lodging a room overlooking the river from which it would be easier if worst came to worst to get him on a ship and so out of the country To do this it was necessary to wait for a favorable chance So Pip providing for Magwitch s comfort meantime bought a boat and he and Herbert rowed daily up and down the river so that when the time came to row the convict to some sea going ship they would know the turns of the stream Pip soon learned that Compeyson was their spy Wopsle who in Pip s boyhood had been the clerk in the village church had turned actor he made to be sure a very poor one and was now playing in London In the theater one night he recognized in the audience the pale faced convict whom he had once with Joe the blacksmith and little Pip seen dragged back to capture by his more powerful fellow Pip had long ago learned from Magwitch that this man was Compeyson and when Wopsle said he had seen him sitting directly back of Pip at the play the latter realized that they had this bitter enemy to reckon with and that Magwitch was in terrible danger Only once was this time of waiting interrupted and that was by a letter from Miss Havisham begging Pip to come to see her He went and she told him she realized now too late how wicked her plans had been and begged him with tears to try to forgive her Pip sore as his own heart was forgave her freely and he was glad ever afterward that he had done so for that same evening while he was standing near her her yellowed wedding veil sweeping too near the hearth caught fire and in an instant her whole dress burst into flame Pip worked desperately to put out the fire but she was so frightfully burned that it was plain she could not live long His own hands and arms were painfully injured so that he returned to London with one arm for the time being almost useless Compeyson meanwhile made friends with Orlick and between them they wrote Pip a letter decoying him to a lonely hut in the marshes When he came there Orlick threw a noose over his head tied him to the wall and would have killed him with a great stone hammer but for Herbert who broke down the door and rushed in just in time to put Orlick to flight and to save Pip s life Herbert had picked up the letter Pip had thrown down read it seen in it something suspicious and had followed from London Pip saw now there was no time to lose if he would save Magwitch They made haste to London and when night fell took the convict in the rowboat and rowing a few miles down the river waited to board a steamer bound for Germany What happened next happened very speedily They were about to board the steamer when a boat containing Compeyson and some police shot out from the bank Compeyson calling on Magwitch to surrender The two boats clashed together and the steamer unable to stop ran them both down At the same moment Magwitch seized Compeyson and they went into the water together When Pip came to himself the steamer had gone his own boat had sunk and he and Herbert had been dragged aboard the other A few minutes later Magwitch was picked up badly injured in the chest and was handcuffed But they did not find Compeyson the other had killed him in that fearful struggle under water That night Magwitch was lodged in jail Before many days he was tried for returning to England and was sentenced to be hanged But it was clear before the trial ended that his injury would never let him live to suffer this penalty And now as he saw the convict lying day by day drawing nearer to death calling him dear boy and watching for his face all the loathing and repugnance Pip had felt for him vanished away He had sat beside the sick man at his trial now he sat beside his cot each day in his cell holding his hand He knew there could be no longer any possibility of his taking the fortune the convict would leave for being condemned to death all Magwitch s property went to the Crown But he did not tell this to Magwitch One thing he discovered however which he told the dying man This concerned Estella As the film of death came over the convict s face Pip said Dear Magwitch you had a child once whom you loved and lost She is living still She is a lady and very beautiful And I love her And hearing this last glad news Magwitch died Before this happened Herbert had left England for Egypt where his business took him Left alone after the strain Pip fell sick of a fever and in the midst of this found himself arrested for debt That was the last he knew for many weeks When he came to himself he found Joe the true hearted blacksmith nursing him He had paid Pip s debts Miss Havisham was dead and Orlick had been sent to jail for robbing Uncle Pumblechook s house Joe s faithfulness smote Pip with a sense of his own ingratitude After a visit to the old forge with Joe and Biddy now Joe s wife Pip felt how true were the old friends He buried for ever the past false pride and folly and knew himself for all his trials a nobler man He sailed to Egypt where he became a clerk in Herbert s business house and finally a partner and it was eleven years before he was in England again Then one day he went down to the old ruined house where Miss Havisham had lived He entered the weed grown garden and there on a bench a sad beautiful widow sat Estella Her husband had treated her brutally till he died and she had learned through suffering to know that she had a heart and had thrown away the one thing that could have made her happy Pip s love When Pip and she left the old house that day it was hand in hand never to part again LIFE AND

Nicholas s benefactors Bray A spendthrift and invalid Madeline His daughter Gride A miser NICHOLAS NICKLEBY I NICHOLAS AT DOTHEBOYS HALL Once on a time in England there were two brothers named Nickleby who had grown up to be very different men Ralph was a rich and miserly money lender who gained his wealth by persecuting the poor of London a thin cold hearted crafty man with a cruel smile The other who lived in the country was generous but poor so that when he died he left his wife and two children Nicholas and Kate with hardly a penny to keep them from starving In their trouble the mother decided to go and try to obtain help from her husband s brother Ralph Nickleby Ralph was angry when he learned they had come to London for he loved his gold better than anything else in the world He lived in Golden Square a very rich part of the city in a great fine house all alone save for one servant and he kept only one clerk This clerk who was named Noggs had one glass eye and long bony fingers which he had an uncomfortable habit of cracking together when he spoke to any one He had once been rich but he had given his money to Ralph Nickleby to invest for him and the money lender had ended by getting it all so that the poor man at last had to become the other s clerk When he first saw Nicholas and Kate Noggs was sorry enough for them because he knew it would be little help they would get from their stingy uncle Nicholas was proud mettled and his very bearing angered the money lender He called him a young puppy and a pauper besides to which Nicholas replied with heat and spirit His mother succeeded in smoothing things over for the time and though Ralph Nickleby from that moment hated the boy he grudgingly promised her to get him a situation as a teacher The school the miser selected was one called Dotheboys Hall a long cold looking tumble down building one story high in a dreary part of the country It belonged to a man named Squeers a burly ruffianly hypocrite who pretended to the world to be a kind fatherly master but in fact treated his pupils with such cruelty that almost the only ones ever sent there were poor little orphans whose guardians were glad to get rid of them Squeers had an oily wrinkled face and flat shiny hair brushed straight up from his forehead His sleeves were too long and his trousers too short and he carried a leather whip about in his pocket to punish the boys with missus Squeers was a fat woman who wore a soiled dressing gown kept her hair in curl papers all day and always had a yellow handkerchief tied around her neck She was as cruel as her husband They had one daughter and a son named Wackford The latter they kept as plump as could be so he would serve as an advertisement of the school the rest of the boys however were pale and thin No wonder for they got almost nothing to eat For dinner all they had was a bowl of thin porridge with a wedge of bread for a spoon When they had eaten the porridge they ate the spoon Once a week they were forced to swallow a dreadful mixture of brimstone and sulphur because this dose took away their appetites so that they ate less for several days afterward They were made to sleep five in a bed and were poorly clothed for whenever a new boy came missus Squeers took his clothes away from him for Wackford and made the new boy wear any old ones she could find They were allowed to write only letters telling how happy they were there and when letters came for any of them missus Squeers opened them first and took for herself any money that they contained There was no attempt at teaching at Dotheboys Hall The books were dirty and torn and the classes were scarecrows All the boys were made to work hard at chores about the place and were flogged almost every day so that their lives were miserable What Squeers wanted was the money their guardians paid him for keeping them This was the kind of school for which Nicholas found himself hired at very low wages as a teacher He knew nothing about it yet however and thought himself lucky and his uncle kind as he bade his mother and Kate good by and took the coach for Dotheboys Hall Noggs Ralph Nickleby s one eyed clerk was there to see him off and put a letter into his hand as he started Nicholas was so sad at leaving the two he loved best in the world that he put it into his pocket and for the time forgot all about it On his arrival next day Nicholas s heart sank into his boots When he saw the boys gathered in the barn which served for a school room he was ready to die with shame and disgust to think he was to be a teacher in such a place But he had no money to take him back to London and because he did not want to make his mother and Kate unhappy he wrote them as cheerfully as he could The letter Noggs had given him he remembered at last to read It told him the writer feared his uncle had deceived him in regard to the school and said if Nicholas needed a friend at any time he would find one in him Noggs These kind words from the old clerk brought tears to Nicholas s eyes Of all the wretched boys there Nicholas pitied most a poor fellow named Smike whom Squeers had made a drudge He was tall and lanky and wore a little boy s suit too short in the arms and legs He had been placed there when a child and the man who had brought him had disappeared and left no money to pay for his keep Squeers s cruelties had made the unfortunate lad simple minded Besides this he was lame Nicholas helped Smike all he could and the poor fellow was so grateful that he followed the other about like a slave Squeers s daughter was named Fanny She had red hair which she wore in five exact rows on the top of her head She thought herself very beautiful and at once fell in love with Nicholas As he could not help showing that he did not like her Miss Fanny grew spiteful and in revenge began to persecute Smike knowing Nicholas liked him Smike stood this as long as he could but at last one day he ran away Squeers was furious He took one chaise and missus Squeers another and off they went in different directions to find him Nicholas was miserable for he knew Smike would be caught Sure enough on the second day missus Squeers returned dragging her victim When Squeers arrived Smike was taken from the cellar where he had been locked up and brought before the assembled boys for a public thrashing At the rain of brutal blows which began Nicholas s blood boiled He stepped forward crying Stop For answer Squeers struck him savagely in the face with his heavy ruler Then Nicholas threw away his self control and leaping on the bully to the unmeasured delight of the boys took the ruler from him and thrashed him until he cried for mercy All the while missus Squeers was trying to drag the victor away by his coat tails while the spiteful Miss Fanny threw inkstands at his head When his arm was tired Nicholas gave Squeers a final blow which knocked him senseless into a corner coolly went to his room packed his few belongings in a bundle and left Dotheboys Hall for ever He was two hundred and fifty miles from London and had very little money Snow was falling and for that night he took refuge in an empty barn In the morning he awoke startled to see a figure sitting by him It was Smike who had followed him The poor creature fell on his knees Let me go with you he cried I want no clothes and I can beg my food I will be your faithful servant Only let me go with you And so you shall said Nicholas Come He rose took up his bundle gave his hand to Smike and so they set out toward London together II NICHOLAS BECOMES AN ACTOR Meanwhile Ralph Nickleby the money lender had given Kate and her mother leave to live in a rickety unoccupied house which he owned It was a dingy building on an old wharf but Noggs the clerk himself cleaned and furnished one of its rooms so that it was fairly comfortable When they were settled Ralph took Kate to a dressmaker s where he got her a situation hoping thus they would not call on him for any money The dressmaker called herself Madame Mantalini Her real name was Muntle but she thought the other sounded better Her husband was a plump lazy man with huge side whiskers who spent most of the time curling them and betting on horse races He gambled away all the money Madame Mantalini made but he pretended to be terribly fond of her and was always calling her his little fairy and his heart s delight so that the silly woman always forgave him He tried to kiss Kate the first day which made her detest him At Madame Mantalini s Kate had to stand up all day trying on dresses for rich ladies who were often rude to her And because they preferred to be waited on by the pretty rosy cheeked girl Miss Knag the ugly forewoman hated the child and did all she could to make her unhappy Kate s mother used to wait each evening on the street corner outside and they would walk home together They had no idea what trouble Nicholas was having all this time because he had written them such cheerful letters and whenever they felt sadder than usual they would comfort themselves by thinking how well he was getting along and what a fine position he had If they could have seen him when he finally got to London after running away from Dotheboys Hall they would hardly have known him Both he and poor Smike were hungry and muddy and tired Remembering Noggs s kind letter Nicholas went first to the little garret where the clerk lived and through him he found a cheap room on the roof of the building which he rented for himself and Smike Then he started out to find his mother and Kate He would have hastened if he had guessed what was happening or how badly Kate had been treated by Ralph Nickleby The evening before as it happened Kate had been invited to dinner at her uncle s fine house and there she had met two dissipated young men Lord Frederick Verisopht and Sir Mulberry Hawk the latter of whom had looked at her and talked to her so rudely that she had indignantly left the table and gone home She had not slept a wink that night and the next morning to make her and her mother more wretched still Ralph Nickleby called with a letter he had just received from Fanny Squeers declaring that Nicholas was a thief and a scoundrel that he had tried to murder her father and all his family and had run off with one of the pupils of Dotheboys Hall To be sure neither of them believed it but if made them very unhappy And then just as Ralph was reading them the last line of the letter in came Nicholas You may be sure he comforted them and told them it was a lie He told Ralph what he thought of him also in stern language which made his uncle angrier than ever Then seeing that his presence was making things worse and realizing in what poverty his dear ones were and that they were so wholly dependent on Ralph for help Nicholas came to a very brave determination He told them that as he could not help them himself he would go away from them until his fortune bettered So bidding them good by and telling his uncle he should keep watch over them and that if any harm came to them he would hold him accountable Nicholas went sadly back to his garret room and to Smike He tried hard for some days to find a situation but failed and he would not take money from Noggs who was so poor himself So at last with Smike he set out on foot for Portsmouth which was a seaport thinking there they might find a chance to go as sailors in some ship At an inn on the way however Nicholas met a man who caused him to change all his plans This man was a mister Vincent Crummles When Nicholas first saw him in the inn he was teaching his two sons to make believe fight with swords They were practising for a play for mister Crummles was manager of a theater in Portsmouth and he proposed that Nicholas join the company and become an actor There seemed nothing else to do so Nicholas agreed and next day they went to the Portsmouth theater where he was introduced to all the company It was a very curious mixture There was missus Crummles who took the tickets and little Miss Crummles whom the bills called The Infant Phenomenon and who was always said to be only ten years old There was a slim young man with weak eyes who played the lover and a fat man with a turned up nose who played the funny countryman and a shabby old man whose breath smelled of gin who took the part of the good old banker with the gray side whiskers Then there was the lady who acted the role of the wicked adventuress and all the others Nicholas had to begin by writing a play which had parts for all of them and it proved a great success Smike whom he drilled himself took the part of a hungry boy and he looked so starved naturally from his life with Squeers that he was tremendously applauded One of the other actors was so jealous at the play s success that he sent Nicholas a challenge to a duel but Nicholas walked on to the stage before the whole company and knocked the actor down and after that he had no trouble and was a great favorite He might have stayed a long time at mister Crummles s theater for he had earned quite a good deal of money but one day he got a letter from Noggs the clerk telling him that all was not well with his mother and Kate And without waiting an hour Nicholas resigned from the company and with Smike set out again for London III NICHOLAS COMES TO KATE S RESCUE Noggs was right Ralph Nickleby had never ceased to persecute Kate and her mother In fact when he had invited Kate to the dinner at which she had been insulted it was for his own evil purpose He had done so hoping she might impress the foolish young Lord Verisopht whose money he was hoping to get and whom he wished to attract to his house The young nobleman as Ralph had intended fell in love with Kate s sweet face at once and found out from her uncle where she lived She had lost her first position at the dressmaker s for mister Mantalini had thrown away his wife s money on race horses until the sheriff had seized the business and she was acting now as companion to a missus Wititterly a pale languid lady who considered herself a very fashionable person indeed and was always suffering from imaginary ailments Lord Frederick and Sir Mulberry Hawk came often to the house pretending to flatter missus Wititterly but really to see Kate who heartily disliked them both missus Wititterly at last came to realize that the two men at whose attentions she had felt so flattered really cared only for her young companion and being vain and jealous she tormented and scolded Kate till the poor girl s life was a burden At length feeling that she could endure it no longer Kate went to Ralph and begged him with tears to help her find another situation but the money lender refused to aid her Noggs the clerk was sorry for her but could do nothing except write to Nicholas and this was the reason for the letter that had brought Nicholas post haste back to London Just what kind of persecution Kate had had to bear he learned by accident almost as soon as he got there As he sat in a coffee house he suddenly heard the words little Kate Nickleby spoken by a man behind him He turned and listened Four men whom he had never seen were drinking toasts to her and Nicholas grew hot with rage at the coarse words they used Sitting there scarcely able to contain himself he heard the whole story of his Uncle Ralph s plot he heard his sister s sufferings derided her goodness jeered at her beauty made the subject of insolent jests One of the four men of course was Lord Frederick Verisopht and the coarsest and the most vulgar of them all as may be guessed was Sir Mulberry Hawk White with anger Nicholas confronted the party and throwing down his card on the table declared that the lady in question was his sister and demanded of Hawk his name Hawk refused to answer Nicholas called him a liar and a coward and seating himself swore the other should not leave his sight before he knew who he was When Hawk attempted to enter his carriage Nicholas sprang on to the step The other in a fury struck him with the whip and Nicholas wrenching it from him with one blow laid open Hawk s cheek The horse frightened at the struggle started off at a terrific speed and Nicholas felt himself hurled to the ground As he rose he saw the runaway horse whirling across the pavement upset the carriage with a crash of breaking glass Nicholas had no doubt that the man it held had been frightfully hurt if not killed He felt faint from his own fall and it was with difficulty that he reached Noggs s garret whither before the adventure in the coffee room he had sent Smike to announce his coming His first step now was to write a letter to Ralph telling him he at last knew what a villain he was and that he and his mother and sister cast him off for ever with shame that they had ever asked his aid The next day Nicholas took Kate from the Wititterly house and his mother from her poor lodging and rented them rooms in another part of the city Then he started out to find some employment for himself For a long time he was unsuccessful but one day and a very lucky day Nicholas thought it ever afterward he met on the street a round faced jolly looking old gentleman with whom he fell into conversation and before long almost without knowing it he had told him all his troubles This old gentleman was named Cheeryble and the firm to which he belonged was Cheeryble Brothers He and his twin brother had come to London barefoot when they were boys and though they had grown very rich they had never forgotten what it was to be poor and wretched The old gentleman asked Nicholas to come with him to his office and there they met the other mister Cheeryble Nicholas could scarcely tell the two brothers apart for they were like as two peas They were precisely the same size wore clothes just alike and laughed in the same key Each had even lost exactly the same number of teeth They were loved by everybody for they went through life doing good wherever they could They both liked Nicholas at once and the upshot was that they gave him a position in their counting room and rented a pleasant cottage near by for his mother and Kate So there Nicholas took up work and they were all happy and comfortable very different from Ralph Nickleby the money lender in his fine house with only the memory of his own wickedness for company IV WHAT HAPPENED TO EVERYBODY Ralph Nickleby s hatred had been growing day by day As he could not harm Nicholas now he tried to hurt him through Smike He sent for Squeers and the latter finding Smike alone one day on the street seized him put him in a coach and started to take him back to Dotheboys Hall But luckily his victim escaped and got back to London Then Ralph formed a wicked plot to get Smike surely into their hands He hired a man to claim that he was the boy s father who had first taken him to Squeers s school Squeers too swore to this lying tale But the Cheeryble brothers suspected the story and when Ralph saw they were determined to help Nicholas protect Smike he was afraid to go any further with the plan So he smothered his rage for the time being and meanwhile a most important thing happened to Nicholas he fell in love It came about in this way There was a man named Bray who had been arrested for debt and was allowed to live only in a certain street under the guardianship of the jailer for this was the law in England then He was slowly dying of heart disease and all the money he had to live on was what his only daughter a lovely girl named Madeline earned by painting and selling pictures The Cheeryble brothers had learned of their poverty for it was hard for Madeline to find purchasers and they sent Nicholas to buy some of the pictures He was to pretend to be a dealer so that Madeline would not suspect it was done for charity Nicholas went more than once and soon had fallen very much in love with Madeline Bray He was not the only one who admired her however There was an old man named Gride almost as stingy as Ralph Nickleby who had discovered by accident that a large sum of money really belonged to Madeline which she and her father knew nothing about and he thought it would be a fine thing to marry her and thus get this fortune into his hands Now Ralph Nickleby was one of the men who was keeping Bray a prisoner and so Gride went to him and asked him to help him marry Madeline If Bray made his daughter marry the old miser he himself was to be set free Ralph for his share was to get some of the money the old man Gride knew should be Madeline s It was a pretty plan and it pleased Ralph for he cared little what lives he ruined so long as he got money by it So he agreed and soon convinced Bray who ill as he was was utterly selfish that it would be a fine thing for Madeline to marry the hideous old Gride and so free her father At length in despair because she thought it her duty to her heartless father Madeline consented to do so Nicholas might never have known of this till after the wedding but luckily Noggs the clerk had overheard the old skinflint make the bargain with Ralph and when one day Nicholas confessed that he was in love with Madeline the good hearted clerk told him all that he had found out Nicholas was in great trouble for he loved Madeline very dearly He went to her and begged her not to marry Gride but she thought it her duty He went to Gride too but the hideous old miser only sneered at him At last in desperation he told Kate and the brother and sister went together to Bray s house They reached it just as the wedding was about to begin Ralph Nickleby who was there foamed with fury to find the nephew he so hated again stepping between him and his evil designs He tried to bar them out but Nicholas forced him back They would doubtless have come to blows but at that moment there came from another room the sound of a fall and a scream from Madeline The excitement had proved too much for her father His heart had failed and he had fallen dead on the floor Thus Providence interfered to bring the wicked scheme of the marriage to naught Vainly did Gride bemoan the loss of the money he had hoped to gain and vainly did Ralph Nickleby with curses try to prevent Nicholas thrust them both aside lifted the unconscious Madeline as easily as if she had been a baby placed her with Kate in a coach and daring Ralph to follow jumped up beside the coachman and bade him drive away He took her to his own home where his mother and Kate cared for her tenderly till she had recovered from the shock and was her own lovely self again The penalty that he had so long deserved was soon to overtake Ralph Nickleby He lost much of his wealth through a failure and close on the heels of this misfortune came the news that the infamous plot he had formed against Smike had been discovered and that Squeers his accomplice had been arrested The most terrible blow came last A man whom Ralph had long ago ruined and had caused to be transported for a crime confessed that he had been the one who many years before had left Smike at Dotheboys Hall and he confessed also that Smike was really Ralph Nickleby s own son by a secret marriage Ralph had not known this because the man in revenge had falsely told him the child was dead The knowledge that in Smike he had been persecuting his own son was the crowning blow for cruel Ralph Nickleby When he heard this he locked himself up alone in his great house and never was seen alive again His body was found in the garret where he had hanged himself to a rafter Poor Smike however did not live to sorrow over the villainy of his father The exposure and hardships of his years at Squeers s school had broken his health He had for long been gradually growing weaker and at last one day he died peacefully with Nicholas s arms around him Every one of whose villainy this story tells came to a bad end Sir Mulberry Hawk quarreled with young Lord Verisopht and shot him dead in the duel that followed For this he himself had to fly to a foreign country where he finally died miserably in jail Gride the miser who had plotted to marry Madeline met almost as terrible a fate as Ralph s His house was broken into by burglars one night and he was found murdered in his bed Squeers was declared guilty and transported for seven years When the news reached Dotheboys Hall such a cheer arose as had never been heard there It came on the weekly treacle day and the boys ducked young Wackford in the soup kettle and made missus Squeers swallow a big dose of her own brimstone Then big and little they all ran away just as Nicholas and Smike had done Kate married a nephew of the Cheeryble brothers and Nicholas of course married Madeline and in time became a partner in the firm All of them lived near by and their little children played together under the watchful care of old Noggs the one eyed clerk who loved them all alike The children laid flowers every day on poor Smike s grave and often their eyes filled with tears as they spoke low and softly of the dead cousin they had never known DEALINGS

Bagstock A retired army officer Diogenes Doctor Blimber s dog Later a pet of Florence s DOMBEY AND SON I LITTLE PAUL In London there was once a business house known as Dombey and Son It had borne that name for generations though at the time this story begins mister Dombey the head of the house had no son He was a merchant hard cold and selfish who thought the world was made only for his firm to trade in He had one little daughter Florence but never since her birth had he loved or petted her because of his disappointment that she was not a boy When at last a son was born to him it wakened something at the bottom of his cold and heavy heart that he had never known before He scarcely grieved for his wife who died when the baby was born but gave all his thought to the child He named him Paul and began at once to long for the time when he should become old enough to be a real member of the firm in which all his own interest centered Dombey and Son He hired the best nurse he could find and when he was not at his office would sit and watch the baby Paul hour after hour laying plans for his future So selfishly was the father s soul wrapped up in this that he scarcely ever noticed poor lonely little Florence whose warm heart was starving for affection Little Paul s nurse was very fond of him and of his sister too but she had children of her own also and one day instead of walking up and down with Florence and the baby near the Dombey house she took the children to another part of the city to visit her own home This was a wrong thing to do and resulted in a very unhappy adventure for Florence On their way home a mad bull broke away from his keepers and charged through the crowded street There was great screaming and confusion and people ran in every direction Florence among the rest She ran for a long way and when she stopped her nurse was nowhere to be seen Terrified to find herself lost in the great city she began to cry The next thing she knew an ugly old woman with red rimmed eyes and a mouth that mumbled all the while grasped her by the wrist and dragged her through the shabby doorway of a dirty house into a back room heaped with rags I want that pretty frock said she and that little bonnet and your petticoat Come Take them off Florence dreadfully frightened obeyed The old woman took away her shoes too and made her put on some filthy ragged clothing from the heaps on the floor Then she let her go first making her promise she would not ask any one to show her the way home The poor child could think of nothing else but to find her father s office at Dombey and Son s and for two hours she walked asking the way of everybody she met She might not have found it at all but at a wharf where she wandered there happened to be a young clerk of Dombey and Son s and the minute he was pointed out to her she felt such trust in his bright and open face that she caught his hand and sobbed out all her story This lad s name was Walter Gay He lived with his uncle honest old Solomon Gills a maker of ship s instruments who kept a little shop with the wooden figure of a midshipman set outside Very few customers ever came into the shop and indeed hardly any one else for Old Sol as the neighbors called him had only one intimate friend This friend was a retired seaman named Captain Cuttle who always dressed in blue as if he were a bird and those were his feathers He had a hook instead of a hand attached to his right wrist a shirt collar so large that it looked like a small sail and wherever he went he carried in his left hand a thick stick that was covered all over like his nose with knobs Captain Cuttle used to talk on land just as if he were at sea He would say Steady and Belay there and called Old Sol Shipmate as though the little shop in which he spent his evenings was a ship He had a deep rumbling voice in which he would sing Lovely Peg the only song he knew and which he never but once got through to the last line But in spite of his queer ways and talk Captain Cuttle had the softest kindest heart in the world He thought old Solomon Gills the greatest man alive and was as fond as possible of Wal r as he called the nephew And indeed Walter was a handsome boy and as good as he was handsome Walter soothed Florence s tears and took her ragged clothes and all straight home to Solomon Gills s shop where his uncle gave her a warm supper while Walter ran to the Dombey house with the news that she was found and to bring back a dress for her to wear So Florence s adventure turned out very well in one way since through it she first met Walter Gay but it turned out badly in another way for mister Dombey was angry that any one should have seen a daughter of his in such a plight and unjustly enough treasured this anger against Walter Florence however never forgot her rescuer after that day and as for Walter he fell quite in love with her Florence loved her little brother very dearly but Paul in the constant companionship of his father grew up without boys or play His face was old and wistful and he had an old fashioned way of sitting brooding in his little arm chair beside his father looking into the fire He used to ask strange wise questions and the only time he seemed childlike at all was when he was with Florence He was never strong and well like her but he grew tired easily and used to say that his bones ached mister Dombey at length grew anxious about Paul s health and sent him with Florence to Brighton a town on the sea coast to the house of a missus Pipchin a stooped old lady with a mottled face a hooked nose and a hard gray eye missus Pipchin took little children to board and her idea of managing them was to give them everything they didn t like and nothing they did like She lived in a gloomy house so windy that it always sounded to any one in it like a great shell which one had to hold to his ear whether he liked it or not The children there stayed most of the time in a bare room they called the dungeon with a big ragged fireplace in it They had only bread and butter and rice to eat while missus Pipchin had tea and mutton chops and buttered toast and other nice things Little Paul s father did not know what a dreary place this was for a child or doubtless he would not have sent him there mister Dombey knew so little about children that it seemed as if he had never been a child himself Paul was not happy except when he was out on the beach with Florence who used to draw him in a little carriage and sing to him and tell him stories Once a week mister Dombey came to Brighton and then she and little Paul would go to his hotel to take tea with him Paul seemed to find a curious fascination in missus Pipchin He would sit by the hour before the fire looking steadily at her where she sat with her old black cat beside her till his gaze quite disturbed her He did not care to play with other children only with Florence whom he called Floy Often as they sat together on the beach he would ask her what it was the sea was always saying and would rise up on his couch to listen to something he seemed to hear far far away Walter Gay meanwhile in London was working away and thinking often of Florence He was greatly worried about his Uncle Solomon for the business of the old instrument maker was in a bad way and Old Sol himself was melancholy One day Walter came home from his work at Dombey and Son s to find that an officer had taken possession of the shop and all that was in it for debt His old Uncle Sol was sobbing like a child and not knowing what else to do he went post haste for Captain Cuttle He found the captain with his hat on peeling potatoes with a knife screwed into the wooden socket in his wrist instead of the hook When he told him what had happened Captain Cuttle jumped up put all the money he had his silver watch some spoons and a pair of sugar tongs into his pocket and went back at once with him to the shop But the debt he found was far too big to be thus paid and Captain Cuttle advised Walter to go to mister Dombey and ask him to help them or else everything in the shop would have to be sold and that would kill old Solomon Gills It was Saturday and mister Dombey had gone to see little Paul so Walter and Captain Cuttle took the next coach for Brighton They found him with the children at breakfast and Walter discouraged by his cold look faltered lamely through his story while Captain Cuttle laid on the table the money the watch the spoons and the sugar tongs offering them to help pay the debt mister Dombey was astonished at his strange appearance and indignant at being annoyed by such an errand so that Florence seeing his mood and Walter s trouble began to sob Little Paul however stood looking from Walter to his father so intently and wisely that the latter telling him he was one day to be a part of Dombey and Son asked him if he would like to loan Walter the money Paul joyfully said yes and mister Dombey telling Walter that it was to be considered a loan from the boy gave him a note which would at once release his uncle from his difficulty So Walter and Captain Cuttle went gladly back to London Soon after this when Paul was six years old his father thought he should be studying so he put him in a school next door to missus Pipchin s The master was Doctor Blimber a portly gentleman in knee breeches with a bald head and a double chin He made all the boys there study much too hard even those only six years old had to learn Greek and history Poor little Paul did the best he could but such difficult tasks made him giddy and dull It was only the Saturdays he enjoyed these he spent with Florence on the seashore or in missus Pipchin s bare room Paul would have broken down sooner under Doctor Blimber s system but that Florence bought all the books he studied and studied them herself so as to help him on Saturdays People called him old fashioned and that troubled him a great deal but he tried to love even the old watch dog at Doctor Blimber s and before the holidays came everybody in the school liked him But before the term ended little Paul fell sick He seemed not to be ill of any particular disease but only weak so weak he had to sit propped up with pillows at the entertainment Doctor Blimber gave on the final evening After that everything was hazy until he found himself somehow at home in bed with Florence beside him He lay there day after day watching and dreaming He dreamed often of a swift silent river that flowed on and on and he wanted to stop it with his hands Why will it never stop Floy he would ask her It is bearing me away I think There were many shadowy figures that came and went One came often and sat long but never spoke One day he saw it was his father and he called out to it Don t be so sorry for me dear papa Indeed I am quite happy Once he roused himself and there were many about the bed Florence his father his old nurse and Walter Gay and he called each by name and waved his hand to them Florence took him in her arms and he heard the swift river flowing How fast it runs Floy It is taking me with it There is a shore before me now Who is standing on the bank He put his hands together behind her neck as he had been used to do at his prayers Mama is like you Floy he said I know her by her face The light about the head is shining upon me as I go So little Paul died II HOW FLORENCE LOST HER FATHER It was a sad sad house for many days after that and Florence in her loneliness often thought her heart would break Her father she scarcely ever saw for he sat alone in his room Every night she would steal down the dark hall to his door and lay her head against the panels hungering for a little love but he thought only of his dead son and gave no sign of tenderness to her One of Doctor Blimber s pupils begged for and brought her Diogenes the old watch dog which little Paul had petted at the school and this dog was all she had to love She had not seen Walter Gay since the death of her brother though he himself thought of her very often Walter s prospects thanks to an enemy he had made without knowing it had changed since then This enemy was Carker the manager at Dombey and Son s Carker was a thin man with the whitest most regular teeth which he continually showed in an unpleasant smile There was something cat like about him the more he disliked a person the wider was his smile Carker had a brother whom he hated and Walter unconsciously earned his enmity by liking and being kind to this brother mister Dombey was not fond of Walter either the less so because Florence liked him and disliking Florence he disliked all for whom she cared So between mister Dombey and Carker Walter was ordered to go on business for the firm on a long voyage to the West Indies Walter was not deceived He knew he was not sent there for his own good but in order not to worry his uncle he and Captain Cuttle pretended that it was a splendid opportunity So old Solomon Gills tried not to sorrow for his going Florence heard of the voyage and the night before Walter sailed in she came to the little shop where Walter had brought her years before when she had been lost She kissed Old Sol and called Walter her brother and said she would never forget him And so Walter when next day he sailed away waving his hand to his uncle and Captain Cuttle went with even more of love in his heart for Florence than he had had After his going Florence was lonelier than before She was all alone save for the dog Diogenes and her books and music Her father was much away and in the evenings she could go into his room and nestle in his easy chair without fear of repulse She kept the room in order and a fresh nosegay on the table and never left it without leaving on his deserted desk a kiss and a tear The purpose of her life she determined should be to try continually to let her father know how much she loved him But months passed and she had no chance Her father in fact seldom came near the house He was away visiting in the country with a Major Bagstock who had struck up an acquaintance with him because of mister Dombey s wealth Bagstock who had a habit of referring to himself as J B or Joey B or almost anything but his full name was as fat as a dancing bear with a purple apoplectic looking face and a laugh like a horse s cough He was a glutton and stuffed himself so at meals that he did little but choke and wheeze through the latter half of them He was a great flatterer however and he flattered so well that mister Dombey blind from his own pride thought him a very proper person indeed And even though everybody laughed at the major mister Dombey always found him most agreeable company There was an old lady at the town they visited who was poor but very fond of fashion and rich people She had no heart and was silly enough even though she was seventy years old to wear rouge on her cheeks and dress like a girl of seventeen She had a widowed daughter Edith Granger a proud lovely woman who despised the life her mother led but in spite of this was weak enough to be influenced by her Major Bagstock introduced mister Dombey to the mother and the latter soon made up her mind that her daughter should marry him The major who wanted mister Dombey to marry so he himself could profit by the dinners and entertainments that would follow helped this affair on all he could and Edith though at times she hated herself for the false part she was playing agreed to it To tell the truth mister Dombey was so full of his own conceit that he never stopped to wonder if Edith could really love him She was beautiful and as cold and haughty as he was himself and that was all he considered So Major Bagstock and the old lady were soon chuckling and wheezing together with delight at the success of their plan and before long Edith had promised to marry Florence s father Poor Florence She had other griefs of her own by this time Carker of Dombey and Son with the false smile and the white teeth came several times to see her asking if she had messages to send to her father each time seeming purposely to wound her by recalling her father s dislike She tried to like the smooth oily manager but there was something in his face she could not but distrust To add to her trouble the ship by which Walter Gay had sailed for the West Indies had not yet arrived there It was long overdue and in the absence of news people began to fear it had been lost She went to the little shop where the wooden midshipman stood but found old Solomon Gills and Captain Cuttle in as great anxiety Old Sol indeed was soon in such distress for fear Walter had been drowned that he felt he could bear the suspense no longer One day soon after Florence s visit he disappeared from London leaving a letter for Captain Cuttle This letter said he had gone to the West Indies to search for Walter and asked the captain to care for the little shop and keep it open so that it could be a home for his nephew if he should ever appear As for himself Old Sol said if he did not return within a year he would be dead and the captain should take the shop for his own The disappearance of his old friend was a great blow to bluff Captain Cuttle but determined to do his part he left his own lodgings and took up his place at the sign of the wooden midshipman to wait for news either of Walter or of old Solomon Gills Florence knew nothing about this for the captain had not the heart to tell her And for her own part she had much to think of in the approaching marriage of her father in preparation for which the house was full of painters and paper hangers making it over for the bride The first time Florence saw Edith was when one day she entered the parlor to find her father there with a strange beautiful lady beside him mister Dombey told her the lady would soon be her mama and Edith touched by the child s sweet face bent down and kissed her so tenderly that Florence so starved for affection began at that moment to love her and to hope through Edith s love finally to win the love of her father The wedding was a very grand one and many people were at the church to see it Even Captain Cuttle watched it from the gallery and Carker s smile as he looked on showed more of his white teeth than ever The only thing that marred Florence s happiness and hope on this day was the knowledge that Walter had not been heard from and the fear that he might never return But in spite of her brave hope after her father and Edith came back from their wedding journey and the life of parties and dinners began Florence was soon disheartened In the first flush of confidence she opened all her soul to Edith and begged her to teach her to win her father s liking But Edith knowing as Florence did not know how she had sold herself in this rich marriage and that she had no particle of love in her heart for her husband told her sadly that she could not help her This puzzled Florence greatly for she loved Edith and knew that Edith loved her in return In fact it was Florence s trust and innocence that made Edith s conscience torture her the more In Florence s pure presence she felt more and more unworthy and the knowledge that her husband s hardness of heart was crushing the child s life and happiness made her hate him Florence saw before many months passed that her father and Edith did not live in love and contentment Indeed how could they She had married for ambition he for pride and neither loved nor would yield to the other They had not the same friends or acquaintances Hers were people of fashion his were men of business At the dinners they gave mister Dombey did not think Edith treated his friends politely enough He began to reprove her more and more often and when she paid no heed he finally chid her openly and sternly in the presence of Carker who brought his smile and gleaming teeth often to the house knowing this action would most wound Edith s pride And at length he took the management of the house out of her hands and hired as housekeeper missus Pipchin the old ogre of Brighton at whose house Florence and little Paul had once lived The worst of it all was that the more mister Dombey grew to dislike his wife the more he saw she loved Florence and this made him detest the poor child more than ever He imagined in his cruel selfishness that as Florence had come between him and the love of little Paul so she was now coming between him and his wife Finally he sent Carker to Edith telling her she must no longer sit or talk with Florence that they must see each other only in his presence Florence s cup of bitterness was now almost full for she knew nothing of this command and when she saw that Edith avoided her sorrowed in secret She was quite alone again now save for Diogenes Neither Major Bagstock her father s flatterer nor Carker with his cat like smile could she see without a shudder and all the while her heart was aching for her father s love mister Dombey s insults were heaped more and more upon the defenseless Edith till at last made desperate by his pride and cruelty she prepared a terrible revenge On the morning of the anniversary of their wedding day mister Dombey was startled by the news that Edith had run away with the false hearted Carker On that terrible morning when the proud old man sat stunned in his room Florence yielding to her first impulse of grief and pity for him ran to him to comfort him But when she would have thrown her arms around his neck he lifted his arm and struck her so that she tottered And as he did so he bade her follow Edith since they had always been in league In that blow Florence felt at last his cruelty neglect and hatred trampling down any feeling of compassion he may once have had for her She saw she had no longer a father she could love and wringing her hands with her head bent to hide her agony of tears ran out of the house that could no more be her home into the heartless street III HOW FLORENCE REACHED A REFUGE For a long time she ran without purpose weeping and not knowing where to go But at last she thought of the day so many years before when she had been lost and when Walter Gay had found her He had taken her then to the shop of his uncle old Solomon Gills There she thought she might at least find shelter When she got to the sign of the wooden midshipman she had just enough strength to knock and push open the door and then at sight of Captain Cuttle s honest face all her strength left her and she fainted on the threshold Captain Cuttle was cooking his breakfast He knew her at once even though she had grown to be a young lady He lifted her and laid her on the sofa calling her his lady lass and bathed her face in cold water till she opened her eyes and knew him She told him all her story and he comforted her and told her the shop should be her home just as long as she would stay in it When she had eaten some toast and drunk some tea he made her lie down in the little upper room and sleep till she woke refreshed at evening When she came down the stair she found Captain Cuttle cooking dinner He seemed to her then to have some great joyful and mysterious secret All through the evening and until she went to bed he would persist in drawing the conversation around to Walter which brought the tears again and again to her eyes Then he would rumble out Wal r s drown ded ain t he pretty and nod his head and look very wise Indeed Captain Cuttle did have a wonderful secret While Florence had been sleeping he had received a great piece of news Walter whom every one had believed drowned had escaped death alone of all on the wrecked vessel He had clung to a spar when the ship went down and had been picked up by a vessel going in another direction so he had had no way of sending back news of his safety The ship that had rescued him had at last brought him back to London and it would not be long now before he would appear at the shop You may guess Captain Cuttle s heart was full of thankfulness But not knowing much about such matters he had an idea that the good news must be broken very gently to Florence So at last he commenced to tell her a story about a shipwreck in which only one was saved and then she began to suspect the truth and her heart beat joyfully Just as he finished the story the door opened There was Walter himself alive and well and with a cry of joy she sprang to his arms There was much to talk of that night in the little shop With her face on Captain Cuttle s shoulder Florence told him how and why she had left her home And Walter as he took her hand and kissed it knew that she was a homeless wandering fugitive but richer to him thus than in all the wealth and pride of her former station that had once made her seem so far off from him Very soon after that he told Florence that he loved her not as a brother but as something even dearer and she promised to be his wife On the evening before their wedding day one more surprise came to them They were all gathered in the shop when the outer door opened Captain Cuttle suddenly hit the table a terrific blow with his hook shouted Sol Gills ahoy and tumbled into the arms of a man in an old weather beaten coat It was old Solomon Gills indeed returned from his long search and now to see Walter there weeping with joy In another moment Walter and Florence were both in his arms too and everybody was laughing and crying and talking together Old Sol had been half way around the world in his search for Walter but had finally heard of his safety and started home knowing he would go there also It was a very joyous evening that last evening of Florence s girl life The next morning Walter and Florence paid an early visit to the grave of little Paul She bade it a long good by for Walter had become an officer of a ship and she was to make the coming voyage with her husband Then they went to the church where they were married and a few days later they sailed away to China with Captain Cuttle s big watch and sugar tongs and teaspoons that he had once offered to mister Dombey for wedding presents content in each other s love Often indeed in this happy honeymoon Florence remembered the father who had spurned her But Walter s love had taken away the bitterness of that thought She tried to love her father now rather as she loved the memory of little Paul not as a cruel cold living man but as some one who had once lived and who might once have loved her IV HOW FLORENCE FOUND HER FATHER AT LAST mister Dombey alone in the silent house had made no search for Florence His pride bade him hide all traces of his grief and rage from the world He had only one thought to find where Carker had fled with his wife to follow and to kill him He hired detectives and at last discovered that Carker had gone to a certain city in France And to that place he followed him Now Edith desperate as she had been had not really been so wicked as mister Dombey supposed her She had deserted him but she had not run away with Carker In all the trouble between herself and mister Dombey Carker the smooth smiling hypocrite had labored to make matters worse He had lied to mister Dombey about his wife and taunted her with her position and done everything in his power to make them hate each other more bitterly At last when he saw Edith could bear it no longer he had begged her to run away with him and when she refused he had threatened her in many cowardly ways But Edith hated him as much as she disliked her husband and had not the least idea of running away with him She had pretended to Carker that she would do so and had led her husband and everybody else to think she had done so but this was only to wound her husband s pride and to punish him for all his tortures Carker had followed her to France but once there he had found the tables turned Edith laughed at him and scorned him and sent him from her baffled and furious Carker was thus caught in his own trap He had lost his own position and reputation and had gained nothing for all his evil plots And besides this he was a fugitive and mister Dombey the man he had wronged was on his track When he learned his enemy had followed him to France Carker raging but cowardly fled back to England and back to England Edith s revengeful husband followed him day and night The wicked manager knew no more peace or rest He traveled into the country seeking some lonely village in which to hide but he could not shake off that grim pursuer They met at last face to face one day on a railroad platform when neither was expecting to see the other In the surprise of the meeting Carker s foot slipped he stepped backward directly in the path of the engine that was roaring up the track It caught him and tossed him and tore him limb from limb and its iron wheels crushed and ground him to pieces And that was the end of Carker of the white teeth and false smile and mister Dombey went back to London still proud and alone still cold and forbidding But his conscience at last had begun to cry out against him and to deafen its voice he plunged more and more recklessly into business spending money too lavishly and taking risks of which in other days he would not have thought The months went by and little by little the old firm of Dombey and Son became more entangled Soon there were whispers that the business was in difficulty but mister Dombey did not hear them One morning the crash came A bank closed and then suddenly the word went around that the old firm had failed It was too true The proud hard hearted merchant who had driven his daughter from him was ruined and a beggar His rich friends whom he had treated so haughtily shrugged their shoulders and sneered Even Major Bagstock at his club grew purple in the face with chuckling The servants were all sent away most of the furniture was sold at a public sale and the old man who had once been so proud and held his gray head so high still sat on hour after hour in the echoing house so empty now that even the rats would not live in it What was he thinking At last in his agony his sorrow his remorse his despair he remembered Florence He saw again her trembling lips her lonely face longing for love the terrible hopeless change that came over it when his own cruel arm struck her on that final day when she had stood before him His pride at last had fallen He knew now himself what it was to be rejected and deserted He thought how the daughter he had disliked of them all had never changed in her love for him And by his own act he had lost her for ever His son his wife his fortune all had gone and now at last in his wretchedness he knew that Florence would always have been true to him if he had only let her Days passed but he never left the house every night he wandered through the empty rooms like a ghost He grew to be a haggard wasted likeness of himself And one day the thought came to him that it would be better if he too were dead even if it be by his own hand This thought clung to him He could not shake it off One day he took a pistol from his dressing table and sat hugging it to his breast At length he rose and stood in front of a mirror with the weapon in his hand But suddenly he heard a cry a piercing loving rapturous cry and he saw at his feet clasping his knees with her face lifted to his Florence his long lost daughter Papa dearest papa she cried I have come back to you I never can be happy more without you He tottered to a chair feeling her draw his arms around her neck He felt her wet cheek laid against his own He heard her soft voice telling him that now she herself had a little child a baby boy born at sea whom she and Walter had named Paul Dear papa she said you will come home with me We will teach our little child to love and honor you and we will tell him when he can understand that you had a son of that name once and that he died and that you were sorry but that he is gone to Heaven where we all hope to see him sometime Kiss me papa as a promise that you will be reconciled Never let us be parted any more His hard heart had been melting while she spoke As she clung closer to him he kissed her and she heard him mutter Oh God forgive me for I need it very much She drew him to his feet and walking with a feeble gait he went with her With her eyes upon his face and his arm about her she led him to the coach waiting at the door and carried him away mister Dombey was very ill for a long time When he recovered he was no longer his old self but a gentle loving white haired old man Walter did not go to sea again but found a position of great trust and confidence in London and in their home the old man felt growing stronger and stronger his new found love for the daughter whom till now he had never really known Florence never saw Edith again but once Then the latter came back to bid her farewell for ever before she went to live in Italy In these years Edith had seen her own pride and grieved for her fault There were tears in her stern dark eyes when Florence asked if she would send some message to mister Dombey Tell him she answered that if in his own present he can find a reason to think less bitterly of me I asked him to do so I will try to forgive him his share of blame let him try to forgive me mine Time went happily by in the home of Walter and Florence They often visited the little shop where stood the wooden midshipman now in a new suit of paint The sign above the door had become Gills and Cuttle for Old Sol and the Captain had gone into partnership and the firm had grown rich through the successes of some of Solomon Gills s old investments which had finally turned out well Walter was beloved by everybody who knew him and in time refounded the old firm of Dombey and Son Often in the summer on the sea beach old mister Dombey might have been seen wandering with Florence s little children The oldest was little Paul and he thought of him sometimes almost as of the other little Paul who died But most of all the old gentleman loved the little girl He could not bear to see her sit apart or with a cloud on her face He often stole away to look at her in her sleep and was fondest and most loving to her when there was no one by The child used to say then sometimes Dear grandpa why do you cry when you kiss me But he would only answer Little Florence Little Florence and smooth away the curls that shaded her earnest eyes THE POSTHUMOUS PAPERS OF THE PICKWICK CLUB Published eighteen thirty six eighteen thirty seven Scene London Neighboring Towns Bath and the Country Time eighteen

PAPERS I THE PICKWICKIANS BEGIN THEIR ADVENTURES THEY MEET mister ALFRED JINGLE AND WINKLE IS INVOLVED IN A DUEL Once upon a time in London there was a club called The Pickwick Club mister Samuel Pickwick its founder and chairman was a benevolent simple hearted old gentleman of some wealth with a taste for science He delighted to invent the most profound theories to explain the most ordinary happenings and to write long papers to be read before the Club He had a large bald head and eyes that twinkled behind round spectacles and he made a speech with one hand under his coat tails and the other waving in the air His fellow members looked upon mister Pickwick as a very great man and when he proposed that he and three others form a Corresponding Society which should travel about and forward to the club accounts of their adventures the idea was at once adopted The three that mister Pickwick chose were named Tupman Snodgrass and Winkle Tupman was middle aged with a double chin and was so fat that for years he had not seen the watch chain that crossed his silk waistcoat But he had a youthful romantic disposition and a great liking for the fair sex Snodgrass who had no parents was a ward of mister Pickwick s and imagined himself a poet Winkle was a young man whose father had sent him to London to learn life he wore a green shooting coat and his great ambition was to be considered a sportsman though at heart he was afraid of either a horse or a gun With these three companions mister Pickwick prepared to set out in search of adventures Next morning as he drove in a cab to the inn where all were to take the coach mister Pickwick began to chat with the driver The cabman amused himself by telling the most impossible things all of which mister Pickwick believed When he said his horse was forty two years old and that he often kept him out three weeks at a time without resting down it went in mister Pickwick s note book as a wonderful instance of the endurance of horses Unfortunately however the driver thought mister Pickwick was putting down the number of the cab so as to complain of him and as they arrived just then at the inn he jumped from his seat with the intention of fighting his dismayed passenger He knocked off mister Pickwick s spectacles and dancing back and forth as the other s three comrades rushed to the rescue planted a blow in mister Snodgrass s eye another in Tupman s waistcoat and ended by knocking all the breath out of Winkle s body From this dilemma they were rescued by a tall thin long haired young man in a faded green coat worn black trousers and patched shoes who seized mister Pickwick and lugged him into the inn by main force talking with a jaunty independent manner and in rapid and broken sentences This way sir where s your friends all a mistake never mind here waiter brandy and water raw beefsteak for the gentleman s eye eh ha ha The seedy looking stranger whose name was Alfred Jingle was a passenger on the same coach that day and entertained the Pickwickians with marvelous stories of his life in Spain None of these was true to be sure but they were all entered in mister Pickwick s note book In gratitude that night the latter invited Jingle to dinner at the town inn where they stopped The dinner was long and almost before it was over not only mister Pickwick but Snodgrass and Winkle also were asleep Tupman however was more wakeful a ball the waiter had told him was to be held that night on the upper floor and he longed to attend it Jingle readily agreed especially when Tupman said he could borrow for him a blue dress suit the property of the sleeping Winkle They were soon dressed and at the ball Jingle s jaunty air gained him a number of introductions Before long he was dancing with a little old widow named missus Budger who was very rich and to whom he at once began to make love There was an army surgeon present named Slammer a short fat man with a ring of upright black hair around his head and a bald plain on top of it who had been courting the rich widow himself Doctor Slammer was old Jingle was young and the lady felt flattered Every moment the doctor grew angrier and at last tried to pick a quarrel with the wearer of the blue dress suit at which Jingle only laughed The ball over Tupman and Jingle went down stairs Winkle s clothes were returned to their place and Jingle promising to join the party at dinner next day took his departure The Pickwickians were hardly awake next morning when an army officer came to the inn inquiring which gentleman of their number owned a blue dress suit with gilt buttons When told that mister Winkle had such a costume he demanded to see him and at once in the name of his friend Doctor Slammer challenged him to fight a duel that night at sunset Poor Winkle almost fainted with surprise When the stranger explained that the wearer of the blue suit had insulted Doctor Slammer Winkle concluded that he must have drunk too much wine at dinner changed his clothes gone somewhere and insulted somebody of all of which he had no recollection He saw no way therefore but to accept the bloodthirsty challenge hoping that something would happen to prevent the duel Winkle was dreadfully afraid for he had never fired a pistol in his life He chose Snodgrass for his second hoping the latter would tell mister Pickwick but Snodgrass he soon found to his dismay had no idea of doing so The day wore heavily away and Winkle could think of no escape At sunset they walked to the appointed spot a lonely field and at last Winkle found himself pistol in hand opposite another man armed likewise and waiting the signal to shoot At that moment Doctor Slammer saw that the man he faced was not the one who had insulted him at the ball Explanations were soon made and the whole party walked back together to the inn where Winkle introduced his new friends to the Pickwickians Jingle however was with the latter and Doctor Slammer at once recognized him as the wearer of the blue dress suit The doctor flew into a rage and only the statement of his fellow officer that Jingle was not a gentleman but a strolling actor far beneath the doctor s dignity prevented an encounter As it was Slammer stumped off in anger leaving the Pickwickians to enjoy the evening in their own way II TUPMAN HAS A LOVE AFFAIR WITH A SPINSTER AND THE PICKWICKIANS FIND OUT THE REAL CHARACTER OF JINGLE Next day a military drill was held just outside the town and the Pickwickians went to see it In the confusion of running officers and prancing horses they became separated from one another mister Pickwick Snodgrass and Winkle found themselves between two lines of troops in danger of being run down At this moment they saw Tupman standing in an open carriage near by and hurrying to it were hoisted in The carriage belonged to a short stout old gentleman named Wardle who had attended some of the club s meetings in London and knew mister Pickwick by sight He lived at a place near by called Dingley Dell from which he had driven to see the drill with his old maid sister and his own two pretty daughters Fastened behind was a big hamper of lunch and on the box was a fat boy named Joe whom mister Wardle kept as a curiosity because he did nothing but eat and sleep Joe went on errands fast asleep and snored as he waited on the table He had slept all through the roaring of the cannon and the old gentleman had to pinch him awake to serve the luncheon They had a merry time that day Tupman being deeply smitten with the charms of the elderly Miss Wardle and Snodgrass no less in love with Emily one of the pretty daughters When the review was over the old gentleman invited them all to visit Dingley Dell next day Early in the morning they set out mister Pickwick driving Tupman and Snodgrass in a chaise while Winkle rode on horseback to uphold his reputation as a sportsman mister Pickwick was distrustful of the horse he hired but the hostler assured him that even a wagon load of monkeys with their tails burnt off would not make him shy Winkle had never ridden a horse before but he was ashamed to admit it For a while all went well then the luckless Winkle dropped his whip and when he dismounted the horse would not let him mount again mister Pickwick got out of the chaise to help and at this the animal jerked the bridle away and trotted home Hearing the clatter the other horse bolted too Snodgrass and Tupman jumped for their lives and the chaise was smashed to pieces against a wooden bridge With difficulty the horse was freed from the ruins and leading him the four friends walked the seven miles to Dingley Dell where they found mister Wardle and the fat boy the latter fast asleep as usual posted in the lane to meet them Brushes a needle and thread and some cherry brandy soon cured their rents and bruises and they forgot their misfortunes in an evening of pleasure mister Wardle s mother was a deaf old lady with an ear trumpet who loved to play whist When she disliked a person she would pretend she could not hear a word he said but mister Pickwick s jollity and compliments made her forget even to use her ear trumpet Tupman flirted with the spinster aunt and Snodgrass whispered poetry into Emily s ear to his heart s content Next morning mister Wardle took Winkle rook shooting The pair set out with their guns preceded by the fat boy and followed by mister Pickwick Snodgrass and the corpulent Tupman Winkle who disliked to admit his ignorance of guns showed it in a painful way His first shot missed the birds and lodged itself in the arm of Tupman who fell to the ground The confusion that followed can not be described They bound up his wounds and supported him to the house where the ladies waited at the garden gate mister Wardle calling out to them not to be frightened The warning however had no effect on the spinster aunt At the sight of her Tupman wounded she began to scream Old mister Wardle told her not to be a fool but Tupman was affected almost to tears and spoke her name with such romantic tenderness that the poor foolish lady felt quite a flutter at her heart A surgeon found the wound a slight one and as a cricket match was to be played that day the host left Tupman in the care of the ladies and carried off the others to the game When they reached the field the first words that fell on mister Pickwick s ear made him start This way capital fun glorious day make yourself at home glad to see you very It was Jingle still clad in his faded green coat He had fallen in with the visiting players and by telling wonderful tales of the games he had played in the West Indies soon convinced them he was a great cricket player Seeing him greet mister Pickwick mister Wardle thinking him a friend of his guest procured him an invitation to the dinner that followed the match There Jingle made good use of his time in eating and drinking and at midnight was heard leading with great effect the chorus We won t go home till morning Meanwhile the romantic Tupman at Dingley Dell had been free to woo the middle aged spinster This he did with such success that when evening came he and she sat together in a vine covered arbor in the garden like a pair of carefully folded kid gloves bound up in each other He had just printed a kiss on her lips when both looked up to see the fat boy perfectly motionless staring into the arbor Supper s ready said the fat boy and his look was so blank that they both concluded he must have been asleep and had seen nothing It was long past midnight when a tremendous noise told that the absent ones had returned All rushed to the kitchen where Jingle s voice was heard crying Cricket dinner glorious party capital songs very good wine ma am wine mister Pickwick Snodgrass and Winkle went to bed but the talkative Jingle remained with the ladies and before they retired had made Tupman almost mad with jealousy by his attentions to the spinster aunt who showed herself greatly pleased with his politeness Now the fat boy for once in his life had not been asleep when he had announced supper that evening He had seen Tupman s love making and took the first occasion to tell the deaf old lady as she sat in the garden arbor next morning He was obliged to shout it in her ear and thus the whole story was overheard by Jingle who happened to be near The deceitful Jingle saw in this a chance to benefit himself The spinster he thought had money what could he better do than turn her against Tupman and marry her himself With this plan he went to Tupman recited what the fat boy had told and advised him for a time in order to throw off the suspicions of the old lady and of mister Wardle to pay special attention to one of the younger daughters and to pretend to care nothing for the spinster He told Tupman that the latter herself had made this plan and wished him to carry it out for her sake Tupman thinking it the wish of his lady love did this with such success that the old lady concluded the fat boy must have been dreaming The spinster however thought Tupman false and Jingle used the next few days to make such violent love to her that the silly creature believed him forgot Tupman and agreed to run away with the deceiver to London There was great excitement when their absence was discovered and the wrathful mister Wardle and mister Pickwick pursued them at once in a four horse chaise They rode all night and reaching London at once began to inquire at various inns to find a trace of the runaway pair They came at length to one called The White Hart in whose courtyard a round faced man servant was cleaning boots This servant whose name was Sam Weller wore a coat with blue glass buttons a bright red handkerchief tied around his neck and an old white hat stuck on the side of his head He spoke with a quaint country accent but he was a witty fellow with a clever answer for every one Werry well I m agreeable he said when mister Pickwick gave him a gold piece What the devil do you want with me as the man said when he see the ghost With Sam Weller s aid they soon found that Jingle and the spinster were there and entered the room in which the couple sat at the very moment Jingle was showing the marriage license which he had just brought The spinster at once went into violent hysterics and Jingle seeing the game was up accepted the sum of money which mister Wardle offered him to take himself off There were deep lamentations when the confiding spinster found herself deserted by the faithless Jingle and slowly and sadly mister Pickwick and mister Wardle bore her back to Dingley Dell The heartbroken Tupman had already left there and with feelings of gloom mister Pickwick with Snodgrass and Winkle also departed III mister PICKWICK HAS AN INTERESTING SCENE WITH missus BARDELL HIS HOUSEKEEPER FURTHER PURSUIT OF JINGLE LEADS TO AN ADVENTURE AT A YOUNG LADIES BOARDING SCHOOL mister Pickwick lived in lodgings let for a single gentleman in the house of a missus Bardell a widow with one little boy For a long time she had secretly adored her benevolent lodger as some one far above her own humble station mister Pickwick had not forgotten Sam Weller the servant who had aided in the pursuit of Jingle and on returning to London he wrote asking Sam to come to see him intending to offer him a position as body servant Sam came promptly and mister Pickwick then proceeded to tell his landlady of his plan a more or less delicate matter since it would cause some change in her household affairs missus Bardell said he do you think it a much greater expense to keep two people than one La mister Pickwick answered missus Bardell fancying she saw matrimony in his eye That depends on whether it s a saving person Very true said mister Pickwick but the person I have in my eye here he looked at missus Bardell has this quality And to tell you the truth I have made up my mind missus Bardell blushed to her cap border Her lodger was going to propose Oh mister Pickwick she said you re very kind sir I m sure I ought to be a very happy woman It ll save you a deal of trouble mister Pickwick went on and when I m in town you ll always have somebody to sit with you Oh you dear said missus Bardell mister Pickwick started Oh you kind good playful dear said missus Bardell and flung herself on his neck with a cataract of tears The astonished mister Pickwick struggled violently pleading and reproving but in vain missus Bardell clung the tighter and exclaiming frantically that she would never leave him fainted away in his arms At the same moment Tupman Winkle and Snodgrass entered the room mister Pickwick tried to explain but in their faces he read that they suspected him of making love to the widow This reflection made him miserable and ill at ease He lost no time in taking Sam Weller into his service on condition that he travel with the Pickwickians in their further search for adventures and at once proposed to his three comrades another journey Next day therefore found them on the road for Eatanswill a town near London which was then on the eve of a political election This was a very exciting struggle and interested them greatly Here one morning soon after their arrival a fancy dress breakfast was given by missus Leo Hunter a lady who had once written an Ode to an Expiring Frog and who made a great point of knowing everybody who was at all celebrated for anything All of the Pickwickians attended the breakfast mister Pickwick s dignity was too great for him to don a fancy costume but the rest wore them Tupman going as a bandit in a green velvet coat with a two inch tail missus Leo Hunter herself in the character of Minerva insisted on presenting mister Pickwick to all the guests In the midst of the gaiety missus Leo Hunter s husband called out My dear here comes mister Fitz Marshall and to his astonishment mister Pickwick heard a well known voice exclaiming Coming my dear ma am crowds of people full room hard work very It was Jingle mister Pickwick indignantly faced him but the impostor at the first glance turned and fled mister Pickwick after hurriedly questioning his hostess who told him mister Fitz Marshall lived at an inn in a village not far away left the entertainment instantly bent on pursuit With Sam Weller his faithful servant he took the next stage coach and nightfall found him lodged in a room in that very inn while Sam set himself to discover Jingle s whereabouts With the money mister Wardle had paid him Jingle had set up as a gentleman he even had a servant a sneaking fellow with a sallow solemn face and lank hair named Job Trotter who could burst into tears whenever it suited his purpose and whose favorite occupation seemed to be reading a hymn book Sam Weller soon picked an acquaintance with Job and it was not long before the latter confided to him that Jingle his master whom he pretended to think very wicked had plotted to run away that same night with a beautiful young lady from a boarding school just outside the village at which he was a frequent caller Job said his master was such a villain that he had made up his mind to betray him Sam took Job to mister Pickwick to whom he repeated his tale adding that he and his master were to be let into the school building at ten o clock and that if mister Pickwick would climb over the garden wall and tap on the kitchen door a little before midnight he Job would let him in to catch Jingle in the very act of eloping This seemed to mister Pickwick a good plan and he proceeded to act upon it In good time that night Sam hoisted him over the high garden wall of the school after which he returned to the inn while his master stealthily approached the building It was very still When the church chimes struck half past eleven mister Pickwick tapped on the door Instead of being opened by Job however a servant girl appeared with a candle mister Pickwick had presence of mind enough to hide behind the door as she opened it She concluded the noise must have been the cat mister Pickwick did not know what was best to do To make matters worse a thunder storm broke and he had no refuge from the rain He was thoroughly drenched before he dared repeat the signal This time windows were thrown open and frightened voices demanded Who s there mister Pickwick was in a dreadful situation He could not retreat and when the door was timidly opened and some one screamed A man there was a dreadful chorus of shrieks from the lady principal three teachers five female servants and thirty young lady boarders all half dressed and in a forest of curl papers mister Pickwick was desperate He protested that he was no robber that he would even consent to be tied or locked up only to convince them A closet stood in the hall as a pledge of good faith he stepped inside it Its door was quickly locked and only then the trembling principal consented to listen to him By the time he had told his story he knew that he had been cruelly hoaxed by Jingle and Job Trotter She knew not even the name of mister Fitz Marshall For her own part she was certain mister Pickwick was crazy and he had to stay in the stuffy closet over an hour while at his request some one was sent to find Sam Weller The latter came at length bringing with him old mister Wardle who as it happened unknown to mister Pickwick was stopping at the inn Explanations were made and mister Pickwick choking with wrath returned to the inn to find Jingle and his servant gone and to be himself for some time thereafter a prey to rheumatism A serious matter at this juncture called mister Pickwick home This was a legal summons notifying him that missus Bardell his landlady had brought a suit for damages against him claiming he had promised to marry her and had then run away A firm of tricky lawyers had persuaded her to this in the hope of getting some money out of it themselves mister Pickwick was very angry but there was nothing for it but to hire a lawyer so he and Sam Weller set out without delay IV SAM WELLER MEETS HIS FATHER AND THE PURSUIT OF JINGLE IS CONTINUED mister PICKWICK MAKES A STRANGE CALL ON A MIDDLE AGED LADY IN YELLOW CURL PAPERS Having arranged this matter in London master and servant sat one evening in a public house when Sam recognized in a stout man with his face buried in a quart pot his own father old Tony Weller the stage coach driver and with great affection introduced him to mister Pickwick How s mother in law asked Sam The elder mister Weller shook his head as he replied I ve done it once too often Samivel Take example by your father my boy and be very careful o widders specially if they ve kept a public house missus Weller the second indeed was the proprietress of a public house To a shrill voice and a complaining disposition she added a dismal sort of piety which showed itself in much going to meeting in considering her husband a lost and sinful wretch and in the entertaining of a prim faced red nosed rusty old hypocrite of a preacher who sat by her fireside every evening consuming quantities of toast and pineapple rum and groaning at the depravity of her husband who declined to give money to the preacher s society for sending flannel waistcoats and colored handkerchiefs to the infant negroes of the West Indies As may be imagined Sam s father led a sorry life at home The meeting with the elder Weller proved a fortunate one for when Sam told of their experiences with Jingle and Job Trotter his father declared that he himself had driven the pair to the town of Ipswich where they were then living Nothing would satisfy mister Pickwick when he heard this but pursuit and he and Sam set out next morning by coach mister Pickwick having written to the other Pickwickians to follow him On the coach was a red haired man with an inquisitive nose and blue spectacles whose name was mister Peter Magnus and with whom since they stopped at the same inn mister Pickwick dined on his arrival mister Magnus before they parted for the night grew confidential and informed him that he had come there to propose to a lady who was in the inn at that very moment For some time after he retired mister Pickwick sat in his bedroom thinking At length he rose to undress when he remembered he had left his watch down stairs and taking a candle he went to get it He found it easily but to retrace his steps proved more difficult A dozen doors he thought his own and a dozen times he turned a door knob only to hear a gruff voice within At last he found what he thought was his own room the door ajar The wind had blown out his candle but the fire was bright and mister Pickwick as he retired behind the bed curtains to undress smiled till he almost cracked his nightcap strings as he thought of his wanderings Suddenly the smile faded some one had entered the room and locked the door Robbers thought mister Pickwick He peered out between the curtains and almost fainted with horror Standing before the mirror was a middle aged lady in yellow curl papers brushing her back hair Bless my soul thought mister Pickwick I must be in the wrong room This is fearful He waited a while then coughed first gently then more loudly Gracious Heaven said the middle aged lady What s that It s it s only a gentleman ma am said mister Pickwick A strange man exclaimed the lady with a terrific scream mister Pickwick put out his head in desperation Wretch she said covering her face with her hands What do you want here Nothing ma am nothing whatever ma am said mister Pickwick earnestly I am almost ready to sink ma am beneath the confusion of addressing a lady in my nightcap here the lady snatched off hers but I can t get it off ma am here mister Pickwick gave it a tremendous tug It is evident to me now that I have mistaken this bedroom for my own If this be true said the lady sobbing violently you will leave it instantly Certainly ma am answered mister Pickwick appearing I I am very sorry ma am The lady pointed to the door With his hat on over his nightcap his shoes in his hand and his coat over his arm mister Pickwick opened the door dropping both shoes with a crash I trust ma am he resumed bowing very low that my unblemished character but before he could finish the sentence the lady had thrust him into the hall and bolted the door Luckily mister Pickwick met coming along the corridor the faithful Sam Weller who took him safely to his room V THE PICKWICKIANS FIND THEMSELVES IN THE GRASP OF THE LAW THE FINAL EXPOSURE OF JINGLE AND A CHRISTMAS MERRYMAKING mister Pickwick was still indoors next morning when Sam strolling through the town met coming from a certain garden gate the wily Job Trotter Job tried at first to disguise himself by making a horrible face but Sam was not to be deceived and finding this trick vain the other burst into tears of joy to see him Job told Sam that his master Jingle had bribed the mistress of the boarding school to deny to mister Pickwick that she knew him and had then cruelly deserted the beautiful young lady for a richer one But this time Sam was too wise to believe anything Job said Meanwhile in the inn mister Pickwick was giving mister Peter Magnus some good advice as to the best method of proposing The latter finally plucked up his courage saw the lady proposed to her and was accepted In his gratitude he insisted on taking mister Pickwick to be introduced to her The instant he saw her however mister Pickwick uttered an exclamation and the lady with a slight scream hid her face in her hands She was none other than the owner of the room into which mister Pickwick had intruded the night before mister Peter Magnus in astonishment demanded where and when they had seen each other before This the lady declared she would not reveal for the world and mister Pickwick likewise refusing the other flew into a jealous rage which ended in his rushing from the room swearing he would challenge mister Pickwick to mortal combat Tupman Winkle and Snodgrass being announced at that moment mister Pickwick joined them and the middle aged lady was left alone in a state of terrible alarm The longer she thought the more terrified she became at the idea of possible bloodshed and harm to her lover At length overcome by dread and knowing no other way to stop the duel she hastened to the house of the mayor of the town a pompous magistrate named Nupkins and begged him to stop the duel Not wishing to make trouble for mister Peter Magnus she declared that the two rioters who threatened to disturb the peace of the town were named Pickwick and Tupman these two Nupkins thinking them cutthroats from London at once sent men to arrest mister Pickwick was just telling his followers the story of his mishap of the night before when a half dozen officers burst into the room Boiling with indignation mister Pickwick had to submit and the officers put him and Tupman into an old sedan chair and carried them off followed by Winkle and Snodgrass and by all the town loafers Sam Weller met the procession and tried to rescue them but was knocked down and taken prisoner also So they were all brought to Nupkins s house The mayor refused to hear a word mister Pickwick said and was about to send them all to jail as desperate characters when Sam Weller called his master aside and whispered to him that the house they were in was the very one from which he had seen Job Trotter come and from this fact he guessed that Jingle himself had wormed himself into the good graces of the mayor At this mister Pickwick asked to have a private talk with Nupkins This was grudgingly granted and in a few moments mister Pickwick had learned that Jingle calling himself Captain Fitz Marshall had imposed so well on the pompous mayor that the latter s wife and daughter had introduced him everywhere and he himself had boasted to everybody of his acquaintance It was Nupkins s turn to feel humble when mister Pickwick told him Jingle s real character He was terribly afraid the story would get out and that the town would laugh at him so he became all at once tremendously polite declared their arrest had been all a mistake and begged the Pickwickians to make themselves at home Sam Weller was sent down to the kitchen to get his dinner where he met a pretty housemaid named Mary with whom he proceeded to fall very much in love for the first time in his life Jingle and Job walked into the trap a little later not expecting the kind of reception they were to find there But even before the combined scorn of Nupkins missus Nupkins Miss Nupkins and the Pickwickians Jingle showed a brazen front He knew pride would prevent the mayor from exposing him and when finally shown the door he left with a mocking jeer followed by the chuckling Job In spite of his own troubles mister Pickwick left Ipswich comforted by the defeat of Jingle As for Sam he kissed the pretty housemaid behind the door and they parted with mutual regrets To atone for these difficult adventures the Pickwickians prepared for a long visit to Dingley Dell where they spent an old fashioned Merry Christmas where they found the fat boy even fatter and mister Wardle even jollier where Tupman was not saddened by the sight of his lost love the spinster aunt who had been sent to live with another relative where Snodgrass came more than ever to admire Emily the pretty daughter where Winkle fell head over ears in love with a black eyed young lady visitor named Arabella Allen who wore a nice little pair of boots with fur around the top where they went skating and mister Pickwick broke through and had to be carried home and put to bed where they hung mistletoe and told stories and altogether enjoyed themselves in a hundred ways Ben Allen Arabella s brother reached Dingley Dell on Christmas Day a thick set mildewy young man with short black hair a long white face and spectacles He was a medical student and brought with him his chum Bob Sawyer a slovenly smart swaggering young gentleman who smelled strongly of tobacco smoke and looked like a dissipated Robinson Crusoe Ben intended that his chum should marry his sister Arabella and Bob Sawyer paid her so much attention that Winkle began to hate him on the spot The Christmas merrymaking was all too soon over and as missus Bardell s lawsuit against mister Pickwick was shortly to be tried the Pickwickians returned regretfully to the city VI THE CELEBRATED CASE OF BARBELL AGAINST PICKWICK SERGEANT BUZFUZ S SPEECH AND AN UNEXPECTED VERDICT On the morning of the trial mister Pickwick went to court certain that the outcome would be in his favor The room was full of people and all the Pickwickians were there when he arrived The Judge was a very short man so plump that he seemed all face and waistcoat When he had rolled in upon two little turned legs and sat down at his desk all you could see of him was two little eyes one broad pink face and about half of a comical big wig Scarcely had the jurors taken their seats when missus Bardell s lawyers brought in the lady herself half hysterical and supported by two tearful lady friends The ushers called for silence and the trial began The lawyer who spoke for missus Bardell was named Sergeant Buzfuz a blustering man with a fat body and a red face He began by picturing mister Pickwick s housekeeper as a lonely widow who had been heartlessly deceived by the villainy of her lodger He declared that for two years missus Bardell had attended to mister Pickwick s comforts that once he had patted her little boy on the head and asked him how he would like to have another father that he had also asked her to marry him and on the same day had been seen by three of his friends holding her in his arms and soothing her agitation Drawing forth two scraps of paper Sergeant Buzfuz went on Gentlemen one word more Two letters have passed between these parties which speak volumes They are not open fervent letters of affection They are sly underhanded communications evidently intended by Pickwick to mislead and delude any one into whose hands they might fall Let me read the first Dear missus B Chops and tomato Sauce Yours Pickwick Gentlemen what does this mean Chops Gracious Heavens and Tomato Sauce Gentlemen is the happiness of a trusting female to be trifled away by such shallow tricks The next has no date Dear missus B I shall not be at home till to morrow And then follows this remarkable expression Don t trouble yourself about the warming pan The warming pan Why is missus Bardell begged not to trouble herself about this warming pan unless as is no doubt the case it is a mere substitute for some endearing word or promise cunningly used by Pickwick with a view to his intended desertion But enough of this gentlemen It is hard to smile with an aching heart My client s hopes are ruined All is gloom in the house the child s sports are forgotten while his mother weeps But Pickwick gentlemen Pickwick the pitiless destroyer Pickwick who comes before you to day with his heartless tomato sauce and warming pans Pickwick still rears his head and gazes without a sigh on the ruins he has made Damages gentlemen heavy damages is the only punishment with which you can visit him And for these damages my client now appeals to a high minded a right feeling a sympathizing jury of her countrymen With this Sergeant Buzfuz stopped and began to call his witnesses The first was one of missus Bardell s female cronies whose testimony of course was all in her favor Then Winkle was called Knowing that he was a friend of mister Pickwick s missus Bardell s lawyers browbeat and puzzled him till poor mister Winkle had the air of a disconcerted pickpocket and was in a terrible state of confusion He was soon made to tell how with Tupman and Snodgrass he had come into mister Pickwick s lodgings one day to find him holding missus Bardell in his arms The other two Pickwickians were also compelled to testify to this Nor was this all Sergeant Buzfuz finally entrapped the agonized Winkle into telling how mister Pickwick had been found at night in the wrong room at the Ipswich Inn and how as a result a lady s marriage had been broken off and the whole party arrested and taken before the mayor Poor Winkle was obliged to tell this though he knew it would hurt the case of mister Pickwick When he was released he rushed away to the nearest inn where he was found some hours later by the waiter groaning dismally with his head under the sofa cushions mister Pickwick s case looked black The only comfort he received was from the testimony of Sam Weller who tried to do missus Bardell s side all possible harm yet say as little about his master as he could and who kept the court room in a roar of laughter with his sallies Do you mean to tell me mister Weller said Sergeant Buzfuz finally that you saw nothing of missus Bardell s fainting in the arms of mister Pickwick Have you a pair of eyes mister Weller Yes I have a pair of eyes replied Sam and that s just it If they was a pair o patent double million magnifyin gas miscroscopes of hextra power p r aps I might be able to see through a flight o stairs and a deal door but bein only eyes you see my wision s limited Sergeant Buzfuz could make nothing out of Sam and so the case for missus Bardell closed mister Pickwick s lawyer made a long speech in his favor but it was of no use The evidence seemed all against him The jury found him guilty of breach of promise of marriage and sentenced him to pay missus Bardell her damages mister Pickwick was speechless with indignation He vowed that not one penny would he ever pay if he spent the rest of his life in a jail His own lawyer warned him that if he did not pay within two months missus Bardell s lawyers could put him into the debtors prison but mister Pickwick prepared to start on another excursion with his three friends still declaring that he would never pay VII WINKLE HAS AN EXCITING ADVENTURE WITH mister DOWLER AND WITH THE AID OF mister PICKWICK AND SAM WELLER DISCOVERS THE WHEREABOUTS OF MISS ARABELLA ALLEN At Bath a resort very popular with people of fashion the Pickwickians decided to spend the next two months and started by coach at once accompanied by Sam Weller On the coach they fell in with a fierce looking abrupt gentleman named Dowler with a bald glossy forehead and large black whiskers who introduced them to the society of Bath particularly to mister Angelo Cyrus Bantam master of ceremonies at the famous Assembly Room where the fashionable balls were held mister Bantam carried a gold eye glass a gold snuff box gold rings on his finger a gold watch in his waistcoat pocket a gold chain and an ebony cane with a gold head His linen was the whitest his wig the blackest and his teeth were so fine that it was hard to tell the real ones from the false ones mister Bantam made the Pickwickians welcome and in three days time they were settled in a fine house where mister and missus Dowler also lodged mister Pickwick passed his days in drinking the spring water for which Bath was famous and in walking his evenings he spent at the Assembly balls at the theater or in making entries in his journal One evening missus Dowler was carried off to a party in her sedan chair leaving her husband to sit up for her The Pickwickians had long since gone to bed and mister Dowler fell fast asleep while he waited It was a very windy night and the sedan carriers who brought the lady home knocked in vain at the door mister Dowler did not wake though they knocked like an insane postman At length Winkle in his own room was roused by the racket He donned slippers and dressing gown hurried down stairs half asleep and opened the door At the glare of the torches he jumped to the conclusion that the house was on fire and rushed outside when the door blew shut behind him Seeing a lady s face at the window of the sedan chair he turned and knocked at the door frantically but with no response He was undressed and the wind blew his dressing gown in a most unpleasant manner There are people coming down the street now There are ladies with em cover me up with something Stand before me roared Winkle but the chairmen only laughed The ladies were nearer and in desperation he bolted into the sedan chair where missus Dowler was Now mister Dowler a moment before had bounced off the bed and now threw open the window just in time to see this He thought his wife was running away with another man and seizing a supper knife the indignant husband tore into the street shouting furiously Winkle hearing his horrible threats did not wait He leaped out of the sedan chair and took to his heels hotly pursued by Dowler He dodged his pursuer at length rushed back slammed the door in Dowler s face gained his bedroom barricaded his door with furniture and packed his belongings At the first streak of dawn he slipped out and took coach for Bristol mister Pickwick was greatly vexed over Winkle s unheroic flight Sam Weller soon discovered where he had gone and mister Pickwick sent him after the fugitive bidding him find Winkle and either compel him to return or keep him in sight until mister Pickwick himself could follow Winkle meanwhile walking about the Bristol streets chanced to stop at a doctor s office to make some inquiries and in a young medical gentleman in green spectacles recognized to his huge surprise Bob Sawyer the bosom friend of Ben Allen both of whom he had met on Christmas Day at Dingley Dell Bob in delight dragged Winkle into the back room where sat Ben Allen amusing himself by boring holes in the chimney piece with a red hot poker The precious couple had in fact set up shop together and were using every trick they knew to make people think them great doctors with a tremendous practice They insisted on Winkle s staying to supper and it was lucky he did so for he heard news of Arabella the pretty girl who had worn the little boots with fur around the top at Dingley Dell and with whom he had fallen in love He learned that Arabella had scorned the sprightly Bob Sawyer and that her brother in anger had taken her away from mister Wardle s and put her in the house of an old aunt a dull close place not far from Bristol Before he bade them good night Winkle had determined to find her He met with a shock on returning to his inn to come suddenly upon Dowler sitting in the coffee room Winkle drew back very pale and was greatly surprised to see the bloodthirsty Dowler do likewise as growing even paler than Winkle he began an apology for his action of the evening before As a matter of fact Dowler had run away from Bath too at dawn in fear of Winkle and thought now the latter had pursued him Winkle suspecting this put on a look of great fierceness but accepted the apology and the pair shook hands Winkle s plan for finding Arabella Allen met now with a set back Sam Weller arrived at midnight and insisted that Winkle be waked at once Once in his room Sam told him mister Pickwick s instructions and declared he would not leave his sight till Winkle came back with him to Bath This was awkward but luckily mister Pickwick himself to whom Sam wrote arrived next day and released his follower mister Pickwick approved of Winkle s determination to find the pretty Arabella and so the next morning Sam Weller was sent on a voyage of discovery among the servants of the town For many hours Sam searched in vain without a clue In the afternoon he sat in a lane running between rows of gardens in one of the suburbs when a gate opened and a maid servant came out to shake some carpets Sam gallantly rose to help her when she uttered a half suppressed scream It was Mary the good looking housemaid whom Sam had kissed at the house of Nupkins the mayor of Ipswich on the day of the arrest of the Pickwickians and the exposure of Jingle She had left her place there for this new situation When Sam had finished his gallant speeches and Mary her blushing he told her of Winkle s search What was his surprise when she told him that Arabella was living the very next door She let Sam come into the garden and presently when Arabella came out to walk he scrambled on to the wall and pleaded Winkle s cause Ve thought ve should ha been obliged to straitveskit him last night he declared He s been a ravin all day and he says if he can t see you afore to morrow night s over he vishes he may be somethin unpleasanted if he don t drownd hisself Arabella in great distress at this prospect promised she would be in the garden next evening and Sam returned with the news to mister Pickwick and Winkle The next evening all three set out for the spot Mary let them into the garden and while Winkle climbed the wall to throw himself at Arabella s feet mister Pickwick kept guard at the gate with a dark lantern So far he threw its beam that a scientific gentleman who lived a few houses away seeing the light from his window took it for some new and wonderful freak of electricity and came out to investigate Before he arrived however Winkle had scrambled back over the wall and Arabella had run into the house Seeing the scientific gentleman s head poked out of a garden gate as they passed Sam gave it a gentle tap with his fist and then hoisting mister Pickwick on his back and followed by Winkle he ran off at full speed leaving the scientific gentleman to go back to his room and write a long article about the wonderful light and to tell how he had received a shock of electricity which left him stunned for a quarter of an hour afterward The Pickwickians stay at Bath came to an end soon after this adventure and their leader with Sam Weller returned to London VIII mister PICKWICK S EXPERIENCES IN THE DEBTORS PRISON WHERE HE FINDS AN OLD ENEMY AND HEAPS COALS OF FIRE ON THE HEAD OF missus BARDELL mister Pickwick had not been long in London when his lawyer s warning proved too true One morning a bailiff forced his way to his bedroom and since he had not paid the damages to missus Bardell arrested him in bed waited till he was dressed and carried him off to the debtors prison The prison was called The Fleet It was a gloomy building with a heavy gate guarded by a turnkey holding all classes from laboring men to broken down spendthrifts Its filthy galleries and low coffee room reeked with tobacco smoke and its open court was noisy with the oaths of card players In some of the rooms lived men with their wives and whole families of children and mister Pickwick found he would have to pay extra even to have a room to himself Caged with this coarse vulgar crowd mister Pickwick suffered greatly but no idea of paying the unjust damages entered his mind Instead he busied himself with wandering about the prison and learning all he could of its customs and inmates Those who like himself had money were well treated Those who had none lived in starvation and wretchedness In one wall was a kind of iron cage within which was posted a lean and hungry prisoner who rattled a money box and called out Remember the poor debtors The money he collected from passers by in the street was divided and bought food for the poorest As mister Pickwick entered the room given over to the latter class he started In one of its occupants clad in tattered garments and yellow shirt pinched with starvation and pale with illness he saw Alfred Jingle and near him faithful still in rags and dirt was Job Trotter Jingle was no longer jaunty and impudent He had pawned all his belongings had lived in fact for the last week on a silk umbrella with an ivory handle His smile now was a mere twitch of the face as he said Nothing soon starve die workhouse funeral serve him right all over drop the curtain Unable however to keep up this make believe recklessness Jingle sat down at length and sobbed like a child mister Pickwick was greatly moved at the sight and gave Job some money for his master as he turned away Sam Weller had come with mister Pickwick to the prison The latter however told his servant he must now leave him though his wages would go on as usual Sam pretended to agree but lost no time in going to his father with a plan by which he too should be sent to the Fleet Prison for debt so as to be near his master He borrowed some money from the old stage driver and then when he refused to pay it his father had him arrested and sent to the prison as he wished Old Tony Weller and all his friends went with him and gave him three tremendous cheers at the door When mister Pickwick saw Sam return and learned what he had done he was much affected at the devotion of this faithful servant and felt himself more fond of him than ever It was a long time before Winkle Tupman and Snodgrass learned of their leader s imprisonment and came to see him Sam also had visitors in the person of his mother in law who of course did not know he had brought about his own arrest and the hypocritical red nosed preacher who came with her to lecture him on his evil ways Old Tony Weller came too with a plan that he had thought of for mister Pickwick s escape in a piano It ll hold him easy he whispered with his hat and shoes on and breathe through the legs vich is holler Have a passage ready taken for Mericker The Merikin gov ment will never give him up when they finds as he s got money to spend Sammy Let him stop there till missus Bardell s dead then let him come back and write a book about the Merikins as ll pay all his expenses and more if he blows em up enough But mister Pickwick did not avail himself of this plan to escape to America Day by day he wandered about the prison learning its tales of misery and hopelessness till his head and his heart ached and he could bear no more For three months he remained there shut up all day stealing from his room only at night and no entreaties would induce him to pay the money which was keeping him a prisoner missus Bardell s lawyers meanwhile grew impatient They had not been paid even the costs of the trial and these missus Bardell had agreed to pay if they won the suit As mister Pickwick had not paid the damages however she had no money and so the lawyers at last had her arrested and she too was sent to the Fleet Prison After a few hours there missus Bardell was willing to do anything to escape and she agreed if mister Pickwick paid the costs to release him from the damages mister Pickwick was still so indignant that he would possibly not have consented but at this juncture Winkle entered leading by the hand the beautiful girl who had been Arabella Allen but whom he introduced now as missus Winkle He had run away with her from the old aunt s house with the help of Mary the pretty housemaid and they had been married without the knowledge of Winkle s father They had come to mister Pickwick to beg him to go and plead with old mister Winkle for forgiveness Arabella s tears and Winkle s plight proved too much for mister Pickwick s resolution He paid missus Bardell s costs and left Fleet Prison that very day with Sam Weller whose father of course immediately released him also IX SNODGRASS GETS INTO DIFFICULTIES BUT WINS HIS LADY LOVE THE ADVENTURES OF THE PICKWICKIANS COME TO AN END mister Pickwick journeyed first to Bristol to break the news of Arabella s marriage to her brother Ben Allen The latter was angry at first but finally he and Bob Sawyer shook hands with the visitor and agreed to treasure no ill feeling Both the young gentlemen insisted on going with mister Pickwick to the Winkle homestead a circumstance which did not make that visit an easy one Arabella s brother went fast asleep in the parlor while they waited and when Bob Sawyer pinched him as the old gentleman entered he awoke with a shriek without the least idea where he was This was most embarrassing to mister Pickwick but he said all he could for Winkle The old gentleman however would send no message to his son and mister Pickwick and Sam Weller returned with disappointment In London Sam found a letter awaiting him from his father His mother in law was dead and the public house and its earnings were now the old stage driver s Sam went to see old Tony and found him terrified All the widows in town were setting their caps for him and he was afraid one of them would succeed in marrying him He had determined to sell out the business give the money to mister Pickwick to invest for him and keep to stage driving so as to be safe While Sam sat with his father talking matters over the red nosed preacher came sidling in to inquire whether missus Weller s will had not left some money for him He felt so much at home that he went to the cupboard and poured himself out a big tumbler of his favorite pineapple rum This was more than old Tony Weller could stand He fell upon the old hypocrite kicked him through the door and ducked him in the horse trough mister Pickwick meanwhile had been arranging to buy the release of Jingle and Job Trotter and to send them to the West Indies where they might have a chance to make an honest living While he was attending to this at his lawyer s a prolonged knock came at the door It was Joe mister Wardle s fat boy erect but gone fast asleep between his knocks mister Wardle came up from his carriage delighted to see his old friend of whose imprisonment he had just heard He told mister Pickwick that his daughter Emily had fallen in love with Snodgrass and that discovering it he had brought her to London to ask the advice of mister Pickwick in the matter While they talked he sent the fat boy back to the inn to tell Emily that mister Pickwick would dine there with them The fat boy went on this errand and coming suddenly into the inn sitting room discovered Emily with her waist encircled with Snodgrass s arm while Arabella and her pretty housemaid were obligingly looking out of the window There was but one thing to do they bribed the fat boy not to tell Snodgrass unluckily stayed too long As he was leaving he heard mister Wardle with mister Pickwick and Winkle coming up the stair He was obliged to retreat and took refuge in mister Wardle s bedroom from which there was no escape save through the dining room The dinner hour was a painful one to Emily for the fat boy s secret kept him awake and he winked at her and at Arabella so often that mister Wardle noticed it The latter sent him into the bedroom finally for his snuff box and he came out very pale mister Snodgrass having seized him there and begged him to tell some one secretly to release him Accordingly the fat boy made desperate efforts to attract mister Pickwick s attention first by making faces at him when he thought no one else was looking and finally by running a pin into his leg But this did not have the desired results mister Pickwick concluded he was crazy and mister Wardle was about to have him taken down stairs when into the confusion with a very red face walked Snodgrass out of the bedroom He explained his presence there declared his love for Emily was forgiven on the spot and joined the dinner The happiness of all was complete when old mister Winkle arrived having made up his mind to see his son s wife and judge for himself and found Arabella so sweet that he kissed her and forgave Winkle on the instant Thus the last adventure of the Pickwickians ended happily mister Pickwick had seen before this that the marriage of his companions would change his own life He withdrew his name from the Pickwick Club which thereupon went to pieces and purchased a house near London for the entertainment of his friends and there a few days later Snodgrass and Emily were married in the presence of mister Wardle and all the Pickwickians After the wedding Snodgrass bought a farm near Dingley Dell where with Emily he lived many years and was always accounted a great poet on account of his pensive and absent minded manner Winkle with Arabella settled a half mile from mister Pickwick Tupman never again fell in love though for years his romantic air made him the admiration of numerous single ladies of the neighborhood Ben Allen and Bob Sawyer went to India as surgeons where after having had yellow fever fourteen times they became teetotalers and thereafter did well missus Bardell continued to let lodgings to single gentlemen but never had another breach of promise suit Old Tony Weller finally gave up business and retired to live on the interest of the money mister Pickwick had invested for him having to the end of his life a great dislike for widows His son Sam remaining faithful to his master mister Pickwick at length made Mary the pretty maid his housekeeper on condition that she marry Sam which she did at once mister Pickwick lived happily occupied in writing his adventures and in acting as godfather to the children of Snodgrass and Winkle He never regretted what he had done for Jingle and Job Trotter who became in time worthy members of society He was a favorite with all and the children loved him Every year he went to mister Wardle s to a large merrymaking attended by his faithful Sam Weller between whom and his master there was a regard that nothing but death could end LITTLE DORRIT Published

London a young man named Clennam He was an orphan and was brought up by a stern uncle who crushed and repressed his youth and finally forced him to marry a cold unfeeling stubborn woman whom he did not in the least love Some time before this marriage the nephew had met a beautiful young woman also an orphan whom a rich man named Dorrit was educating to be a singer since she had a remarkable voice Clennam had fallen in love with her and had persuaded her to give him all her love in return There had even been a kind of ceremony of marriage between them But they were both very poor and could not really marry for fear of the anger of Clennam s cruel uncle who finally compelled his nephew to marry the other woman whom he had picked out for him And the singer because she loved him and could not bear to see him made a beggar gave him up So Clennam married one woman while loving another and this as all wrong things must do resulted in unhappiness for them both The singer had given him a little silk watch paper worked in beads with the initials D N F These letters stood for the words Do Not Forget The wife saw the paper with her husband s watch in his secret drawer and wondered what it meant One day she found an old letter that had passed between her husband and the singer which explained the initials and betrayed the secret of their love She was hard and unforgiving Though she had never loved Clennam herself her anger was terrible She went to the singer and under threat of for ever disgracing her in the eyes of the world she made her give up to her her baby boy Arthur to rear as her own She promised in return that the little Arthur should be provided for and should never know the real history of his parentage She also compelled her husband and the singer to take an oath that neither would ever see or communicate with the other again missus Clennam in taking this terrible revenge cheated herself into believing that she was only the instrument of God carrying out His will and punishment But in reality she was satisfying the rage and hatred of her own heart Year by year she nursed this rage in the gloomy house in which Clennam lived and where he carried on the London branch of his business It was an old brick house separated from the street by a rusty courtyard It seemed to have once been about to slide down sidewise but had been propped up as though it leaned on some half dozen gigantic crutches Inside it was dark and miserable with sunken floors and blackened furniture In a corner of the sitting room was an ugly old clock that was wound once a week with an iron handle and on the walls were pictures showing the Plagues of Egypt The only pleasure the grim woman enjoyed was reading aloud from those parts of the Old Testament which call for dreadful punishments to fall upon all the enemies of the righteous and in these passages she gloried In this melancholy place the boy Arthur Clennam grew up in silence and in dread wondering much why they lived so lonely and why his father and mother for so he thought missus Clennam to be sat always so silent with faces turned from each other There were but two servants an old woman named Affery and Flintwinch her husband a short bald man who was both clerk and footman and who carried his head awry and walked in a one sided crab like way as though he were falling and needed propping up like the house Flintwinch was cunning and without conscience Very few secrets his mistress had which he did not know and they often quarreled At length the uncle who had compelled the unhappy marriage of Arthur s father died Feeling sorry at the last for the wretched singer whose life had been ruined he left her in his will a sum of money and another sum to the youngest niece of the man who had befriended and educated her mister Dorrit This money however missus Clennam did not intend either the woman she hated or the niece of her patron should get She hid the part of the will which referred to it and made Flintwinch who beside her husband was the only one who knew of it promise not to tell Arthur s father she compelled to sail to China to take charge of the branch of his business in that country and when Arthur was old enough she sent him there also For twenty years while Arthur stayed with his father on the other side of the world missus Clennam cold and unforgiving as ever lived on in the old tumbling house carrying on the London business with the aid of Flintwinch The poor forsaken singer lost her mind and at last died mister Dorrit of course knowing nothing about the hidden will could not claim his share and the guilty secret remained except for Arthur s unhappy father in possession of only missus Clennam and the crafty Flintwinch So the years rolled by and missus Clennam s cold gray eyes grew colder her gray hair grayer and her face more hard and stony She went out less and less and finally paralysis made her keep to her room and her chair The time came when Arthur s father lay dying with his son beside him On his death bed he did not forget the money which had never been restored He had not strength to write but with his dying hand he gave Arthur his watch making him promise to take it back to England to the wife whose anger and hatred still lived The watch still held the little paper with the bead initials that stood for Do not forget and he meant thus to remind her of the wrong which was still unrighted Many times thereafter on his way back to London Arthur thought of his father s strange manner and wondered if it could be that some wrong deed lay on his conscience This idea clung to him so that when he saw missus Clennam again on his arrival and spoke to her of his father s last hours he asked her if she thought this might be so But at this her anger rose she upbraided him and declared if he ever referred again to the subject she would renounce him as her son and cast him off for ever It was her guilty conscience of course that caused this burst of rage And yet just because it was not for the money s sake that she had done that evil act but because she so hated the woman to whom it should have been given she tried to convince herself that she had acted rightly as the instrument of God to punish wickedness She had told herself this falsehood over and over again so often that she had ended by quite believing it to be the truth Arthur said no more to her about the matter He was a man now and his father s death had made him master of a very considerable fortune He decided that he would not carry on the business but would make a new one for himself This resolution angered missus Clennam greatly but she grimly determined to carry it on herself and in Arthur s place took the wily Flintwinch as her partner and told Arthur coldly to go his own way II THE CHILD OF THE MARSHALSEA On the first night of his return to the house of his childhood Arthur had noticed there a little seamstress with pale transparent face hazel eyes and a figure as small as a child s She wore a spare thin dress spoke little and passed through the rooms noiselessly and shy They called her Little Dorrit She came in the morning and sewed quietly till nightfall when she vanished It had been so rare in the old days for any one to please the mistress of that gloomy house that the little creature s presence there interested Arthur greatly and he longed to know something of her history He soon found there was nothing to be learned from Flintwinch and so one night he followed Little Dorrit when she left the house To his great surprise he saw her finally enter a great bare building surrounded with spiked walls and called The Marshalsea This was a famous prison where debtors were kept In those days the law not only permitted a man to be put in jail for debt but compelled him to stay there till all he owed was paid a strange custom since while he was in jail he was unable to earn any money to pay with In fact in many cases poor debtors had to stay there all their lives Inside the walls of the Marshalsea the wives and children of unfortunate prisoners were allowed to come to live with them just as in a boarding house or hotel but the debtors themselves could never pass out of the gate Arthur entered the prison ignorant of its rules and so stayed too long for presently the bell for closing rang the gates were shut and he had to stay inside all night This was not so pleasant but it gave him a chance easily to find out all he wished to learn of Little Dorrit s history Her father before she was born had lost all his money through a business failure and had thus been thrown into the Marshalsea There Amy or Little Dorrit as they came to call her was born there her mother had languished away and there she herself had always lived mothering her pretty frivolous sister Fanny and her lazy ne er do well brother Tip Her father had been an inmate of the prison so many years that he was called The Father of the Marshalsea From being a haughty man of wealth he had become a shabby old white haired dignitary with a soft manner who took little gifts of money which any one gave him half shame facedly and to the mortification of Little Dorrit alone The child had grown up the favorite of the turnkeys and of all the prison calling the high blank walls home When she was a little slip of a girl she had her sister and brother sent to night school for a time and later taught herself fine sewing so that at the time Arthur Clennam returned to London she was working every day outside the walls for small wages Each night she returned to the prison to prepare her father s supper bringing him whatever she could hide from her own dinner at the house where she sewed loving him devotedly through all She even had a would be lover too The son of one of the turnkeys a young man with weak legs and weak light hair soft hearted and soft headed had long pursued her in vain He was now engaged in seeking comfort for his hopeless love by composing epitaphs for his own tombstone such as Here Lie the Mortal Remains of JOHN CHIVERY Never Anything Worth Mentioning Who Died of a Broken Heart Requesting With His Last Breath that the Word AMY Might be Inscribed Over His Ashes Which Was Done by His Afflicted Parents Old mister Dorrit held his position among the Marshalsea prisoners with great fancied dignity and received all visitors and new comers in his room like a man of society at home During that evening Arthur called on him and treated the old man so courteously and talked to Little Dorrit with such kindness that she began to love him from that moment Many things of Little Dorrit s pathetic story Arthur learned that night His first surprise at finding her in the Clennam house mingled strangely with his old thought that his father on his death bed seemed to be troubled by some remorseful memory and as he slept in the gloomy prison he dreamed that the little seamstress was in some mysterious way mingled with this wrong and remorse There was more truth than fancy in this dream Not knowing the true history of his parentage and wholly ignorant of the sad life and death of the poor singer his own unhappy mother Arthur had never heard the name Dorrit He did not know to be sure that it was the name of the wealthy patron who had once educated her As a matter of fact this patron had been Little Dorrit s own uncle who now was living in poverty It was to his youngest niece that the will missus Clennam had wickedly hidden declared the money should go And as Little Dorrit was this niece it rightfully belonged to her The real reason of missus Clennam s apparent kindness to Little Dorrit was the pricking of her conscience which gave her no rest But all this Arthur could not guess Nevertheless he had gained such an interest in the little seamstress that next day he determined to find out all he could about her father s unfortunate affairs He had great difficulty in this The Government had taken charge of old mister Dorrit s debts and his affairs were in the hands of a department which some people sneeringly called the Circumlocution Office because it took so much time and talk for it to accomplish anything This department had a great many clerks every one of whom seemed to have nothing to do but to keep people from troubling them by finding out anything Arthur went to one clerk who sent him to a mister Tite Barnacle a fat pompous man with a big collar a big watch chain and stiff boots mister Barnacle treated him quite as an outsider and would give him no information whatever Then he tried another department where they said they knew nothing of the matter Still a third advised him not to bother about it So at last he had to give up quite discouraged Though he could do nothing for Little Dorrit s father Arthur did what he could for her lazy brother He paid his debts so that he was released from the Marshalsea and this kindness though Tip himself was ungrateful to the last degree endeared him still more to Little Dorrit who needed his friendship so greatly The night her brother was released she came to Arthur to thank him alone save for a half witted woman named Maggie who believed she herself was only ten years old and called Little Dorrit Little Mother and who used to go with her when she went through the streets at night Little Dorrit was dressed so thinly and looked so slight and helpless that when she left Arthur felt as if he would like to take her up in his arms and carry her home again It would have been better if he had For when they got back to the Marshalsea the prison gates had closed for the night and they had to stay out till morning They wandered in the cold street till nearly dawn then a kind hearted sexton who was opening a church let them come in and made Little Dorrit a bed of pew cushions and there she slept a while with a big church book for a pillow Arthur did not know of this adventure till long afterward for Little Dorrit would not tell him for fear he should blame himself for letting them go home alone Little Dorrit had one other valuable friend beside Arthur at this time This was a rent collector named Pancks who was really kind hearted but who was compelled to squeeze rent money out of the poor by his master The latter looked so good and benevolent that people called him The Patriarch but he was at heart a genuine skinflint for whose meanness Pancks got all the credit Pancks was a short wiry man with a scrubby chin and jet black eyes and when he walked or talked he puffed and blew and snorted like a little steam engine Little Dorrit used sometimes to go to sew at the house of The Patriarch and Pancks often saw her there One day he greatly surprised her by asking to see the palm of her hand and then he pretended to read her fortune He told her all about herself which astonished her for she did not know that he knew anything of her history and then with many mysterious puffs and winks he told her she would finally be happy After that she seemed to meet Pancks wherever she went at missus Clennam s and at the Marshalsea as well but at such meetings he would pretend not to know her Only sometimes when no one else was near he would whisper I m Pancks the gipsy fortune telling Illustration Arthur Clennam calling on Little Dorrit and her father at The Marshalsea See page two hundred sixty nine These strange actions puzzled Little Dorrit very much But she was far from guessing the truth that Pancks had for some time been interested as had Arthur Clennam in finding out how her father s affairs stood He had discovered thus accidentally that old mister Dorrit was probably the heir at law to a great estate that had lain for years forgotten unclaimed and growing larger all the time The question now was to prove this and this Pancks out of friendship for Little Dorrit was busily trying to do One day the rent collector came to Arthur to tell him that he had succeeded The proof was all found mister Dorrit s right was clear all he had to do was to sign his name to a paper and the Marshalsea gates would open and he would be free and a rich man Arthur found Little Dorrit and told her the glad tidings They made her almost faint for joy although all her rejoicing was for her father Then he put her in a carriage and drove as fast as possible with her to the prison to carry her father the great news Little Dorrit told the old man with her arms around his neck and as she clasped him thinking that she had never yet in her life known him as he had once been before his prison years she cried I shall see him as I never saw him yet my dear love with the dark cloud cleared away I shall see him as my poor mother saw him long ago O my dear my dear O father father O thank God thank God So The Father of the Marshalsea left the old prison in which he had lived so long and all the prisoners held a mass meeting and gave him a farewell address and a dinner On the last day when they drove away from the iron gates old mister Dorrit was in fine new clothing and Tip and Fanny were clad in the height of fashion Poor Little Dorrit in joy for her father and grief at parting from Arthur for they were to go abroad at once did not appear at the last moment and Arthur who had come to see them off hastening to her room found that she had fainted away He carried her gently down to the carriage and as he lifted her in he saw she had put on the same thin little dress that she had worn on the day he had first seen her So amid cheers and good wishes they drove away and Arthur as he walked back through the crowded streets somehow felt very lonely III WHAT RICHES BROUGHT TO THE DORRITS Great changes came to old mister Dorrit with his money As they traveled slowly through Switzerland and into Italy he put on greater dignity daily He lived each day suspecting that every one was in some way trying to slight him and grew very much ashamed of his past years in the Marshalsea and forbade all mention of them He hired a great number of servants and to improve the manners of Fanny and Little Dorrit he employed a woman named missus General who had many silly notions of society Little Dorrit could not even say father without being reproved by missus General Papa is preferable my dear the lady would insist and besides it gives a pretty form to the lips Papa potatoes poultry prunes and prisms are all good words for the lips You will find it serviceable in the formation of a demeanor if you say to yourself in company on entering a room for instance Papa potatoes poultry prunes and prisms Fanny and Tip were as spoiled as possible Fanny morning and night thought of nothing but wearing costly dresses and going into society and Tip did little but play cards and bet on horse races Only Little Dorrit through all kept her old sweet self unchanged Wherever they went they lived in splendid hotels In Venice the palace they occupied was six times as big as the whole Marshalsea mister Dorrit when he remembered Arthur Clennam at all spoke of him as an upstart who had intruded his presence upon them in their poverty and quickly forgot all his kindness and his efforts to help and comfort them But Little Dorrit never forgot Her present existence seemed a dream She tried to care for her father as she used to do but he was afraid people would think he had not been used to servants foolish man so she lost even the little pleasure of her old prison life in the Marshalsea There were valets and maids now to do all the little things she had once loved to do with her own hands and she seemed to be no longer of use to him She loved her father as dearly as she always had but now she had begun to feel that she could never see him as he used to be before his prison days because first poverty and now wealth had changed him The old sad shadow came over her He grew angry at her and chid her and hurt her It seemed he had entirely forgotten the old days when she slaved so for him Poor little Dorrit She was far lonelier now than she had ever been before in the debtors prison lonelier and unhappier than Arthur Clennam in London could have guessed The gay fashionable life of her brother and sister did not attract her She was timid of joining in their gaieties She asked leave only to be left alone and went about the city in a gondola in a quiet scared lost manner It often seemed to her as if the Marshalsea must be just behind the next big building or missus Clennam s house where she had first met Arthur just around the next corner And she used to look into gondolas as they passed as if she might see Arthur any minute In the days of their prison poverty Fanny had occasionally earned some money by dancing at a theater There she had met a silly chuckle headed young man the son of a missus Merdle and he had been fascinated by her beauty Now in their wealth he saw Fanny again and fell even more deeply in love with her missus Merdle was a cold hearted artificial woman who kept a parrot that was always shrieking and who thought of nothing but riches and society She would have refused to let her son marry Fanny in the old days but now it was another matter He proposed and Fanny who had been made angry a thousand times by missus Merdle s insolence and patronizing ways made up her mind to marry him if only to take her revenge on his mother missus Merdle s husband always stayed in London He was immensely rich so rich that people said everything he touched turned into gold He was a quiet dull man with dull red cheeks and cared nothing at all for society though everybody flattered and courted him When old mister Dorrit saw missus Merdle s son was in love with Fanny he was greatly pleased He had by this time grown so selfish that he considered much less her happiness than his own profit and he thought if they were married he could persuade mister Merdle to invest his own great fortune for him so that he would be even richer than he was now mister Merdle s name had been growing bigger and bigger every day Nobody believed the great man could make a mistake but that he was going to keep on getting richer and richer though nobody knew how he did it as long as he lived So before long Fanny married missus Merdle s son and went back to London to take up life in the magnificent Merdle mansion with her silly chuckle headed husband mister Merdle had got a very rich position for him in the Circumlocution Office with which Arthur Clennam had had so much trouble once on a time Old mister Dorrit went to London too and as he had schemed gave the famous mister Merdle all his fortune to invest Then he returned to Italy where in Rome his faithful and lonely Little Dorrit waited lovingly for him On the night after he reached Rome missus Merdle gave a dinner party to a large company and Little Dorrit and her father attended In the midst of the dinner he suddenly called to her across the table His voice was so loud and excited that all the guests were frightened and rose to their feet Little Dorrit ran to him and put her arms about him for she saw at once that he was not himself He began to address the company and his first words showed that his mind had failed He imagined he was still in the debtors prison and that all the rich people about him were the other poor prisoners He made them a speech welcoming them to its walls thanking them in advance for any money they might give to him as The Father of the Marshalsea And he ended by calling for the old turnkey he had known there to help him up the narrow stair to bed as he had been used to do in the prison Little Dorrit was not ashamed she loved him too much for that Her only wish was to soothe him and with a pale frightened face she begged him to come with her They got him away at last and carried him to his house Once laid on his bed he never rose from it again Nor did he regain his memory of the immediate present That with its show and its servants its riches and power in which Little Dorrit had had so small a part had faded out for ever and now his mind back in the Marshalsea recognized his daughter as his only stay and faithful comfort It was well so for this was the father she had most loved So she watched beside him day and night while every day his life grew weaker and weaker Every day the shadow of death stole deeper and deeper over his face until one morning when the dawn came they saw that he would never wake again IV WHAT HAPPENED TO ARTHUR CLENNAM Arthur meanwhile had missed Little Dorrit greatly He was very friendly with a couple named Meagles a comely healthy good humored and kind hearted pair and he was so lonely he almost thought himself in love with their daughter Pet for a while But Pet soon married a portrait painter and went to live abroad mister and missus Meagles had a little orphan maid whom they called Tattycoram for no particular reason except that her first name had been Hattie and the name of the man who founded the asylum where they found her was Coram Tattycoram had a very bad temper so that mister Meagles when he saw one of these fits coming on used to stop and say Count twenty five Tattycoram And Tattycoram would count twenty five and by that time the fit of temper was over But one day she had an attack that was very much worse than usual so much worse that she couldn t wait to count twenty five and ran away And it was a long time before they saw Tattycoram again At mister Meagles s house Arthur met an inventor named Doyce a quiet straightforward man whom he soon came to like Doyce had made a useful invention and for twelve years had been trying to bring it to the notice of the British Government But this matter too had to go through the famous Circumlocution Office and so there it had stuck just as Arthur s inquiry had done Arthur having chosen no new business as yet before long proposed a partnership between himself and Doyce The latter agreed readily and the new firm was established Soon after this Doyce went abroad on business leaving Arthur to manage the affairs All might have gone well but for the fame of mister Merdle His wealth seemed so enormous and his plans so sure that many people throughout England just as old mister Dorrit had done put their money in his care Even Pancks the rent collector did so and strongly advised Arthur to do the same Convinced by such advice Arthur was unhappily led to invest the money of the new firm in Merdle s schemes One day soon after mister Merdle whom every one had looked up to and respected killed himself and then to every one s astonishment it was found that his money was all gone that his schemes were all exploded and that the famous man who had dined and wined with the great was simply the greatest forger and the greatest thief that had ever cheated the gallows But it was too late then Arthur s firm was utterly ruined with all the rest What hurt him most was the knowledge that by using the firm s money he had ruined his honest partner Doyce In order to set the latter as near right as he could Arthur turned over every cent of his own personal fortune to pay as much of the firm s debt as it would keeping nothing of value but his clothes and his books Beside doing this he wrote out a statement declaring that he Arthur Clennam had of his own act and against his partner s express caution used the firm s money for this purpose and that he alone and not Doyce was to blame He declared also that his own share if any remained out of the wreck should go to his partner and that he himself would work as a mere clerk at as small a salary as he could live on He published this statement at once unwisely no doubt when all London was so enraged against Merdle and glad to have some one on whom to vent its madness In the public anger and excitement the generosity of his act was lost sight of A few hours later a man who had invested some of his money in Arthur s firm and thus lost it had him arrested for debt and that night he entered the dismal iron gates of the Marshalsea prison not now as a visitor but as one whom the pitiless bars locked in from liberty The turnkey took him up the old familiar staircase and into the old familiar room in which he had so often been And as he sat down in its loneliness thinking of the fair slight form that had dwelt in it so long he turned his face to the wall and sobbed aloud Oh my Little Dorrit Wherever he looked he seemed to see her and just as she herself in a foreign country found herself looking and listening for his step and voice so too it was with him In the days that followed he thought of her all the while He was too depressed and too retiring and unhappy to mingle with the other prisoners so he kept his own room and made no friends The rest disliked him and said he was proud or sullen A burning reckless mood soon added its sufferings to his dread and hatred of the place The thought grew on him that he would in the end break his heart and die there He felt that he was being stifled and at times the longing to be free made him believe he must go mad A week of this suffering found him in his bed in the grasp of a slow wasting fever He felt light headed and delirious and heard tunes playing that he knew were only in his brain One day when he had dragged himself to his chair by the window the door of his room seemed to open to a quiet figure which dropped a mantle it wore then it seemed to be Little Dorrit in her old dress and it seemed first to smile and then to burst into tears He roused himself and all at once he saw that it was no dream She was really there kneeling by him now with her tears falling on his hands and her voice crying Oh my best friend Don t let me see you weep I am your own poor child come back No one had told her he was ill for she had just returned from Italy She made the room fresh and neat sewed a white curtain for its window and sent out for grapes roast chicken and jellies and every good thing She sat by him all day smoothing his hot pillow or giving him a cooling drink Though he had been strangely blind he knew at last that she must have loved him all along And to find her great heart turned to him thus in his misfortune made him realize that during all those months in the lonely prison he had been loving her too though he had not known it A feeling of peace came to him Whenever he opened his eyes he saw her at his side the same trusting Little Dorrit that he had always known V ALL S WELL THAT ENDS WELL All the while these things were happening missus Clennam and Flintwinch had continued their grim partnership missus Clennam at last decided to burn the part of the will she had hidden so that her share in the wicked plan could never be found out Flintwinch however wishing for his own purposes to keep her in his power deceived her He cunningly put in its place a worthless piece of paper and this missus Clennam burned instead Flintwinch then locked up the real piece in an iron box with a lot of private letters that had been written by the poor crazed singer to missus Clennam begging her forgiveness The box he gave to his brother who took it to Holland with him for safe keeping But Flintwinch in this deception overreached himself There was an adventurer in Holland named Rigaud who used to drink and smoke with this brother He was an oily villain who had been in jail in France on suspicion of having murdered his wife He had shaggy dry hair streaked with red and a thick mustache and when he smiled his eyes went close together his mustache went up under his hooked nose and his nose came down over his mustache Rigaud saw the box concluded it contained something valuable and made up his mind to get it His chance came when the brother of Flintwinch died suddenly one day and he lost no time in making away with the iron box By means of the letters it contained he soon guessed the secret which missus Clennam had been for so many years at such pains to conceal and deciding that by this knowledge he could squeeze money out of her he came to London to find and threaten her But she believing she had burned the part of the will which Rigaud claimed to possess refused to listen to him until at last maddened by her refusals he searched out the Dorrits He soon discovered that the man who had educated the singer Arthur s real mother was Frederick Dorrit Little Dorrit s dead uncle and that it was Little Dorrit herself since she was his youngest niece from whom the money was now being unjustly kept Rigaud easily found Little Dorrit for she was now in the Marshalsea nursing Arthur where he lay sick and to her the cunning adventurer sent a copy of the paper in a sealed packet asking her if it was not reclaimed before the prison closed that same night to open and read it herself He then went to the Clennam house told missus Clennam and Flintwinch what he had done and demanded money at once as the price of his reclaiming the packet before Little Dorrit should learn the secret it held At this Flintwinch had to confess what he had done and missus Clennam knew that the fatal paper had not been burned after all The wretched woman seeing this sharp end to all her scheming was almost distracted She had not walked a step for twelve years but now her excitement and frenzy gave her unnatural strength She rose from her invalid chair and ran with all her speed from the house Old Affery the servant followed her mistress wringing her hands as she tried vainly to overtake her missus Clennam did not pause till she had reached the prison and found Little Dorrit She told her to open the packet at once and to read what it contained and then kneeling at her feet she promised to restore to her all she had withheld and begged her to forgive and to come back with her to tell Rigaud that she already knew the secret and that he might do his worst Little Dorrit was greatly moved to see the stern gray haired woman at her feet She raised and comforted her assuring her that come what would Arthur should never learn the truth from her lips This return of good for evil from the one she had most injured brought the tears to the hard woman s eyes God bless you she said in a broken voice Side by side they hastened back to the Clennam house but as they reached the entrance of its dark courtyard there came a sudden noise like thunder For one instant they saw the building with the insolent Rigaud waiting smoking in the window then the walls heaved surged outward opened and fell into pieces Its great pile of chimneys rocked broke and tumbled on the fragments and only a huge mass of timbers and stone with a cloud of dust hovering over it marked the spot where it had stood The rotten old building propped up so long had fallen at last For years old Affery had insisted that the house was haunted She had often heard mysterious rustlings and noises and in the mornings sometimes she would find little heaps of dust on the floors Curious crooked cracks would appear too in the walls and the doors would stick with no apparent reason These things of course had been caused by the gradual settling of the crazy walls and timbers which now finally had collapsed all at once Frightened they ran back to the street and there missus Clennam s strange strength left her and she fell in a heap upon the pavement She never from that hour was able to speak a word or move a finger She lived for three years in a wheel chair but she lived and died like a statue For two days workmen dug industriously in the ruins before they found the body of Rigaud with his head smashed to atoms beneath a huge beam They dug longer than that for the body of Flintwinch and stopped at last when they came to the conclusion that he was not there By that time however he had had a chance to get together all of the firm s money he could lay his hands on and to decamp He was never seen again in England but travelers claimed to have seen him in Holland where he lived comfortably under the name of Mynheer Von Flyntevynge which is after all about as near as one can come to saying Flintwinch in Dutch No one grieved greatly over his loss It was long before Arthur knew of these events and Little Dorrit was too happy in nursing him back to health to think much about it She was not content with this either but wrote to mister and missus Meagles who were abroad of the sick man s misfortune The former went at once in search of Doyce and brought him back to London where together they set the firm of Doyce and Clennam on its feet again and arranged to buy Arthur s liberty They did not tell Arthur anything of this however in order that they might surprise him mister Meagles for Little Dorrit s sake tried hard to find the fragment of the will which Rigaud had kept in the iron box But it was Tattycoram the little maid with the bad temper who finally found it in a lodging Rigaud had occupied and brought it to mister Meagles praying on her knees that he take her back into his service which to be sure he was very glad to do Arthur while he was slowly growing better had thought much of his condition Though Little Dorrit had begged him again and again to take her money and use it as his own he had refused telling her as gently as he could that now that she was rich and he a ruined man this could never be and that as the time had long gone by when she and the Marshalsea had anything in common they two must soon part One day however when he was well enough to sit up Little Dorrit came to his room in the prison and told him she had received a very great fortune and asked him again if he would not take it Never he told her You will not take even half of it she asked pleadingly Never dear Little Dorrit he said emphatically Then at last she laid her face on his breast crying I have nothing in the world I am as poor as when I lived here in the Marshalsea I have just found that papa gave all we had to mister Merdle and it is swept away with the rest My great fortune now is poverty because it is all you will take Oh my dearest and best are you quite sure you will not share my fortune with me now He had locked her in his arms and his tears were falling on her cheek as she said joyfully I never was rich before or proud or happy I would rather pass my life here in prison with you and work daily for my bread than to have the greatest fortune that ever was told and be the greatest lady that ever was honored But Arthur s prison life was to be short For mister Meagles and Doyce burst upon them with all the other good news at once Arthur was free the firm had been reestablished with him at its head and to morrow the debtors prison would be only a memory Next morning before they left the Marshalsea for ever Little Dorrit handed Arthur a folded paper and asked him to please her by putting it into the fire with his own hand Is it a charm he asked It is anything you like best she answered standing on tiptoe to kiss him Only say I love you as you do it He said it and the paper burned away And so the will that had been the cause of so much pain and wrong was turned to ashes Little Dorrit kept the promise she had made and Arthur never learned of the sin of which the woman he had always called his mother had been guilty Then when all good bys had been said they walked together to the very same church where Little Dorrit had slept on the cushions the night she had been locked out of the Marshalsea and there she and Arthur were married Doyce gave the bride away And among the many who came to witness the wedding were not only Pancks and Maggie the half witted woman but even a group of Little Dorrit s old turnkey friends from the prison among whom was the disconsolate Chivery who had so long solaced himself by composing epitaphs for his own tombstone and who went home to meditate over his last inscription

found not only that people bowed low and flattered him but that many of his relatives were trying by every trick to get some of his money The old man was naturally suspicious and obstinate and when he saw this he began to distrust everybody and to think the whole world selfish and deceitful He had loved most of all his grandson Martin but at length his heart became hardened to him also This was partly Martin s own fault for he was somewhat selfish but he had nevertheless a great deal of good in him And perhaps his selfishness was partly his grandfather s fault too because the latter had brought him up to believe he would inherit all his money and would sometime be very rich At last ill and grown suspicious of every one he met old Chuzzlewit gave a home to a beautiful orphan girl named Mary Graham and kept her near him as his nurse and secretary In order that she might not have any selfish interest in being kind to him he took an oath in her presence that he would not leave her a cent when he died He paid her monthly wages and it was agreed that there should be no affection shown between them In spite of his seeming harshness Mary knew his heart was naturally kind and she soon loved him as a father And he softened by her sympathy came in spite of himself to love her as a daughter It was not long before young Martin too had fallen very deeply in love with Mary He concluded too hastily however that his grandfather would not approve of his marrying her and told the old man his intentions in such a fiery way that Chuzzlewit resented it The old man accused Martin of a selfish attempt to steal from him Mary s care and at this Martin whose temper was as quick as his grandfather s flew to anger They quarreled and Martin left him declaring he would henceforth make his own way until he was able to claim Mary for his wife While he was wondering what he should do Martin saw in a newspaper the advertisement of a mister Pecksniff an architect living near Salisbury not many miles from London who wished a pupil to board and teach An architect was what Martin wanted to be and he answered the advertisement at once and accepted Pecksniff s terms Now to tell the truth Martin had another reason for this Pecksniff was his grandfather s cousin and he knew the old man thought him the worst hypocrite of all his relatives and disliked him accordingly And Martin was so angry with his grandfather that he went to Pecksniff s partly to vex him Pecksniff was just the man old Chuzzlewit thought him He was a smooth sleek hypocrite with an oily manner He had heavy eyelids and a wide whiskerless throat and when he talked he fairly oozed virtuous sayings for which people deemed him a most moral and upright man He was a widower with two daughters Charity and Mercy the older of whom had a very bitter temper which made it hard for the few students as long as they stayed there After Pecksniff had once got a pupil s money in advance he made no pretense of teaching him He kept him drawing designs for buildings and that was all If any of the designs were good he said nothing to the pupil but sold them as his own and pocketed the money His pupils soon saw through him and none of them had ever stayed long except one This one was named Tom Pinch He had been poor and mister Pecksniff had pretended to take him in at a reduced rate But really Pinch paid as much as the others beside being a clever fellow who made himself useful in a thousand ways He was a musician too and played the organ in the village church which was a credit to Pecksniff With all this Pinch was a generous open hearted lad who believed every one honest and true and he was so grateful to Pecksniff whose hypocrisy he never imagined that he was always singing his praises everywhere In return for all this Pecksniff treated him with contempt and made him quite like a servant Tom Pinch however was a favorite with every one else He had a sister Ruth who loved him dearly but he seldom saw her for she was a governess in the house of a brass and iron founder who did not like her to have company One of Tom s greatest friends had been a pupil named John Westlock who in vain had tried to open the other s eyes to Pecksniff s real character When Westlock came into his money he had left and gone to live in London and it was to take his vacant place that the new pupil Martin was now coming Another friend of Pinch s was Mark Tapley a rakish good humored fellow whose one ambition was to find a position so uncomfortable and dismal that he would get some credit for being jolly in it Tapley was an assistant at The Blue Dragon the village inn whose plump rosy landlady was so fond of him that he might have married her if he had chosen to But as Tapley said there was no credit in being jolly where he was so comfortable so he left The Blue Dragon and went off too to London With neither Westlock nor Mark Tapley there Tom Pinch was lonely and welcomed the arrival of Martin with whom he soon made friends mister Pecksniff folded his new pupil to his breast shed a crocodile tear and set him to work designing a grammar school Old Chuzzlewit soon heard where Martin his grandson was and wrote to Pecksniff asking him to meet him in London Pecksniff was so anxious to curry favor with the rich old man that taking his daughters with him he left at once for London where they put up at a boarding house kept by a missus Todgers while Pecksniff awaited the arrival of old Chuzzlewit missus Todgers s house smelled of cabbage and greens and mice and missus Todgers herself was bony and wore a row of curls on the front of her head like little barrels of flour But a number of young men boarded there and Charity and Mercy enjoyed themselves very much One whom they met on this trip to London was a remote relative of theirs a nephew of old Chuzzlewit s named Jonas Jonas s father was eighty years old and a miser and the son too was so mean and grasping that he often used to wish his father were dead so he would have his money The old father indeed would have had no friend in his own house but for an old clerk Chuffey who had been his schoolmate in boyhood and had always lived with him Chuffey was as old and dusty and rusty as if he had been put away and forgotten fifty years before and some one had just found him in a lumber closet But in his own way Chuffey loved his master Jonas called on the two Pecksniff daughters and Charity the elder determined to marry him Jonas however had his own opinion and made up his mind to marry Mercy her younger sister Before long old Chuzzlewit reached London and when Pecksniff called he told him his grandson Martin was an ingrate who had left his protection and asked the architect not to harbor him Pecksniff who worshiped the other s money and would have betrayed his best friend for old Chuzzlewit s favor returned home instantly heaped harsh names upon Martin and ordered him to leave his house at once Martin guessed what had caused Pecksniff to change his mind so suddenly and with hearty contempt for his truckling action he left that very hour in the rain though he had only a single silver piece in his pocket Tom Pinch in great grief for his trouble ran after him with a book as a parting gift and between its leaves Martin found another silver piece all Tom had Most of the way to London Martin walked Once there he took a cheap lodging and tried to find some vessel on which he could work his passage to America for there as he walked he had made up his mind to go But he found no such opportunity His money gone he pawned first his watch and then his other belongings one by one until he had nothing left and was even in distress for food Yet his pride was strong and he gave what was almost his last coin to escape the attentions of one Montague Tigg a dirty jaunty bold mean swaggering slinking vagabond of the shabby genteel sort whom he recognized as one who had more than once tried to squeeze money out of his grandfather At last when he was almost in despair a surprise came in the shape of an envelop addressed to himself containing no letter but a bank note for a generous amount There was no clue whatever to the sender but the sum was enough to pay his passage and he determined therefore to sail next day While he was still wondering at this good luck Martin chanced to come upon Mark Tapley the old assistant at The Blue Dragon Inn Tapley had found London too pleasant a place to be jolly in with any credit and as he had heard America was a very dismal place he proposed to go with Martin As it happened Tapley knew that Mary Graham was then in London for he had seen old Chuzzlewit going into his house When Martin learned this he sent a letter to her by Tapley and she met him next morning in a little park near by There he told her of his leaving Pecksniff s and of his coming voyage She was very sorrowful over his departure but he cheered her by telling her he would soon return well and prosperous for her She told him that Pecksniff seemed somehow to have made his grandfather trust him and that by his advice they were both to move to The Blue Dragon Inn near his house Martin told her of Pecksniff s true character warned her against him and begged her to trust in Tom Pinch as a true friend So they parted pledging each other their love whatever befell Before Martin left next day Mary sent him a diamond ring which he thought his grandfather had given her but for which in reality she had paid all her savings so that he should have with him something of value to sell if he be in want So Martin and Mark Tapley took ship for America and Mary Graham and old Chuzzlewit went to live at The Blue Dragon to the huge satisfaction of the oily Pecksniff who thought now he could easily get the rich old man under his thumb II PECKSNIFF AND OLD CHUZZLEWIT After his first burst of anger at Martin s leaving him old Chuzzlewit to Mary s eyes seemed to grow gradually a different man He appeared more old and stooped and deaf and took little interest in anything After they came to The Blue Dragon Inn Pecksniff threw himself constantly in old Chuzzlewit s way flattering and smooth and before long Mary saw to her grief that the old man was coming more and more under the other s influence When she was alone with him he seemed more his former eager self but let Pecksniff appear and the strange dull look would come and he would seem only anxious to ask his advice about the smallest matters Little wonder Pecksniff concluded he could wind his victim around his finger At length he proposed that old Chuzzlewit and Mary leave The Blue Dragon where he said he felt sure they were not comfortable and come and live with him under his own roof To Mary s dismay the old man consented and they were soon settled in the architect s house The only thing that now seemed to stand in Pecksniff s way was Mary and he decided that as old Chuzzlewit was fond of her he himself would marry her Once married to her he reasoned with both of them to influence old Chuzzlewit it would be easy to do what they pleased with him and with his money too With this end in view he began to persecute poor Mary with his attentions squeezing her hand and throwing kisses to her when no one else was looking Charity Pecksniff s older daughter was not blind to his plan She was in a sour temper because the miserly Jonas who came from London often now to see them had begun to make love to Mercy instead of to her To see her father now paying so much attention to Mary Graham made Charity angry and she left her father s house and went to live in London at missus Todgers s boarding house where she set her cap to catch a young man whether he wanted to be caught or not As for Mercy the younger sister she was leading Jonas such a dance that she thought very little of her father s schemes His vinegary daughter Charity out of the way Pecksniff began to persecute Mary more and more One day he made her so angry by holding her hand and kissing it that she threatened to complain to old Chuzzlewit Pecksniff told her that if she did he would use all his influence to turn the old man still more against his grandson The poor girl was in great trouble then for she loved Martin and feared Pecksniff s growing power with old Chuzzlewit And seeing that this threat frightened her Pecksniff continued his annoyances According to Martin s parting advice Mary had learned to like and to trust Tom Pinch in spite of his mistaken worship of Pecksniff One day while Tom was practising the organ at the church she came to him and confiding in him told all that she had endured In his simple heartedness he had admired and looked up to Pecksniff all his life but this evidence opened Tom Pinch s eyes At last he saw the pompous hypocrite in his true light He agreed with her that the architect was a scoundrel and comforted her and asked her always to trust in his own friendship Unluckily while they talked there was an eavesdropper near It was Pecksniff himself He had gone into the church to rest and lying down in one of the high back pews had gone to sleep and now the voices of Tom and Mary had awakened him He listened and waited till they had both gone then he stole out and went home by a roundabout way That night he went to old Chuzzlewit and pretending to shed tears of sorrow told him he had overheard Tom Pinch the pauper pupil whom he had trusted and befriended making love to Mary the old man s ward in the church Making a great show of his respect and regard for old Chuzzlewit he told him this villain should not remain under his roof one night longer Then he called in Tom Pinch and abusing and insulting him in Chuzzlewit s presence sent him away as he had sent away Martin Tom was feeling so bad over his loss of faith in his idol Pecksniff that he did not greatly mind this last blow In fact he had about concluded he could not live any longer with such a wicked hypocrite anyway He packed his things and set off for London feeling almost as if the world had come to an end Once there however he plucked up spirit and felt better First of all he looked up Westlock the former pupil of Pecksniff s and found him the same friendly clever fellow now in his riches as he was of old Westlock was glad Tom had at last found his master out and began at once to plan for his future Next Tom went to see his sister Ruth at the house where she was governess He arrived there at a fortunate time for the vulgar brass and iron founder who had hired her to try to teach his spoiled little daughter was at that moment scolding Ruth harshly for what was not her fault at all Tom had been gaining a spirit of his own since he had parted from Pecksniff and now at sight of his gentle little sister s tears his honest indignation rose He gave her unjust employer a lecture that left him much astonished and then drawing Ruth s arm through his he led her from the house for ever It was not long before each had told the other all that had happened Tom decided that they should part no more and they set out together to find a lodging They took some rooms in a quiet neighborhood and settled down together till Tom could find something to do Ruth was a neat housekeeper but she had to learn to cook and they had great fun over their first meal While she was making her first beefsteak pudding Westlock called with a great piece of news An agent had come to him asking him to offer to his friend Tom Pinch a position as a librarian at a good salary Who the employer was Tom was not to know Here was a rare mystery and Ruth in her mingled excitement and pie making looked so sweet and charming that then and there Westlock fell in love with her Tom and he went at once to the agent who had made this extraordinary offer and he took them to an unoccupied house to a dusty room whose floor was covered all over with books Tom he said was to arrange and make a list of these Then he gave him the key told him to come to him each week for his salary and disappeared Still wondering the two friends went back together for of course Westlock had to taste the beefsteak pudding Ruth had supper waiting for them Every minute Westlock thought she grew more lovely and as he walked home he knew he was in love at last Now the mystery of Tom s library and of the bank note that Martin had received when his money was all gone would have been a very joyful one to them both if they could have guessed it Old Chuzzlewit whom they believed so harsh and whom the wily Pecksniff thought he had got under his thumb was a very deep and knowing old man indeed He had never ceased to love Martin his grandson though he had misunderstood him at first but he had seen very plainly that the lad was growing selfish and he wished to save him from this He had longed for nothing more than that Martin and Mary should marry but he wished to try their love for each other as well as Martin s affection for him It was to test Pecksniff that old Chuzzlewit had asked the architect to send Martin from his house and when he saw that Pecksniff was fawning hound enough to do it he determined to punish him in the end It was old Chuzzlewit who had found where Martin lodged in London and had sent him the bank note And won by Tom Pinch s goodness and honor it was he who now secretly made him this position If Pecksniff had guessed all this he would probably have had a stroke of apoplexy III JONAS GETS RID OF AN ENEMY Jonas meanwhile in his miserly soul had been wishing that his old father would hurry and die He wanted the money and he wanted to marry Mercy Pecksniff and to do both he preferred the old man out of his way He thought of this and wished it so long that at last he began to think of helping the matter along His father kept in a drawer some cough lozenges which he constantly used Jonas at last bought some poison from a dissipated man who needed money badly and made some lozenges like them These he put in his father s drawer instead of the others His father however and Chuffey the old clerk noticed that the lozenges were not the same and they guessed what Jonas had done The shock of discovering that his own son had tried to murder him proved the old man s death He made Chuffey promise not to betray Jonas then fell in a fit and never spoke again Jonas naturally thought the poison had done the work and was at first in dreadful fear of discovery He made a fine funeral with four horse coaches velvet trappings and silver plate so that people would think he loved his father and not till the body was buried did he forget his dread Chuffey however seemed to go almost daft He would walk and cry and wring his hands and talk so strangely about his master s death that Jonas feared he would cause suspicion that all was not right So he hired a nurse to come and keep him in his room This nurse went by the name of Sairey Gamp She was a fat old woman with a red face a husky voice and a moist eye which often turned up so as to show only the white Wherever she went she carried a faded umbrella with a round white patch on top and she always smelled of whisky missus Gamp was fond of talking of a certain missus Harris whom she spoke of as a dear friend but whom nobody else had ever seen When she wanted to say something nice of herself she would put it in the mouth of missus Harris She was always quoting I says to missus Harris or missus Harris says to me People used to say there was no such person at all but this never failed to make missus Gamp very angry She was a cruel nurse and her way of making a sick man swallow a dose of medicine was by choking him till he gasped and then putting the spoon down his throat Such was the guardian Jonas chose to keep old Chuffey quiet in London while he himself courted Pecksniff s daughter at her father s house And it was not very long before he proposed to Mercy and they were married If Pecksniff had searched London he could not have found a worse man for his daughter to marry But Pecksniff cared for nothing but money and as Jonas was now rich he pretended great love for his new son in law and went around with his hands clasped and his eyes lifted to Heaven in pious thankfulness As for Jonas he began to treat Mercy brutally and soon she was miserable Jonas meanwhile had fallen in with a very prosperous individual This was none other than Montague Tigg the bold jaunty swaggering shabby genteel Tigg who had once been glad to beg a coin from any one he knew Now he had changed in both appearance and name His face was covered with glossy black whiskers his clothes were the costliest and his jewelry the most expensive He was known now as mister Tigg Montague and was president of the great Anglo Bengalee Company The Anglo Bengalee Company was a business which pretended to insure people s lives It had fine offices with new furniture new paper and a big brass plate on the door It looked most solid and respectable but it was really a trap for Tigg and its other officers were only waiting until they had taken in enough money to run away with it to a foreign country Jonas sharp as he was was deceived into believing it an honest enterprise He came there to get his wife s life insured and so he met Tigg Tigg however knowing Jonas of old knew he had a great deal of money of his own and thought too that he might influence mister Pecksniff now his father in law Tigg flattered Jonas accordingly telling him what a sharp man he was and offered to make him a director in the company He assured Jonas that there would be enormous profits and showed him how by putting his own money into it he could cheat other people out of much more This idea tickled Jonas and he agreed Having got thus far Tigg hired a spy named Nadgett to see if he could discover whether Jonas had ever committed any crime the knowledge of which would put him in their power Nadgett began his work got on the right side of Sairey Gamp the nurse found out that old Chuffey was locked up for fear he might talk and soon had a suspicion that Jonas had been concerned in his father s death As an experiment Tigg boldly charged him with it one day and knew in an instant by the way Jonas s face whitened with fear that he had stumbled on the truth He then told Jonas he not only must put into the company more of his own money but must persuade Pecksniff to do likewise Jonas dared not now refuse He thought of escaping to some other country but wherever he turned he found Tigg s spies watching and at last he determined on a second murder to hide the first the murder of Tigg who knew his secret Tigg did not forget his plan to ensnare Pecksniff To do this he took Jonas by carriage from London to Salisbury and mile by mile as they sped the latter laid his plans Near their destination accident came near assisting him In the storm the carriage was upset and Tigg was thrown under the horses feet Jonas lashed the struggling horses hoping they would trample and kill his companion but the driver pulled him out just in time They finally reached The Blue Dragon Inn and there the next day Jonas brought Pecksniff to dine with Tigg and the latter told the architect all about his wonderful company Though Pecksniff pretended he took the idea as a joke yet the thought of cheating other people for big profits was very attractive to him Before the evening was over he had fallen into the trap and had promised next day to give Tigg his money Jonas his part of the bargain finished hurried back to London There after telling Mercy not to disturb him as he expected to sleep all next day he locked himself into his room When it was dark he dressed himself in a rough suit that he had prepared for disguise let himself out by a rear way and took the stage back again to the village where he had left Tigg with Pecksniff He lay in wait in a wood through which Tigg passed after his last call on the architect and there he killed him with a club Then he went swiftly back to London and let himself into his room again thinking no one had noticed his absence But there had been an eye at the shutter of the window in the house opposite that did not fail to observe Jonas when he went and when he came And this eye belonged to Nadgett the spy IV WHAT CAME OF MARTIN S TRIP TO AMERICA While these things were occurring much had happened to Martin and Mark Tapley far away in America The sailing vessel on which they crossed was crowded and dirty and in order to save their money they had taken passage in the steerage For a long time Martin was very seasick and even when he grew better he was so ashamed at having to travel in the worst and cheapest part of the vessel that he would not go on deck But Tapley had none of this false pride He made friends with all helped every one he could and soon became such a general favorite that as he thought sadly he was having much too good a time for him to be jolly with any credit The long voyage of so many weeks came to an end at last and they reached New York They found it a strange place indeed and met many strange characters in it Only one they met pleased them a gentleman named Bevan and from him they got much information and advice There seemed however to be little opening for an architect in New York and Martin at length decided to go West and settle in some newer region In the western town where they left the train they found a land agent who was selling lots in a new settlement on the Mississippi River called Eden To buy their railway tickets Martin had already sold the ring Mary Graham had given him and he had just enough to purchase a tract of land in Eden and to pay their fare there Martin looked at the agent s splendid plans of the new town showing wharves churches and public buildings and thought it a capital place for a young architect so they closed the bargain without more ado and took the next steamer down the desolate Mississippi A terrible disappointment awaited them when they found what Eden really was a handful of rotting log cabins set in a swamp The wharves and public buildings existed only on the agent s map with which he had so cruelly cheated them There were only a few wan men alive there the rest had succumbed to the sickly hot vapor that rose from the swamp and hung in the air At the sight of what they had come to Martin lay down and wept in very despair But for his comrade s cheerfulness he would have wholly given up hope Next morning Martin found himself in the grip of the deadly fever with which the place reeked and for many days thereafter he lay helpless and burning nursed like a child by the faithful Mark Tapley When he had begun to recover it came the other s turn to fall ill and Martin took his place at nursing Through all Tapley never complained At last he found himself in circumstances where to be jolly was really a credit to anybody He always insisted that he was in great spirits and when he was weakest and could not speak he wrote jolly on a slate for Martin to see Watching beside his friend day by day Martin came to know himself truly and to see his own selfishness As he nursed Tapley to health again he determined to root it out of his nature and to return to England a nobler man He began to think not of what he had sacrificed for Mary but of what she would have sacrificed for him and to wish with all his heart that he had not parted from his grandfather in anger And even before Tapley was able to sit up Martin had determined to return as soon as possible to England He laid aside his pride and wrote to Bevan who had befriended them in New York to borrow money enough to bring them both to that city Once there Tapley found a position as cook in the same ship that had brought them from England and his wages proved sufficient to pay for Martin s passage So Martin started back to the home he had parted from a year before poorer than he had left it but at heart a better and a sounder man His false pride was gone now He mingled with others and helped them and by the time they landed he was as popular a passenger as Mark Tapley was a cook Almost the first man they saw on landing curiously enough was the oily Pecksniff They saw him escorted along the street pointed out by the crowds as the great architect On that day the corner stone of a splendid public building was to be laid and Pecksniff s design for this structure had taken the prize The two comrades went with the crowd to hear Pecksniff s speech and looking over a gentleman s shoulder at a picture of the building as it was to look Martin saw that it was the very grammar school he himself had designed when he had first come to Pecksniff s The old rascal had stolen the plans Martin was angry of course but there was no help for it and besides he had other things to think of Mary Graham to be sure was his first thought and he and Tapley set out at once for The Blue Dragon to learn the latest news The rosy landlady laughed and cried together to see them and Mark Tapley kissed her so many times that she was quite out of breath She cooked the finest dinner in the world for them and told them all she knew about their friends how Tom Pinch had been sent away and how every one said that Pecksniff intended to marry Mary This news made Martin grind his teeth and it would have been unlucky for the architect if he had been near at that moment Martin first sent Tapley with a note addressed to his grandfather but Pecksniff who came to the door tore up the letter before the bearer s face Mark told Martin of this and together they forced themselves into the house and into the room where old Chuzzlewit sat with Pecksniff beside him and Mary standing behind his chair Martin s grandfather hardly looked at him keeping his eyes on Pecksniff s face as though he depended on him even for his thoughts Martin seeing this was almost hopeless but he did as he had determined and in a few manly words begged old Chuzzlewit s pardon for his own haste and temper and asked him to take him back to his favor While he talked Mary had hidden her face in her hands and was weeping for she believed his grandfather so wholly in Pecksniff s power that she had no hope for Martin Pecksniff was in rare good humor for it was this very day that he had turned his money over to Tigg to make a fortune for him in the great Anglo Bengalee Company Now rejoicing in his opportunity he took it upon himself to answer He called Martin a shameless cowardly vagabond and ordered him from the door Then he gave his arm to the old man and led him out of the room Martin clasped Mary for a moment in his arms as he kissed her and told her to keep up heart Then he left the house and set out with Mark Tapley for London V OLD CHUZZLEWIT S PLOT SUCCEEDS Where was the guilty Jonas meanwhile Shivering at every sound listening for the news that Tigg s body had been found in the wood wondering if by any chance the crime might be laid on him Already fate was weaving a net about his feet The man from whom he had bought the poison to kill his father had fallen very ill and in his illness had repented of the part he had played He had confessed to Westlock whom before he had fallen into wicked company he had once known Westlock sent for old Chuzzlewit and he too was told the story of the purchased poison Then together the three went to Jonas s house and brought him face to face with his accuser Confronted with their evidence Jonas gave himself up for lost but old Chuffey whom he had so abused escaped the watchful eye of Sairey Gamp and entered just in time to keep his promise to his dead master and to clear Jonas the son He told them how it had really happened How Jonas had intended to kill his father but how the latter s death had been due not to the poison which he had never taken but to the knowledge of his son s wickedness Jonas in the reaction from his fear laughed aloud and was abusively ordering them to leave when the door opened and the color suddenly left his cheeks Policemen stood there and at their head was Nadgett the spy In another moment there were handcuffs on his wrists and he knew not only that the murder of Tigg had been discovered but that every action of his own on that fatal night had been traced and that he was surely doomed to die on the gallows When he realized that he was lost he fell to the floor in pitiable fear They put him in a wagon to take him to jail but when they arrived there they found him motionless in his seat He had swallowed some of his own poison which he carried in his pocket and was as dead as any hangman could have made him Old Chuzzlewit had yet another purpose to carry out before he left London and for this purpose he asked Westlock to meet him in his rooms at a certain time next day He sent for Tom Pinch and his sister Ruth for his grandson Martin and Mark Tapley and last but not least for Pecksniff himself all to meet him there at the same hour All save Pecksniff arrived together and greatly astonished most of them were you may be sure to see old Chuzzlewit so changed For now the dull bent look had vanished His eyes were bright his form erect and every feature eager and full of purpose Even Mary Graham scarcely knew what to make of it As they sat wondering and waiting for old Chuzzlewit to speak Pecksniff came hurriedly in to start back as if at a shock of electricity But he recovered himself and clasped his hands with a look of pious joy to see the old man safe and well Then he looked around him and shook his head Oh vermin Oh bloodsuckers he said Horde of unnatural plunderers and robbers Begone Leave him and do not stay in a spot hallowed by the gray hairs of this patriarchal gentleman He advanced with outstretched arms but he had not seen how tightly old Chuzzlewit s hand clasped the walking stick he held The latter in one great burst of indignation rose up and with a single blow stretched him on the ground Mark Tapley dragged him into a corner and propped him against the wall and in this ridiculous position cringing and with his assurance all gone Pecksniff listened as did they all to the old man s story He told the assembled company how the curse of selfishness had seemed to him always to rest upon his family How he had misunderstood Martin his best loved grandson and how he had seen Pecksniff doing his best to add to this bad feeling He beckoned Martin to him and put Mary s hand in his as he told how he had tested them both and had at last resolved to see to what a length the hypocrisy of Pecksniff would lead him How to this end he had pretended feebleness of mind and had planned and plotted finally to expose Pecksniff and set all right When he had finished the door was opened and Pecksniff looking all shrunken and frowsy and yellow passed out never to enter again into the lives of any of them There was a great and joyful gathering that night when all these so strangely united took dinner together Martin sat beside Mary while Westlock walked home with Ruth and before they reached there she had promised to be his wife Martin and Mary were married soon and old Chuzzlewit made Martin his heir He also gave a home to poor Mercy the wife of the dead Jonas Tom Pinch lived a long and happy life in the home which Westlock made for Ruth where he had a fine organ on which he played every day Mark Tapley of course married the rosy landlady of The Blue Dragon and settled down at the inn which he renamed The Jolly Tapley Charity Pecksniff succeeded in ensnaring her young man at last The day they were to be married however he did not come to the church but ran off to Van Diemen s Land and she lived and died a vinegary shrewish old maid As for Pecksniff himself having lost all his money in the Anglo Bengalee Company which of course went to pieces on Tigg s death he sank lower and lower till at last a drunken squalid old man he eked out a miserable existence writing whining begging letters to the very people whom he had once labored so hard to make unhappy OUR MUTUAL FRIEND Published eighteen sixty four eighteen

gathering the dust and ashes of the city and sorting it for whatever it contained of value He lived in a house surrounded by great mounds of dust that he had collected He was a hard hearted man and when his daughter would not marry as he wished he turned her out of the house on a winter s night The poor girl died soon after and her younger brother a boy of only fourteen indignant at his father s

who had run away on one condition that he marry a young lady by the name of Bella Wilfer the daughter of a poor London clerk The son had never seen Bella in his life and in fact the old man himself had seen her only a few times and that was a long long time before when she was a very little girl He was sitting in the park one Sunday morning and the baby Bella because her father would not go the exact way she wanted was screaming and stamping her little foot Old mister Harmon having such a stubborn temper himself admired it in the little child and came to watch for her Then for some strange reason which nobody ever could guess he had put the baby s name in his will declaring that his son John should get his money only by marrying this little girl And the will declared moreover that if the son John Harmon should die or should refuse to marry Bella all the fortune should go to mister Boffin The lawyers had great trouble in finding where John Harmon was but finally they did so and received word that he would return at once to England The ship he sailed on reached London but the passenger it carried did not appear A few days later a riverman named Hexam found a body floating in the River Thames which flows through the middle of London In his pockets were the letters the lawyers had written to John Harmon and there seemed no doubt that the unfortunate young man had been murdered and his body thrown into the river The night the body was found while it lay at the police station a young man very much excited came and asked to see it He would not tell who he was and his whole appearance was most wild and strange The police wondered but they saw no reason to detain the stranger so after looking at the body he went away again very hastily A great stir was made about the case and the police tried their best to discover the murderer but they were unsuccessful Then it occurred to them that there was something suspicious in the appearance of the young man that night They tried to find him but he seemed to have disappeared At last the fortune was turned over to mister Boffin and all but a few people thought no more about the murder Now it was not really true that John Harmon had been drowned This is what had happened The young man had come back to England unwillingly though he was coming to such wealth Having left his father so long before in anger he hardly liked to touch the money And he dreaded having to marry a young lady he had never seen with whom all his life he might be most unhappy On the ship was a seaman about his own age whose face somewhat resembled his own With this man Harmon became friendly and before the ship reached England he had told him his trouble and his dread The other proposed that Harmon disguise himself in sailor s clothes go into the neighborhood where Miss Bella Wilfer lived and see if she was one whom he could love Now the man whom Harmon was thus trusting was a villain who while he had been listening to the other s story had been planning a crime against him He had made up his mind to kill Harmon and as he looked so much like him to marry Bella himself and claim the fortune Near the docks where the ship came in was a sailors boarding house owned by a riverman of bad reputation named Rogue Riderhood Riderhood had once been the partner of Hexam the man who found the floating body but one day he was caught trying to rob a live man and Hexam had cast him off The seaman took Harmon to this house and there he secretly got from Riderhood some poison Last he persuaded Harmon to change clothes with him All that remained now was to get rid of the real Harmon To do this he put the poison in a cup of coffee and Harmon drinking this became insensible The lodging house hung out over the river and the wicked man had intended throwing the other s body dressed now in seaman s clothing into the water But fate was quickly to spoil his plan He and some others fell to quarreling over the money found in the clothing of the unconscious man The result was a desperate fight and when it was over there were two bodies thrown from the window into the black river the drugged man and the seaman who had planned his murder The shock of the cold water brought the drugged Harmon to his senses He struck out and after a terrible struggle succeeded in reaching shore The exposure and the poison made him very ill and he lay abed in an inn for some days While he was lying helpless there the drowned body of the seaman was found by Hexam the riverman As it wore the clothes of John Harmon and had his papers in its pockets every one supposed of course that it was the body of the missing heir The first thing John Harmon saw after he was well enough to walk was a printed notice announcing the finding of his own dead body which gave him a very queer sensation Lying there he had had time to think over the adventure and he had guessed pretty nearly how it all had happened He went at once to the police station to look at the corpse and saw it was that of his false friend who had tried to lure him to his death So it was the real John Harmon who had so excitedly appeared that night to the police inspectors and had vanished immediately and whom they had searched for so long in vain under the suspicion that he himself was the murderer He had a very good reason for not letting the police find him too Now that the world considered him dead he had determined before he came to life to carry out his first plan and to find out for himself just what kind of person the Bella Wilfer he was expected to marry was and whether mister and missus Boffin who had been so kind to him in his childhood would still be as true to his memory in their wealth For this reason he did not correct the error that had been made He took the name of John Rokesmith and to get acquainted with Bella hired lodgings in her own father s house mister Wilfer was a clerk for a mister Veneering a man who had made a big fortune in the drug business and wanted now to get into Parliament Everything the Veneerings had was brand new They spent a great deal of money entertaining society people at dinners but mister Veneering spent very little on his clerks Bella s father though he was always as happy as a cherub was so poor that he never had been able to buy a whole new suit at once His hat was shabby before he could afford a coat and his trousers were worn before he got to new shoes So he was glad enough indeed to get a lodger mister and missus Boffin to be sure now had the great fortune They bought a fine house and everybody called mister Boffin The Golden Dustman because he was so rich missus Boffin wore velvet dresses and mister Boffin thinking that now he was rich he ought to know a great deal about books bought a big volume of the History of the Roman Empire and hired a man with a wooden leg who kept a ballad shop near by to come and read to him in the evenings But in spite of all their fine things mister and missus Boffin remained the same good kind hearted couple they had always been John Harmon or John Rokesmith as he now called himself soon found this out for he cleverly got a position as mister Boffin s secretary taking charge of all his papers and preventing many dishonest people from cheating him And mister and missus Boffin never suspecting who he really was instead of secretary called him Our Mutual Friend and soon grew fond of him Nor did they forget Bella Wilfer for whose disappointment at not getting the rich husband she had expected they felt very sorry and soon invited her to live with them Bella was a good tempered pretty girl though inclined to be somewhat selfish and spoiled and she was not sure after all that she would have liked a husband who had been willed to her like a dozen silver spoons so she did not grieve greatly and accepted mister and missus Boffin s offer gratefully So now the secretary John Rokesmith beside being constantly with mister and missus Boffin whom he had always loved had a chance to see Bella every day and he was not long in finding out that it would be very easy indeed for him to fall in love with her II LIZZIE HEXAM AND THE DOLLS DRESSMAKER Hexam the riverman who had found the body floating in the Thames made a living by watching in his boat for drowned bodies and getting any rewards that might be offered for finding them He had two children a daughter Lizzie who used to row the boat for him and a younger son Charley Lizzie was a beautiful girl and a good daughter and she never ceased to beseech her father to quit this ghastly business She saved every cent she could get to give her brother some schooling and kept urging the boy until he left home and became a teacher in a respectable school For her own part she chose to stay by her father hoping in spite of her hatred of his calling to make him sometime something better The night Hexam found the body the lawyers who had the Harmon will in charge came to his house to see about it One of them a careless young man by the name of Eugene Wrayburn was greatly struck with the beauty of Lizzie and pitied her because of the life she was obliged to live and this interest in her made him even more deeply interested in the case of the odd will and the strange murder Now mister and missus Boffin since they were rich had offered a great reward for the arrest of the murderer of John Harmon To get this reward and at the same time to avenge himself on his old partner Hexam for casting him off Rogue Riderhood went to the lawyers and declared that it was Hexam himself who had really killed the man whose body he had found Riderhood swore that Hexam had confessed the crime to him Wrayburn knowing what a shock this charge against her father would be for Lizzie went with the officers sent to seize him But they made no arrest for that night Hexam himself was drowned by accidentally falling from his own boat But the false charge against him lay heavy on Lizzie s mind She hated the river and all that was connected with it and soon found herself a decent lodging in another part of London Here she lived with a weird little dwarf of a girl so deformed that she could scarcely walk at all I can t get up she used to say to strangers because my back s bad and my legs are queer She had an odd face with sharp gray eyes and her wits were sharper yet She worked at the strangest trade in the world She had visiting cards on which was printed MISS JENNIE WREN DOLLS DRESSMAKER Dolls Attended at Their Own Residence She was really and truly a dolls dressmaker and sat all day long making tiny frocks out of silk and ribbon Every evening she would hobble out to the door of the theater or of a house where a ball was going on and wait until a lady came out in a beautiful costume then she would take careful note of it and go home and dress a doll just like it She even made a minister doll in clerical collar and surplice and used to rent him out for doll weddings But in spite of her trade she disliked children because the rude ones of the neighborhood called her names through her keyhole and mimicked her bent back and crooked legs Don t talk to me of children she often said I know their tricks and their manners and when she said this she would make a fierce little jab in the air with her needle as if she were putting out somebody s eyes Jennie Wren had a miserable drunkard of a father whom she called her troublesome child He is enough to break his mother s heart she would say when he staggered in I wish I had never brought him up Ugh You muddling disgraceful prodigal old son I can t bear to look at you Go into your corner this minute And the wretched creature whining and maudlin would shuffle into his corner in disgrace not daring to disobey her The odd little dolls dressmaker was cheerful and merry with all her trials and loved Lizzie Hexam very much Wrayburn the young lawyer used to come to see them but she did not approve of him She saw almost before Lizzie did herself that the latter was falling in love with Wrayburn and the wise little creature feared that this would only bring pain to Lizzie because she was an uneducated girl and Wrayburn a gentleman who when he married would be expected to marry a lady far above Lizzie s station Lizzie knew this too but she could not help loving Wrayburn and as for the lawyer he thought nothing of what the outcome might be Meanwhile Lizzie s brother Charley for whom she had worked so hard was doing well at school but now that he was getting up in the world he had turned out to be a selfish boy and was afraid that his sister might draw him down One day he came to visit her bringing with him the master of his school The master s name was Headstone He was a gloomy passionate revengeful man who dressed always in black and had no friends Unfortunately enough the first time he saw Lizzie he fell in love with her It was unfortunate in more ways than one for Lizzie disliked him greatly and he was as it proved a man who would stop at nothing not even at the worst of crimes to attain an object When Lizzie s brother found Headstone wanted to marry her in his selfishness he saw only what a fine thing it would be for himself and when she refused he said many harsh things and finally left her in anger telling her she was no longer a sister of his This was not the worst either for she knew Headstone had been made almost angry by her dislike and she was in dreadful fear lest he do harm to Eugene Wrayburn whom he suspected she loved In her anxiety Lizzie left her lodging with the dolls dressmaker and found employment in a paper mill in a village on the river some miles from London letting neither Wrayburn nor Headstone know where she had gone The schoolmaster imagined that the lawyer whom he now hated with a deadly hatred knew where she was and in order to discover if he visited her he began to dog the other s footsteps At night after teaching all day in school Headstone would lie in wait outside the lawyer s door and whenever he came out would follow him Wrayburn soon discovered this and delighted to fool his enemy Every night he would take a new direction and lead his pursuer for hours about the city So that in a few weeks Headstone became almost insane with murderous anger and disappointment So things went on for a long while Lizzie continued to love Eugene Wrayburn who kept trying in every way to find her Headstone the schoolmaster kept watching him and meditating evil The little dolls dressmaker worked on cheerily every day in the city and in their fine house mister and missus Boffin grew fonder and fonder of Miss Bella whom John Rokesmith the secretary thought more beautiful every day III THE RISE AND FALL OF SILAS WEGG The wooden legged ballad seller whom mister Boffin had hired to read to him was a sly dishonest rascal named Silas Wegg who soon made up his mind to get all the money he could out of his employer There is an old story of a camel who once asked a shopkeeper to let him put his nose in at the shop door to warm it The shopkeeper consented and little by little the camel got his head then his neck then his shoulders and at last his whole body into the shop so that there was no room for the poor shopkeeper who had to sit outside in the cold Wegg soon began to act like the camel and took such advantage of easy going mister Boffin that the latter at last let him live rent free in the house amid the dust heaps which he himself had occupied before he got old Harmon s money Wegg imagined the mounds contained treasures hidden by the old man and thought it would be a fine thing to cheat mister Boffin out of them So every night he spent hours prodding the heaps Finally he persuaded a mister Venus a man who had been disappointed in love and made a melancholy living by stringing skeletons together on wires to become his partner in the search One day Wegg really did find something It was a parchment hidden in an empty pump and he soon saw that it was a second will of old Harmon s later than the one already known leaving the whole fortune not to the son at all but to the Crown When Wegg saw this his hypocritical soul swelled with joy for he thought sooner than give up all the money to the Crown mister Boffin would pay him a great deal to destroy this new will He was such a rascal himself that it never occurred to him that maybe mister Boffin would prefer to be honest He took it for granted everybody else was as bad as he was himself yet all the while he tried to make himself believe that he was upright and noble in all he did as hypocrites generally do The only point Wegg could not make up his mind about was how much he could squeeze out of his benefactor mister Boffin At first he had thought of asking for half but the more he hugged his secret the lesser the half seemed At last he determined to demand for himself as the price for giving up the will all but a very small share of the whole fortune Now mister Venus though he had yielded at first to the rosy temptations of Wegg was after all quite honest at heart and his conscience troubled him so that at last he went and told mister Boffin all about Wegg s discovery The Golden Dustman at first thought mister Venus had some underhanded plan so he pretended he was terribly frightened for fear of Wegg and the will he had found As a matter of fact sly old mister Boffin was not afraid in the least because he knew something that neither Wegg nor Venus nor even John Rokesmith the secretary knew This was that the old original dustman Harmon had made still a third will later than either of the others The first will found was the one that had called the son back to England to marry Bella The second will was the one leaving all his fortune to the Crown which Wegg had found in the empty pump The third and last one gave all the money to mister Boffin no matter whom the son married and gave none to any one else And this third and last will the one that was the true will The Golden Dustman had long ago found himself buried in a bottle in one of the dust heaps mister Boffin had never told any one about this last will because he had all the fortune anyway Now however seeing how Wegg had planned to act he was very glad he had found it And when he was convinced that mister Venus was really honest and wanted no reward whatever mister Boffin determined to fool the rascally Wegg up to the very last moment Wegg s plan was not to demand the money until he had fully searched all the dust mounds mister Boffin spurred Wegg on in this regard by making him read to him in the evenings from a book called The Lives of Famous Misers which he had bought about the famous mister Dancer who had warmed his dinner by sitting on it and died naked in a sack and yet had gold and bank notes hidden in the crevices of the walls and in cracked jugs and tea pots of an old apple woman in whose house a fortune was found wrapped up in little scraps of paper of Vulture Hopkins and Blewbury Jones and many others whose riches after their death were found hidden in strange places While Wegg read mister Boffin would pretend to get tremendously excited about his dust mounds so that Wegg grew surer and surer there must be riches hidden in them Finally The Golden Dustman sold the mounds and had them carted away little by little Wegg watching every shovelful for fear he would miss something mister Boffin hired a foreman to manage the removal of the dust who wore Wegg down to skin and bone He worked by daylight and torchlight too Just as Wegg tired out by watching all day in the rain would crawl into bed the foreman like a goblin would reappear and go to work again Sometimes Wegg would be waked in the middle of the night and sometimes kept at his post for as much as forty eight hours at a stretch till he grew so gaunt and haggard that even his wooden leg looked chubby in comparison At last he could not keep quiet any longer and he told mister Boffin what he had found mister Boffin pretended the most abject dread Wegg bullied and browbeat him to his heart s content and ended by ordering him like a slave to be ready to receive him on a certain morning and to have the money ready to pay him When he went to the fine Boffin house to keep this appointment he entered insolently whistling and with his hat on A servant showed him into the library where mister Boffin and the secretary sat waiting and where the secretary at once astonished him by taking off the hat and throwing it out of the window In another moment Wegg found himself seized by the cravat shaken till his teeth rattled and pinned in a corner of the room where the secretary knocked his head against the wall while he told him in a few words what a scoundrel he was When he learned that the will he had discovered was worthless paper Wegg lost all his bullying air and cringed before them mister Boffin was disposed to be merciful and offered to make good his loss of his ballad business but Wegg grasping and mean to the last set its value at such a ridiculously high figure that mister Boffin put his money back into his pocket Then at a sign from John Rokesmith one of the servants caught Wegg by the collar hoisted him on his back ran down to the street with him and threw him into a garbage cart where he disappeared from view with a tremendous splash And that so far as this story is concerned was the end of Silas Wegg IV BELLA AND THE GOLDEN DUSTMAN It was not long before John Rokesmith the secretary was very much in love with Bella indeed Bella saw this plainly but the fine house and costly clothes had quite spoiled her and thinking him only a poor secretary and her father s lodger she treated him almost with contempt Yet he would not tell her who he was for he did not want her to marry him merely because of the money it would bring her She hurt his feelings often but in spite of it she could not help being attracted to him He had a way too of looking at her that made her feel how proud and unjust she was and sometimes made her quite despise herself But having had a taste of the pleasures and comforts that wealth would bring Bella had quite determined when she married to marry nobody but a very rich man mister and missus Boffin both noticed how changed she was growing from her own sweet self and regretted it for they liked Bella and they liked the secretary too and they could easily see that the latter was in love with her One day missus Boffin went to the secretary s room for something As she entered Rokesmith who was sitting sadly over the fire looked up with a peculiar expression that told the good woman all in a flash who he was I know you now she cried you re little John Harmon In the joy and surprise she almost fainted but he caught her and set her down beside him Just then in came mister Boffin and the secretary told them the whole story and how he now loved Bella but would not declare himself because of her contempt Both mister and missus Boffin were so glad to know he was really alive they fell to crying with joy The Golden Dustman declared that no matter how the last will read John should have the fortune for his own Rokesmith or Harmon at first refused to do this but mister Boffin swore that if he did not he himself would not touch the money and it would have to go to the Crown anyway So at last it was agreed that mister Boffin should keep a small portion for his own but that the other should take all the rest mister Boffin wanted to tell everybody the truth at once but John would not let them You see he wouldn t marry Bella for anything unless she loved him for himself alone And she was growing so fond of riches that there seemed little chance of this happening Nevertheless they believed that at heart Bella was good and sweet if they could only get to her real self so mister Boffin that moment made a plan He determined to show Bella how much unhappiness misused riches could cause and how too much money might sometimes spoil the kindest and best people As a lesson to her in this he was to pretend gradually to turn into a mean hard hearted miser They agreed that he should begin to treat the secretary harshly and unjustly in Bella s presence feeling sure that her true self would stand up for him when he was slighted and be kinder to him when he seemed poorest and most friendless The Golden Dustman began the new plan that very night Every day he made himself act like a regular brown bear and every evening he would say I ll be a grislier old growler to morrow He made the secretary slave from morning till night and found fault with him and sneered at his poverty and cut down his wages Each afternoon when he went walking with Bella mister Boffin would make her go into bookshops and inquire if they had any book about a miser If they had he would buy it no matter what it cost and lug it home to read He began to drive hard bargains for everything he bought and all his talk came to be about money and the fine thing it was to have it Go in for money my dear he would say to Bella Money s the article You ll make money of your good looks and of the money missus Boffin and me will leave you and you ll live and die rich That s the state to live and die in R r rich Bella was greatly shocked at the sorrowful change in mister Boffin Wealth began to look less lovely when she saw him growing so miserly She began to wonder if she herself might ever become like that too and sometimes when she thought how kind and generous the old mister Boffin had been she fairly hated money and wished it had never been invented There was an old woman who peddled knitting work through the country whom mister and missus Boffin had befriended and to whom they had given a letter to carry wherever she went This letter asked whoever should find her if she fell sick to let them know The old woman fell and died one day by the roadside near the spot where Lizzie Hexam was now living and Lizzie finding the letter wrote about it to mister and missus Boffin They sent the secretary and Bella to make arrangements for the poor woman s burial and in this way Bella met Lizzie and became her friend Lizzie soon told her all her story and Bella seeing how unselfishly she loved began to think her own ambition to marry for money a mean and ignoble thing She thought how patient and kind the secretary had always been and knowing he loved her wished heartily that her own coldness had not forbidden him to tell her so One day mister Boffin s pretended harsh treatment of his secretary seemed to come to a climax He sent for him to come to the room where missus Boffin and Bella sat and made a fearful scene He said he had just heard that he Rokesmith had been presuming on his position to make love to Bella a young lady who wanted to marry money who had a right to marry money and who was very far from wanting to marry a poor beggar of a private secretary He threw the wages that were due Rokesmith on the floor and discharged him on the spot telling him the sooner he could pack up and leave the better Then at last in the face of this apparent meanness and injustice Bella saw herself and mister Boffin s money and John Rokesmith s love and dignity all in their true light She burst out crying begged Rokesmith s forgiveness told mister Boffin he was an old wretch of a miser and when the secretary had gone she said Rokesmith was a gentleman and worth a million Boffins and she would not stay in the house a minute longer Then she packed up her things and went straight to her father s office All the other clerks had gone home for it was after hours and she put her head on his shoulder and told him all about it And while they were talking in came John Rokesmith and seeing her there alone with her father rushed to her and caught her in his arms My dear brave noble generous girl he said and Bella feeling all at once that she had never been quite so happy in her life laid her head on his breast as if that were the one place for it in all the world They had a talk together and then walked home to mister Wilfer s poor little house Bella s father agreeing that she had done exactly the proper thing and Bella herself feeling so happy now in having John Rokesmith s love that she cared not a bit for the fine mansion and clothes and money of the Boffins which she had left for ever A few days later John Rokesmith and Bella were married and went to live in a little furnished cottage outside of London where they settled down as happy as two birds V THE END OF THE STORY While these things were happening at mister Boffin s house Eugene Wrayburn with Headstone the schoolmaster watching him like a hawk had never left off trying to find where Lizzie Hexam had gone At length through the troublesome child of the little dolls dressmaker he learned the name of the village where she was living and went at once to see her Headstone followed close behind him and when from his hiding place he saw how glad Lizzie was to see the lawyer he went quite mad with jealousy and hate and that moment he determined to kill Wrayburn It happened that Rogue Riderhood was then working on the river that flowed past the village where he tended a lock The schoolmaster in order to turn suspicion from himself in case any one should see him when he did this wicked deed observing carefully how Riderhood was dressed got himself clothes exactly like the lock tender s even to a red handkerchief tied around his neck In this guise with murder in his heart he lay in wait along the riverside till Wrayburn passed one evening just after he had bade good night to Lizzie Hexam The schoolmaster crept up close behind the lawyer and struck him a fearful crashing blow on the head with a club Wrayburn grappled with him but Headstone struck again and again with the bloody weapon and still again as the other lay prostrate at his feet and dragging the body to the bank threw it into the river Then he fled Lizzie Hexam had not yet turned homeward from the riverside She heard through the night the sound of the blows the faint moan and the splash She ran to the spot saw the trampled grass and looking across the water saw a bloody face drifting away She ran to launch a boat and rowed with all her strength to overtake it But for her dreadful life on the river with her father she could not have found the drowning man in the darkness but she did and then she saw it was the man she loved One terrible cry she uttered then rowed with desperate strokes to the shore and with superhuman strength carried him to a near by inn Wrayburn was not dead but was dreadfully disfigured For many days he hovered between life and death Jennie Wren the dolls dressmaker came and she and Lizzie nursed him As soon as he could speak he made them understand that before he died he wanted Lizzie to marry him A minister was sent for and with him came John Rokesmith and Bella So the sick man was married to Lizzie and from that hour he began to get better till before long they knew that he would recover Meanwhile not waiting to see the result of his murderous attack Headstone had fled down the river bank to the hut where Riderhood lived and there the villainous lock tender let him rest and sleep As the schoolmaster tossed in his guilty slumber Riderhood noted that his clothes were like his own He unbuttoned the sleeping man s jacket saw the red handkerchief and having heard from a passing boatman of the attempted murder he guessed that Headstone had done it and saw how he had plotted to lay the crime on him When the schoolmaster went away Riderhood followed him watched him change clothes in the bushes and rescued the bloody garments the other threw away With these in his hands he faced the schoolmaster one day in his class room and made him promise under threat of exposure to come that night to the hut by the lock Headstone was afraid to disobey When he came Riderhood told him he must give him money at once or he would follow him till he did Headstone refused and as the other had threatened when he started back to London he found the lock tender by his side He returned to the hut and the other did the same He started again and again the other walked beside him Then Headstone turning suddenly caught Riderhood around the waist and dragged him to the edge of the lock Let go said Riderhood You can t drown me I can panted Headstone And I can drown myself I ll hold you living and I ll hold you dead Come down Riderhood went over backward into the water and the schoolmaster upon him When they found them long afterward Riderhood s body was girdled still with the schoolmaster s arms and they held him tight This was the awful end of the two wicked men whom fate had brought into Lizzie s life All this time of course Bella had been believing her husband to be very poor At first he had intended to tell her who he was on the day they were married but he said to himself No she s so unselfish and contented I can t afford to be rich yet So he pretended to get a position in the city at small wages Then after a few months he thought it over again and he said to himself She s such a cheerful little housewife that I can t afford to be rich yet And at last a little baby was born to Bella and then they were so happy that he said She s so much sweeter than she ever was that I can t afford to be rich just yet But meantime Bella was imagining that mister Boffin was a cruel old miser and mister Boffin didn t like this so John agreed that he would tell her all about it But first he got Bella to describe exactly the kind of house she would like if they were very very rich and when she told him he and mister Boffin had the Boffin mansion fixed over in just the way she had said with a nursery with rainbow colored walls and flowers on the staircase and even a little room full of live birds and a jewel box full of jewels on the dressing table Fate however had arranged even a greater trial of Bella s love for him than all the others As they walked together on the street one day they came face to face with a man who had been in the police office on the night the body which every one believed to be John Harmon s had lain there He had seen the entrance of the agitated stranger and had helped the police in their later vain search for Rokesmith Now he at once recognized Bella s husband as that man who the police believed had probably committed the murder Rokesmith knew the man had recognized him and when they got home he told Bella that he was accused of killing the man the Harmon will had bidden her marry Illustration Jennie Wren and her troublesome child See page three hundred thirty five But nothing now could shake her faith in him How dare they she cried indignantly My beloved husband He caught her in his arms at that and while he held her thus the officers entered to arrest him Rokesmith found the matter very easy to explain to the satisfaction of the police but he told Bella nothing as yet and trusting and believing in him absolutely she waited in great wonder Next day he told her he had a new position and that now they must live in the city where he had taken a furnished house for them They drove together to see it Strangely enough it seemed to be in the same street as mister Boffin s house and stranger yet the coach stopped at mister Boffin s own door Her husband put his arm around her and drew her in and she saw that everything was covered with flowers As he led her on she exclaimed in astonishment to see the little room full of birds just as she had wished Suddenly her husband opened a door and there was mister Boffin beaming and missus Boffin shedding tears of joy and folding her to her breast as she said My deary deary deary wife of John and mother of his little child My loving loving bright bright pretty pretty Welcome to your house and home my deary Then of course the whole story came out The mystery was solved and she knew that John Rokesmith was the true John Harmon and that her husband was really the man the Harmon will had picked out for her to marry In the splendid Boffin house they lived happily for many years surrounded by Bella s children And they were never so happy as when they welcomed Eugene Wrayburn with Lizzie his wife or Jennie Wren the little dolls dressmaker A TALE OF TWO CITIES PUBLISHED eighteen fifty nine Scene London and Paris Time seventeen seventy five to seventeen

Her mother had died when she was a baby in France and she lived alone with her old nurse Miss Pross a homely grim guardian with hair as red as her face who called Lucie ladybird and loved her very

Bastille a cold dark building like a castle with high gray towers a deep moat and drawbridge and soldiers and cannon to defend it In those days in France the rich nobles who belonged to the royal court were very powerful and overbearing and the rest of the people had few rights One could be put into prison then without any trial at all so that many innocent people suffered Lucie s mother had guessed that Doctor Manette for he was a physician had in some way incurred the hatred of some one of the nobles and had thus been taken from her but all she certainly knew was that he had disappeared one day in Paris and had never come back For a year she had tried in every way to find him but at length desolate and heartbroken she had fallen ill and died leaving little Lucie with only Miss Pross her English nurse to care for her mister Lorry himself who told Lucie this story having known her father had brought her a baby to London in his arms Now he told her after all these years her father had been released and was at that moment in Paris in charge of a man named Defarge who had once been his servant But the long imprisonment had affected his mind so that he was little more than the broken wreck of the man he had once been mister Lorry was about to go to Paris to identify him and he wished Lucie to go also to bring him to himself You can imagine that Lucie s heart was both glad and sorrowful at the news joyful that the father she had always believed dead was alive and yet full of grief for his condition She hastily made ready and that same day set out with mister Lorry for France When they reached Paris they went at once to find Defarge He was a stern forbidding man who kept a cheap wine shop in one of the poorer quarters of the city He took them through a dirty courtyard behind the shop and up five flights of filthy stairs to a door which he unlocked for them to enter In the dim room sat a withered white haired old man on a low bench making shoes His cheeks were worn and hollow his eyes were bright and his long beard was as white as snow He wore a ragged shirt and his hands were thin and transparent from confinement It was Lucie s father Doctor Manette He scarcely looked up when they entered for his mind was gone and he knew no one All that seemed to interest him was his shoemaking He had forgotten everything else He even thought his own name was One hundred and five North Tower which had been the number of his cell in the Bastille Lucie s heart almost broke to see him She wanted to throw her arms about him to lay her head on his breast and tell him she was his daughter who loved him and had come to take him home at last But she was afraid this would frighten him She came close to him and after a while he began to look at her She greatly resembled her dead mother and presently her face seemed to remind him of something He unwound a string from around his neck and unfolded a little rag which was tied to it and there was a lock of hair like Lucie s Then he suddenly burst into tears the first he had shed for long long years and the tears seemed to bring back a part of the past Lucie took him in her arms and soothed him while mister Lorry went to bring the coach that was to take them to England Through all their preparations for departure her father sat watching in a sort of scared wonder holding tight to Lucie s hand like a child and when they told him to come with them he descended the stairs obediently But he would not go into the coach without his bench and shoemaking tools and to quiet him they were obliged to take them too So the father and daughter and mister Lorry journeyed back to Lucie s home in London All the miles they rode Lucie held her father s hand and the touch seemed to give him strength and confidence On the boat crossing to London was a young man who called himself Charles Darnay handsome dark and pale He was most kind to Lucie and showed her how to make a couch on deck for her father and how she could shelter it from the wind In the long months that followed their arrival while the poor old man regained a measure of health she never forgot Darnay s face and his kindness to them Doctor Manette s mind and memory came slowly back with his improving health There were some days when his brain clouded Then Lucie would find him seated at his old prison bench making shoes and she would coax him away and talk to him until the insanity would pass away So time went by peacefully till a strange thing happened Charles Darnay who had been so kind to Lucie and her father on the boat was arrested on a charge of treason England at that time was not on good terms with France and Darnay who was of French birth was accused of selling information concerning the English forts and army to the French Government This was a very serious charge for men convicted of treason then were put to death in the cruelest ways that could be invented The charge was not true and Darnay himself knew quite well who was working against him The fact was that Charles Darnay was not his true name He was really Charles saint Evremonde the descendant of a rich and noble French family though he chose to live in London as Charles Darnay and earned his living by giving lessons in French He did this because he would not be one of the hated noble class of his own country who treated the poor so heartlessly In France the peasants had to pay many oppressive taxes and were wretched and half starved while the rich nobles rode in gilded coaches and if they ran over a little peasant child threw a coin to its mother and drove on without a further thought Among the hardest hearted of all and the most hated by the common people were the Evremondes the family of the young man who was now accused of treason As soon as he was old enough to know how unjust was his family s treatment of the poor who were dependent on them he had protested against it When he became a man he had refused to live on the money that was thus taken from the hungry peasantry and had left his home and come to London to earn his own way by teaching His heartless uncle the Marquis de saint Evremonde in France the head of the family hated the young man for this noble spirit It was this uncle who had invented the plot to accuse his nephew of treason He had hired a dishonest spy known as Barsad who swore he had found papers in Darnay s trunk that proved his guilt and as Darnay had been often back and forth to France on family matters the case looked dark for him Cruelly enough among those who were called to the trial as witnesses to show that Darnay had made these frequent journeys to France were Doctor Manette and Lucie because they had seen him on the boat during that memorable crossing Lucie s tears fell fast as she gave her testimony believing him innocent and knowing that her words would be used to condemn him Darnay would doubtless have been convicted but for a curious coincidence A dissipated young lawyer named Sydney Carton sitting in the court room had noticed with surprise that he himself looked very much like the prisoner in fact that they were so much alike they might almost have been taken for twin brothers He called the attention of Darnay s lawyer to this and the latter while one of the witnesses against Darnay was making oath that he had seen him in a certain place in France made Carton take off his wig all lawyers wear wigs in England while in court and stand up beside Darnay The two were so alike the witness was puzzled and he could not swear which of the two he had seen For this reason Darnay to Lucie s great joy was found not guilty Sydney Carton who had thought of and suggested this clever thing was a reckless besotted young man He cared for nobody and nobody he used to say cared for him He lacked energy and ambition to work and struggle for himself but for the sake of plenty of money with which to buy liquor he studied cases for another lawyer who was fast growing rich by his labor His master who hired him was the lion Carton was content through his own indolence and lack of purpose to be the jackal His conscience had always condemned him for this and now as he saw the innocent Darnay s look noble and straightforward so like himself as he might have been and as he thought of Lucie s sweet face and of how she had wept as she was forced to give testimony against the other Carton felt that he almost hated the man whose life he had saved The trial brought Lucie and these two men so like each other in feature yet so unlike in character together and afterward they often met at Doctor Manette s house It was in a quiet part of London that Lucie and her father lived all alone save for the faithful Miss Pross They had little furniture for they were quite poor but Lucie made the most of everything Doctor Manette had recovered his mind but not all of his memory Sometimes he would get up in the night and walk up and down up and down for hours At such times Lucie would hurry to him and walk up and down with him till he was calm again She never knew why he did this but she came to believe he was trying vainly to remember all that had happened in those lost years which he had forgotten He kept his prison bench and tools always by him but as time went on he gradually used them less and less often mister Lorry with his flaxen wig and constant smile came to tea every Sunday with them and helped to keep Doctor Manette cheerful Sometimes Darnay Sydney Carton and mister Lorry would meet there together but of them all Darnay came oftenest and soon it was easy to see that he was in love with Lucie Sydney Carton too was in love with her but he was perfectly aware that he was quite undeserving and that Lucie could never love him in return She was the last dream of his wild careless life the life he had wasted and thrown away Once he told her this and said that although he could never be anything to her himself he would give his life gladly to save any one who was near and dear to her Lucie fell in love with Darnay at length and one day they were married and went away on their wedding journey Until then since his rescue Lucie had never been out of Doctor Manette s sight Now though he was glad for her happiness yet he felt the pain of the separation so keenly that it unhinged his mind again Miss Pross and mister Lorry found him next morning making shoes at the old prison bench and for nine days he did not know them at all At last however he recovered and then lest the sight of it affect him one day when he was not there they chopped the bench to pieces and burned it up But her father was better after Lucie came back with her husband and they took up their quiet life again Darnay loved Lucie devotedly He supported himself still by teaching mister Lorry came from the bank oftener to tea and Sydney Carton more rarely and their life was peaceful and content Once after his marriage his cruel uncle the Marquis de saint Evremonde sent for Darnay to come to France on family matters Darnay went but declined to remain or to do the other s bidding But his uncle s evil life was soon to be ended While Darnay was there the marquis was murdered one night in his bed by a grief crazed laborer whose little child his carriage had run over Darnay returned to England shocked and horrified the more at the indifference of the life led by his race in France Although now by the death of his uncle he had himself become the Marquis de saint Evremonde yet he would not lay claim to the title and left all the estates in charge of one of the house servants an honest steward named Gabelle He had intended after his return to Lucie to settle all these affairs and to dispose of the property which he felt it wrong for him to hold but in the peace and happiness of his life in England he put it off and did nothing further And this neglect of Darnay s as important things neglected are apt to prove came before long to be the cause of terrible misfortune and agony to them all II DARNAY CAUGHT IN THE NET While these things were happening in London the one city of this tale other very different events were occurring in the other city of the story 
7988-113322-0000	train-other-500	Paris the French capital The indifference and harsh oppression of the court and the nobles toward the poor
none	none	 had gone on increasing 
7988-113322-0001	train-other-500	day by day and day by day the latter had grown more sullen and resentful All the while the downtrodden people of Paris were plotting secretly to rise in rebellion kill the king and queen and all the nobles
7988-113322-0002	train-other-500	seize their riches and govern France themselves
none	none	 The center of this plotting was Defarge the keeper of the wine shop who had cared for Doctor Manette when he had first been released from prison Defarge and those he trusted met and planned often in 
7988-113322-0003	train-other-500	the very room where mister Lorry and Lucie had found her father making shoes They kept a record of all acts of cruelty toward the poor committed by the nobility determining that when they themselves should be strong enough
7988-113322-0004	train-other-500	those thus guilty should be killed their fine houses burned and all their descendants put to death so that not even their names should remain in France This was a wicked and awful determination
7988-113322-0005	train-other-500	but these poor wretched people had been made to suffer all their lives and their parents before them and centuries of oppression had killed all their pity and made them as fierce as wild beasts that only wait
7988-113322-0006	train-other-500	for their cages to be opened to destroy all in their path They were afraid of course to keep any written list of persons whom they had thus condemned so Madame Defarge the wife of the wine seller
7988-113322-0007	train-other-500	used to knit the names in fine stitches into a long piece of knitting that she seemed always at work on Madame Defarge was a stout woman with big coarse hands and eyes that never seemed to look at any one yet saw everything that happened
7988-113322-0008	train-other-500	She was as strong as a man and every one was somewhat afraid of her She was even crueler and more resolute than her husband She would sit knitting all day long in the dirty wine shop watching and listening and knitting in the
7988-113322-0009	train-other-500	names of people whom she hoped soon to see killed One of the hated names that she knitted over and over again was Evremonde The laborer who in the madness of his grief for his dead child
none	none	 had murdered the Marquis de saint Evremonde 
7988-113322-0010	train-other-500	Darnay s hard hearted uncle
none	none	 had been caught and hanged 
7988-113322-0011	train-other-500	and because of this Defarge and his wife and the other plotters had condemned all of the name of Evremonde to death Meanwhile the king
none	none	 and queen of France and all their gay and careless court of nobles feasted and danced as heedlessly as ever They did not see the storm rising 
7988-113322-0012	train-other-500	The bitter taxes still went on The wine shop of Defarge looked as peaceful as ever but the men who drank there now were dreaming of murder and revenge And the half starved women
none	none	 who sat and looked on as the gilded coaches of the rich rolled through the streets 
7988-113322-0013	train-other-500	were sullenly waiting watching Madame Defarge as she silently knitted knitted into her work names of those whom the people had condemned to death without mercy One day
7988-113322-0014	train-other-500	this frightful human storm which for so many years had been gathering in France burst over Paris The poor people rose by thousands seized whatever weapons they could get guns axes or even stones of the street and
7988-113322-0015	train-other-500	led by Defarge and his tigerish wife set out to avenge their wrongs Their rage turned first of all against the Bastille the old stone prison in which so many of their kind had died
none	none	 where Doctor Manette for eighteen years had made shoes They beat down the thick walls and butchered the soldiers who defended it 
7988-113322-0016	train-other-500	and released the prisoners And wherever they saw one of the king s uniforms they hanged the wearer to the nearest lamp post
none	none	 It was the beginning of the terrible Revolution in France that was to end in the murder of thousands of innocent lives 
7988-113322-0017	train-other-500	It was the beginning of a time when Paris s streets were to run with blood when all the worst passions of the people were loosed and when they went mad with the joy of revenge The storm spread over France
7988-113322-0018	train-other-500	to the village where stood the great chateau of the Evremonde family and the peasants set fire to it and burned it to the ground And Gabelle the servant who had been left in charge by Darnay the new
7988-113322-0019	train-other-500	Marquis de saint Evremonde whom they had never seen but yet hated they seized and put in prison
none	none	 They stormed the royal palace and arrested the king and queen 
7988-113322-0020	train-other-500	threw all who bore noble names or titles into dungeons and as they had planned set up a government of their own Darnay safe in London with Lucie knew little and thought less of all this
7988-113322-0021	train-other-500	till he received a pitiful letter from Gabelle who expected each morning to be dragged out to be killed telling of the plight into which his faithfulness had brought him and beseeching his master s aid This letter
7988-113322-0022	train-other-500	made Darnay most uneasy He blamed himself because he knew it was his fault that Gabelle had been left so long in such a dangerous post He did not forget that his own family the Evremondes had been greatly hated
7988-113322-0023	train-other-500	But he thought the fact that he himself had refused to be one of them and had given his sympathy rather to the people they oppressed would make it possible for him to obtain Gabelle s release
none	none	 And with this idea he determined 
7988-113322-0024	train-other-500	to go himself to Paris He knew the very thought of his going now that France was mad with violence would frighten Lucie so he determined not to tell her He packed some clothing hurriedly
7988-113322-0025	train-other-500	and left secretly sending a letter back telling her where and why he was going And by the time she read this he was well on his way from England Darnay had expected to find no trouble in his errand and little personal risk in his journey
7988-113322-0026	train-other-500	but as soon as he landed on the shores of France he discovered his mistake He had only to give his real name the Marquis de saint Evremonde which he was obliged to do if he would help Gabelle
7988-113322-0027	train-other-500	and the title was the signal for rude threats and ill treatment Once in he could not go back and he felt as if a monstrous net were closing around him as indeed it was from which there was no escape
7988-113322-0028	train-other-500	He was sent on to Paris under a guard of soldiers and there he was at once put into prison to be tried and in all probability condemned to death as one of the hated noble class whom the people were now killing as fast as they could
7988-113322-0029	train-other-500	The great room of the prison to which he was taken Darnay found full of ladies and gentlemen most of them rich and titled the men chatting the women reading or doing embroidery all courteous and polite as if they sat in their own splendid homes
7988-113322-0030	train-other-500	instead of in a prison from which most of them
none	none	 could issue only to a dreadful death He was allowed to remain here only a few moments 
7988-113322-0031	train-other-500	then he was taken to an empty cell and left alone It happened that the bank of which mister Lorry was agent had an office also in Paris and the old gentleman had come there on business the day before Darnay arrived
7988-113322-0032	train-other-500	mister Lorry was an Englishman born and for him there was no danger He knew nothing of the arrest of Darnay until a day or two later when
none	none	 as he sat in his room 
7988-113322-0033	train-other-500	Doctor Manette and Lucie entered just arrived from London deeply agitated and in great fear for Darnay s safety As soon as Lucie had read her husband s letter she had followed at once with her father and Miss Pross Doctor Manette
7988-113322-0034	train-other-500	knowing Darnay s real name and title for before he married Lucie he had told her father everything concerning himself feared danger for him But he had reasoned that his own long imprisonment in the Bastille
7988-113322-0035	train-other-500	the building the people had first destroyed would make him a favorite and render him able to aid Darnay if danger came On the way they had heard the sad news of his arrest and had come at once to mister Lorry to consider what might best be done
7988-113322-0036	train-other-500	While they talked through the window they saw a great crowd of people come rushing into the courtyard of the building to sharpen weapons at a huge
none	none	 grindstone that stood there They were going to murder the prisoners with which the jails were by this time full 
7988-113322-0037	train-other-500	Fearful that he would be too late to save Darnay Doctor Manette rushed to the yard his white hair streaming in the wind and told the leaders of the mob who he was how he had been imprisoned for eighteen years in the Bastille
7988-113322-0038	train-other-500	and that now one of his kindred by some unknown error had been seized They cheered him lifted him on their shoulders and rushed away to demand for him the release of Darnay
none	none	 while Lucie in tears with mister Lorry and Miss Pross 
7988-113322-0039	train-other-500	waited all night for tidings But none came that night The rescue had not proved easy Next day Defarge the wine shop keeper brought a short note to Lucie from Darnay at the prison
none	none	 but it was four days before Doctor Manette returned to the house 
7988-113322-0040	train-other-500	He had indeed by the story of his own sufferings saved Darnay s life for the time being but the prisoner he had been told could not be released without trial For this trial they waited day after day
7988-113322-0041	train-other-500	The time passed slowly and terribly Prisoners were no longer murdered without trial but few escaped the death penalty The king and queen were beheaded
7988-113322-0042	train-other-500	Thousands were put to death merely on suspicion and thousands more were thrown into prison to await their turn This was that dreadful period which has always since been called The Reign of Terror when no one felt sure of his safety
7988-113322-0043	train-other-500	There was a certain window in the prison through which Darnay sometimes found a chance to look and from which he could see one dingy street corner On this corner every afternoon Lucie took her station for hours
7988-113322-0044	train-other-500	rain or shine She never missed a day and thus at long intervals her husband got a view of her
none	none	 So months passed till a year had gone 
7988-113322-0045	train-other-500	All the while Doctor Manette
none	none	 now become a well known figure in Paris worked hard for Darnay s release 
7988-113322-0046	train-other-500	And at length his turn came to be tried and he was brought before the drunken ignorant men who called themselves judge and jury
7988-113322-0047	train-other-500	He told how he had years before renounced his family and title left France and supported himself rather than be a burden on the peasantry He told how he had married a woman of French birth the only daughter of the good Doctor Manette
7988-113322-0048	train-other-500	whom all Paris knew and had come to Paris now of his own accord to help a poor servant who was in danger through his fault The story caught the fancy of the changeable crowd in the room They cheered and applauded it
none	none	 When he was acquitted they were quite as pleased as if he had been condemned to be beheaded 
7988-113322-0049	train-other-500	and put him in a great chair and carried him home in triumph to Lucie There was only one there perhaps who did not rejoice at the result and that was the cold cruel wife of the wine seller Madame Defarge
none	none	 who had knitted the name Evremonde so many times into her knitting III SYDNEY CARTON S SACRIFICE 
7988-113323-0000	train-other-500	That same night of his release all the happiness of Darnay and Lucie was suddenly broken Soldiers came and again arrested him Defarge and his wife were the accusers this time and he was to be retried
7988-113323-0001	train-other-500	The first one to bring this fresh piece of bad news to mister Lorry was Sydney Carton the reckless and dissipated young lawyer Probably he had heard in London of Lucie s trouble and out of his love for her
7988-113323-0002	train-other-500	which he always carried hidden in his heart had come to Paris to try to aid her husband He had arrived only to hear at the same time of the acquittal and the rearrest
7988-113323-0003	train-other-500	As Carton walked along the street thinking sadly of Lucie s new grief he saw a man whose face and figure seemed familiar Following he soon recognized him as the English spy Barsad
none	none	 whose false testimony years before in London had come so near convicting Darnay when he was tried for treason 
7988-113323-0004	train-other-500	Barsad who as it happened was now a turnkey in the very prison where Darnay was confined had left London to become a spy in France first on the side of the king and then on the side of the people
7988-113323-0005	train-other-500	At the time of this story England was so hated by France that if the people had known of Barsad s career in London
none	none	 they would have cut off his head at once Carton who was well aware of this threatened the spy with his knowledge and made him swear that if worst 
7988-113323-0006	train-other-500	came to worst and Darnay were condemned he would admit Carton to the cell to see him once before he was taken to execution
none	none	 Why Carton asked this Barsad could not guess but 
7988-113323-0007	train-other-500	to save himself he had to promise Next day Darnay was tried for the second time When the judge asked for the accusation Defarge laid a paper before him
7988-113323-0008	train-other-500	It was a letter that had been found when the Bastille fell in the cell that had been occupied for eighteen years by Doctor Manette
none	none	 He had written it before his reason left him 
7988-113323-0009	train-other-500	and hidden it behind a loosened stone in the wall and in it he had told the story of his own
none	none	 unjust arrest 
7988-113323-0010	train-other-500	Defarge read it aloud to the jury And this was the terrible tale it told The Marquis de saint Evremonde the cruel uncle of Darnay when he was a young man
none	none	 had dreadfully wronged a young peasant woman had caused her husband s death and killed her brother with his own hand 
7988-113323-0011	train-other-500	As the brother lay dying from the sword wound Doctor Manette
none	none	 then also a young man 
7988-113323-0012	train-other-500	had been called to attend him and so by accident had learned the whole Horrified at the wicked wrong he wrote of it in a letter to the Minister of Justice The Marquis whom it accused learned of this and
7988-113323-0013	train-other-500	to put Doctor Manette out of the way had him arrested secretly taken from his wife and baby daughter
none	none	 and thrown into a secret cell 
7988-113323-0014	train-other-500	of the Bastille where he had lived those eighteen years not knowing whether his wife and child lived or died He waited ten years for release and when none came at last feeling his mind giving way he wrote the account
7988-113323-0015	train-other-500	which he concealed in the cell wall denouncing the family of Evremonde and all their descendants The reading of this paper by Defarge as may be guessed aroused all the murderous passions of the people in the court room
7988-113323-0016	train-other-500	There was a further reason for Madame Defarge s hatred for the poor woman whom Darnay s uncle had so wronged had been her own sister In vain old Doctor Manette pleaded
7988-113323-0017	train-other-500	That his own daughter was now Darnay s wife made no difference in their eyes The jury at once found Darnay guilty and sentenced him to die by the guillotine the next morning Lucie fainted when the sentence was pronounced Sydney Carton who had witnessed the trial
7988-113323-0018	train-other-500	lifted her and bore her to a carriage When they reached home he carried her up the stairs and laid her on a couch Before he went he bent down and touched her cheek with his lips and they heard him whisper For a life you love
none	none	 They did not know until next 
7988-113323-0019	train-other-500	day what he meant Carton had in fact formed a desperate plan to rescue Lucie s husband whom he so much resembled in face and figure even though it meant his own death
7988-113323-0020	train-other-500	He went to mister Lorry and made him promise to have ready next morning passports and a coach and swift horses to leave Paris for England with Doctor Manette Lucie and himself telling him that if they delayed longer Lucie s life and her father s also would be lost
7988-113323-0021	train-other-500	Next Carton bought a quantity of a drug whose fumes would render a man insensible and with this in his pocket early next morning he went to the spy Barsad and bade him redeem his promise and take him to the cell where Darnay waited for the signal of death
7988-113323-0022	train-other-500	Darnay was seated writing a last letter to Lucie when Carton entered Pretending that he wished him to write something that he dictated Carton stood over him and held
none	none	 the phial 
7988-113323-0023	train-other-500	of the drug to his face In a moment the other was unconscious Then Carton changed clothes with him and called in the spy
7988-113323-0024	train-other-500	directing him to take the unconscious man who now seemed to be Sydney Carton instead of Charles Darnay to mister Lorry s house He himself was to take the prisoner s place and suffer the penalty The plan worked well Darnay who would not have allowed
7988-113323-0025	train-other-500	this sacrifice if he had known was carried safely and without discovery past the guards mister Lorry guessing what had happened when he saw the unconscious figure took coach at once with him Doctor Manette

7988-113323-0027	train-other-500	The latter had made up her mind as Carton had suspected to denounce Lucie also It was against the law to mourn for any one who had been condemned as an enemy to France and the woman was sure of course that Lucie would be mourning for her husband

none	none	 When Madame Defarge entered Miss Pross read the hatred and evil purpose in her face 
7988-113323-0029	train-other-500	The grim old nurse knew if it were known that Lucie had gone the coach would be pursued and brought back So she planted herself in front of the door of Lucie s room and would not let Madame Defarge open it
7988-113323-0030	train-other-500	The savage Frenchwoman tried to tear her away but Miss Pross seized her around the waist and held her back The other drew a loaded pistol from her breast to shoot her but in the struggle it went off and killed Madame Defarge herself
7988-113323-0031	train-other-500	Then Miss Pross all of a tremble locked the door threw the key into the river took a carriage and followed after the coach Not long after the unconscious Darnay with Lucie and Doctor Manette

7988-113323-0034	train-other-500	all the way and comforted her to the end Cruel women of the people sat about the guillotine knitting and counting with their stitches as each poor victim died And when Carton s turn came thinking he was Darnay

Englishman named Jarndyce once upon a time having made a great fortune died and left a great will The persons appointed to carry out its provisions could not agree they fell to disputing among themselves and went to law over it The court which in England decides such suits is called the Court of Chancery Its action is slow and its delays many so that men generally consider it a huge misfortune to be obliged to have anything to do with it Sometimes it has kept cases undecided for many years till the heirs concerned were dead and gone and often when the decision came at last there was no money left to be divided because it had all been eaten up by the costs of the suit Lawyers inherited some cases from their fathers who themselves had made a living by them and many suits had become so twisted that nobody alive could have told at last what they really meant Such came to be the case with the Jarndyce will It had been tried for so many years that the very name had become a joke Those who began it were long since dead and their heirs either knew nothing of it or had given up hope of its ever being ended The only one who seemed to be interested in it was a little old woman named Miss Flite whom delay and despair in a suit of her own had made half crazy For many years she had attended the Chancery Court every day and many thoughtless people made fun of her She was wretchedly poor and lived in a small room over a rag and bottle shop kept by a man named Krook Here she had a great number of birds in little cages larks and linnets and goldfinches She had given them names to represent the different things which the cruel Chancery Court required to carry on these shameful suits such as Hope Youth Rest Ashes Ruin Despair Madness Folly Words Plunder and Jargon She used to say that when the Jarndyce case was decided she would open the cages and let the birds all go The last Jarndyce that was left had given up in disgust all thought of the famous lawsuit and steadfastly refused to have anything to do with it He lived quietly in the country in a big bare building called Bleak House He was past middle age and his hair was silver gray but he was straight and strong and merry He was rich yet was so tender hearted and benevolent that all who knew him loved him Most of his good deeds he never told for he had a great dislike to being thanked It used to be said that once after he had done an extremely generous thing for a relative of his seeing her coming in the front gate to thank him he escaped by the back door and was not seen again for three months He never spoke ill of his neighbors and whenever he was vexed he would pretend to look for a weather cock and say Dear dear The wind must be coming from the east It happened finally that all the other Jarndyce heirs had died except two a young girl named Ada Clare and a young man named Richard Carstone These two who were cousins were left orphans The master of Bleak House therefore in the goodness of his heart offered them a home with him and this they thankfully accepted mister Jarndyce now wished to find a companion for Ada Clare and this is how Esther Summerson comes into this story Esther was a sweet girl who had been brought up by a stern hard hearted woman whom she had always called godmother in ignorance of her parentage She had never known who were her mother or father for from earliest babyhood her godmother had forbidden her to ask questions concerning them and she would have had a sad and lonely youth but for her sunny disposition It was not till her godmother died suddenly that she found she had a guardian and that he was mister Jarndyce of Bleak House How he came to be her guardian was a mystery to her but she was glad to find herself not altogether friendless Although he had taken the pains to see her more than once and had noticed with pleasure what a cheerful loving nature she had yet Esther had never so far as she knew seen him so that she received his invitation to come and live at Bleak House with joyful surprise She went on the day appointed to London and there she met Ada whom she began to love at once and Richard a handsome careless young fellow of nineteen They spent the day together and got well acquainted before they took the morrow s coach to Bleak House At the Chancery Court they met poor crazy little Miss Flite who insisted on taking them to her room above the rag and bottle shop to show them her caged birds And that night as they had been directed they stayed at the house of a missus Jellyby of whom mister Jarndyce had heard as a woman of great charity missus Jellyby was a woman with a mission which mission was the education of the natives of Borrioboola Gha in Africa and the cultivation there of the coffee bean She thought of nothing else and was for ever sending out letters or pamphlets about it But she seemed unable to see or think of anything nearer home than Africa The house was unswept the children dirty and always under foot and the meals half cooked She would sit all day in slipshod slippers and a dress that did not meet in the back drinking coffee and dictating to her eldest daughter Caddy who hated Africa and all its natives letters about coffee cultivation and the uplifting of the natives of Borrioboola Gha A very strange sort of philanthropist both Esther and Ada thought missus Jellyby Perhaps however mister Jarndyce sent them there for a useful lesson for he afterward asked them what they thought of her and he seemed well pleased to learn that they considered her ideas of doing good in the world extremely odd Next day they drove to Bleak House Not one of them had ever seen mister Jarndyce but they found him all they had imagined and more the kindest pleasantest and most thoughtful person in the world Before they had been there two days they felt as if they had known him all their lives Bleak House was a building where one went up and down steps from one room to another and where there were always more rooms when one thought he had seen them all In the daytime there was horseback riding or walking to amuse them and in the evenings Ada often sang and played to the rest Altogether the time flew by most pleasantly and judging by mister Jarndyce s jollity the wind seldom showed any signs of coming from the east It was soon clear to everybody that Richard was in love with Ada and that Ada was beginning to love him in return This pleased mister Jarndyce for he was fond of both But he was fondest of Esther He made her his housekeeper and she carried a big bunch of keys and kept the house as clean as a new pin He used to say she reminded him of Little old woman and whither so high To sweep the cobwebs out of the sky She was so cheerful he said she would sweep the cobwebs out of anybody s sky And from this they took to calling her Little Old Woman and Cobweb and Mother Hubbard till none of them thought of her real name at all Bleak House had a number of visitors who came more or less often One of these was an old school friend of mister Jarndyce s named Boythorn He was a big blustering man with a laugh as big as himself Wherever he went he carried a tiny tame canary that used to sit at meal time perched on the top of his great shaggy head It was odd to see this wee bird sitting there unafraid even at one of his ha ha ha s that shook the whole house mister Boythorn was exceedingly tender hearted but took delight in pretending to be the stubbornest most cross grained worst tempered individual possible His neighbor was Sir Leicester Dedlock a dignified and proud old baronet and him mister Boythorn loved to keep in perpetual anger by bringing against him all manner of lawsuits regarding the boundary between their land Another visitor whom Esther found amusing was Harold Skimpole a light bright creature of charming manners with a large head and full of simple gaiety He was a man who seemed to trifle with everything He sang a little composed a little and sketched a little But his songs were never completed and his sketches never finished His aim in life seemed to be to avoid all responsibility and to find some one else to pay his debts He always spoke of himself as a child though he was middle aged He claimed to have no idea whatever of the value of money He would take a handful of coins from his pocket and say laughing Now there s some money I have no idea how much I don t know how to count it I dare say I owe more than that If good natured people don t stop letting me owe them why should I There you have Harold Skimpole mister Jarndyce was far too honest and innocent himself to see through the man s hollow selfishness and was continually paying his debts as they soon learned Most of all Bleak House s visitors Esther came to like Allan Woodcourt a handsome dark haired young surgeon and before long she found herself unconsciously looking and longing for his coming Woodcourt was poor however and although he was in love with Esther he did not tell her but soon sailed away on a long voyage as a ship s doctor II LADY DEDLOCK S SECRET Sir Leicester Dedlock whom mister Boythorn so loved to torment was seventy years old 
7679-113325-0000	train-other-500	His wife many years younger than himself he had married for love Lady Dedlock was not noble by birth no one indeed knew who she had been before her marriage but she was very beautiful
7679-113325-0001	train-other-500	She was as proud and haughty too as she was lovely and was much sought after But with all her popularity she had few close friends and no one in whom she confided Even her housekeeper
7679-113325-0002	train-other-500	missus Rouncewell a fine handsome old woman who had been Sir Leicester s servant for fifty years thought her cold and reserved missus Rouncewell herself had had a son George who many years before had gone off to be a soldier and had never come back
7679-113325-0003	train-other-500	and looking at her mistress s face
none	none	 she often wondered if the shadow of pain there was the mark of some old grief or loss of which no one knew 
7679-113325-0004	train-other-500	However that may have been the old baronet loved his wife and was very proud of her Sir Leicester s family lawyer was named Tulkinghorn He was a dull dignified man who always dressed in black and seldom spoke unless he had to
7679-113325-0005	train-other-500	His one passion was the discovery of other people s secrets He knew more family secrets than any one else in London and to discover a new one he would have risked all his fortune Now
none	none	 among the very many persons connected in some way or other with the famous Jarndyce case 
7679-113325-0006	train-other-500	which seemed destined never to end was Sir Leicester Dedlock and one day the Chancery Court having actually made a little progress mister Tulkinghorn brought the baronet some legal papers to read to him As the lawyer held one in his hand
7679-113325-0007	train-other-500	Lady Dedlock seeing the handwriting asked in an agitated voice who had written it He answered that it was the work of one of his copyists A moment later as he went on reading they found that Lady Dedlock had fainted away
7679-113325-0008	train-other-500	Her husband did not connect her faintness with the paper but mister Tulkinghorn did and that instant he determined that Lady Dedlock had a secret
none	none	 that this secret had something to do with the copyist 
7679-113325-0009	train-other-500	and that what this secret was he Tulkinghorn would discover
none	none	 He easily found that the writing had been done by a man who called himself Nemo 
7679-113325-0010	train-other-500	and who lived above Krook s rag and bottle shop a neighbor to crazy little Miss Flite of the Chancery Court and the many bird cages Krook himself was an ignorant spectacled old rascal whose sole occupations seemed to be to sleep and to drink gin
none	none	 a bottle of which stood always near him 
7679-113325-0011	train-other-500	His only intimate was a big gray evil tempered cat called Lady Jane
none	none	 who when not lying in wait for Miss Flite s birds used to sit on his shoulder with her tail sticking straight up like a hairy feather 
7679-113325-0012	train-other-500	People in the neighborhood called his dirty shop the Court of Chancery because like that other court it had so many old things in it and whatever its owner once got into it never got out again
none	none	 In return for mister Tulkinghorn s money 
7679-113325-0013	train-other-500	Krook told him all he knew about his lodger Nemo it seemed was surly and dissipated and did what legal copying he could get to do in order to buy opium with which he drugged himself daily So far as was known he had but one friend
7679-113325-0014	train-other-500	Joe a wretched crossing sweeper to whom when he had it he often gave a coin Thus much the lawyer learned but from the strange lodger himself he learned nothing
none	none	 For when Krook took him to the room Nemo occupied 
7679-113325-0015	train-other-500	they found the latter stretched on his couch dead whether by accident or design no one could tell of an overdose of opium Curious to see how Lady Dedlock would receive this news
7679-113325-0016	train-other-500	mister Tulkinghorn called on her and told her of the unknown man s death She pretended to listen with little interest but his trained eye saw that she was deeply moved by it
7679-113325-0017	train-other-500	and he became more anxious than ever to find out what connection there could be between this proud and titled woman and the miserable copyist who had lived and died in squalor Chance favored mister Tulkinghorn s object
7679-113325-0018	train-other-500	One night he saw Joe the ragged crossing sweeper pointing out to a woman whose face was hidden by a veil and whose form was closely wrapped in a French shawl
none	none	 the gate of the cemetery where Nemo had been buried 
7679-113325-0019	train-other-500	Later at Sir Leicester s
none	none	 he saw Lady Dedlock s maid Hortense 
7679-113325-0020	train-other-500	a black haired jealous French woman with wolf like ways wearing the same shawl He cunningly entrapped the maid into coming to his house one night wearing both veil and shawl and there brought her unexpectedly face to face with Joe
7679-113325-0021	train-other-500	By the boy s actions mister Tulkinghorn decided at once that Joe had never seen Hortense before and that instant he guessed the truth that the veiled woman who had gone to the cemetery was really Lady Dedlock herself
7679-113325-0022	train-other-500	and that she had worn her maid s clothes to mislead any observer This was a clever trick in the lawyer but it proved too clever for his own good for finding she had been enticed there for some deeper purpose Hortense flew into a passion with him
7679-113325-0023	train-other-500	He sneered at her and turned her out into the street threatening if she troubled him to have her put into prison Because of this she began to hate him with a fierceness which he did not guess
none	none	 mister Tulkinghorn felt himself getting nearer to his goal But he now had to find out who Nemo really had been If he had only known it Krook could have aided him The old man had found a bundle of old letters in Nemo s room after his death and these were all addressed to Captain Hawdon Krook himself could not read except enough to spell out an address and he had no idea what the letters contained But he was quick to think the bundle might be worth some money So he put it carefully away 
7679-113325-0024	train-other-500	But mister Tulkinghorn found out nothing from Krook for one day a strange thing happened
none	none	 Krook had drunk so much gin in his life that he had become perfectly soaked with alcohol so that he was just like a big spongeful of it 
7679-113325-0025	train-other-500	Now it is a curious fact that when a great mass of inflammable material is heaped together sometimes it will suddenly burst into flame and burn up all in a minute without anything or anybody setting fire to it
7679-113325-0026	train-other-500	This is just what happened to Krook As he stood in the middle of the dirty shop without any warning all in a twinkling he blazed up and burned clothes and all and in less time than it takes to tell it there was nothing left but a little pile of ashes
7679-113325-0027	train-other-500	a burnt mark in the floor and a sticky smoke that stuck to the window panes and hung in the air like soot And this was all the neighbors found when they came to search for him This was the end of Krook
7679-113325-0028	train-other-500	and the rag and bottle shop was taken possession of by Grandfather Smallweed a hideous crippled money lender who had been his brother in law and who at once went to work ransacking all the papers he could find on the premises
7679-113325-0029	train-other-500	Grandfather Smallweed was a thin toothless wheezy green eyed old miser who was so nearly dead from age and asthma that he had to be wheeled about by his granddaughter Judy He had a wife who was out of her mind
7679-113325-0030	train-other-500	Everything said in her hearing she connected with the idea of money If one said for example It s twenty minutes past noon missus Smallweed would at once begin to gabble Twenty pence Twenty pounds Twenty thousand millions of bank notes locked up in a black box
7679-113325-0031	train-other-500	and she would not stop till her husband threw a cushion at her which he kept beside him for that very purpose and knocked her mouth shut Grandfather Smallweed soon discovered the bundle of letters hidden back of the shelf where Lady Jane
7679-113325-0032	train-other-500	Krook s big cat slept The name they bore Captain Hawdon was familiar enough to the money lender Long ago when Hawdon was living a dissipated life in London he had borrowed money from Grandfather Smallweed
7679-113325-0033	train-other-500	and this money was still unpaid when he had disappeared It was said that he had fallen overboard from a vessel and had been drowned To think now that the captain had been living as a copyist all these years in London free from arrest for the debt
7679-113325-0034	train-other-500	filled the wizened soul of the old man with rage He was ready enough to talk when mister Tulkinghorn questioned him and finally sold him the bundle of letters The lawyer saw that they were in Lady Dedlock s penmanship
none	none	 it remained to prove that the dead Nemo had really been Captain Hawdon 
7679-113325-0035	train-other-500	mister Tulkinghorn of course had many specimens of the copyist s hand and after much search he found a man who had once been a fellow soldier of the captain s He was called mister George and kept a shooting gallery
7679-113325-0036	train-other-500	mister George had among his papers a letter once written him by Captain Hawdon and not knowing the purpose for which it was to be used loaned it to the lawyer The handwriting was the same And thus mister Tulkinghorn knew that the copyist had really been Captain Hawdon
7679-113325-0037	train-other-500	and that the letters in the bundle had once been written to him by the woman who was now the haughty Lady Dedlock It was a strange sad story that the letters disclosed as mister Tulkinghorn gloating over his success read them line by line
7679-113325-0038	train-other-500	The man who had fallen so low as to drag out a wretched existence by copying law papers whom until she saw the handwriting in the lawyer s hands she had believed to be dead was a man Lady Dedlock had once loved
7679-113325-0039	train-other-500	Many years before when a young woman she had run away from home with him A little child was born to them whom she named Esther When she and Hawdon had separated her sister to hide from the world the knowledge of the elopement
7679-113325-0040	train-other-500	had told her the baby Esther was dead had taken the child to another part of the country given her the name of Summerson and calling herself her godmother instead of her aunt brought her up in ignorance of the truth Years had gone by and Captain Hawdon was reported drowned
7679-113325-0041	train-other-500	At length the little Esther s mother had met and married Sir Leicester Dedlock and in his love and protection had thought her dark past buried from view for ever All this the pitiless lawyer read in the letters
none	none	 and knew that Lady Dedlock s happiness was now in his hands And as he thought how with this knowledge he could torture her with the fear of discovery 
7679-113325-0042	train-other-500	his face took on the look of a cat s when it plays with a mouse it has caught Meanwhile Lady Dedlock had suffered much The knowledge that Hawdon had not been drowned as she had supposed had come to her like a thunderclap
7679-113325-0043	train-other-500	And the news of his death following so soon after this discovery had unnerved her She felt mister Tulkinghorn s suspicious eyes watching her always and began to tremble in dread of what he might know
7679-113325-0044	train-other-500	In the midst of these fears she accidentally discovered one day that the baby name of Esther Summerson of Bleak House had been not Summerson but Hawdon This made Lady Dedlock guess the whole truth that Esther was in reality her own daughter
none	none	 As soon as she was alone she threw herself on her knees in the empty room with sobs crying 
7679-113325-0045	train-other-500	Oh my child My child Not dead in the first hours of her life as my cruel sister told me but sternly nurtured by her after she had renounced me and my name
none	none	 Oh my child My child III LITTLE JOE PLAYS A PART While these events which so closely concerned Esther were occurring in London life at Bleak House went quietly on Ada and Esther had become bosom friends and both loved and respected mister Jarndyce above every one Harold Skimpole as charming and careless as ever and as willing as ever that some one else should pay his debts for him was often there and whenever they went to the city they saw Miss Flite and missus Jellyby the latter still busily sending letters about the growing of coffee and the education of the natives of Borrioboola Gha Esther grew especially to like Caddy the slipshod daughter to whom missus Jellyby dictated her letters The poor girl had much good in her and Esther encouraged and helped her all she could Caddy finally fell in love with Prince Turveydrop a blue eyed flaxen haired young man whose father kept a dancing school Old mister Turveydrop his father was a fat man with a false complexion false teeth false whiskers a wig and a padded chest He always carried a cane eye glass and snuff box and was so tightly buttoned up that when he bowed you could almost see creases come into the whites of his eyes He thought himself a model of politeness and stood about to show off his clothes while he made his son Prince do all the teaching Caddy was so tired of hearing about Africa that at last she married Prince and moved into the Turveydrop dancing school and missus Jellyby had to hire a boy to help her with her great plans for the education of the natives of Borrioboola Gha Once Esther and Ada went with mister Jarndyce to visit mister Boythorn the man with the tremendous laugh and the pet canary at his country house where he lived in one perpetual quarrel with his neighbor Sir Leicester Dedlock Esther had often heard of the beauty of Lady Dedlock and one Sunday in the village church she saw her There was something strangely familiar in her look that reminded Esther of her godmother An odd sensation came over her then and she felt her heart beat quickly But this was before Lady Dedlock had guessed the truth and Esther and she did not meet Richard Carstone had soon begun to be a source of great anxiety to all at Bleak House It was plainly to be seen that he loved Ada dearly and that she loved him as well but to mister Jarndyce s regret he had begun to think and dream of the famous chancery suit and of the fortune that would be his when it ended mister Jarndyce from his own bitter experience hated the Chancery Court and everything connected with it and saw with grief that Richard was growing to be a ne er do well who found it easier to trust in the future than to labor in the present In spite of all advice Richard went from bad to worse He began the study of medicine soon changed this for law and lastly decided to enter the army He was naturally a spendthrift and as long as his money lasted Harold Skimpole found him a very fine friend and helped him spend it Skimpole also introduced to him a knavish lawyer named Vholes who made him believe the great chancery suit must soon end in his favor and who when Richard had put the case in his hands proceeded to rob him of all he had He poisoned his mind too against mister Jarndyce so that Richard began to think his truest friend deceitful Ada saw this with pain but she loved Richard above all else and the more so when she saw him so wretched and deceived and at last without telling either mister Jarndyce or Esther what she was going to do she went to Richard one day and married him so that as her husband he could take the little fortune she possessed to pay Vholes to go on with the chancery suit A great misfortune befell Esther about this time a misfortune that came to her strangely enough through little Joe the crossing sweeper Half starved ragged and homeless all his life Joe had never known kindness save that given to him by the poor copyist who had lived above Krook s rag and bottle shop He lived if having a corner to sleep in can be called living in a filthy alley called Tom all Alone s It seemed to him that every one he met told him to move on The policeman the shopkeepers at whose doors he stopped for warmth all told him to move on till the wretched lad wondered if there was any spot in London where he could rest undisturbed mister Tulkinghorn in his search to find out the woman who had hired Joe to show her the cemetery had dogged him so with his detective that at length the lad had become frightened and left London for the open country There he was taken very ill and on the highway near Bleak House one evening Esther found him helpless and delirious with fever Touched by his condition she had him taken at once to Bleak House and put to bed intending when morning came to send for a doctor But in the morning little Joe was missing Though they searched high and low he was not to be found and they decided that in his delirium he had taken to the road again It was not till long after that Esther found his leaving had been brought about by Harold Skimpole who was then visiting Bleak House and who in his selfishness feared the boy might be the bearer of some contagious disease This unfortunately proved to be the case Joe s illness was smallpox and a few days later a maid of Esther s fell ill with it Esther nursed her day and night and just as she was recovering was stricken with it herself In her unselfishness and love for the rest before unconsciousness came she made the maid promise faithfully to allow no one particularly neither mister Jarndyce nor her beloved Ada to enter the room till all danger was past For many days Esther hovered between life and death and all the time the maid kept her word Caddy came from the Turveydrop dancing school early and late and little Miss Flite walked the twenty miles from London in thin shoes to inquire for her And at length slowly she began to grow well again But the disease had left its terrible mark When she first looked in a mirror she found that her beauty was gone and her face strangely altered This was a great grief to her at first but on the day when mister Jarndyce came into her sick room and held her in his arms and said My dear dear girl she thought He has seen me and is fonder of me than before So what have I to mourn for She thought of Allan Woodcourt too the young surgeon somewhere on the sea and she was glad that if he had loved her before he sailed away he had not told her so Now she told herself when they met again and he saw her so sadly changed he would have given her no promise he need regret When she was able to travel Esther went for a short stay at the house of mister Boythorn and there walking under the trees she grew stronger One day as she sat in the park that surrounded the house she saw Lady Dedlock coming toward her and seeing how pale and agitated she was Esther felt the same odd sensation she had felt in the church Lady Dedlock threw herself sobbing at her feet and put her arms around her and kissed her as she told her that she was her unhappy mother who must keep her secret for the sake of her husband Sir Leicester Esther thought her heart must break with both grief and joy at once But she comforted Lady Dedlock and told her nothing would ever change her love for her and they parted with tears and kisses Another surprise of a different sort awaited Esther on her return to Bleak House mister Jarndyce told her that he loved her and asked her if she would marry him And remembering how tender he had always been and knowing that he loved her in spite of her disfigured face she said yes But one day the very day he returned Esther saw Allan Woodcourt on the street Somehow at the first glimpse of him she knew that she had loved him all along Then she remembered that she had promised to marry mister Jarndyce and she began to tremble and ran away without speaking to Woodcourt at all But they soon met and this time it was Joe the crossing sweeper who brought them together Woodcourt found the poor ragged wanderer in the street so ill that he could hardly walk He had recovered from smallpox but it had left him so weak that he had become a prey to consumption The kind hearted surgeon took the boy to little Miss Flite and they found him a place to stay in mister George s shooting gallery where they did what they could for him and where Esther and mister Jarndyce came to see him Joe was greatly troubled when he learned he had brought the smallpox to Bleak House and one day he got some one to write out for him in very large letters that he was sorry and hoped Esther and all the others would forgive him And this was his will On the last day Allan Woodcourt sat beside him Joe my poor fellow he said I hear you sir but it s dark let me catch your hand Joe can you say what I say I ll say anything as you do sir for I know it s good Our Father Our Father yes that s very good sir Which art in Heaven Art in Heaven Is the light a comin sir Hallowed be thy name Hallowed be thy But the light had come at last Little Joe was dead IV ESTHER BECOMES THE MISTRESS OF BLEAK HOUSE When the last bit of proof was fast in his possession mister Tulkinghorn pluming himself on the cleverness with which he had wormed his way into Lady Dedlock s secret went to her at her London home and informed her of all he had discovered delighting in the fear and dread which she could not help showing She knew now that this cruel man would always hold his knowledge over her head torturing her with the threat of making it known to her husband Some hours after he had gone home she followed him there to beg him not to tell her husband what he had discovered But all was dark in the lawyer s house She rang the private bell twice but there was no answer and she returned in despair By a coincidence some one else had been seen to call at mister Tulkinghorn s that same night This was mister George of the shooting gallery who came to get back the letter he had loaned to the lawyer When morning came it was found that a dreadful deed had been done that night mister Tulkinghorn was found lying dead on the floor of his private apartment shot through the heart All the secrets he had so cunningly discovered and gloated over with such delight had not been able to save his life there in that room mister Tulkinghorn was so well known that the murder made a great sensation The police went at once to the shooting gallery to arrest mister George and he was put into jail He was able later to prove his innocence however and all in all his arrest turned out to be a fortunate thing For by means of it old missus Rouncewell Lady Dedlock s housekeeper discovered that he was her own son George who had gone off to be a soldier so many years before He had made up his mind not to return till he was prospering But somehow this time had never come bad fortune had followed him and he had been ashamed to go back But though he had acted so wrongly he had never lost his love for his mother and was glad to give up the shooting gallery and go with missus Rouncewell to become Sir Leicester s personal attendant At first after the death of mister Tulkinghorn Lady Dedlock had hoped that her dread and fear were now ended but she soon found that this was not to be The telltale bundle of letters was in the possession of a detective whom the cruel lawyer had long ago called to his aid and the detective thinking Lady Dedlock herself might have had something to do with the murder thought it his duty to tell all that his dead employer had discovered to Sir Leicester It was a fearful shock to the haughty baronet to find so many tongues had been busy with the name his wife had borne so proudly When the detective finished Sir Leicester fell unconscious and when he came to his senses had lost the power to speak They laid him on his bed sent for doctors and went to tell Lady Dedlock but she had disappeared Almost at one and the same moment the unhappy woman had learned not only that the detective had told his story to Sir Leicester but that she herself was suspected of the murder These two blows were more than she could bear She put on a cloak and veil and leaving all her money and jewels behind her with a note for her husband went out into the shrill frosty wind The note read If I am sought for or accused of his murder believe I am wholly innocent I have no home left I will trouble you no more May you forget me and forgive me They gave Sir Leicester this note and great agony came to the stricken man s heart He had always loved and honored her and he loved her no less now for what had been told him Nor did he believe for a moment that she could be guilty of the murder He wrote on a slate the words Forgive find and the detective started at once to overtake the fleeing woman He went first to Esther to whom he told the sad outcome and together they began the search For two days they labored tracing Lady Dedlock s movements step by step through the pelting snow and wind across the frozen wastes outside of London where brick kilns burned and where she had exchanged clothes with a poor laboring woman the better to elude pursuit then back to London again where at last they found her But it was too late She was lying frozen in the snow at the gate of the cemetery where Captain Hawdon the copyist whom she had once loved lay buried So Lady Dedlock s secret was hidden at last by death Only the detective whose business was silence Sir Leicester her husband and Esther her daughter knew what her misery had been or the strange circumstances of her flight for the police soon succeeded in tracing the murder of mister Tulkinghorn to Hortense the revengeful French maid whom he had threatened to put in prison One other shadow fell on Esther s life before the clouds cleared away for ever Grandfather Smallweed rummaging among the papers in Krook s shop found an old will and this proved to be a last will made by the original Jarndyce whose affairs the Court of Chancery had been all these years trying to settle This will bequeathed the greater part of the fortune to Richard Carstone and its discovery of course would have put a stop to the famous suit But the suit stopped of its own accord for it was found now that there was no longer any fortune left to go to law about or to be willed to anybody All the money had been eaten up by the costs After all the years of hope and strain this disappointment was too much for Richard and he died that night at the very hour when poor crazed little Miss Flite as she had said she would do when the famous suit ended gave all her caged birds their liberty The time came at length after the widowed Ada and her baby boy had come to make their home with mister Jarndyce when Esther felt that she should fulfil her promise and become the mistress of Bleak House So she told her guardian she was ready to marry him when he wished He appointed a day and she began to prepare her wedding clothes But mister Jarndyce true hearted and generous as he had always been had an idea very different from this in his mind He had found on Allan Woodcourt s return from his voyage that the young surgeon still loved Esther His keen eye had seen that she loved him in return and he well knew that if she married him Jarndyce it would be because of her promise and because her grateful heart could not find it possible to refuse him So wishing most of all her happiness he determined to give up his own love for her sake He bought a house in the town in which Woodcourt had decided to practise medicine remodeled it and named it Bleak House after his own When it was finished in the way he knew Esther liked best he took her to see it telling her it was to be a present from him to the surgeon to repay him for his kindness to little Joe Then when she had seen it all he told her that he had guessed her love for Woodcourt and that though she married the surgeon and not himself she would still be carrying out her promise and would still become the mistress of Bleak House When she lifted her tearful face from his shoulder she saw that Woodcourt was standing near them This is Bleak House said Jarndyce This day I give this house its little mistress and before God it is the brightest day of my life HARD TIMES

HARD TIMES I mister GRADGRIND AND HIS SYSTEM In a cheerless house called Stone Lodge in Coketown a factory town in England where great weaving mills made the sky a blur of soot and smoke lived a man named Gradgrind He was an obstinate stubborn man with a square wall of a forehead and a wide thin set mouth His head was bald and shining covered with knobs like the crust of a plum pie and skirted with bristling hair 
8005-113328-0000	train-other-500	He had grown rich in the hardware business and was a school director of the town He believed in nothing but facts
none	none	 Everything in the world to him was good only to weigh and measure and wherever he went 
8005-113328-0001	train-other-500	one would have thought he carried in his pocket a rule and scales and the multiplication table
none	none	 He seemed a kind of human cannon loaded to the muzzle with facts Now what I want is facts he used to say to mister M Choakumchild the schoolmaster Teach boys and girls nothing but facts Facts alone are wanted in life Nothing else is of any service to anybody Stick to facts sir He had several children whom he had brought up according to this system of his and they led wretched lives No little Gradgrind child had ever seen a face in the moon or learned Mother Goose or listened to fairy stories or read The Arabian Nights They all hated Coketown always rattling and throbbing with machinery they hated its houses all built of brick as red as an Indian s face and its black canal and river purple with dyes And most of all they hated facts Louisa the eldest daughter looked jaded 
8005-113328-0002	train-other-500	for her imagination was quite starved under their teachings
none	none	 Tom her younger brother was defiant and sullen 
8005-113328-0003	train-other-500	I wish he used to say
none	none	 that I could collect all the facts and all the figures in the world and all the people who found them out 
8005-113328-0004	train-other-500	and I wish I could put a thousand pounds of gunpowder under them and blow them all up together
none	none	 Louisa was generous 
8005-113328-0005	train-other-500	and the only love she knew was for her selfish worthless brother who repaid her with very little affection Of their mother they saw very little she was a thin white pink eyed bundle of shawls feeble and ailing
8005-113328-0006	train-other-500	and had too little mind to oppose her husband in anything Strangely enough
none	none	 mister Gradgrind had once had a tender heart 
8005-113328-0007	train-other-500	and down beneath the facts of his system he had it still though it had been covered up so long that nobody would have guessed it Least of all perhaps his own children mister Gradgrind s intimate friend one whom he was foolish enough to admire
8005-113328-0008	train-other-500	was Josiah Bounderby a big loud staring man with a puffed head whose skin was stretched so tight it seemed to hold his eyes open He owned the Coketown mills and a bank besides and was very rich and pompous
8005-113328-0009	train-other-500	Bounderby was a precious hypocrite of an odd sort
none	none	 His greatest pride was to talk continually of his former poverty and wretchedness and he delighted to tell everybody that he had been born in a ditch 
8005-113328-0010	train-other-500	deserted by his wicked mother and brought up a vagabond by a drunken grandmother
none	none	 from which low state he had made himself wealthy and respected by his own unaided efforts Now this was not in the least true 
8005-113328-0011	train-other-500	As a matter of fact his grandmother had been a respectable honest soul and his mother had pinched and saved to bring him up decently had given him some schooling and finally apprenticed him in a good trade
8005-113328-0012	train-other-500	But Bounderby was so ungrateful and so anxious to have people think he himself deserved all the credit
none	none	 that after he became rich he forbade his mother even to tell any one who she was 
8005-113328-0013	train-other-500	and made her live in a little shop in the country forty miles from Coketown But in her good and simple heart the old woman was so proud of her son that she used to spend all her little savings to come into town
8005-113328-0014	train-other-500	sometimes walking a good part of the way cleanly and plainly dressed and with her spare shawl and umbrella just to watch him go into his fine house or to look in admiration at the mills or the fine bank he owned
8005-113328-0015	train-other-500	On such occasions she called herself missus Pegler and thought no one else would be the wiser The house in which Bounderby lived had no ornaments It was cold and lonely and rich
8005-113328-0016	train-other-500	He made his mill hands more than earn their wages and when any of them complained he sneered that they wanted to be fed on turtle soup and venison with a golden spoon Bounderby had for housekeeper a missus Sparsit
none	none	 who talked a great deal of her genteel birth rich relatives and of the better days she had once seen 
8005-113328-0017	train-other-500	She was a busybody and when she sat of an evening cutting out embroidery with sharp scissors
none	none	 her bushy eyebrows and Roman nose made her look like a hawk 
8005-113328-0018	train-other-500	picking out the eyes of a very tough little bird In her own mind she had set her cap at Bounderby So firmly had mister Gradgrind put his trust in the gospel of facts which he had taught Louisa
8005-113328-0019	train-other-500	and Tom that he was greatly shocked one day to catch them instead of studying any one of the dry sciences ending in ology which he made them learn
none	none	 peeping through the knot holes in a wooden pavilion 
8005-113328-0020	train-other-500	along the road at the performance of a traveling circus The circus which was run by a man named Sleary
none	none	 had settled itself in the neighborhood for some time to come and all the performers meanwhile boarded in a near by public house 
8005-113328-0021	train-other-500	The Pegasus s Arms The show was given every day and at the moment of mister Gradgrind s appearance one Signor Jupe the clown was showing the tricks of his trained dog Merrylegs
8005-113328-0022	train-other-500	and entertaining the audience with his choicest jokes mister Gradgrind dumb with amazement seized both Louisa and Tom and led them home repeating at intervals with indignation
none	none	 What would mister Bounderby say This question was soon answered for the latter was at Stone Lodge when they arrived 
8005-113328-0023	train-other-500	He reminded mister Gradgrind that there was an evil influence in the school the children attended which no doubt had led them to such idle pursuits this evil influence being the little daughter of Jupe the circus clown
none	none	 And Bounderby advised mister Gradgrind to have the child put out of the school at once 
8005-113328-0024	train-other-500	The name of the clown s little daughter was Cecelia but every one called her Sissy She was a dark eyed dark haired appealing child frowned upon by mister M Choakumchild the schoolmaster
8005-113328-0025	train-other-500	because somehow many figures would not stay in her head at one time When the circus first came her father who loved her very much
none	none	 had brought her to the Gradgrind house and begged that she be allowed to attend school 
8005-113328-0026	train-other-500	mister Gradgrind had consented Now however at Bounderby s advice he wished he had not done so and started off with the other to The Pegasus s Arms to find Signor Jupe and deny to little Sissy the right of any more schooling
8005-113328-0027	train-other-500	Poor Jupe had been in great trouble that day
none	none	 For a long time he had felt that he was growing too old for the circus business 
8005-113328-0028	train-other-500	His joints were getting stiff he missed in his tumbling and he could no longer make the people laugh as he had once done
none	none	 He knew that before long Sleary would be obliged to discharge him and this he thought he could not bear to have Sissy see 
8005-113328-0029	train-other-500	He had therefore made up his mind to leave the company and disappear
none	none	 He was too poor to take Sissy with him so 
8005-113328-0030	train-other-500	loving her as he did he decided to leave her there
none	none	 where at least she had some friends 
8005-113328-0031	train-other-500	He had come to this melancholy conclusion this very day and had sent Sissy out on an errand so that he might slip away accompanied only by his dog Merrylegs while she was absent
8005-113328-0032	train-other-500	Sissy was returning when she met mister Gradgrind and Bounderby and came with them to find her father But at the public house she met only sympathizing looks
none	none	 for all of the performers had guessed what her father had done 
8005-113328-0033	train-other-500	They told her as gently as they could but poor Sissy was at first broken hearted in her grief and was comforted only by the assurance that her father would certainly come back to her before long
none	none	 While Sissy wept mister Gradgrind had been pondering 
8005-113328-0034	train-other-500	He saw here an excellent chance to put his system to the test To take this untaught girl and bring her up from the start entirely on facts would be a good experiment With this in view then he proposed to take Sissy to his house
8005-113328-0035	train-other-500	and to care for and teach her provided
none	none	 she promised to have nothing further to do with the circus or its members 
8005-113328-0036	train-other-500	Sissy knew how anxious her father had been to have her learn
none	none	 so she agreed and was taken at once to Stone Lodge 
8005-113328-0037	train-other-500	and set to work upon facts But alas mister Gradgrind s education seemed to make Sissy low spirited but no wiser Every day she watched and longed for some message from her father but none came
8005-113328-0038	train-other-500	She was loving and lovable and Louisa liked her and comforted her as well as she could
none	none	 But Louisa was far too unhappy herself to be of much help to any one else 
8005-113328-0039	train-other-500	Several years went by Sissy s father had never returned She had grown into a quiet lovely girl the only ray of light in that gloomy home mister Gradgrind had realized one of his ambitions
8005-113328-0040	train-other-500	had been elected to Parliament and now spent much time in London
none	none	 missus Gradgrind was yet feebler and more ailing 
8005-113328-0041	train-other-500	Tom had grown to be a young man a selfish and idle one and Bounderby had made him a clerk in his bank Louisa not blind to her brother s
none	none	 faults but loving him devotedly had become 
8005-113328-0042	train-other-500	in this time an especial object of Bounderby s notice Indeed the mill owner had determined to marry her Louisa had always been repelled by his coarseness and rough ways and when he proposed for her
8005-113328-0043	train-other-500	hand she shrank from the thought If her father had ever encouraged her confidence
none	none	 she might then have thrown herself on his breast and told him all that she felt 
8005-113328-0044	train-other-500	but to mister Gradgrind marriage was only a cold fact with no romance in it and his manner chilled her Tom in his utter selfishness thought only of what a good thing it would be for him if his sister married his employer
8005-113328-0045	train-other-500	and urged it on her with no regard whatever for her own liking At length
none	none	 thinking as long as she had never been allowed to have a sentiment 
8005-113328-0046	train-other-500	that could not be put down in black and white
none	none	 that it did not much matter whom she married after all 
8005-113328-0047	train-other-500	and believing that at least it would help Tom she consented She married Bounderby the richest man in Coketown and went to live in his fine house while missus Sparsit the housekeeper
none	none	 angry and revengeful found herself compelled to move into small rooms over Bounderby s bank II 
8005-113329-0000	train-other-500	THE ROBBERY OF BOUNDERBY S BANK In one of Bounderby s weaving mills a man named Stephen Blackpool had worked for years He was sturdy and honest but had a stooping frame a knitted brow and iron gray hair
8005-113329-0001	train-other-500	for in his forty years he had known much trouble Many years before he had married unhappily for through no fault or failing of his own his wife took to drink left off work and became a shame and a disgrace to the town
8005-113329-0002	train-other-500	When she could get no money to buy drink with she sold his furniture
none	none	 and often he would come home from the mill to find the rooms stripped of all their belongings 
8005-113329-0003	train-other-500	and his wife stretched on the floor in drunken slumber At last he was compelled to pay her to stay away and even then he lived in daily fear lest she return to disgrace him afresh
8005-113329-0004	train-other-500	What made this harder for Stephen to bear was the true love he had for a sweet patient working woman in the mill named Rachel She had an oval delicate face with gentle eyes and dark shining hair
8005-113329-0005	train-other-500	She knew his story and loved him too He could not marry her because his own wife stood in the way nor could he even see or walk with her often for fear busy tongues might talk of it
8005-113329-0006	train-other-500	but he watched every flutter of her shawl One night Stephen went home to his lodging to find his wife returned She was lying drunk across his bed a besotted creature
none	none	 stained and splashed and evil to look at All that night he sat sleepless and sick at heart 
8005-113329-0008	train-other-500	Next day at the noon hour he went to his employer s house to ask his advice He knew the law sometimes released two people from the marriage tie when one or the other lived wickedly
8005-113329-0009	train-other-500	and his whole heart longed to marry Rachel But Bounderby told him bluntly that the law he had in mind was only for rich men who could afford to spend a great deal of money And he further added according to his usual custom
none	none	 that he had no doubt Stephen would soon be demanding the turtle soup and venison and the golden spoon 
8005-113329-0010	train-other-500	Stephen went home that night hopeless knowing what he should find there But Rachel had heard and was there before him
none	none	 She had tidied the room and was tending the woman who was his wife It seemed to Stephen as he saw her in her work of mercy 
8005-113329-0011	train-other-500	there was an angel s halo about her head Soon the wretched creature she had aided passed out of his daily life again to go he knew not where and this act of Rachel s remained to make his love and longing greater
8005-113329-0012	train-other-500	About this time a stranger came to Coketown He was James Harthouse a suave polished man of the world good looking well dressed with a gallant yet indolent manner and bold eyes
8005-113329-0013	train-other-500	Being wealthy he had tried the army tried a Government position tried Jerusalem tried yachting and found himself bored by them all At last he had tried facts and figures
none	none	 having some idea these might help in politics 
8005-113329-0014	train-other-500	In London he had met the great believer in facts mister Gradgrind and had been sent by him to Coketown to make the acquaintance of his friend Bounderby Harthouse thus met the mill owner who introduced him to Louisa now his wife
8005-113329-0015	train-other-500	The year of married life had not been a happy one for her She was reserved and watchful and cold as ever but Harthouse easily saw that she was ashamed of Bounderby s bragging talk and shrank from his coarseness as from a blow
8005-113329-0016	train-other-500	He soon perceived too that the only love she had for any one was given to Tom though the latter little deserved it In his own mind Harthouse called her father a machine her brother a whelp and her husband a bear
8005-113329-0017	train-other-500	Harthouse was attracted by Louisa s beauty no less than by her pride He was without conscience or honor and determined though she was already married to make her fall in love with him
8005-113329-0018	train-other-500	He knew the surest way to her liking was to pretend an interest in Tom and he at once began to flatter the sullen young fellow Under his influence the latter was not long in telling the story of Louisa s marriage
none	none	 and in boasting that he himself had brought it about for his own advancement 
8005-113329-0019	train-other-500	To Louisa Harthouse spoke regretfully of the lad s idle habits yet hopefully of his future so that she deeming him honestly Tom s friend confided in him telling him of her brother s love of gambling
8005-113329-0020	train-other-500	and how she had more than once paid his debts by selling some of her own jewelry In such ways as these Harthouse step by step gained an intimacy with her While Harthouse was thus setting his net
8005-113329-0021	train-other-500	Stephen Blackpool the mill worker was on trial It was a time of great dissatisfaction among workmen throughout the country
none	none	 In many towns they were banding themselves together into unions 
8005-113329-0022	train-other-500	in order to gain more privileges and higher wages from their employers This movement in time had reached Coketown
none	none	 Rachel was opposed to these unions 
8005-113329-0023	train-other-500	believing they would in the end do their members more harm than good and knowing her mind
none	none	 Stephen had long ago promised her that he would never join one 
8005-113329-0024	train-other-500	The day had come however when a workman who thus declined was looked on with suspicion and dislike by his fellows and at length though all had liked and respected Stephen
none	none	 because he steadfastly refused to join the rest he found himself shunned 
8005-113329-0025	train-other-500	Day after day he went to and from his work alone
none	none	 and spoken to by none 
8005-113329-0026	train-other-500	and not seeing Rachel in these days was lonely and disheartened This condition of things did not escape the eye of Bounderby who sent for Stephen and questioned him But even in his trouble
8005-113329-0027	train-other-500	thinking his fellow workmen believed themselves in the right Stephen refused to complain or to bear tales of them
none	none	 Bounderby in his arrogance chose to be angry that one of his mill hands should presume not to answer his questions 
8005-113329-0028	train-other-500	and discharged him forthwith so that now Stephen found himself without friends money or work Not wholly without friends either for Rachel was still the same And he had gained another friend too
8005-113329-0029	train-other-500	While he told her that evening in his lodgings what had occurred
none	none	 and that he must soon go in search of work in some other town 
8005-113329-0030	train-other-500	Louisa came to him She had witnessed the interview in which her husband had discharged this faithful workman had found out where he lived and had made her brother Tom bring her there that she might tell Stephen how sorry she was
none	none	 and beg him to accept money from her to help him in his distress 
8005-113329-0031	train-other-500	This kindness touched Stephen He thanked her and took as a loan a small portion of the money she offered him
none	none	 Tom had come on this errand with his sister in a sulky humor 
8005-113329-0032	train-other-500	While he listened now a thought came to him As Louisa talked with Rachel he beckoned Stephen from the room and told him that he could perhaps aid him in finding work
8005-113329-0033	train-other-500	He told him to wait during the next two or three evenings near the door of Bounderby s bank and promised that he himself would seek Stephen there and tell him further There was no kindness however in this proposal
8005-113329-0034	train-other-500	It was a sudden plan wicked and cowardly Tom had become a criminal He had stolen money from the bank and trembled daily lest the theft become known What would be easier now he thought
8005-113329-0035	train-other-500	than to hide his crime by throwing suspicion on some one else He could force the door of the safe before he left at night and drop a key of the bank door which he had secretly made
none	none	 in the street where it would afterward be found 
8005-113329-0036	train-other-500	He himself then next morning could appear to find the safe open and the money missing Stephen he considered would be just the one to throw suspicion upon All unconscious of this plot
none	none	 Stephen in good faith waited near the bank during three evenings 
8005-113329-0037	train-other-500	walking past the building again and again watching vainly for Tom to appear
none	none	 missus Sparsit at her upper window 
8005-113329-0038	train-other-500	wondered to see his bowed form haunting the place Nothing came of his waiting however and the fourth morning saw him with his thoughts on Rachel trudging out of town along the highroad bravely and uncomplainingly
8005-113329-0039	train-other-500	toward whatever new lot the future held for him Tom s plot worked well Next day there was a sensation in Coketown Bounderby s bank was found to have been robbed
8005-113329-0040	train-other-500	The safe Tom declared he had found open with a large part of its contents missing A key to the bank door was picked up in the street this it was concluded the thief had thrown away after using Who had done it Had any suspicious person been seen about the place
8005-113329-0041	train-other-500	Many people remembered a strange old woman apparently from the country who called herself missus Pegler and who had often been seen standing looking fixedly at the bank What more natural than to suspect her Then another rumor began to grow
8005-113329-0042	train-other-500	Stephen Blackpool discharged from the mill by Bounderby himself the workman who had been shunned by all his comrades to whom no one spoke he had been seen recently loitering night after night near the robbed bank
none	none	 Where was he Gone none knew where In an hour Stephen was suspected By the next day half of Coketown believed him guilty III HARTHOUSE S PLAN FAILS 
8005-113330-0000	train-other-500	Two persons however had a suspicion of the truth One of these was the porter of the bank whose suspicion was strong The other was Louisa who though her love denied it room
8005-113330-0001	train-other-500	hid in her secret heart a fear that her brother had had a share in the crime In the night she went to Tom s bedside
none	none	 put her arms around him and begged him to tell her any secret he might be keeping from her 
8005-113330-0002	train-other-500	But he answered sullenly that he did not know what she meant missus Sparsit s fine bred nerves so she insisted were so shaken by the robbery that she came to Bounderby s house to remain till she recovered
8005-113330-0003	train-other-500	The feeble pink eyed bundle of shawls that was missus Gradgrind happening to die at this time and Louisa being absent at her mother s funeral missus Sparsit saw her opportunity She had never forgiven Louisa for marrying Bounderby
none	none	 and she now revenged herself by a course of such flattery 
8005-113330-0004	train-other-500	that the vulgar bully began to think his cold proud wife much too regardless of him and of his importance What pleased the hawk faced old busybody most was the game the suave Harthouse was playing
none	none	 which she was sharp enough to see through at once 
8005-113330-0005	train-other-500	If Louisa would only disgrace herself by running away with Harthouse thought missus Sparsit Bounderby might be free again and she might marry him So she watched narrowly the growing intimacy between them hoping for Louisa s ruin
8005-113330-0006	train-other-500	There came a day when Bounderby was summoned on business to London and Louisa stayed meanwhile at the Bounderby country house which lay some distance from Coketown missus Sparsit guessed that Harthouse would use this chance to see Louisa alone
none	none	 and to spy upon her took the train herself 
8005-113330-0007	train-other-500	reaching there at nightfall She went afoot from the station to the grounds opened the gate softly and crept close to the house Here and there in the dusk through garden and wood she stole and at length she found what she sought
8005-113330-0008	train-other-500	There under the trees stood Harthouse his horse tied near by
none	none	 and talking with him was Louisa 
8005-113330-0009	train-other-500	missus Sparsit stood behind a tree like Robinson Crusoe
none	none	 in his ambuscade against the savages and listened with all her ears 
8005-113330-0010	train-other-500	She could not hear all but caught enough to know that he was telling her he loved her and begging her to leave her husband her home and friends and to run away with him In her delight and in the noise of rain upon the foliage
8005-113330-0011	train-other-500	for a thunder storm was rolling up missus Sparsit did not catch Louisa s answer Where and when Harthouse asked her to join him she could not hear but as he mounted and rode away she thought he said To night
8005-113330-0012	train-other-500	She waited in the rain rejoicing till her patience was at length rewarded by seeing Louisa cloaked and veiled as if for a journey come from the house and go toward the railroad station
none	none	 Then missus Sparsit drawing her draggled shawl over her head to hide her face followed boarded the same train and hastened to tell the news of his wife s elopement to Bounderby in London 
8005-113330-0013	train-other-500	Wet to the skin her feet squashing in her shoes her clothes spoiled and her bonnet looking like an over ripe fig with a terrible cold that made her voice only a whisper and sneezing herself almost to pieces
8005-113330-0014	train-other-500	missus Sparsit found Bounderby at his city hotel exploded with the combustible information she carried and fainted quite away on his coat collar Furious at the news she brought Bounderby hustled her into a fast train and together
none	none	 he raging and glaring and she inwardly jubilant they hurried toward Coketown to inform mister Gradgrind who was then at home 
8005-113330-0015	train-other-500	of his daughter s doings But where meanwhile was Louisa Not run away with Harthouse as missus Sparsit so fondly imagined but safe in her own father s house in Coketown She had suffered much without complaint
none	none	 but Harthouse s proposal had been the last straw 
8005-113330-0016	train-other-500	Added to all the insults she had suffered at her husband s hands and her fearful suspicion of Tom s guilt it had proven too much for her to bear She had pretended to agree to Harthouse s plan only that she might the more quickly rid herself of his presence
8005-113330-0017	train-other-500	mister Gradgrind astonished at her sudden arrival at Stone Lodge was shocked no less at her ghastly appearance than by what she said She told him she cursed the hour when she had been born to grow up a victim to his teachings
8005-113330-0018	train-other-500	that her whole life had been empty
none	none	 that every hope affection and fancy had been crushed from her very infancy and her better angel made a demon 
8005-113330-0019	train-other-500	She told him the whole truth about her marriage to Bounderby that she had married him solely for the advancement of Tom the only one she had ever loved and that now she could no longer live with her husband or bear the life she had made for herself
8005-113330-0020	train-other-500	And when she had said this Louisa the daughter his system had brought to such despair fell at his feet At her pitiful tale the tender heart that mister Gradgrind had buried in his long past youth
8005-113330-0021	train-other-500	under his mountain of facts stirred again and began to beat The mountain crumbled away and he saw in an instant as by a lightning flash that the plan of life to which he had so rigidly held was a complete and hideous failure
8005-113330-0022	train-other-500	He had thought there was but one wisdom that of the head he knew at last that there was a deeper wisdom of the heart also which all these years he had denied When she came to herself Louisa found her father sitting by her bedside
8005-113330-0023	train-other-500	His face looked worn and older He told her he realized at last his life mistake and bitterly reproached himself Sissy too was there her love shining like a beautiful light on the other s darkness She knelt beside the bed
none	none	 and laid the weary head on her breast 
8005-113330-0024	train-other-500	and then for the first time Louisa burst into sobs Next day Sissy sought out Harthouse who was waiting full of sulky impatience at the failure of Louisa to appear as he had expected Sissy told him plainly what had occurred
8005-113330-0025	train-other-500	and that he should never see Louisa again Harthouse realizing that his plan had failed suddenly discovered that he had a great liking for camels and left the same hour for Egypt never to return to Coketown
8005-113330-0026	train-other-500	It was while Sissy was absent on this errand of her own that the furious Bounderby and the triumphant missus Sparsit the latter voiceless and still sneezing appeared at Stone Lodge
8005-113330-0027	train-other-500	mister Gradgrind took the mill owner greatly aback with the statement that Louisa had had no intention whatever of eloping and was then in that same house and under his care Angry and blustering at being made such a fool of
8005-113330-0028	train-other-500	Bounderby turned on missus Sparsit but in her disappointment at finding it a mistake she had dissolved in tears When mister Gradgrind told him he had concluded it would be better for Louisa to remain for some time there with him
8005-113330-0029	train-other-500	Bounderby flew into a still greater rage and stamped off swearing his wife should come home by noon next day or not at all To be sure Louisa did not go and next day Bounderby sent her clothes to mister Gradgrind
8005-113330-0030	train-other-500	advertised his country house for sale and needing something to take his spite out upon redoubled his efforts to find the robber of the bank
none	none	 And he began by covering the town with printed placards offering a large regard for the arrest of Stephen Blackpool IV STEPHEN S RETURN 
8005-113331-0000	train-other-500	Rachel had known of course of the rumors against Stephen and had been both indignant and sorrowful She alone knew where he was and how to find him for deeming it impossible because of his trouble with the Coketown workmen
8005-113331-0001	train-other-500	to get work under his own name he had taken another Now that he was directly charged with the crime she wrote him the news at once so that he might lose no time in returning to face the unjust accusation
8005-113331-0002	train-other-500	Being so certain herself of his innocence she made no secret of what she had done and all Coketown waited wondering whether he would appear or not Two days passed and he had not come
none	none	 and then Rachel told Bounderby the address to which she had written him 
8005-113331-0003	train-other-500	Messengers were sent who came back with the report that Stephen had received her letter and had left at once saying he was going to Coketown
none	none	 where he should long since have arrived 
8005-113331-0004	train-other-500	Another day with no Stephen and now almost every one believed he was guilty had taken Rachel s letter as a warning and had fled All the while Tom waited nervously biting his nails and with fevered lips
8005-113331-0005	train-other-500	knowing that Stephen when he came would tell the real reason why he had loitered near the bank and so point suspicion to himself On the third day missus Sparsit saw a chance to distinguish herself She recognized on the street missus Pegler
8005-113331-0006	train-other-500	the old countrywoman who also had been suspected She seized her and regardless of her entreaties dragged her to Bounderby s house and into his dining room with a curious crowd flocking at their heels
8005-113331-0007	train-other-500	She plumed herself on catching one of the robbers but what was her astonishment when the old woman called Bounderby her dear son pleading that her coming to his house was not her fault
none	none	 and begging him not to be angry even if people did know at last that she was his mother 
8005-113331-0008	train-other-500	mister Gradgrind who was present when they entered having always heard Bounderby tell such dreadful tales of his bringing up reproached her for deserting her boy in his infancy to a drunken grandmother
8005-113331-0009	train-other-500	At this the old woman nearly burst with indignation calling on Bounderby himself to tell how false this was and how she had pinched and denied herself for him till he had begun to be successful Everybody laughed at this
8005-113331-0010	train-other-500	for now the true story of the bullying mill owner s tales was out Bounderby who had turned very red was the only one who did not seem to enjoy the scene
none	none	 After he had wrathfully shut every one else from the house 
8005-113331-0011	train-other-500	he vented his anger on missus Sparsit for meddling as he called it with his own family affairs
none	none	 He ended by giving her the wages due her 
8005-113331-0012	train-other-500	and inviting her to take herself off at once So missus Sparsit for all her cap setting and spying
none	none	 had to leave her comfortable nest and go to live in a poor lodging as companion to the most grudging 
8005-113331-0013	train-other-500	peevish tormenting one of her noble relatives an invalid with a lame leg But meanwhile another day had passed
none	none	 the fourth since Rachel had sent her letter 
8005-113331-0014	train-other-500	and still Stephen had not come On this day full of her trouble Rachel had wandered with Sissy now her fast friend some distance out of the town through some fields where mining had once been carried on Suddenly she cried out
8005-113331-0015	train-other-500	she had picked up a hat and inside it was the name Stephen Blackpool An instant later a scream broke from her lips that echoed over the country side
none	none	 Before them at their very feet 
8005-113331-0016	train-other-500	half hidden by rubbish and grasses yawned the ragged mouth of a dark abandoned shaft That instant both Rachel and Sissy guessed the truth that Stephen returning had not seen the chasm in the darkness and had fallen into its depths
8005-113331-0017	train-other-500	They ran and roused the town Crowds came from Coketown Rope and windlass were brought and two men were lowered into the pit The poor fellow was there alive but terribly injured
none	none	 A rough bed was made and so at last the crushed and broken form was brought up to the light and air 
8005-113331-0018	train-other-500	A surgeon was at hand with wine and medicines but it was too late Stephen spoke with Rachel first then called mister Gradgrind to him and asked him to clear the blemish from his name
8005-113331-0019	train-other-500	He told him simply that he could do so through his son Tom This was all He died while they bore him home holding the hand of Rachel whom he loved Stephen s last words had told the truth to mister Gradgrind
8005-113331-0020	train-other-500	He read in them that his own son was the robber Tom s guilty glance had seen also With suspicion removed from Stephen he felt his own final arrest sure Sissy noted Tom s pale face and trembling limbs
8005-113331-0021	train-other-500	Guessing that he would attempt flight too late and longing to save the heartbroken father from the shame of seeing his son s arrest and imprisonment she drew the shaking thief aside
none	none	 and in a whisper bade him go at once to Sleary 
8005-113331-0022	train-other-500	the proprietor of the circus to which her father had once belonged She told him where the circus was to be found at that season of the year and bade him ask Sleary to hide him for her sake till she came Tom obeyed
8005-113331-0023	train-other-500	He disappeared that night and later Sissy told his father what she had done mister Gradgrind with Sissy and Louisa followed as soon as possible intending to get his son to the nearest seaport and so out of the country on a vessel
8005-113331-0024	train-other-500	for he knew that soon he himself Tom s father would be questioned and obliged to tell the truth
none	none	 They traveled all night and at length reached the town where the circus showed 
8005-113331-0025	train-other-500	Sleary for Sissy s sake had provided Tom with a disguise in which not even his father recognized him
none	none	 He had blacked his sullen face 
8005-113331-0026	train-other-500	and dressed him in a moth eaten greatcoat and a mad cocked hat in which attire he played the role of a black servant in the performance Tom met them grimy and defiant ashamed to meet Louisa s eyes brazen to his father
8005-113331-0027	train-other-500	anxious only to be saved from his deserved punishment A seaport was but three hours away He was soon dressed and plans for his departure were completed But at the last moment danger appeared It
none	none	 came in the person of the porter of Bounderby s bank who had all along suspected Tom 
8005-113331-0028	train-other-500	He had watched the Gradgrind house followed its master when he left and now laid hands on Tom vowing he would take him back to Coketown In this moment of the father s despair Sleary the showman saved the day for the shivering thief
8005-113331-0029	train-other-500	He agreed with the porter that as Tom was guilty of a crime he must certainly go with him
none	none	 and he offered moreover to drive the captor and his prisoner at once to the nearest railroad station 
8005-113331-0030	train-other-500	He winked at Sissy as he proposed this and she was not alarmed The porter accepted the proposal at once
none	none	 but he did not guess what the showman had in mind 
8005-113331-0031	train-other-500	Sleary s horse was an educated horse At a certain word from its owner it would stop and begin to dance and would not budge from the spot till he gave the command in a particular way
none	none	 He had an educated dog also that would do anything it was told 
8005-113331-0032	train-other-500	With this horse hitched to the carriage and this dog trotting innocently behind the showman set off with the porter and Tom while mister Gradgrind and Louisa whom Sissy had told to trust in Sleary waited all night for his return
8005-113331-0033	train-other-500	It was morning before Sleary came back with the news that Tom was undoubtedly safe from pursuit if not already aboard ship He told them how at the word from him the educated horse had begun to dance how Tom had slipped down and got away
8005-113331-0034	train-other-500	while the educated dog at his command had penned the frightened porter in the carriage all night fearing to stir Thus Tom who did not deserve any such good luck got safely away
8005-113331-0035	train-other-500	but though his father was spared the shame of ever seeing his son behind the bars of a jail yet he was a broken man ever after the truth became known What was the fate of all these Bounderby a bully to the last
none	none	 died of a fit five years afterward leaving his entire fortune to the perpetual support of twenty five humbugs each of whom was required to take the name of Josiah Bounderby of Coketown Louisa never remarried but lived to be the comfort of her father and the loving comrade of Sissy Jupe Sissy never found her father and when at last Merrylegs his wonderful dog came back alone to die of old age at Sleary s feet all knew that his master must be dead Tom died softened and penitent in a foreign land Rachel remained the same pensive little worker always dressed in black beloved by all and helping every one even Stephen s besotted wife As for mister Gradgrind a white haired decrepit old man he forgot all the facts on which he had so depended and tried for ever after to mingle his life s acts with Faith Hope and Charity THE MYSTERY OF EDWIN DROOD Published eighteen seventy Scene London and Cloisterham a Neighboring Town Time About eighteen sixty five CHARACTERS Edwin Drood A young engineer John Jasper His uncle and guardian A choir master Rosa Bud An orphan girl engaged to marry Drood Known as Rosebud mister Grewgious A lawyer Her guardian Miss Twinkleton The principal of the Young Ladies Seminary in Cloisterham The Reverend mister Crisparkle A minister A minister Neville Landless mister Crisparkle s pupil Helena His twin sister Rosebud s room mate in the seminary Luke Honeythunder A self styled philanthropist and bore Guardian of Neville and Helena Lieutenant Tartar A retired naval officer Dick Datchery A detective Durdles A stone mason and chiseler of tombstones The Deputy A street Arab THE MYSTERY OF EDWIN DROOD I JOHN JASPER In the quiet town of Cloisterham in England in a boarding school once lived a beautiful girl named Rosa Bud an amiable wilful winning whimsical little creature whom every one called Rosebud She was an orphan Her mother had been drowned when she was only seven years old and her father had died of grief on the first anniversary of that day Her father s friend and college mate a mister Drood had comforted his last hours and they had agreed between them that when Rosebud was old enough she should marry mister Drood s son Edwin then a little boy Her father put this wish in his will as did mister Drood who died also soon after his friend and so Rosebud and Edwin Drood grew up knowing that though not bound in any way each was intended for the other So it came about that while if they had been let alone they might have fallen in love naturally yet as it was they were always shy and ill at ease with one another Yet they liked each other too Rosebud s guardian was a mister Grewgious an arid sandy man who looked as if he might be put in a grinding mill and turned out first class snuff He had scanty hair like a yellow fur tippet and deep notches in his forehead and was very near sighted He seemed to have been born old so that when he came to London to call on Rosebud amid all the school girls he used to say he felt like a bear with the cramp Grewgious however under his oddity had a very tender heart particularly for Rosebud whose mother he had been secretly in love with before she married But he had grown up a dry old bachelor living in gloomy rooms in London and no one would have guessed him ever to have been a bit romantic The school Rosebud attended was called Nun s House Miss Twinkleton the prim old maid who managed it termed it a Seminary for Young Ladies It had a worn front with a shining brass door plate that made it look at a distance like a battered old beau with a big new eye glass stuck in his blind eye Here Rosebud lived a happy life the pet of the whole seminary till she was a young lady Cloisterham was a dull gray town with an ancient cathedral which was so cold and dark and damp that looking into its door was like looking down the throat of old Father Time The cathedral had a fine choir which sang at all the services and was taught and led by a music master whose name was John Jasper This Jasper as it happened was the uncle and guardian of Edwin Drood Drood who was studying to be an engineer was very fond of his uncle and came often to Cloisterham to visit him so that Rosebud saw a great deal of her intended husband He always called her Pussy He used to call on her at the school and take her walking and buy her candy at a Turkish shop called Lumps of Delight and did his best to get on well with her though he felt awkward Drood and Jasper were much more like two friends than like uncle and nephew for the choir master was very little older than the other Jasper seemed to be wonderfully fond of Drood and every one who knew him thought him a most honorable and upright man but in reality he was far different At heart he hated the cathedral and the singing and wished often that he could find relief like some old monk in carving demons out of the desks and seats He had a soul that was without fear or conscience One vile and wicked practice he had which he had hidden from all who knew him He was an opium smoker He would steal away to London to a garret kept by a mumbling old woman who knew the secret of mixing the drug and there stretched on a dirty pallet sometimes with a drunken Chinaman or a Lascar beside him would smoke pipe after pipe of the dreadful mixture that stole away his senses and left him worse than before Hours later he would awake give the woman money and hurry back to Cloisterham just in time perhaps to put on his church robes and lead the cathedral choir Though no one knew of this and though Edwin Drood thought his uncle was well nigh perfect Rosebud after she grew up had no liking for Jasper He gave her music lessons and every time they met he terrified her She felt sometimes that he haunted her thoughts like a dreadful ghost He seemed almost to make a slave of her with his looks and she felt that in every glance he was telling her that he Jasper loved her and yet compelled her to keep silence But though disliking the choir master so and shivering whenever he came near her Rosebud did not know how to tell Edwin who she knew loved and believed in Jasper of her feelings II THE COMING OF NEVILLE LANDLESS One of the ministers in charge of the cathedral was the Reverend mister Crisparkle a ruddy young active honest fellow who was perpetually practising boxing before the looking glass or pitching himself head foremost into all the streams about the town for a swim even when it was winter and he had to break the ice with his head mister Crisparkle sometimes took young men into his home to live while he tutored them to prepare them for college One day he received word from a mister Luke Honeythunder in London telling him he was about to bring to Cloisterham a twin brother and sister Neville and Helena Landless the young man to be taught by mister Crisparkle and his sister Helena to be put in Miss Twinkleton s seminary This Luke Honeythunder called himself a philanthropist but he was a queer sort of one indeed He was always getting up public meetings and talking loudly insisting on everybody s thinking exactly as he did and saying dreadful things of them if they did not Helena and Neville Landless had been born in Ceylon where as little children they had been cruelly treated by their stepfather But they had brave spirits and four times in six years they had run away only to be brought back each time and punished On each of these occasions the first had been when they were but seven years old Helena had dressed as a boy and once had even tried to cut off her long hair with Neville s pocket knife At length their cruel stepfather died and they were sent to England where for no other reason than that his name was continually appearing in the newspapers mister Honeythunder had been appointed their guardian No wonder the brother and sister had grown up thinking everybody was their enemy They were quite prepared to hate mister Crisparkle when their guardian brought them But by the time mister Honeythunder had gone and mister Crisparkle was as glad as they were when he went home they liked the young minister and felt that they would be happy there They were a handsome pair and mister Crisparkle was attracted to them both Neville was lithe and dark and rich in color Helena was almost like a gypsy slender supple and quick Both seemed half shy half defiant as though their blood were untamed To make them welcome that first evening mister Crisparkle invited to his house Jasper the choir master with Edwin Drood who was visiting him and Rosebud from the seminary Before they parted Rosebud was asked to sing Jasper played her accompaniment and while she sang he watched her lips intently All at once to their great astonishment Rosebud covered her face with her hands and crying out I can t bear this I am frightened Take me away burst into tears Helena the new comer who had liked Rosebud at first sight seemed to understand her better than any one else She laid her on a sofa soothed her and in a few moments Rosebud seemed again as usual mister Crisparkle and Edwin Drood thought it only a fit of nervousness To her relief they made light of the matter and so the evening ended But later at Nun s House where she and Helena were to be room mates Rosebud told her new friend how much she disliked Jasper and how his eyes terrified her and how as she sang with his eyes watching her lips she felt as if he had kissed her While the two girls were talking of this Neville and Edwin Drood who had gone with them as far as the door of the seminary were walking back together mister Crisparkle had told Neville of Drood s betrothal to Rosebud and Neville now spoke of it Drood who had felt all along that he and Rosebud did not get along well together and who was sensitive on the subject was unjustly angry that the other should so soon know what he considered his own private affair He answered in a surly way and as both were quick tempered they soon came to high words As it happened Jasper was walking near and overhearing came between them He reproved them good naturedly and took them to his rooms where he insisted they should drink a glass of wine with him to their good fellowship There he did a dastardly thing He mixed with the wine a drug which once drunk aroused their angry passions Their speech grew thick and the quarrel began again Safe now from any spectator Jasper did not attempt to soothe them He let them go on until they were about to come to blows Then pretending the greatest indignation he threw himself upon Neville and forced him hatless from the house In the cool night air Neville s strange dizziness and with it his rage cleared away He realized that the blame for the quarrel had been Jasper s but he did not guess the drugging of the wine and could not explain the incident even to himself He went however manfully and sorrowfully to mister Crisparkle and told him what had occurred and naturally mister Crisparkle who had never found Edwin Drood quarrelsome thought it the fault of Neville s hot blood and revengeful character He was the more certain of this when Jasper came to him bringing Neville s hat and told him his own story of the meeting Jasper told him falsely that Neville had made a murderous attack on Drood and but for him would have laid his nephew dead at his feet He warned the minister that Neville had a tigerish nature and would yet be guilty of terrible crime mister Crisparkle liked Neville and all this saddened him for he had not the least suspicion that Jasper was lying for a cruel purpose of his own The affair was an unhappy one for Neville Jasper took care that the story spread abroad and as it went it grew so that almost everybody in Cloisterham came to consider Helena s brother a sullen fellow of a furious temper And they believed it the more because Neville made no secret of the fact that he had fallen in love too with Rosebud and in this they thought they saw a reason for his hating Edwin Drood mister Crisparkle was a faithful friend He concluded soon that the fault was not all on Neville s side But he was anxious to have the two young men friends and he begged his pupil for his own part to lay aside the ill feeling He went to the choir master also on the same errand and Jasper assured him that his nephew would do the same He even promised hypocritically that to bring this about he would invite both Edwin Drood and Neville to dine with him on Christmas Eve in his own rooms where they might meet and shake hands Both young men promised to come to the dinner and mister Crisparkle was highly pleased little dreaming what the outcome would be III THE CHOIR MASTER S DINNER There was a quaint character in Cloisterham named Durdles He was a stone mason whose specialty was the chiseling of tombstones He was an old bachelor and was both a very skilful workman and a very great sot He had keys to all the cathedral vaults and was fond of prowling about the old pile and its dismal crypt for ever tap tapping with a little hammer he carried on its stones and walls hunting for forgotten cavities in which perhaps centuries before persons had been buried He wore a coarse flannel suit with horn buttons and a yellow handkerchief with draggled ends and it was a daily sight to see him perched on a tombstone eating his dinner out of a bundle When he was not feeling well he used to say he had a touch of tomb atism instead of rheumatism Durdles was drunk so much that he was never certain about getting home at night so he had hired at a penny a day a hideous small boy known as The Deputy to throw stones at him whenever he found him out of doors after ten o clock and drive him home to his little hole of an unfurnished stone house The Deputy used to watch for Durdles after this hour and when he saw him he would dance up and sing Widdy widdy wen I ketches him out arter ten Widdy widdy wy When he don t go then I shy Widdy widdy Wake Cock Warning It was a part of the bargain that he must give this warning before he began to throw the stones and when Durdles heard this yell he knew what was coming Before the Christmas Eve dinner Jasper picked a friendship with Durdles and pretending he wanted to make a trip by moonlight with him among the vaults he persuaded him one night to be his guide While they were in the crypt of the cathedral Jasper plied him with liquor which he had brought to such purpose that Durdles went fast asleep and the key of the crypt fell from his hand He had a dim idea that Jasper picked up the key and went away with it and was a long time gone but when he awoke he could not tell whether this had really happened or not And this when The Deputy stoned him home that night was all he could remember of the expedition But what Jasper had really done while Durdles was asleep whether he had taken away the key to make a copy of it so as to make one like it for some evil purpose of his own or whether he wanted to be able to unlock that dark underground place and hide something in it sometime when no one would be with him this only Jasper himself knew The Christmas season arrived and Edwin Drood according to his promise came to Cloisterham to his uncle s dinner at which he was to meet Neville Before leaving however he called upon mister Grewgious Rosebud s guardian who had sent for him with a particular purpose This purpose was to give into his hands a ring set with diamonds and rubies that had belonged to Rosebud s mother It had been left in trust to mister Grewgious to give to the man who married her that he might himself put it on her finger And in accordance with the trust the lawyer charged Drood if anything should be amiss or if anything happened between him and Rosebud to bring back the ring mister Grewgious gave him this keepsake with such wise and friendly advice on the seriousness of marriage that all the way to Cloisterham with the ring in his pocket Edwin Drood was very thoughtful He asked himself whether he really loved Rosebud as a man should love his wife whether he had not drifted into this betrothal rather as a result of their parents wish and wills than from any deeper feeling And he began to wonder if by marrying her thus he would not be doing her a vast injustice He decided therefore to tell her all that was in his mind and be guided by her judgment Rosebud meanwhile in the silence of the Christmas vacation with only Helena for her companion had been thinking of the same matter and her wise little head had reached almost the same conclusion When Drood came they walked out together under the trees by the cathedral Their talk was not so difficult after all as each had feared it would be and both felt relieved when they decided they could be far happier to remain as brother and sister and not become husband and wife So they agreed without pain on either side Drood s only anxiety was for his uncle He thought Jasper had looked forward to his marriage to Rosebud so long that he would be pained and disappointed to learn it was not to be So he concluded he would not tell him as yet Poor Rosebud She was greatly agitated She felt the falseness of Jasper and knew that he loved her himself but she realized the impossibility of telling this to the nephew who believed in him So she was silent Drood for his part since the betrothal was ended said nothing to her of the ring Grewgious had given to him intending to return it to the lawyer They kissed each other when they parted The wicked choir master who happened to be walking near saw the embrace and thought it the kiss of lovers soon to be wed Drood left Rosebud then to pass the time till the hour of the dinner in Jasper s rooms Neville that day had determined the dinner over to start at dawn next morning on a walking tour to be absent a fortnight He bought a knapsack and a heavy steel shod stick in preparation for this expedition and bade his sister Helena and mister Crisparkle good by before he went to the appointed meeting at the choir master s Jasper himself it was noticed had never seemed in better spirits than on that day nor had he ever sung more sweetly than in the afternoon service before the dinner which he gave to the two young men If he was contemplating a terrible crime no one would have guessed it from his serene face and his agreeable manner Edwin Drood had one warning just before he went up the postern stair that led to his Uncle Jasper s The old hag who mixed the opium in the London garret where the choir master smoked the drug had more than once tried to find out who her strange gentlemanly visitor was She had listened to his mutterings in his drunken slumber and at length that day had followed him from London to Cloisterham only to lose track of him there As Drood strolled waiting for the dinner hour to strike from the cathedral chimes he passed her and she begged money from him He gave it to her and she asked him his name and whether he had a sweetheart He answered Edwin and that he had none Be thankful your name s not Ned she said for it s a bad name and a threatened name Ned was the name Jasper always called him by but Drood did not think seriously of the old woman s words He could not have guessed that the threats she spoke of against the Ned who had a sweetheart had been murmured in his drugged slumber by his own uncle against himself And yet something at just that moment made him shudder So the chimes struck and Edwin Drood went on to Jasper s rooms to meet his uncle and Neville Landless went to his doom For from that time no one who loved him ever saw him again in this world IV JASPER SHOWS HIS TEETH That night a fearful tempest howled over Cloisterham In the morning early as the storm was breaking Jasper the choir master came pale panting and half dressed to mister Crisparkle s asking for Edwin Drood He said his nephew had left his rooms the evening before with Neville Landless to go to the river to look at the storm and had not returned Strange rumors sprang up at once Neville had left for his walking tour and an ugly suspicion flew from house to house He had got only a few miles from the town when he was overtaken by a party of men who surrounded him Thinking at first that they were thieves he fought them but was soon rendered helpless and bleeding and in the midst of them was taken back toward Cloisterham mister Crisparkle and Jasper met them on the way and from the former Neville first learned of what he was suspected The blood from his encounter with his captors was on his clothes and stick Jasper pointed it out and even those who had seen it fall there looked darkly at the stains He was taken back to the town and to mister Crisparkle s house who promised that he should remain in his own custody Neville s story was simple He said they had gone to the river as Jasper had said and returned together he to mister Crisparkle s Edwin Drood to his uncle s He had not seen the other since that time The river was dragged and its banks searched but to no purpose till mister Crisparkle himself found Drood s watch caught among some timbers in a weir But as the body could not be found it could not be definitely proven that Drood was dead or that any murder had been committed so at last Neville was released The whole neighborhood however believed him guilty of the murder No one spoke to him and he was obliged to quit the place Beside his sister Helena and Rosebud who of course believed in his innocence he had but one friend there mister Crisparkle The latter stoutly refused to believe him guilty When Neville left for London through mister Grewgious Rosebud s guardian the minister found him a cheap lodging and made frequent trips to the city to help and advise him in his studies mister Grewgious had his own opinion of the affair One day he went to Cloisterham to see Jasper and there told him a thing the other did not yet know that before that last night Edwin Drood and Rosebud had agreed not to marry When he heard this the choir master s face turned the color of lead He shrieked and fell senseless at the lawyer s feet mister Grewgious went back to the city more thoughtful than ever and it was not long before a detective came from London to Cloisterham and began to interest himself in all the doings of John Jasper The detective to be sure was not known as such He called himself Dick Datchery and gave it out that he was an idle dog who lived on his money and had nothing to do He was a curious looking man with a great shock of white hair black eyebrows and a military air He rented lodgings next door to the choir master and before long had made friends with Durdles the tombstone maker and even with The Deputy of the wake cock warning Meanwhile Jasper haggard and red eyed took again his place in the cathedral choir while Neville Landless worked sadly and alone in his London garret The latter made but one friend in this time a lodger whose window adjoined his own This lodger was Lieutenant Tartar a retired young naval officer Tartar might have lived in fine apartments for he was rich but he had been so long on shipboard that he felt more at home where the walls were low enough for him to knock his head on the ceiling He used to climb across to Neville s room by the window ledges and they became friendly the warmer friends when mister Crisparkle discovered in the lieutenant a schoolmate who had once saved his life Later too Helena left Miss Twinkleton s Seminary and came to be with her brother And so a year went by Vacation arrived and one day when Rosebud was alone at Nun s House Jasper for the first time since Edwin Drood s disappearance came to see her He found her in the garden and she felt again the repulsion and fear she had always felt at sight of him This time the choir master threw away all concealment He told her that he had always loved her hopelessly and madly though while she was betrothed to his nephew he had hidden the fact She answered indignantly that by look if not by word he had always been false to Edwin Drood that he had made her life unhappy by his pursuit of her and that though she had shrunk from opening his nephew s eyes she had always known he was a wicked man Then maddened by her dislike Jasper swore that no one else should ever marry her that he would pursue her to the death and that if she repulsed him he would bring dreadful ruin upon Neville Landless He said this no doubt knowing that Neville loved Rosebud and thinking perhaps that she loved him in return When Jasper left her Rosebud was faint from fear of his wicked eyes She made up her mind to go at once for protection to mister Grewgious in London and leaving a note for Miss Twinkleton she left by the next omnibus She told her guardian her story he told it to mister Crisparkle who came to London next morning and between them they told Lieutenant Tartar While Rosebud visited with Helena the three men took counsel together agreeing that Jasper was a villain and planning how best to deal with him The next time the choir master visited the opium garret the old woman tracked him back to Cloisterham with more success with such success indeed that she heard him sing in the cathedral and found out his name from a stranger whom she encountered This stranger was Dick Datchery the detective who discovered so much before he left her of Jasper s London habits that he went home in high good humor Datchery had a trick whenever he was following a particular search of marking each step of his progress by a chalk mark on a wall or door To day he must have been highly pleased for he drew a thick line from the very top of the cupboard door to the bottom When Charles Dickens the master story teller had told this tale thus far he fell ill and died and it was never finished The mystery of the disappearance of Edwin Drood what became of Rosebud and of mister Crisparkle how Neville and Helena fared and what was the end of Jasper are matters for each one of us to guess Many have tried to finish this story and they have ended it in various ways Before Dickens died however he told to a friend the part of the story that remained unwritten and this the friend has recorded was to be as follows By means of the old woman of the opium den Durdles the tombstone maker and The Deputy the ragged stone thrower Dick Datchery unraveled the threads which finally made into a net caught Jasper the murderer in its meshes Little by little word by word he was made at last to betray himself He had killed Edwin Drood had hidden his body in one of the vaults and covered it with lime But there had been one thing in the dead man s pocket which the lime could not destroy this was the ring set with diamonds and rubies that had been given to him by mister Grewgious By this the murder was proven mister Crisparkle and mister Grewgious worked hard to clear Neville Landless of whose guilt by the way mister Honeythunder remained always sure but poor Neville himself perished in aiding Lieutenant Tartar to seize the murderer Finding all hope of escape gone Jasper confessed his crime in the cell in which he waited for death But after all the story closed happily with the marriage of mister Crisparkle to Neville s sister Helena and that of Lieutenant Tartar to pretty little Rosebud
