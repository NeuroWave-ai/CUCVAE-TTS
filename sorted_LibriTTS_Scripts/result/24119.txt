science will have to look elsewhere But if it s fun you want try the world s most potent eggnog Shoo Hetty Thompson cried waving her battered old felt hat at the clucking cluster of hens eddying around her legs as she plowed through the flock towards the chicken house Scat You Solomon she called out directing her words at the bobbing comb of the big rooster strutting at the edge of the mob Don t just stand there like a satisfied cowhand after a night in Reno Get these noisy females outta my way She batted at the hens and they scattered with angry squawks of protest Hetty paused in the doorway of the chicken house to allow her eyes to become accustomed to the cool gloom after the bright glare of the ranch yard She could feel the first trickles of sweat forming under the man s shirt she was wearing as the hot early morning Nevada sun beat down on her back in the doorway Moving carefully but quickly through the nests she reached and groped for the eggs she knew would be found in the scattered straw As she placed each find carefully in the bucket she carried her lips moved in a soundless count When she had finished she straightened up and left the chicken house her face reflecting minor irritation Again the hens swirled about her hoping for the handfuls of cracked corn she usually tossed to them On the other side of the yard Solomon stepped majestically along the edge of the vegetable garden never crossing the hoed line separating garden from yard You d better stay over there you no account Lothario Hetty growled Five eggs short this morning and all you do is act like you were just the business agent for this bunch of fugitives from a dumpling pot Solomon cocked his head and stared Hetty down She paused at the foot of the backporch steps and threw the rooster a final remark You don t do any better than this you re liable to wind up in that pot yourself Solomon gave a scornful cluck Better still I ll get me a young rooster in here and take over your job Solomon let out a squawk and took out at a dead run herding three hens before him towards the chicken house With a satisfied smile of triumph Hetty climbed the steps and crossed to the kitchen door She turned and looked back across the yard towards the barn and corrals Barneeeeey Hetty yelled Ain t you finished with that milking yet Comin now Miz Thompson came the reply from the barn Hetty let the screen door slam behind her as she walked into the kitchen and placed the bucket of eggs on the big work table She had her arm up to wipe her moist forehead on the sleeve of her shirt when she spotted the golden egg lying in the middle of the others in the galvanized bucket She froze in the arm lifted position for several seconds staring at the dully glowing egg Then she slowly reached out and picked it up It was slightly heavier than a regular egg but for the dull gold bronze metallic appearance of the shell looked just like any of the other twenty odd eggs in the bucket She was still holding it in the palm of her hand when the kitchen door again slammed and the handy man limped into the room He carried two pails of milk across the kitchen and set them down near the sink Whatcha lookin at Miz Thompson Barney Hatfield asked Hetty frowned at the egg in her hand without answering Barney limped around the side of the table for a closer look Sunlight streaming through the kitchen windows glinted on the shell of the odd egg Barney s eyes grew round Now ain t that something he whispered in awe Hetty started as though someone had snapped their fingers in front of her staring eyes Her normal look of practical dubiousness returned Huh she snorted Even had me fooled for a second Something wrong with this egg but it sure is shootin ain t gold One of them fool hens must of been pecking in the fertilizer storeroom and got herself an overdose of some of them minerals in that stuff What are you staring at you old fool she glared at Barney It ain t gold Hetty laid the egg at one side of the table She walked to the sink and took a clean two gallon milk can from the drainboard and set it in the sink to fill it from the pails of rich frothy milk Barney had brought in the pails Sally come fresh this morning Miz Thompson he said Got herself a real fine little bull calf Hetty looked at the two pails of milk Well where s the rest of the milk then That s Queenie s milk Barney said Sally s is still out on the porch Well bring it in before the sun clabbers it Can t Barney said Hetty swung around and glared at him What do you mean you can t You suddenly come down with the glanders No m it s just that Sally s milk ain t no good he replied A frown spread over Hetty s face as she hoisted one of the milk pails and began pouring into the can in the sink What s wrong with it Barney Sally seem sick or something she asked Barney scratched his head I don t rightly know Miz Thompson That milk looks all right or at least almost all right It s kinda thin and don t have no foam like you d expect milk to have But mostly it sure don t smell right and it danged well don t taste right Phooey He made a face at the memory of the taste I stuck my finger in it when it looked kinda queer and took a taste It shore tasted lousy You probably been currying that mangey old horse of yours before you went to milking Hetty snorted and tasted his cancerous old hide on your fingers I ve told you for the last time to wash your hands before you go to milking them cows I didn t pay no eighteen hundred dollars for that prize registered Guernsey just to have you give her bag fever with your dirty hands That ain t so Miz Thompson Barney cried indignantly I did too wash my hands Good too I wuzn t near my horse this morning That milk just weren t no good Hetty finished pouring the milk into the cans and after putting the cans in the refrigerator wiped her hands on her jeans and went out onto the porch Barney trailing behind her She bent over and sniffed at the two milk pails setting beside the door Whew she exclaimed it sure does smell funny Hand me that dipper Barney Barney reached for a dipper hanging on a nail beside the kitchen door Hetty dipped out a small quantity of the milk sipped straightened up with a jerk and spewed the milk out into the yard Yaawwwk she spluttered that tastes worse n Diesel oil She stirred distastefully at the swirling flat looking liquid in the pails and then turned back to the kitchen I never saw the like of it she exclaimed Chickens come out with some kind of sorry looking egg and now in the same morning an eighteen hundred dollar registered fresh Guernsey gives out hogwash instead of milk She stared thoughtfully across the yard at the distant mountains now shimmering in the hot midmorning sun Guess we could swill the hogs with that milk rather n throw it out Barney I never seen anything them Durocs wouldn t eat When you get ready to put the other swill in the cooker toss that milk in with it and cook it up for the hogs Hetty went back into her kitchen and Barney turned and limped across the yard to the tractor shed He pulled the brim of his sweat stained Stetson over his eyes and squinted south over the heat dancing sage and sparse grasslands of Circle T range Dust devils were pirouetting in the hazy distance towards the mountains forming a corridor leading to the ranch A dirt road led out of the yard and crossed an oiled county road about five miles south of the ranch The county road was now the only link the Circle T had to the cattle shipping pens at Carson City The dirt road arrowed south across the range but fifteen miles from the ranch a six strand new barbed wire fence cut the road A white metal sign with raised letters proclaimed Road Closed U S Government Military Reservation Restricted Area Danger Peligre Keep Out The taut bands of wire stretched east and west of the road for more than twenty miles in each direction with duplicates of the metal sign hung on the fence every five hundred yards Then the wires turned south for nearly a hundred miles etching in skin blistering sun heated strands the outlines of the Nevada atomic testing grounds at Frenchman s Flat When the wire first went up Hetty and her ranching neighbors had screamed to high heaven and high congressmen about the loss of the road and range The fence stayed up Now they had gotten used to the idea and had even grown blase about the frequent nuclear blasts that rattled the desert floor sixty miles from ground zero Barney built a fire under the big smoke blackened cauldron Hetty used for cooking the hog swill Dale Hamilton the county agent had given Hetty a long talk on the dangers of feeding the pigs raw uncooked and possibly contaminated garbage When Hamilton got graphic about what happened to people who ate pork from such hogs Hetty turned politely green and had Barney set up the cooking cauldron After dumping the kitchen slops into the pot Barney hiked back across the yard to get the two pails of bad milk Hetty was sitting at the kitchen table putting the eggs into plastic refrigerator dishes when the hog slop exploded in a whooshing roar followed a split second later by an even louder blast that rocked the ranch buildings The eggs flew across the room as the lid of the slop cauldron came whistling through the kitchen window in a blizzard of flying glass and buried itself edgewise in the wall over the stove Hetty slammed backwards headfirst into a heap of shattered eggs A torrent of broken plaster and crockery fragments rained on her stunned figure Through dazed eyes she saw a column of purple reddish fire rising from the yard A woman who has been thrown twenty three times from a pitching bronco and kicked five times in the process doesn t stay dazed long Pawing dripping egg yokes and plaster from her face Hetty Thompson struggled to her feet and staggered to the kitchen door Barneeey she bawled you all right The column of weird colored flame had quickly died and only a few flickering pieces of wood from the cauldron fire burned in scattered spots about the yard Of the cauldron there wasn t a sign Barney she cried anxiously where are you Here I am Miz Thompson Barney s blackened face peered around the corner of the tractor shed You O K Miz Thompson What in thunderation happened Hetty called out You try to build a fire with dynamite for kindling Shaken but otherwise unharmed Barney painfully limped over to the ranch house porch Don t ask me what happened m am he said I just poured that milk into the slop pot and then put the lid back on and walked off I heered this big whoosh and turned around in time to see the lid fly off and the kettle begin to tip into the fire and then there was one helluva blast It knocked me clean under the tractor shed He fumbled in his pocket for a cigarette and shakily lighted it Hetty peered out over the yard and then looking up gasped Perched like a rakish derby hat on the arm of the towering pump windmill was the slop cauldron Well I ll be Hetty Thompson said You sure you didn t pour gas on that fire to make it burn faster Barney Hatfield she barked at the handy man No siree Barney declaimed loudly there weren t no gas anywhere near that fire Only thing I poured out was that there bad milk He paused and scratched his head Reckon that funny milk coulda done that Miz Thompson There ain t no gas made what ll blow up nor burn so funny as that did Hetty snorted Whoever heard of milk blowing up you old idiot A look of doubt spread You put all that milk in there No m just the one bucket Barney pointed to the other pail beside the kitchen door now half empty and standing in a pool of liquid sloshed out by the blast wave Hetty studied the milk pail for a minute and then resolutely picked it up and walked out into the yard Only one way to find out she said Get me a tin can Barney She poured about two tablespoons of the milk into the bottom of the can while Barney collected a small pile of kindling Removing the milk pail to a safe distance Hetty lighted the little pile of kindling set the tin can atop the burning wood and scooted several yards away to join Barney who had been watching from afar In less than a minute a booming whoosh sent a miniature column of purple gaseous flame spouting from the can Well whadda you know about that Hetty exclaimed wonderingly The can had flown off the fire a few feet but didn t explode Hetty went back to the milk pail and collecting less than a teaspoon full in the water dipper walked to the fire Standing as far back as she could and still reach over the flames she carefully sprinkled a few drops of the liquid directly into the fire and then jumped back Miniature balls of purple flame erupted from the fire before she could move Pieces of flaming kindling flew in all directions and one slammed Barney across the back of the neck and sent a shower of sparks down his back The handy man let out a yowl of pain and leaped for the watering trough beside the corral smoke trailing behind him Hetty thoughtfully surveyed the scene of her experiment from beneath raised eyebrows Then she grunted with satisfaction picked up the remaining milk in the pail and went back to the ranch house Barney climbed drippingly from the horse trough The kitchen was a mess Splattered eggs were over everything and broken glass crockery and plaster covered the floor table and counters Only one egg remained unbroken That was the golden egg Hetty picked it up and shook it There was a faint sensation of something moving inside the tough metallic looking shell It shook almost as a normal egg might but not quite Hetty set the strange object on a shelf and turned to the task of cleaning up Johnny Culpepper the ranch s other full time hand and Hetty s assistant manager drove the pickup into the yard just before noon He parked in the shade of the huge cottonwood tree beside the house and bounced out with an armload of mail and newspapers Inside the kitchen door he dumped the mail on the sideboard and started to toss his hat on a wall hook when he noticed the condition of the room Hetty was dishing out fragrant warmed over stew into three lunch dishes on the table She had cleaned up the worst of the mess and changed into a fresh shirt and jeans Her iron gray hair was pulled back in a still damp knot at the back after a hasty scrubbing to get out the gooey mixture of eggs and plaster Holy smoke Hetty Johnny said What happened here Your pressure kettle blow up His eyes widened when he saw the lid of the slop cauldron still embedded in the wall over the stove His gaze tracked back and took in the shattered window Had an accident Hetty said matter of factly putting the last dishes on the table Tell you about it when we eat Now you go wash up and call Barney I want you to put some new glass in that window this afternoon and get that danged lid outta the wall Curious and puzzled Johnny washed at the kitchen sink and then walked to the door to shout for Barney On the other side of the yard Barney released the pump windmill clutch While Johnny watched from the porch the weight of the heavy slop cauldron slowly turned the big windmill and as the arm adorned by the kettle rotated downward the cast iron pot slipped off and fell to the hard packed ground with a booming clang Well for the luvva Pete Johnny said in amazement Hey Barney time to eat C mon in Barney trudged across the yard and limped into the kitchen to wash They sat down to the table Now just what have you two been up to Johnny demanded as they attacked the food laden dishes Between mouthfuls the two older people gave him a rundown on the morning s mishaps The more Johnny heard the wilder it sounded Johnny had been a part of the Circle T since he was ten years old That was the year Hetty jerked him out of the hands of a Carson City policeman who had been in the process of hauling the ragged and dirty youngster to the station house for swiping a box of cookies from a grocery store Johnny s mother was dead and his father once the town s best mechanic had turned into the town s best drunk During the times his father slept one off either in the shack the man and boy occupied at the edge of town or in the local lockup Johnny ran wild Hetty took the boy to the ranch for two reasons Mainly it was the empty ache in her heart since the death of Big Jim Thompson a year earlier following a ranch tractor accident that had crushed his chest The other was her well hidden disappointment that she had been childless Hetty s bluff weathered features would never admit to loneliness or heartache Beneath the surface all the warmth and love she had went out to the scared but belligerent youngster But she never let much affection show through until Johnny had become part of her life Johnny s father died the following winter after pneumonia brought on by a night of lying drunk in the cold shack during a blizzard It was accepted without legal formality around the county that Johnny automatically became Hetty s boy She cuffed and comforted him into a gawky happy adolescence pushed him through high school and then at eighteen sent him off to the University of California at Davis to learn what the pundits of the United States Department of Agriculture had to say about animal husbandry and ranch management When Hetty and Barney had finished their recitation Johnny wore a look of frank disbelief If I didn t know you two better I d say you both been belting the bourbon bottle while I was gone But this I ve got to see They finished lunch and after Hetty stacked the dishes in the sink trooped out to the porch where Johnny went through the same examination of the milk Again a little fire was built in the open safety of the yard and a few drops of the liquid used to produce the same technicolored combustive effects Well what do you know Johnny exclaimed a four hundred octane Guernsey cow Johnny kicked out the fire and carried the milk pail to the tractor shed He parked the milk on a workbench and gathered up an armful of tools to repair the blast torn kitchen He started to leave but when the milk bucket caught his eye he unloaded the tools and fished around under the workbench for an empty five gallon gasoline can He poured the remaining milk into the closed gasoline can and replaced the cap Then he took his tools and a pane of glass from an overhead rack and headed for the house Hetty came into the kitchen as he was prying at the cauldron lid in the wall You re going to make a worse mess before you re through she said so I ll just let you finish and then clean up the whole mess afterwards I got other things to do anyway She jammed a man s old felt hat on her head and left the house Barney was unloading the last of the supplies Johnny had brought from Carson in the truck Hetty shielded her eyes against the metallic glare of the afternoon sun Gettin pretty dry Barney Throw some salt blocks in the pickup and I ll run them down to the south pasture and see if the pumps need to be turned on And you might get that wind pump going in case we get a little breeze later this afternoon But in any case better run the yard pump for an hour or so and get some water up into the tank I ll be back as soon as I take a ride through the pasture I want to see how that Angus yearling is coming that I picked out for house beef A few minutes later Hetty in the pickup disappeared behind a hot swirl of yellow dust Barney ambled to the cool pump house beneath the towering windmill An electric motor powered either from the REA line or from direct current stored in a bank of wet cell batteries bulked large in the small shed To the left a small gasoline driven generator supplied standby power if no wind was blowing to turn the arm driven generator or if the lines happened to be down as was often the case in the winter Barney threw the switch to start the pump motor Nothing happened He reached for the light switch to test the single bulb hanging from a cord to the ceiling Same nothing Muttering darkly to himself he changed the pump engine leads to DC current and closed the switch to the battery bank The engine squeaked and whined slowly but when Barney threw in the clutch to drive the pump it stopped and just hummed faintly Then he opened the AC fuse box Johnny had freed the cauldron lid and was knocking out bits of broken glass from the kitchen window frame before putting in the new glass when Barney limped into the room That pot busted the pump house lectric line Johnny when it went sailing he said Miz Thompson wants to pump up some water and on top of that the batteries are down You got time to fix the line Johnny paused and surveyed the kitchen I m going to be working here for another hour anyway so Hetty can clean up when she gets back Why don t you fire up the gasoline kicker for now and I ll fix the line when I get through here he said O K Barney nodded and turned to leave Oh forgot to ask you Miz Thompson tell you about the egg What egg Johnny asked The gold one Johnny grinned Sure and I saw the goose when I came in And you re Jack and the windmill is your beanstalk Go climb it Barney and cut out the fairy tales Naw Johnny Barney protested I ain t kidding Miz Thompson got a gold egg from the hens this morning At least it looks kinda like gold but she says it ain t See here it is He reached into the cupboard where Hetty had placed the odd egg He walked over and handed it to Johnny who was sitting on the sink drain counter to work on the shattered window The younger man turned the egg over in his hand It sure feels funny Wonder what the inside looks like He banged the egg gently against the edge of the drain board When it didn t crack he slammed it harder but then realizing that if it did break suddenly it would squish onto the floor he put the egg on the counter and tapped it with his hammer The shell split and a clear liquid poured out on to the drain board thin and clear not glutenous like a normal egg white A small reddish ball obviously the yolk rolled across the board fell into the sink and broke into powdery fragments A faint etherlike odor arose from the mess I guess Miz Thompson was right Barney said She said that hen musta been pecking in the fertilizer chemicals Never seen no egg like that before Yeh Johnny said puzzledly Well so much for that He tossed the golden shell to one side and turned back to his glass work Barney left for the pumphouse Inside the pumphouse Barney opened the gasoline engine tank and poked a stick down to test the fuel level The stick came out almost dry With another string of mutterings he limped across the yard to the tractor shed for a gas can Back in the pumphouse he poured the engine tank full set the gas can aside and then after priming the carburetor yanked on the starter pull rope The engine caught with a spluttering roar and began racing madly Barney lunged for the throttle and cut it back to idle but even then the engine was running at near full speed Then Barney noticed the white fluid running down the side of the engine tank and dripping from the spout of the gasoline can He grinned broadly cut in the pump clutch and hurriedly limped across the yard to the kitchen Hey Johnny he called did you put that milk o Sally s into a gas can Johnny leaned through the open kitchen window Yeh why Well I just filled the kicker with it by accident and man you orter hear that engine run Barney exclaimed Come see Johnny swung his legs through the window and dropped lightly to the yard The two men were halfway across the yard from the pumphouse when a loud explosion ripped the building Parts of the pump engine flew through the thin walls like shrapnel A billowing cloud of purple smoke welled out of the ruptured building as Johnny and Barney flattened themselves against the hot packed earth Flames licked up from the pump shed The men ran for the horse trough and grabbing pails of water raced for the pumphouse The fire had just started into the wooden walls of the building and a few splashes of water doused the flames They eyed the ruins of the gasoline engine Holy cow Johnny exclaimed that stuff blew the engine right apart He gazed up at the holes in the pumphouse roof Blew the cylinders and head right out the roof Holy cow Barney was pawing at the pump and electric motor Didn t seem to hurt the pump none Guess we better get that lectric line fixed though now that we ain t got no more gas engine The two men went to work on the pump motor The broken line outside the building was spliced and twenty minutes later Johnny threw the AC switch The big electric motor spun into action and settled into a workmanlike hum The overhead light dimmed briefly when the pump load was thrown on and then the slip slap sound of the pump filled the shed They watched and listened for a couple of minutes Assured that the pump was working satisfactorily they left the wrecked pumphouse Johnny was carrying the gasoline can of milk Good thing you set this off to one side where it didn t get hit and go off he said The way this stuff reacts we d be without a pump engine or windmill if it had Barney be a good guy and finish putting in that glass for me will you I ve got the frame all ready to putty I ve got me some fiddlin and figurin to do Johnny angled off to the tractor and tool shed and disappeared inside Barney limped into the kitchen and went to work on the window glass From the tractor shed came the sounds of an engine spluttering racing backfiring and then just idling When Hetty drove back into the ranch yard an hour or so later Johnny was rodeoing the farm tractor around the yard like a teen ager his face split in a wide grin She parked the truck under the tree as Johnny drove the tractor alongside and gunned the engine still grinning What in tarnation is this all about Hetty asked as she climbed down from the pickup Know what this tractor s running on Johnny shouted over the noise of the engine Of course I do you young idiot she exclaimed It s gasoline Wrong Johnny yelled triumphantly It s running on Sally s milk The next morning Johnny had mixed up two hundred gallons of Sally s Fuel and had the pickup tractor cattle truck and his nineteen fifty eight Ford and Hetty s fifty nine Chevrolet station wagon all purring on the mixture Mixing it was a simple process after he experimented and found the right proportions One quart of pure Sally s milk to one hundred gallons of water He had used the two remaining quarts in the gasoline can to make the mixture but by morning Sally had graced the ranch with five more gallons of the pure concentrate Johnny carefully stored the concentrated milk in a scoured fifty five gallon gasoline drum in the tool shed We ve hit a gold mine he told Hetty exultantly We re never going to have to buy gasoline again On top of that at the rate Sally s turning this stuff out we can start selling it in a couple of weeks and make a fortune That same morning Hetty collected three more of the golden eggs Set em on the shelf Johnny said and when we go into town next time I ll have Dale look at them and maybe tell us what those hens have been into I ll probably go into town again Saturday for the mail But when Saturday came Johnny was hobbling around the ranch on a wrenched ankle suffered when his horse stumbled in a gopher hole and tossed him You stay off that leg Hetty ordered I ll go into town for the mail Them girls can just struggle along without your romancing this week Johnny made a wry face but obeyed orders Barneeey Hetty bawled bring me a quarter of beef outta the cooler Barney stuck his head out of the barn and nodded I been promising some good beef to Judge Hatcher for a month of Sundays now Hetty said to Johnny If you re going to stop by the courthouse how about taking those crazy eggs of yours into the county agent s office and leave them there for analysis Johnny suggested He hobbled into the kitchen to get the golden eggs Barney arrived with the chilled quarter of beef wrapped in burlap He tossed it in the bed of the pickup and threw more sacks over it to keep it cool under the broiling midmorning sun Johnny came out with the eggs in a light cardboard box stuffed with crumpled newspapers He wedged the box against the side of beef in the forward corner of the truck bed One more thing Hetty he said I ve got a half drum of drain oil in the tractor shed that I ve been meaning to trade in for some gearbox lube that Willy Simons said he d let me have Can you drop it off at his station and pick up the grease Throw it on Hetty said while I go change into some town clothes Johnny started to hobble down the porch steps when Barney stopped him I ll get it boy you stay off that ankle Barney climbed into the pickup and drove it around to the tractor shed He spotted two oil drums in the gloomy shed He tilted the nearest one and felt liquid slosh near the halfway mark then rolled it out the door Barney heaved it into the truck bed stood it on end against the cab and drove the pickup back to the ranch house door as Hetty came out wearing clean jeans and a bright flowered blouse Her gray hair was tucked in a neat bun beneath a blocked Stetson hat She climbed into the truck waved to the two men and drove out the yard As she bumped over the cattle guard at the gate the wooden plug that Johnny had jury rigged to cork the gasoline drum with its twenty gallon load of pure Sally s milk bounced out A small geyser of white fluid shot out of the drum as she hit another bump and then the pickup went jolting down the ranch road little splashes of Sally s milk sloshing out with each bump and forming a pool on the bottom of the truck When Hetty cowboyed onto the county road the drum tipped dangerously and then bounced back onto its base This time a fountain of milk geysered out and splashed heavily into the box of golden eggs Hetty drove on But not for long With a ranch woman s disregard for watching the road Hetty constantly scanned the nearby range lands where small bands of her cherished black Angus grazed She prided herself on the fact that despite her sixty years her eyes were still sharp enough to spot a worm ridden cow at a thousand yards Two miles after she turned onto the county road which ran through Circle T range land her roving gaze took in a cow and calf on a hillside a few hundred yards south of the road Hetty slowed the pickup to fifty miles an hour and squinted into the sun She grunted with satisfaction and slammed on the brakes The truck swerved and skidded to a halt at the left side of the deserted road Hetty leaped from the truck and began a fast walk up the hillside for a closer look at the cow and calf She never heard the dull thump of the milk drum tipping onto the edge of the truck bed Hetty topped the hill and walked slowly towards the cow and calf that were now edging away from her As she eased down the far side of the hill out of sight of the pickup a steady stream of Sally s milk was engulfing the box of golden eggs A minute later the reduced contents caused the drum to shift and slip It fell onto the eggs cracking a half dozen The earth split open and the world around Hetty erupted in a roaring inferno of purple red fire and ear shattering sound The rolling concussion swept Hetty from her feet and tumbled her into a drywash gully at the base of the hill The gully saved her life as the sky splitting shock wave rolled over her Stunned and deafened she flattened herself under a slight overhang The rolling blast rocked ranches and towns for more than one hundred miles and the ground wave triggered the seismographs at the University of California nearly two hundred miles away and at UCLA four hundred miles distant Tracking and testing instruments went wild along the entire length of the AEC atomic test grounds a mere sixty miles south of the smoking gaping hole that marked the end of the Circle T pickup truck In a direct line the ranch house was about eight miles from the explosion Johnny was lounging in Hetty s favorite rocking chair on the wide back verandah lighting a cigarette and Barney was perched on the porch railing when the sky was blotted out by the dazzling violet light of the blast They were blinking in frozen amazement when the shock wave smashed into the ranch flattening the flimsier buildings and buckling the side and roof of the steel braced barn Every window on the place blew out in a storm of deadly glass shards The rolling ground wave in the wake of the shock blast rocked and bounced the solid timber and adobe main house The concussion hit Johnny like a fist pinwheeling him backwards in the rocker against the wall of the house It caught Barney like a sack of sodden rags and flung him atop the dazed and semiconscious younger man The first frightened screams of the horses in the barns and corrals were mingling with the bawling of the heifers in the calf pens when the sound of the explosion caught up with the devastation of the shock and ground waves Like the reverberation of a thousand massed cannon firing at once the soul searing sound rumbled out of the desert and boiled with almost tangible density into the shattered ranch yard It flattened the feebly stirring men on the porch and then thundered on in a tidal wave of noise Barney moaned and rolled off the tangle of porch rocker and stunned youth beneath him Johnny lay dazed another second or two and then began struggling to his feet Hetty he croaked pointing wildly to the south where a massive dirty column of purple smoke and fire rose skyward like the stem of a monstrous and malignant toadstool Hetty s out there He stumbled from the porch and broke into a staggering run to the pile of broken planks that seconds ago had been the tractor shed As he crossed the yard a great gust of wind whipped back from the north pumping clouds of dry dusty earth before it The force of the wind almost knocked the bruised and shaken Johnny from his feet once again as it swept back over the ranch in the direction of the great pillar of purple smoke Implosion Johnny s mind registered He tore at the stack of loose boards leaning against the station wagon flinging them fiercely aside in his frantic efforts to free the vehicle Barney limped up to join him and a minute later they had cleared a way into the wagon Johnny squeezed into the front seat and drove it back from under more leaning boards Three of the side windows were smashed but the windshield was intact except for a small starred crack in the safety glass Clear of the debris Barney opened the opposite door and slid in beside Johnny Dirt spun from beneath the wheels of the car as he slammed his foot to the floor and raced towards the smoke column that now towered more than a mile and a half into the air Beneath her protective overhang Hetty stirred and moaned feebly Twin rivulets of dark blood trickled from her nostrils Thick dust was settling on the area and she coughed and gasped for breath On the opposite side of the hill a vast torn crater nearly a hundred feet across and six to ten feet deep smoked like a stirring volcano and gave off a strange pungent odor of ether Johnny Culpepper s dramatic charge to the rescue was no more dramatic than the reaction in a dozen other places in Nevada and California Particularly sixty miles south where a small army of military and scientific men were preparing for an atomic underground shot when the Circle T pickup vanished The shock wave rippled across the desert floor flowed around the mountains and tunneled into Frenchman s Flat setting off every shock measuring instrument Then came the ground wave rolling through the earth like a gopher through a garden Ditto for ground wave measuring devices Lastly the sound boomed onto the startled scientists and soldiers like the pounding of great timpani under the vaulted dome of the burning sky On mountain top observation posts technicians turned unbelieving eyes north to the burgeoning pillar of smoke and dust then yelped and swung optical and electronic instruments to bear on the fantastic column In less than fifteen minutes the test under preparation had been canceled all equipment secured and the first assault waves of scientists soldiers intelligence and security men were racing north behind white suited and sealed radiation detection teams cradling Geiger counters in their arms like submachine guns Telephone lines were jammed with calls from Atomic Energy Commission field officials reporting the phenomena to Washington and calling for aid from West Coast and New Mexico AEC bases Jet fighters at Nellis Air Force base near Las Vegas were scrambled and roared north over the ground vehicles to report visual conditions near the purple pillar of power The Associated Press office in San Francisco had just received word of the quake recorded by the seismograph at Berkeley when a staffer on the other side of the desk answered a call from the AP stringer in Carson City reporting the blast and mighty cloud in the desert sky One fast look at the map showed that the explosion was well north of the AEC testing ground limits The Carson City stringer was ordered to get out to the scene on the double and hold the fort while reinforcements of staffers and photographers were flown from Frisco Before any of the official or civil agencies had swung into action the Circle T station wagon had rocketed off the ranch road and turned onto the oiled county highway leading both to Carson City and the now expanding but less dense column of smoke Johnny hunched over the wheel and peered through the thickening pall of smoke and dust reluctant to ease off his breakneck speed but knowing that they had to find Hetty if she were alive Neither man had said a word since the wagon raced from the ranch yard There was no valid reason to associate the explosion with Hetty yet instinctively and naggingly Johnny knew that somehow Hetty was involved Barney still ignorant of his error of the oil drums just clung to his seat and prayed for the best The dust was almost too thick to see forcing Johnny to slow the station wagon as they penetrated deeper into the base of the smoke column Hiding under his frantic concern for Hetty was the half formed thought that the whole thing was an atomic explosion and that he and Barney were heading into sure radiation deaths His logic nudged at the thought and said If it were atomic you started dying back on the porch so might as well play the hand out A puff of wind swirled the dust up away from the road as the station wagon came up to the smoking crater Johnny slammed on the brakes and he and Barney jumped from the car to stand awe struck at the edge of the hole The dust deadened air muffled Johnny s sobbing exclamation Dear God They walked slowly around the ragged edges of the crater Barney bent down and picked a tiny metallic fragment from the pavement He stared at it and then tapped Johnny on the arm and handed it to him wordlessly It was a twisted piece of body steel bright at its torn edges and coated with the scarlet enamel that had been the color of the Circle T pickup Johnny s eyes filled with tears and he shoved the little scrap of metal in his pocket Let s see what else we can find Barney The two men began working a slow search of the area in ever widening circles from the crater that led them finally up and over the top of the little hill to the south of the road Fifteen minutes later they found Hetty and ten minutes after that the wiry resilient ranchwoman was sitting between them on the seat of the station wagon explaining how she happened to be clear of the pickup when the blast occurred The suspicion that had been growing in Johnny s mind now brought into the open by his relief at finding Hetty alive and virtually unhurt bloomed into full flower Barney Johnny asked softly which oil drum did you put in the back of the pickup The facts were falling into place like the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle when the Carson City reporter leading a caravan of cars and emergency vehicles from town by a good ten minutes and beating the AEC and military teams by twenty minutes found the Circle T trio sitting in the station wagon at the lip of the now faintly smoldering crater A half hour later the AP man in San Francisco picked up the phone I ve just come back from that explosion the Carson City stringer said The AP man put his hand over the phone and called across the desk Get ready for a ninety five first lead blast O K the San Francisco desk man said let s have it He tucked the phone between chin and shoulder and poised over his typewriter Well there s a crater more than one hundred feet across and ten feet deep the Carson City stringer dutifully recounted The scene is on County Road thirty eight about forty miles east of here and the blast rocked Carson City and caused extensive breakage for miles around What caused it the AP desk man asked as he pounded out a lead A lady at the scene said her milk and eggs blew up the Carson City stringer said Ten miles south the leading AEC disaster truck stopped behind the six strand fence blocking the range road Two men with wire cutters jumped from the truck and snipped the twanging wires The metal Keep Out sign banged to the ground and was kicked aside The truck rolled through the gap and the men swung aboard Behind them was a curtain of dust rising sluggishly in the hot sky marking the long convoy of other official vehicles pressing hard on the trail of the emergency truck When the range road cut across the county highway the driver paused long enough to see that the heaviest smoke concentrations from the unknown blast lay to the west He swung left onto the oiled road and barreled westward In less than a mile he spied the flashing red light of a State trooper s car parked in the center of the road The scene looked like a combination of the San Francisco quake and the Los Angeles county fair Dozens of cars trucks two fire engines and a Good Humor man were scattered around the open range land on both sides of the vast crater still smoldering in the road A film of purple dust covered the immediate area and still hung in the air coating cars and people Scores of men women and children lined the rim of the crater gawking into the smoky pit while other scores roamed aimlessly around the nearby hill and desert A young sheriff s deputy standing beside the State trooper s car raised his hand to halt the AEC disaster van The truck stopped and the white suited radiation team leaped from the vehicle counters in hand racing for the crater Back the chief of the squad yelled at the top of his lungs Everybody get back This area is radiation contaminated Hurry There was a second of stunned comprehension and then a mad pan demonic scrambling of persons and cars bumping and jockeying to flee The radiation team fanned out around the crater fumbling at the level scales on their counters when the instruments failed to indicate anything more than normal background count All of the vehicles had pulled back to safety all except a slightly battered station wagon still parked a yard or two from the eastern edge of the crater The radiation squad leader ran over to the wagon Three people two men and a dirty disheveled and bloody nosed older woman sat in the front seat munching Good Humor bars Didn t you hear me the AEC man yelled Get outta here This area s hot Radioactive Dangerous GET MOVING The woman leaned out the window and patted the radiation expert soothingly on the shoulder Shucks sonny no need to get this excited over a little spilt milk Milk the AEC man yelped purpling Milk I said this is a hot area it s loaded with radiation Look at this He pointed to the meter on his counter then stopped gawked at the instrument and shook it And stared again The meter flicked placidly along at the barely above normal background level count Hey Jack one of the other white suited men on the far side of the crater called this hole doesn t register a thing The squad chief stared incredulously at his counter and banged it against the side of the station wagon Still the needle held in the normal zone He banged it harder and suddenly the needle dropped to zero as Hetty and her ranch hands peered over the AEC man s shoulder at the dial Now ain t that a shame Barney said sympathetically You done broke it The rest of the disaster squad helmets off in the blazing sun and lead coated suits unfastened drifted back to the squad leader at the Circle T station wagon A mile east the rest of the AEC convoy had arrived and halted in a huge fan of vehicles parked a safe distance from the crater A line of more white suited detection experts moved cautiously forward With a stunned look the first squad leader turned and walked slowly down the road towards the approaching line He stopped once and looked back at the gaping hole down at his useless counter shook his head and continued on to meet the advancing units By nightfall new strands of barbed wire reflected the last rays of the red Nevada sun Armed military policemen and AEC security police in powder blue battle jackets patrolled the fences around the county road crater And around the fence that now enclosed the immediate vicinity of the Circle T ranch buildings Floodlights bathed the wire and cast an eerie glow over the mass of parked cars and persons jammed outside the fence A small helicopter sat off to the right of the impromptu parking lot and an NBC newscaster gave the world a verbal description of the scene while he tried to talk above the snorting of the gas powered generator that was supplying the Associated Press radio telephone link to San Francisco Black AEC vans and dun colored military vehicles raced to and from the ranch headquarters pausing to be cleared by the sentries guarding the main gates The AP log recorded one hundred eighteen major daily papers using the AP story that afternoon and the following morning CARSON CITY NEV May twelve AP A kiloton eggnog rocked the scientific world this morning On a Nevada ranch forty miles east of here sixty year old Mehatibel Thompson is milking a cow that gives milk more powerful than an atomic bomb Her chickens are laying the triggering mechanisms This the world learned today when an earth shaking explosion rocked Inside the Circle T ranch house Hetty bathed and cleaned and only slightly the worse for her experiences was hustling about the kitchen throwing together a hasty meal Johnny and Barney had swept up a huge pile of broken glass crockery and dirt and Hetty had salvaged what dishes remained unshattered by the blast She weaved through a dozen men grouped around the kitchen table some in military or security police garb three of them wearing the uniform of the atomic scientist in the field bright Hawaiian sports shirts dark glasses blue denims and sneakers Johnny and Barney huddled against the kitchen drainboard out of the main stream of traffic The final editions of the San Francisco Call Bulletin Oakland Tribune Los Angeles Herald Express and the Carson City Appeal were spread out on the table Hetty pushed them aside to put down dishes The glaring black headlines stared up at her Dairy Detonation Devastates Desert the alliterative Chronicle banner read Bossy s Blast Rocks Bay Area said the Trib Atomic Butter And Egg Blast Jars LA the somewhat inaccurate Herald Ex proclaimed Thompson Ranch Scene of Explosion the Appeal stated hewing to solid facts missus Thompson the oldest of the scientists said won t you please put down those dishes for a few minutes and give us the straight story All afternoon long its been one thing or another with you and all we ve been able to get out of you is this crazy milk egg routine Time enough to talk after we ve all had a bite to eat Hetty said juggling a platter of steaks and a huge bowl of mashed potatoes to the table Now we ve all had a hard day and we can all stand to get on the outside of some solid food I ain t had a bite to eat since this morning and I guess you boys haven t had much either And since you ve seemed to have made yourselves to home here then by golly you re going to sit down and eat with us Besides she added over her shoulder as she went back to the stove for vegetables and bread me n Johnny have already told you what story there is to tell That s all there is to it She put more platters on the now heaping table and then went around the table pouring coffee from the big ranch pot All right you men sit down now and dig in she ordered missus Thompson an Army major with a heavy brush mustache said we didn t come here to eat We came for information Hetty shoved back a stray wisp of hair and glared at the man Now you listen to me you young whippersnapper I didn t invite you but since you re here you ll do me the goodness of being a mite more polite she snapped The major winced and glanced at the senior scientist The older man raised his eyes expressively and shrugged He moved to the table and sat down There was a general scuffling of chairs and the rest of the group took places around the big table Johnny and Barney took their usual flanking positions beside Hetty at the head of the board Hetty took her seat and looked around the table with a pleased smile Now that s more like it She bowed her head and after a startled glance the strangers followed suit We thank Thee dear Lord Hetty said quietly for this food which we are about to eat and for all Your help to us this day It s been a little rough in spots but I reckon You ve got Your reasons for all of it Seein as how tomorrow is Your day anyway we ask that it be just a mite quieter Amen The satisfying clatter of chinaware and silver and polite muttered requests for more potatoes and gravy filled the kitchen for the next quarter of an hour as the hungry men went to work on the prime Circle T yearling beef After his second steak third helping of potatoes and gravy and fourth cup of coffee the senior scientist contentedly shoved back from the table Hetty was polishing the last dabs of gravy from her plate with a scrap of bread The scientist pulled a pipe and tobacco pouch from his pocket With your permission m am he asked his hostess Hetty grinned For heaven s sake fire it up sonny Big Jim that was my husband used to say that no meal could be said properly finished unless it had been smoked into position for digestion Several of the other men at the table followed suit with pipes cigars and cigarettes Hetty smiled benignly around the table and turned to the senior scientist What did you say your name was sonny she asked doctor Floyd Peterson missus Thompson he replied and at forty six years of age I deeply thank you for that sonny He reached for the stack of newspapers on the floor beside his chair and pushing back his plate laid them on the table Now missus Thompson let s get down to facts he rapped the headlines with a knuckle You have played hell with our schedule and I ve got to have the answers soon before I have the full atomic commission and a congressional investigation breathing down my neck What did you use to make that junior grade earthquake Why I ve already told you more n a dozen times sonny Hetty replied It must of been the combination of them queer eggs and Sally s milk The brush mustached major sipping his coffee spluttered and choked Beside him the head of the AEC security force at Frenchman s Flat leaned forward missus Thompson I don t know what your motives are but until I find out I m deeply thankful that you gave those news hounds this this butter and egg business he said Milk and eggs Hetty corrected him mildly Well milk and eggs then But the time has ended for playing games We must know what caused that explosion and you and mister Culpepper and mister Hatfield he nodded to Johnny and Barney sitting beside Hetty are the only ones who can tell us Already told you Hetty repeated Johnny hid a grin Look missus Thompson doctor Peterson said loudly and with ill concealed exasperation you created and set off an explosive force that dwarfed every test we ve made at Frenchman s Flat in four years The force of your explosive was apparently greater than that of a fair sized atomic device and only our Pacific tests and those of the Russians have been any greater Yet within a half hour or forty five minutes after the blast there wasn t a trace of radiation at ground level no aerial radiation and not one report of upper atmosphere contamination or fallout within a thousand miles missus Thompson I appeal to your patriotism Your friends your country the free people of the world need this invention of yours Hetty s eyes grew wide and then her features set in a mold of firm determination Shoving back her chair and raising to stand stiffly erect and with chin thrust forward she was every inch the True Pioneer Woman of the West I never thought of that she said solemnly By golly if my country needs this like that then by golly my country s going to have it The officials leaned forward in anticipation You can have Sally s Cloverdale Marathon III and I don t want one cent for her either And you can take the hens too There was a stunned silence and then the Army major strangled on a mouthful of coffee the security man turned beet red in the face and doctor Peterson s jaw bounced off his breastbone Johnny unable to hold back an explosion of laughter dashed for the back porch and collapsed The kitchen door slammed and doctor Peterson stamped out on to the porch pipe clamped between clenched teeth his face black with anger and frustration He ignored Johnny who was standing beside the rail wiping tears from his eyes Culpepper recovered himself and walked over to the irate physicist doctor Peterson you re a man of science Johnny said and a scientist is supposed to be willing to accept a fact and then possibly determine the causes behind the fact after he recognizes what he sees Isn t that so Now look here Peterson angrily swung around to face Johnny I ve taken all I intend to take from you people with your idiotic story I don t intend to Johnny took the older man by the elbow and gently but firmly propelled him from the porch towards the barn I don t intend to either insult your intelligence doctor Peterson or attempt to explain what has happened here But I do intend to show you what we know Bright floodlights illuminated the yard and a crew of soldiers were stringing telephone wires from the guarded front gate across the open space to the ranch house Beyond the new barbed wire fence there was an excited stir and rush for the wire as a sharp eyed newsman spotted Johnny and the scientist crossing the yard The two men ignored the shouted requests for more up to the minute information as they walked into the barn Johnny switched on the lights The lowing of the two prize Guernseys in the stalls at the right of the door changed to loud plaintive bawling as the lights came on Both cows were obviously in pain from their swollen and unmilked udders Seeing is believing Doc Johnny asked pointing to the cows Seeing what Peterson snapped I knew we were going to have some tall explaining to do when you fellows took over here Johnny said and of course I don t blame you one bit That was some blast Hetty set off out there You don t know doctor Peterson murmured fearfully you just don t know So Johnny continued I deliberately didn t milk these cows so that you could see for yourself that we aren t lying Now mind you I don t have the foggiest idea WHY this is happening but I m going to show you at least WHAT happened He picked up a pair of milk buckets from a rack beside the door and walked towards the cow stalls Peterson trailing This Johnny said pointing to the larger of the two animals is Queenie Her milk is just about as fine as you can get from a champion milk producing line And this he reached over and patted the flank of the other cow is Sally s Cloverdale Marathon III She s young and up to now has given good but not spectacular quantities or qualities of milk She s from the same blood line as Queenie Sally had dried up from her first calf and we bred her again and on Wednesday she came fresh Only it isn t milk that she s been giving Watch Kicking a milking stool into position he placed a bucket under Queenie s distended bag and began squirting the rich foaming milk into the pail with a steady fast and even rhythm When he had finished he set the two full buckets with their thick heads of milk foam outside the stall and brought two more clean empty buckets He moved to the side of the impatient Sally As Peterson watched Johnny filled the buckets with the same flat oily looking white fluid that Sally had been producing since Wednesday The scientist began to show mild interest Johnny finished stripped the cow and then carried the pails out and set them down beside the first two O K now look them over yourself he told Peterson The scientist peered into the buckets Johnny handed him a ladle Look Culpepper Peterson said I m a physicist not a farmer or an agricultural expert How do you expect me to know what milk is supposed to do Until I was fifteen years old I thought the milk came out of one of those spigots and the cream out of another Stir it Johnny ordered The scientist took the ladle angrily and poked at the milk in Queenie s buckets Taste it Johnny said Peterson glared at the younger man and then took a careful sip of the milk Some of the froth clung to his lips and he licked it off Taste like milk to me he said Smell it Johnny ordered Peterson sniffed O K now do the same things to the other buckets Peterson swished the ladle through the buckets containing Sally s milk The white liquid swirled sluggishly and oillike He bent over and smelled and made a grimace Go on Johnny demanded taste it Peterson took a tiny sip tasted and then spat All right he said I m now convinced that there s something different about this milk I m not saying anything is wrong with it because I wouldn t know All I m admitting is that it is different So what Come on Johnny took the ladle from him He carried the buckets of Queenie s milk into the cooler room and dumped them in a small pasturizer Then carrying the two pails of Sally s milk Johnny and the physicist left the barn and went to the shattered remains of the tractor shed Fumbling under wrecked and overturned tables and workbenches Johnny found an old and rusted pie tin Placing the tin in the middle of the open spaces of the yard he turned to Peterson Now you take that pail of milk and pour a little into the pan Not much now just about enough to cover the bottom or a little more He again handed the ladle to Peterson The scientist dipped out a small quantity of the white fluid and carefully poured it into the pie plate That s enough Johnny cautioned Now let s set these buckets a good long ways from here He picked up the buckets and carried them to the back porch He vanished into the kitchen By this time the strange antics of the two men had attracted the attention of the clamoring newsmen outside the fence and they jammed against the wire shouting pleas for an interview or information The network television camera crews trained their own high powered lights into the yard to add to the brilliance of the military lights and began recording the scene doctor Peterson glared angrily at the mob and turned as Johnny rejoined him Culpepper are you trying to make a fool of me he hissed Got a match Johnny queried ignoring the question The pipe smoking scientist pulled out a handful of kitchen matches Johnny produced a glass fish casting rod with a small wad of cloth tied to the weighted hook Leading Peterson back across the yard about fifty feet Johnny handed the rag to Peterson Smell it he said I put a little kerosene on it so it would burn when it goes through the air Peterson nodded You much of a fisherman Johnny asked I can drop a fly on a floating chip at fifty yards the physicist said proudly Johnny handed him the rod and reel O K Doc light up your rag and then let s see you drop it in that pie plate While TV cameras hummed and dozens of still photographers pointed telescopic lenses and prayed for enough light doctor Peterson ignited the little wad of cloth He peered behind to check for obstructions and then with the wrist flicking motion of the devoted and expert fisherman made his cast The tiny torch made a blurred whipping streak of light and dropped unerringly into the pie plate in the middle of the yard The photographers had all the light they needed The night turned violet as a violent ball of purple fire reared and boiled into the darkened sky The flash bathed the entire ranch headquarters and the packed cars and throngs outside the fence in the strange brilliance The heat struck the dumfounded scientist and young rancher like the suddenly opened door of a blast furnace It was over in a second as the fire surged and then winked out The sudden darkness blinded them despite the unchanged power of the television and military floodlights still focused on the yard Pandemonium erupted from the ranks of newsmen and photographers who had witnessed the dazzling demonstration Peterson stared in awe at the slightly smoking and warped pie tin Well cut out my tongue and call me Oppenheimer he exclaimed That was just the milk Johnny said You know of a good safe place we could try it out with one of those eggs I d be afraid to test em anywhere around here after what happened to Hetty this morning An hour later a military helicopter chewed its way into the night carrying three gallons of Sally s milk from the ranch to Nellis AFB where a jet stood ready to relay the sealed cannister to the AEC laboratories at Albuquerque In the ranch house living room Peterson had set up headquarters and an Army field telephone switchboard was in operation across the room An AEC security man was running the board Hetty had decided that one earthquake a day was enough and had gone to bed Barney bewildered but happily pleased at so much company sat on the edge of a chair and avidly watched and listened not understanding a thing he saw or heard At the back of the room Johnny hunched over Big Jim Thompson s roll top desk working up a list of supplies he would need to repair the damages from the week s growing list of explosions Peterson and three of his staff members were in lengthy consultation at a big table in the middle of the room The Army field phone at Peterson s elbow jangled Across the room the switchboard operator swung around and called It s the commissioner doctor Peterson I just got through to him Peterson picked up the phone John he shouted into the instrument Peterson here Where have you been Tinny audible squawks came from the phone and Peterson held it away from his ear Yes I know all about it he said Yes yes yes I know you ve had a time with the papers Yes I heard the radio Yes John I know it sounds pretty ridiculous What Get up to the ranch and find out Where do you think I m calling from The squawking rattled the receiver and Peterson winced Look commissioner he broke in I can t put a stop to those stories What I said I can t put a stop to the stories for one reason They re true The only sound that came from the phone was the steady hum of the line Are you there John Peterson asked There was an indistinct mumble from Washington Now listen carefully John What I need out here just as quickly as you can round them up and get them aboard a plane is the best team of biogeneticists in the country What No I don t need a team of psychiatrists commissioner I am perfectly normal Peterson paused I think He talked with his chief for another fifteen minutes At two other telephones around the big table his chief deputy and the senior security officer of the task force handled a half dozen calls during Peterson s lengthy conversation When Peterson hung up the machinery was in motion gathering the nation s top biochemists animal geneticists agricultural and animal husbandry experts and a baker s dozen of other assorted ists ready to package and ship them by plane and train to the main AEC facility at Frenchman s Flat and to the Circle T Peterson sighed gustily as he laid down the phone and reached for his pipe Across the table his assistant put a hand over the mouthpiece of his telephone and leaned towards Peterson It s the Associated Press in New York he whispered They re hotter than a pistol about the blackout and threatening to call the President and every congressman in Washington if we don t crack loose with something Why couldn t I have flunked Algebra Two Peterson moaned No I had to be a genius Now look at me A milkmaid He looked at his watch Tell em we ll hold a press conference at eight zero a m outside the ranch gate The assistant spoke briefly into the phone and again turned to Peterson They say they want to know now whether the milk and egg story is true They say they haven t had anything but an official runaround and a lot of rumor Tell them we neither deny nor confirm the story Say we are investigating We ll give them a formal statement in the morning Peterson ordered He left the table and walked to the desk where Johnny was finishing his list of building supplies What time do you usually get those eggs he asked Well as a rule Hetty gets out and gathers them up about nine each morning But they ve probably been laid a couple of hours earlier That s going to make us awfully late to produce anything for those babbling reporters the scientist said Come to think of it Johnny said thoughtfully we could rig up a light in the chicken house and make the hens lay earlier That way you could have some eggs about four or five o clock in the morning Barney had been listening And them eggs make a mighty fine breakfast of a morning he volunteered cheerfully Peterson glared at him and Johnny grinned I think the doctor wants the golden kind he said with a smile Oh them Barney said with a snort of disgust They wouldn t make an omelet fit for a hog You don t want to fuss with them doc

4511-45511-0037	train-other-500	A short time later the number of golden eggs dropped daily until one morning there were none They never reappeared The United States had stockpiled twenty six dozen in an underground cave deep in the Rockies
none	none	 Man who had burst like a butterfly into space crawled back into his cocoon and pondered upon the stars from a worm s eye point of view Banging around in the back end of a common cattle truck Sally s Cloverdale Marathon III 
4511-45512-0000	train-other-500	came home to the Circle T in disgrace In a corner of the truck the late Solomon s harem cackled and voiced loud cries of misery as they huddled in the rude slatted shipping coop
4511-45512-0001	train-other-500	The truck turned off the county road and onto the dirt road leading to the main buildings It rattled across the cattle guard and through the new unprotected and open gate in the barbed wire fence
4511-45512-0002	train-other-500	Life had returned almost to normal at the Circle T But not for long Five days after Sally s ignominious dismissal from the armed forces a staff car came racing up to the ranch
4511-45512-0003	train-other-500	It skidded to a halt at the back porch steps doctor Peterson jumped out and dashed up to the kitchen door
none	none	 Well for heaven s sake Hetty cried Come on in sonny I 
4511-45512-0004	train-other-500	ain t seen you for the longest spell Peterson entered and looked around Where s Johnny missus Thompson he asked excitedly I ve got some wonderful news Now ain t that nice Hetty exclaimed
4511-45512-0005	train-other-500	Your wife have a new baby or something Johnny s down at the barn I ll call him for you She moved towards the door Never mind Peterson said darting out the door I ll go down to the barn He jumped from the porch and ran across the yard
4511-45512-0006	train-other-500	He found Johnny in the barn rigging a new block and tackle for the hayloft Barney was helping thread the new manila line from a coil on the straw littered floor Johnny we ve found it Peterson shouted jubilantly
4511-45512-0007	train-other-500	as he burst into the barn Why Doc good to see you again Johnny said Found what The secret of Sally s milk Peterson cried He looked wildly around the barn Where is she Who
4511-45512-0008	train-other-500	Sally of course the scientist yelped Oh she s down in the lower pasture with Queenie Johnny replied She s all right isn t she Peterson asked anxiously
none	none	 Oh sure she s fine Doc Why 
4511-45512-0009	train-other-500	Listen Peterson said hurriedly our people think they ve stumbled on something Now we still don t know what s in those eggs or in Sally s milk that make them react as they do
4511-45512-0010	train-other-500	All we ve been able to find is some strange isotope but we don t know how to reproduce it or synthesize it But we do think we know what made Sally give that milk and made those hens start laying the gold eggs
4511-45512-0011	train-other-500	Johnny and Barney laid down their work and motioned the excited scientist to join them on a bench against the horse stalls Do you remember the day Sally came fresh Peterson continued
4511-45512-0012	train-other-500	Not exactly Johnny replied but I could look it up in my journal I keep a good record of things like new registered stock births Never mind Peterson said
4511-45512-0013	train-other-500	I ve already checked It was May ninth He paused and smiled triumphantly I guess that s right if you say so Johnny said But what about it
4511-45512-0014	train-other-500	And that was the same day that the hens laid the first golden egg too wasn t it
none	none	 Peterson asked Why it sure was Doc Barney chimed in I remember cause Miz Thompson was so mad that the milk was bad and the eggs went wrong both in the same day That s what we know Now listen to this Johnny the scientist continued During the night of May eighth we fired an entirely new kind of test shot on the range I can t tell you what it was only to say that it was a special atomic device 
4511-45512-0015	train-other-500	that even we didn t know too much about That s why we fired it from a cave in the side of a hill down there Since then our people have been working on the pretty good assumption
4511-45512-0016	train-other-500	that something happened to that cow and those chickens
none	none	 not too long before they started giving the Eggnog ingredients 
4511-45512-0017	train-other-500	Someone remembered the experimental test shot checked the date and then went out and had a look at the cave We already had some earlier suspicions that this device produced a new type of beam ray
4511-45512-0018	train-other-500	We took sightings from the cave found them to be in a direct unbroken line with the Circle T We set up the device again and using a very small model tried it out on some chick embryos
4511-45512-0019	train-other-500	Sure enough we got a mutation But not the right kind
none	none	 So we re going to recreate the entire situation right here only this time we re going to expose not only Sally but a dozen other Guernseys from as close to her blood line as we can get 
4511-45512-0020	train-other-500	And we already knew that you had a young rooster sired by Solomon But Doc Johnny protested Sally had a calf early that morning Isn t that going to make a difference
4511-45512-0021	train-other-500	Of course it is Peterson exclaimed And she s going to have another one the same way And so are all the other cows You re the one that told me she had her calf by artificial insemination didn t you Johnny nodded
4511-45512-0022	train-other-500	Well then she s going to have another calf from the same bull and so will the other cows
none	none	 Pore Sally 
4511-45512-0023	train-other-500	Barney said sorrowfully They re sure takin the romance outta motherhood for you The next day the guards were back on the gate
none	none	 By midafternoon twelve fine young Guernseys arrived 
4511-45512-0024	train-other-500	together with a corps of veterinarians biologists and security police By nightfall Sally and her companions were all once again in a delicate condition A mile from the ranch house a dormitory was built for the veterinarians and biologists
4511-45512-0025	train-other-500	and a barracks thrown up for the security guards A thirty five thousand dollar twelve foot high chain link fence topped by barbed wire was constructed around the pasture and armored cars patrolled the fence by day
4511-45512-0026	train-other-500	and kept guard over the pregnant bovines by night in the barn
none	none	 Through the fall into the long winter and back to budding spring again 
4511-45512-0027	train-other-500	the host of experts and guards watched and cared for the new calf bloated herd The fact that Sally had gone dry had been kept a carefully guarded national secret
4511-45512-0028	train-other-500	To keep up the pretense and show to the world that America still controlled the only proven method of manned space travel the Joint Chiefs of Staff voted to expend two hundred gallons of the precious small store of milk on hand
4511-45512-0029	train-other-500	for another interplanetary junket this time to inspect the rings around Saturn Piloting a smaller and more sophisticated but equally well protected version of Icarus Major Quartermain abandoned the fleshpots of earth
none	none	 and the adulation of his coast to coast collection of worshiping females 
4511-45512-0030	train-other-500	to again hurtle into the unknown It was strictly a milk run Major Quartermain was quoted as saying as he emerged from his ship after an uneventful but propaganda loaded trip By the middle of May
4511-45512-0031	train-other-500	it was the consensus of the veterinarians that Delivery Day would be July fourth Plans were drafted for the repeat atomic cave shot
none	none	 at nine zero p m 
4511-45512-0032	train-other-500	July third The pregnant herd was to be given labor inducing shots at midnight and if all went well deliveries would start within a few hours Just to be sure that nothing would shield the cows from the rays of the explosion
4511-45512-0033	train-other-500	they were put in a corral on the south side of the barn until nine thirty p m on the night of the firing Solomon s successor and a new bevy of hens were already roosting in the same old chicken house and egg production was normal
none	none	 On the night of July third at precisely nine zero p m a sheet of light erupted from the Nevada hillside cave 
4511-45512-0034	train-other-500	and the ground shook and rumbled for a few miles It wasn t a powerful blast nor had been the original shot Sixty miles away thirteen Guernsey cows munched at a rick of fresh hay and chewed contentedly in the moonlight
none	none	 At three eleven a m the following morning the first calf arrived followed in rapid order by a dozen more Sally s Cloverdale Marathon III dropped her calf at four eight a m on Independence Day At seven zero a m she was milked and produced two and a half gallons of absolutely clear odorless tasteless and non ignitable fluid 
4511-45512-0036	train-other-500	Eleven other Guernseys gave forth gushing foaming creamy rich gallon after gallon of Grade A milk The thirteenth cow filled two buckets with something that looked like weak cocoa and smelled like stale tea
4511-45512-0037	train-other-500	But when a white smocked University of California poultry specialist entered the chicken house later in the morning he found nothing but normal white fresh eggs in the nests He finally arrived at the conclusion that Solomon s old harem had known for some time
none	none	 whatever it was that Solomon had been gifted with 
4511-45512-0038	train-other-500	this new rooster just didn t have it A rush call went out for a dozen of the precious store of golden eggs to be sent to the testing labs down range
none	none	 Two hours later doctor Peterson surrounded by fellow scientists stood before a bank of closed circuit television monitors in the Frenchman s Flat headquarters building 
4511-45512-0039	train-other-500	The scene on the screens was the interior of a massive steel and concrete test building several miles up range Resting on the floor of the building was an open gallon sized glass beaker filled with the new version of Sally s milk
none	none	 Poised directly above the opened beaker was a funnel shaped vessel containing the contents of one golden egg 
4511-45512-0040	train-other-500	doctor Peterson reached for a small lever By remote control the lever would gradually open the bottom of the funnel He squeezed gently slowly applying pressure
4511-45512-0041	train-other-500	An involuntary gasp arose from the spectators as a tiny trickle of egg fluid fell from the funnel towards the open beaker Instinctively everyone in the room clamped their eyes shut in anticipation of a blast
4511-45512-0042	train-other-500	A second later Peterson peered cautiously at the screen The beaker of milk had turned a cloudy pale blue It neither fizzed nor exploded It just sat He levered another drop from the funnel
4511-45512-0043	train-other-500	The stringy glutenous mass plopped into the beaker and the liquid swirled briefly and turned more opaque taking on more of a bluish tinge A babble of voices broke through the room when it was apparent that no explosion was forthcoming
none	none	 Peterson slumped into a nearby chair and stared at the screen 
4511-45512-0044	train-other-500	Now what he moaned
none	none	 The what developed twelve hectic hours later after time lost initially in shaking bouncing and beaming the new substance 
4511-45512-0045	train-other-500	on the outside chance it might develop a latent tendency towards demolition Satisfied that whatever it was in the beaker wasn t explosive the liquid was quickly poured off into sixteen small half pint beakers
none	none	 and speeded to as many different laboratories for possible analysis What about the other stuff Peterson was asked referring to the brownish milk subsequently identified as coming from a dainty young cow known as Melody Buttercup Greenbrier IV One thing at a time replied Peterson Let s find out what we have here before we got involved in the second problem At nine zero p m that night Peterson was called to the radiation labs He was met at the door by a glazed eyed physicist who led him back to his office He motioned Peterson to a seat and then handed him a sheaf of photographic papers and other charts Each of the photo sheets had a clear white outline of a test beaker surrounded by a solid field of black Two of the papers were all white I don t believe it Floyd the physicist said running his hands through his hair I ve seen it I ve done it I ve tested it proven it and I still don t believe it Peterson riffled the sheaf of papers and waited expectantly You don t believe what Fred he asked The physicist leaned over and tapped the papers in Peterson s hands We ve subjected that crazy stuff to every source and kind of high and low energy radiation we can produce here and that means just about everything short of triggering an H device on it We fired alphas gammas betas the works in wide dispersion concentrated beam and just plain exposure Not so much as one neutron of any of them went beyond the glass surrounding that forsaken slop They curved around it Floyd They curved around it The physicist leaned his head on the desk Nothing should react like that he sobbed He struggled for composure as Peterson stared dazedly at the test sheets That s not the whole story the physicist continued He walked to Peterson s side and extracted the two all white sheets This he said brokenly represents a sheet of photographic paper dipped in that crud and then allowed to dry before being bombarded with radiation And this he waved the other sheet is a piece of photo paper in the center of a panel protected by another sheet of ordinary typing paper coated with that stuff Peterson looked up at him A radiation proof liquid he said in awed tones The other man nodded dumbly Eight years of university the physicist whispered to himself Six years in summer schools Four fellowships Ten years in research All shot to hell he screamed by a stinking hayburning cow Peterson patted him gently on the shoulder It s all right Fred Don t take it so hard It could be worse How he asked hollowly Have this stuff milked from a kangaroo Back in his office Peterson waved off a dozen calls while he gave orders for fresh quantities of the blue milk to be rushed to the Argonne laboratories for further radiation tests and confirmation of the Nevada results He ordered a test set up for the brown fluid for the following morning and then took a call from the AEC commissioner Yes John he said we ve got something Operation Milkmaid was in full swing The following morning observers again clustered about the monitoring room as Peterson prepared to duplicate the tests using a sample of the Melody s brownish milk There was the same involuntary remote cringing as the first drop of egg fell towards the beaker but this time Peterson forced himself to watch Again the gentle plop was heard through the amplifiers and nothing more A similar clouding spread through the already murky fluid and when the entire contents of one egg had been added the beaker took on a solid brown and totally opaque appearance The scientists watched the glass container for several minutes anticipating another possible delayed blast When nothing occurred Peterson nodded to an assistant at an adjoining console The aide worked a series of levers and a remotely controlled mechanical arm came into view on the screen The claw of the arm descended over the beaker and clasping it gently bounced it lightly on the cement bunker floor The only sound was the muffled thunk of the glass container against the concrete The assistant wiggled his controls gently and the beaker jiggled back and forth a few inches off the floor Peterson who had been watching closely called out Do that again The operator jostled the controls Look at that Peterson exclaimed That stuff s hardened A quick movement confirmed this and then Peterson ordered the beaker raised five feet from the floor and slowly tipped Over the container went as the claw rotated in its socket The glass had turned almost one hundred eighty deg towards the floor when the entire mass of solidified glob slid out The watchers caught their breath as it fell to the hard floor The glob hit the floor bounced up a couple of inches fell back bounced again and then quivered to a stop What was soon to be known as Melody s Mighty Material had been born The testing started But there was a difference By the time the brown chunk had been removed from the bunker it had solidified to the point that nothing would break or cut it The surface yielded slightly to the heaviest cutting edge of a power saw and then sprang back unmarked A diamond drill spun ineffectually So the entire block started making the rounds of the various labs It was with downright jubilation that radiation labs reported no properties of resistance for the stuff One after the other the test proved nothing until the physical properties unit came up with an idea You can t cut it break it or tear it the technician told Peterson as he hefted the chunk of lightweight enigma You can t burn it shoot holes in it or so much as mark the surface with any known acid This stuff s tougher than steel and about fifty times lighter O K Peterson asked so what good is it You can mold it when you mix it the technician said significantly Hey you re right Peterson jumped up excitedly Why a spacer cast out of this stuff and coated with Sally s paint would be light enough and shielded enough to work on regular missile fuels Working under crash priorities the nation s three leading plastics plants turned out three lightweight molded one man space vehicles from the government supplied Melody s Mix A double coating of Sally s Paint then covered the hulls and a single stage liquid fuel rocket engine was hooked to the less than one ton engineless hull Twenty eight days after the milk first appeared on a warm August evening the first vehicle stood on the pads at Cape Canaveral illuminated by towers of lights Fuel crews had finished loading the tanks which would be jettisoned along with the engine at burn out Inside the rocket Major Quartermain lounged uncomfortably and cramped in the take off sling for a short but telling trip through the Van Allen radiation fields and back to Earth The take off sling rested inside an escape capsule since the use of chemical fuel brought back many of the old uncertainties of launchings On the return trip Quartermain would eject at sixty thousand feet and pull the capsule s huge parachute for a slow drop to the surface of the Atlantic where a recovery fleet was standing by The light rocket hull would pop a separate chute and also drift down for recovery and analysis Inside the ship Quartermain sniffed the air and curled his nose Let s get this thing on the road he spoke into his throat mike Some of that Florida air must have seeped in here Four minutes to final countdown blockhouse control replied Turn on your blowers for a second Outside the ship the fuel crews cleared their equipment away from the pad The same ripe heavy odor hung in the warm night air At eight two p m twenty eight days after the new milks made their first appearance Major Quartermain blasted off in a perfect launching At eight three p m the two other Melody Mix hulls standing on nearby pads began to melt At eight four p m the still roaring engine fell from the back end of Quartermain s rocket in a flaming arc back towards Earth Fifteen seconds later he hurtled his escape capsule out of the collapsing rocket hull The parachute opened and the daring astronaut drifted towards the sea Simultaneously in a dozen labs around the nation blocks and molds of Melody s Mix made from that first batch of milk collapsed into piles of putrid goo Every day thereafter newer blocks of the mix reached the twenty eight day limit and similarly broke down into malodrous blobs It was a month before the stinking gooey mess that flowed over the launching pads at the Cape was cleaned up by crews wearing respirators and filter masks It took considerably longer to get the nation s three top plastics firms back in operation as the fetid flow of unfinished rocket parts wrecked machinery and drove personnel from the area The glob that had been Quartermain s vehicle fell slowly back to Earth disintegrating every minute until it reached the consistency of thin gruel At this point it was caught by a jet air stream and carried in a miasmic cloud halfway around the world until it finally floated down to coat the Russian city of Urmsk in a veil of vile odor The United States disclaimed any knowledge of the cloud LAS VEGAS NEV May eight AP The Atomic Energy Commission today announced it has squeezed the last drop from

laboratory at the Circle T ranch doctor Floyd Peterson who has been in charge of the attempt to again reproduce Sally s Milk told newsmen that the famed Guernsey and her stablemate Melody no longer
