LETTER FROM POLLYANNA POLLYANNA CHAPTER I MISS POLLY Miss Polly Harrington entered her kitchen a little hurriedly this June morning Miss Polly did not usually make hurried movements she specially prided herself on her repose of manner But to day she was hurrying actually hurrying Nancy washing dishes at the sink looked up in surprise Nancy had been working in Miss Polly s kitchen only two months but already she knew that her mistress did not usually hurry Nancy Yes ma am Nancy answered cheerfully but she still continued wiping the pitcher in her hand Nancy Miss Polly s voice was very stern now when I m talking to you I wish you to stop your work and listen to what I have to say Nancy flushed miserably She set the pitcher down at once with the cloth still about it thereby nearly tipping it over which did not add to her composure Yes ma am I will ma am she stammered righting the pitcher and turning hastily I was only keepin on with my work cause you specially told me this mornin ter hurry with my dishes ye know Her mistress frowned That will do Nancy I did not ask for explanations I asked for your attention Yes ma am Nancy stifled a sigh She was wondering if ever in any way she could please this woman Nancy had never worked out before but a sick mother suddenly widowed and left with three younger children besides Nancy herself had forced the girl into doing something toward their support and she had been so pleased when she found a place in the kitchen of the great house on the hill Nancy had come from The Corners six miles away and she knew Miss Polly Harrington only as the mistress of the old Harrington homestead and one of the wealthiest residents of the town That was two months before She knew Miss Polly now as a stern severe faced woman who frowned if a knife clattered to the floor or if a door banged but who never thought to smile even when knives and doors were still When you ve finished your morning work Nancy Miss Polly was saying now you may clear the little room at the head of the stairs in the attic and make up the cot bed Sweep the room and clean it of course after you clear out the trunks and boxes Yes ma am And where shall I put the things please that I take out In the front attic Miss Polly hesitated then went on I suppose I may as well tell you now Nancy My niece Miss Pollyanna Whittier is coming to live with me She is eleven years old and will sleep in that room A little girl coming here Miss Harrington Oh won t that be nice cried Nancy thinking of the sunshine her own little sisters made in the home at The Corners Nice Well that isn t exactly the word I should use rejoined Miss Polly stiffly However I intend to make the best of it of course I am a good woman I hope and I know my duty Nancy colored hotly Of course ma am it was only that I thought a little girl here might might brighten things up for you she faltered Thank you rejoined the lady dryly I can t say however that I see any immediate need for that But of course you you d want her your sister s child ventured Nancy vaguely feeling that somehow she must prepare a welcome for this lonely little stranger Miss Polly lifted her chin haughtily Well really Nancy just because I happened to have a sister who was silly enough to marry and bring unnecessary children into a world that was already quite full enough I can t see how I should particularly WANT to have the care of them myself However as I said before I hope I know my duty See that you clean the corners Nancy she finished sharply as she left the room Yes ma am sighed Nancy picking up the half dried pitcher now so cold it must be rinsed again In her own room Miss Polly took out once more the letter which she had received two days before from the far away Western town and which had been so unpleasant a surprise to her The letter was addressed to Miss Polly Harrington Beldingsville Vermont and it read as follows Dear Madam I regret to inform you that the reverend John Whittier died two weeks ago leaving one child a girl eleven years old He left practically nothing else save a few books for as you doubtless know he was the pastor of this small mission church and had a very meagre salary I believe he was your deceased sister s husband but he gave me to understand the families were not on the best of terms He thought however that for your sister s sake you might wish to take the child and bring her up among her own people in the East Hence I am writing to you The little girl will be all ready to start by the time you get this letter and if you can take her we would appreciate it very much if you would write that she might come at once as there is a man and his wife here who are going East very soon and they would take her with them to Boston and put her on the Beldingsville train Of course you would be notified what day and train to expect Pollyanna on Hoping to hear favorably from you soon I remain Respectfully yours Jeremiah O White With a frown Miss Polly folded the letter and tucked it into its envelope She had answered it the day before and she had said she would take the child of course She HOPED she knew her duty well enough for that disagreeable as the task would be As she sat now with the letter in her hands her thoughts went back to her sister Jennie who had been this child s mother and to the time when Jennie as a girl of twenty had insisted upon marrying the young minister in spite of her family s remonstrances There had been a man of wealth who had wanted her and the family had much preferred him to the minister but Jennie had not The man of wealth had more years as well as more money to his credit while the minister had only a young head full of youth s ideals and enthusiasm and a heart full of love Jennie had preferred these quite naturally perhaps so she had married the minister and had gone south with him as a home missionary s wife The break had come then Miss Polly remembered it well though she had been but a girl of fifteen the youngest at the time The family had had little more to do with the missionary s wife To be sure Jennie herself had written for a time and had named her last baby Pollyanna for her two sisters Polly and Anna the other babies had all died This had been the last time that Jennie had written and in a few years there had come the news of her death told in a short but heart broken little note from the minister himself dated at a little town in the West Meanwhile time had not stood still for the occupants of the great house on the hill Miss Polly looking out at the far reaching valley below thought of the changes those twenty five years had brought to her She was forty now and quite alone in the world Father mother sisters all were dead For years now she had been sole mistress of the house and of the thousands left her by her father There were people who had openly pitied her lonely life and who had urged her to have some friend or companion to live with her but she had not welcomed either their sympathy or their advice She was not lonely she said She liked being by herself She preferred quiet But now Miss Polly rose with frowning face and closely shut lips She was glad of course that she was a good woman and that she not only knew her duty but had sufficient strength of character to perform it But POLLYANNA what a ridiculous name CHAPTER II OLD TOM AND NANCY In the little attic room Nancy swept and scrubbed vigorously paying particular attention to the corners There were times indeed when the vigor she put into her work was more of a relief to her feelings than it was an ardor to efface dirt Nancy in spite of her frightened submission to her mistress was no saint I just wish I could dig out the corners of her soul she muttered jerkily punctuating her words with murderous jabs of her pointed cleaning stick There s plenty of em needs cleanin all right all right The idea of stickin that blessed child way off up here in this hot little room with no fire in the winter too and all this big house ter pick and choose from Unnecessary children indeed Humph snapped Nancy wringing her rag so hard her fingers ached from the strain I guess it ain t CHILDREN what is MOST unnecessary just now just now For some time she worked in silence then her task finished she looked about the bare little room in plain disgust Well it s done my part anyhow she sighed There ain t no dirt here and there s mighty little else Poor little soul a pretty place this is ter put a homesick lonesome child into she finished going out and closing the door with a bang Oh she ejaculated biting her lip Then doggedly Well I don t care I hope she did hear the bang I do I do In the garden that afternoon Nancy found a few minutes in which to interview Old Tom who had pulled the weeds and shovelled the paths about the place for uncounted years mister Tom began Nancy throwing a quick glance over her shoulder to make sure she was unobserved did you know a little girl was comin here ter live with Miss Polly A what demanded the old man straightening his bent back with difficulty A little girl to live with Miss Polly Go on with yer jokin scoffed unbelieving Tom Why don t ye tell me the sun is a goin ter set in the east ter morrer But it s true She told me so herself maintained Nancy It s her niece and she s eleven years old The man s jaw fell Sho I wonder now he muttered then a tender light came into his faded eyes It ain t but it must be Miss Jennie s little gal There wasn t none of the rest of em married Why Nancy it must be Miss Jennie s little gal Glory be ter praise ter think of my old eyes a seein this Who was Miss Jennie She was an angel straight out of Heaven breathed the man fervently but the old master and missus knew her as their oldest daughter She was twenty when she married and went away from here long years ago Her babies all died I heard except the last one and that must be the one what s a comin She s eleven years old Yes she might be nodded the old man And she s goin ter sleep in the attic more shame ter HER scolded Nancy with another glance over her shoulder toward the house behind her Old Tom frowned The next moment a curious smile curved his lips I m a wonderin what Miss Polly will do with a child in the house he said Humph Well I m a wonderin what a child will do with Miss Polly in the house snapped Nancy The old man laughed I m afraid you ain t fond of Miss Polly he grinned As if ever anybody could be fond of her scorned Nancy Old Tom smiled oddly He stooped and began to work again I guess maybe you didn t know about Miss Polly s love affair he said slowly Love affair HER No and I guess nobody else didn t neither Oh yes they did nodded the old man And the feller s livin ter day right in this town too Who is he I ain t a tellin that It ain t fit that I should The old man drew himself erect In his dim blue eyes as he faced the house there was the loyal servant s honest pride in the family he has served and loved for long years But it don t seem possible her and a lover still maintained Nancy Old Tom shook his head You didn t know Miss Polly as I did he argued She used ter be real handsome and she would be now if she d let herself be Handsome Miss Polly Yes If she d just let that tight hair of hern all out loose and careless like as it used ter be and wear the sort of bunnits with posies in em and the kind o dresses all lace and white things you d see she d be handsome Miss Polly ain t old Nancy Ain t she though Well then she s got an awfully good imitation of it she has she has sniffed Nancy Yes I know It begun then at the time of the trouble with her lover nodded Old Tom and it seems as if she d been feedin on wormwood an thistles ever since she s that bitter an prickly ter deal with I should say she was declared Nancy indignantly There s no pleasin her nohow no matter how you try I wouldn t stay if twa n t for the wages and the folks at home what s needin em But some day some day I shall jest b ile over and when I do of course it ll be good by Nancy for me It will it will Old Tom shook his head I know I ve felt it It s nart ral but tain t best child tain t best Take my word for it tain t best And again he bent his old head to the work before him Nancy called a sharp voice Y yes ma am stammered Nancy and hurried toward the house CHAPTER III THE COMING OF POLLYANNA In due time came the telegram announcing that Pollyanna would arrive in Beldingsville the next day the twenty fifth of June at four o clock Miss Polly read the telegram frowned then climbed the stairs to the attic room She still frowned as she looked about her The room contained a small bed neatly made two straight backed chairs a washstand a bureau without any mirror and a small table There were no drapery curtains at the dormer windows no pictures on the wall All day the sun had been pouring down upon the roof and the little room was like an oven for heat As there were no screens the windows had not been raised A big fly was buzzing angrily at one of them now up and down up and down trying to get out Miss Polly killed the fly swept it through the window raising the sash an inch for the purpose straightened a chair frowned again and left the room Nancy she said a few minutes later at the kitchen door I found a fly up stairs in Miss Pollyanna s room The window must have been raised at some time I have ordered screens but until they come I shall expect you to see that the windows remain closed My niece will arrive to morrow at four o clock I desire you to meet her at the station Timothy will take the open buggy and drive you over The telegram says light hair red checked gingham dress and straw hat That is all I know but I think it is sufficient for your purpose Yes ma am but you Miss Polly evidently read the pause aright for she frowned and said crisply No I shall not go It is not necessary that I should I think That is all And she turned away Miss Polly s arrangements for the comfort of her niece Pollyanna were complete In the kitchen Nancy sent her flatiron with a vicious dig across the dish towel she was ironing Light hair red checked gingham dress and straw hat all she knows indeed Well I d be ashamed ter own it up that I would I would and her my onliest niece what was a comin from way across the continent Promptly at twenty minutes to four the next afternoon Timothy and Nancy drove off in the open buggy to meet the expected guest Timothy was Old Tom s son It was sometimes said in the town that if Old Tom was Miss Polly s right hand man Timothy was her left Timothy was a good natured youth and a good looking one as well Short as had been Nancy s stay at the house the two were already good friends To day however Nancy was too full of her mission to be her usual talkative self and almost in silence she took the drive to the station and alighted to wait for the train Over and over in her mind she was saying it light hair red checked dress straw hat Over and over again she was wondering just what sort of child this Pollyanna was anyway I hope for her sake she s quiet and sensible and don t drop knives nor bang doors she sighed to Timothy who had sauntered up to her Well if she ain t nobody knows what ll become of the rest of us grinned Timothy Imagine Miss Polly and a NOISY kid Gorry there goes the whistle now Oh Timothy I I think it was mean ter send me chattered the suddenly frightened Nancy as she turned and hurried to a point where she could best watch the passengers alight at the little station It was not long before Nancy saw her the slender little girl in the red checked gingham with two fat braids of flaxen hair hanging down her back Beneath the straw hat an eager freckled little face turned to the right and to the left plainly searching for some one Nancy knew the child at once but not for some time could she control her shaking knees sufficiently to go to her The little girl was standing quite by herself when Nancy finally did approach her Are you Miss Pollyanna she faltered The next moment she found herself half smothered in the clasp of two gingham clad arms Oh I m so glad GLAD GLAD to see you cried an eager voice in her ear Of course I m Pollyanna and I m so glad you came to meet me I hoped you would You you did stammered Nancy vaguely wondering how Pollyanna could possibly have known her and wanted her You you did she repeated trying to straighten her hat Oh yes and I ve been wondering all the way here what you looked like cried the little girl dancing on her toes and sweeping the embarrassed Nancy from head to foot with her eyes And now I know and I m glad you look just like you do look Nancy was relieved just then to have Timothy come up Pollyanna s words had been most confusing This is Timothy Maybe you have a trunk she stammered Yes I have nodded Pollyanna importantly I ve got a brand new one The Ladies Aid bought it for me and wasn t it lovely of them when they wanted the carpet so Of course I don t know how much red carpet a trunk could buy but it ought to buy some anyhow much as half an aisle don t you think I ve got a little thing here in my bag that mister Gray said was a check and that I must give it to you before I could get my trunk mister Gray is missus Gray s husband They re cousins of Deacon Carr s wife I came East with them and they re lovely And there here tis she finished producing the check after much fumbling in the bag she carried Nancy drew a long breath Instinctively she felt that some one had to draw one after that speech Then she stole a glance at Timothy Timothy s eyes were studiously turned away The three were off at last with Pollyanna s trunk in behind and Pollyanna herself snugly ensconced between Nancy and Timothy During the whole process of getting started the little girl had kept up an uninterrupted stream of comments and questions until the somewhat dazed Nancy found herself quite out of breath trying to keep up with her There Isn t this lovely Is it far I hope tis I love to ride sighed Pollyanna as the wheels began to turn Of course if tisn t far I sha n t mind though cause I ll be glad to get there all the sooner you know What a pretty street I knew twas going to be pretty father told me She stopped with a little choking breath Nancy looking at her apprehensively saw that her small chin was quivering and that her eyes were full of tears In a moment however she hurried on with a brave lifting of her head Father told me all about it He remembered And and I ought to have explained before missus Gray told me to at once about this red gingham dress you know and why I m not in black She said you d think twas queer But there weren t any black things in the last missionary barrel only a lady s velvet basque which Deacon Carr s wife said wasn t suitable for me at all besides it had white spots worn you know on both elbows and some other places Part of the Ladies Aid wanted to buy me a black dress and hat but the other part thought the money ought to go toward the red carpet they re trying to get for the church you know missus White said maybe it was just as well anyway for she didn t like children in black that is I mean she liked the children of course but not the black part Pollyanna paused for breath and Nancy managed to stammer Well I m sure it it ll be all right I m glad you feel that way I do too nodded Pollyanna again with that choking little breath Of course twould have been a good deal harder to be glad in black Glad gasped Nancy surprised into an interruption Yes that father s gone to Heaven to be with mother and the rest of us you know He said I must be glad But it s been pretty hard to to do it even in red gingham because I I wanted him so and I couldn t help feeling I OUGHT to have him specially as mother and the rest have God and all the angels while I didn t have anybody but the Ladies Aid But now I m sure it ll be easier because I ve got you Aunt Polly I m so glad I ve got you Nancy s aching sympathy for the poor little forlornness beside her turned suddenly into shocked terror Oh but but you ve made an awful mistake d dear she faltered I m only Nancy I ain t your Aunt Polly at all You you AREN T stammered the little girl in plain dismay No I m only Nancy I never thought of your takin me for her We we ain t a bit alike we ain t we ain t Timothy chuckled softly but Nancy was too disturbed to answer the merry flash from his eyes But who ARE you questioned Pollyanna You don t look a bit like a Ladies Aider Timothy laughed outright this time I m Nancy the hired girl I do all the work except the washin an hard ironin Mis Durgin does that But there IS an Aunt Polly demanded the child anxiously You bet your life there is cut in Timothy Pollyanna relaxed visibly Oh that s all right then There was a moment s silence then she went on brightly And do you know I m glad after all that she didn t come to meet me because now I ve got HER still coming and I ve got you besides Nancy flushed Timothy turned to her with a quizzical smile I call that a pretty slick compliment he said Why don t you thank the little lady I I was thinkin about Miss Polly faltered Nancy Pollyanna sighed contentedly I was too I m so interested in her You know she s all the aunt I ve got and I didn t know I had her for ever so long Then father told me He said she lived in a lovely great big house way on top of a hill She does You can see it now said Nancy It s that big white one with the green blinds way ahead Oh how pretty and what a lot of trees and grass all around it I never saw such a lot of green grass seems so all at once Is my Aunt Polly rich Nancy Yes Miss I m so glad It must be perfectly lovely to have lots of money I never knew any one that did have only the Whites they re some rich They have carpets in every room and ice cream Sundays Does Aunt Polly have ice cream Sundays

none	none	Her lips twitched She threw a merry look into Timothy s eyes No Miss Your aunt don t like ice cream I guess leastways I never saw it on her table Pollyanna s face fell Oh doesn t she I m so sorry I don t see how she can help liking ice cream But anyhow I can be kinder glad about that cause the ice cream you don t eat can t make your stomach ache like missus White s did that is I ate hers you know lots of it Maybe Aunt Polly has got the carpets though Yes she s got the carpets In every room Well in almost every room answered Nancy frowning suddenly at the thought of that bare little attic room where there was no carpet Oh I m so glad exulted Pollyanna I love carpets We didn t have any only two little rugs that came in a missionary barrel and one of those had ink spots on it missus White had pictures too perfectly beautiful ones of roses and little girls kneeling and a kitty and some lambs and a lion not together you know the lambs and the lion Oh of course the Bible says they will sometime but they haven t yet that is I mean missus White s haven t Don t you just love pictures I I don t know answered Nancy in a half stifled voice I do We didn t have any pictures They don t come in the barrels much you know There did two come once though But one was so good father sold it to get money to buy me some shoes with and the other was so bad it fell to pieces just as soon as we hung it up Glass it broke you know And I cried But I m glad now we didn t have any of those nice things cause I shall like Aunt Polly s all the better not being used to em you see Just as it is when the PRETTY hair ribbons come in the barrels after a lot of faded out brown ones My but isn t this a perfectly beautiful house she broke off fervently as they turned into the wide driveway It was when Timothy was unloading the trunk that Nancy found an opportunity to mutter low in his ear Don t you never say nothin ter me again about leavin Timothy Durgin You couldn t HIRE me ter leave Leave I should say not grinned the youth You couldn t drag me away It ll be more fun here now with that kid round than movin picture shows every day Fun fun repeated Nancy indignantly I guess it ll be somethin more than fun for that blessed child when them two tries ter live tergether and I guess she ll be a needin some rock ter fly to for refuge Well I m a goin ter be that rock Timothy I am I am she vowed as she turned and led Pollyanna up the broad steps CHAPTER IV THE LITTLE ATTIC ROOM Miss Polly Harrington did not rise to meet her niece She looked up from her book it is true as Nancy and the little girl appeared in the sitting room doorway and she held out a hand with duty written large on every coldly extended finger How do you do Pollyanna I She had no chance to say more Pollyanna had fairly flown across the room and flung herself into her aunt s scandalized unyielding lap Oh Aunt Polly Aunt Polly I don t know how to be glad enough that you let me come to live with you she was sobbing You don t know how perfectly lovely it is to have you and Nancy and all this after you ve had just the Ladies Aid Very likely though I ve not had the pleasure of the Ladies Aid s acquaintance rejoined Miss Polly stiffly trying to unclasp the small clinging fingers and turning frowning eyes on Nancy in the doorway Nancy that will do You may go Pollyanna be good enough please to stand erect in a proper manner I don t know yet what you look like Pollyanna drew back at once laughing a little hysterically No I suppose you don t but you see I m not very much to look at anyway on account of the freckles Oh and I ought to explain about the red gingham and the black velvet basque with white spots on the elbows I told Nancy how father said Yes well never mind now what your father said interrupted Miss Polly crisply You had a trunk I presume Oh yes indeed Aunt Polly I ve got a beautiful trunk that the Ladies Aid gave me I haven t got so very much in it of my own I mean The barrels haven t had many clothes for little girls in them lately but there were all father s books and missus White said she thought I ought to have those You see father Pollyanna interrupted her aunt again sharply there is one thing that might just as well be understood right away at once and that is I do not care to have you keep talking of your father to me The little girl drew in her breath tremulously Why Aunt Polly you you mean She hesitated and her aunt filled the pause We will go up stairs to your room Your trunk is already there I presume I told Timothy to take it up if you had one You may follow me Pollyanna Without speaking Pollyanna turned and followed her aunt from the room Her eyes were brimming with tears but her chin was bravely high After all I I reckon I m glad she doesn t want me to talk about father Pollyanna was thinking It ll be easier maybe if I don t talk about him Probably anyhow that is why she told me not to talk about him And Pollyanna convinced anew of her aunt s kindness blinked off the tears and looked eagerly about her She was on the stairway now Just ahead her aunt s black silk skirt rustled luxuriously Behind her an open door allowed a glimpse of soft tinted rugs and satin covered chairs Beneath her feet a marvellous carpet was like green moss to the tread On every side the gilt of picture frames or the glint of sunlight through the filmy mesh of lace curtains flashed in her eyes Oh Aunt Polly Aunt Polly breathed the little girl rapturously what a perfectly lovely lovely house How awfully glad you must be you re so rich PollyANNA ejaculated her aunt turning sharply about as she reached the head of the stairs I m surprised at you making a speech like that to me Why Aunt Polly AREN T you queried Pollyanna in frank wonder Certainly not Pollyanna I hope I could not so far forget myself as to be sinfully proud of any gift the Lord has seen fit to bestow upon me declared the lady certainly not of RICHES Miss Polly turned and walked down the hall toward the attic stairway door She was glad now that she had put the child in the attic room Her idea at first had been to get her niece as far away as possible from herself and at the same time place her where her childish heedlessness would not destroy valuable furnishings Now with this evident strain of vanity showing thus early it was all the more fortunate that the room planned for her was plain and sensible thought Miss Polly Eagerly Pollyanna s small feet pattered behind her aunt Still more eagerly her big blue eyes tried to look in all directions at once that no thing of beauty or interest in this wonderful house might be passed unseen Most eagerly of all her mind turned to the wondrously exciting problem about to be solved behind which of all these fascinating doors was waiting now her room the dear beautiful room full of curtains rugs and pictures that was to be her very own Then abruptly her aunt opened a door and ascended another stairway There was little to be seen here A bare wall rose on either side At the top of the stairs wide reaches of shadowy space led to far corners where the roof came almost down to the floor and where were stacked innumerable trunks and boxes It was hot and stifling too Unconsciously Pollyanna lifted her head higher it seemed so hard to breathe Then she saw that her aunt had thrown open a door at the right There Pollyanna here is your room and your trunk is here I see Have you your key Pollyanna nodded dumbly Her eyes were a little wide and frightened Her aunt frowned When I ask a question Pollyanna I prefer that you should answer aloud not merely with your head Yes Aunt Polly Thank you that is better I believe you have everything that you need here she added glancing at the well filled towel rack and water pitcher I will send Nancy up to help you unpack Supper is at six o clock she finished as she left the room and swept down stairs For a moment after she had gone Pollyanna stood quite still looking after her Then she turned her wide eyes to the bare wall the bare floor the bare windows She turned them last to the little trunk that had stood not so long before in her own little room in the far away Western home The next moment she stumbled blindly toward it and fell on her knees at its side covering her face with her hands Nancy found her there when she came up a few minutes later There there you poor lamb she crooned dropping to the floor and drawing the little girl into her arms I was just a fearin I d find you like this like this Pollyanna shook her head But I m bad and wicked Nancy awful wicked she sobbed I just can t make myself understand that God and the angels needed my father more than I did No more they did neither declared Nancy stoutly Oh h NANCY The burning horror in Pollyanna s eyes dried the tears Nancy gave a shamefaced smile and rubbed her own eyes vigorously There there child I didn t mean it of course she cried briskly Come let s have your key and we ll get inside this trunk and take out your dresses in no time no time Somewhat tearfully Pollyanna produced the key There aren t very many there anyway she faltered Then they re all the sooner unpacked declared Nancy Pollyanna gave a sudden radiant smile That s so I can be glad of that can t I she cried Nancy stared Why of course she answered a little uncertainly Nancy s capable hands made short work of unpacking the books the patched undergarments and the few pitifully unattractive dresses Pollyanna smiling bravely now flew about hanging the dresses in the closet stacking the books on the table and putting away the undergarments in the bureau drawers I m sure it it s going to be a very nice room Don t you think so she stammered after a while There was no answer Nancy was very busy apparently with her head in the trunk Pollyanna standing at the bureau gazed a little wistfully at the bare wall above And I can be glad there isn t any looking glass here too cause where there ISN T any glass I can t see my freckles Nancy made a sudden queer little sound with her mouth but when Pollyanna turned her head was in the trunk again At one of the windows a few minutes later Pollyanna gave a glad cry and clapped her hands joyously Oh Nancy I hadn t seen this before she breathed Look way off there with those trees and the houses and that lovely church spire and the river shining just like silver Why Nancy there doesn t anybody need any pictures with that to look at Oh I m so glad now she let me have this room To Pollyanna s surprise and dismay Nancy burst into tears Pollyanna hurriedly crossed to her side Why Nancy Nancy what is it she cried then fearfully This wasn t YOUR room was it My room stormed Nancy hotly choking back the tears If you ain t a little angel straight from Heaven and if some folks don t eat dirt before Oh land there s her bell After which amazing speech Nancy sprang to her feet dashed out of the room and went clattering down the stairs Left alone Pollyanna went back to her picture as she mentally designated the beautiful view from the window After a time she touched the sash tentatively It seemed as if no longer could she endure the stifling heat To her joy the sash moved under her fingers The next moment the window was wide open and Pollyanna was leaning far out drinking in the fresh sweet air She ran then to the other window That too soon flew up under her eager hands A big fly swept past her nose and buzzed noisily about the room Then another came and another but Pollyanna paid no heed Pollyanna had made a wonderful discovery against this window a huge tree flung great branches To Pollyanna they looked like arms outstretched inviting her Suddenly she laughed aloud I believe I can do it she chuckled The next moment she had climbed nimbly to the window ledge From there it was an easy matter to step to the nearest tree branch Then clinging like a monkey she swung herself from limb to limb until the lowest branch was reached The drop to the ground was even for Pollyanna who was used to climbing trees a little fearsome She took it however with bated breath swinging from her strong little arms and landing on all fours in the soft grass Then she picked herself up and looked eagerly about her She was at the back of the house Before her lay a garden in which a bent old man was working Beyond the garden a little path through an open field led up a steep hill at the top of which a lone pine tree stood on guard beside the huge rock To Pollyanna at the moment there seemed to be just one place in the world worth being in the top of that big rock With a run and a skilful turn Pollyanna skipped by the bent old man threaded her way between the orderly rows of green growing things and a little out of breath reached the path that ran through the open field Then determinedly she began to climb Already however she was thinking what a long long way off that rock must be when back at the window it had looked so near Fifteen minutes later the great clock in the hallway of the Harrington homestead struck six At precisely the last stroke Nancy sounded the bell for supper One two three minutes passed Miss Polly frowned and tapped the floor with her slipper A little jerkily she rose to her feet went into the hall and looked up stairs plainly impatient For a minute she listened intently then she turned and swept into the dining room Nancy she said with decision as soon as the little serving maid appeared my niece is late No you need not call her she added severely as Nancy made a move toward the hall door I told her what time supper was and now she will have to suffer the consequences She may as well begin at once to learn to be punctual When she comes down she may have bread and milk in the kitchen Yes ma am It was well perhaps that Miss Polly did not happen to be looking at Nancy s face just then At the earliest possible moment after supper Nancy crept up the back stairs and thence to the attic room Bread and milk indeed and when the poor lamb hain t only just cried herself to sleep she was muttering fiercely as she softly pushed open the door The next moment she gave a frightened cry Where are you Where ve you gone Where HAVE you gone she panted looking in the closet under the bed and even in the trunk and down the water pitcher Then she flew down stairs and out to Old Tom in the garden mister Tom mister Tom that blessed child s gone she wailed She s vanished right up into Heaven where she come from poor lamb and me told ter give her bread and milk in the kitchen her what s eatin angel food this minute I ll warrant I ll warrant The old man straightened up Gone Heaven he repeated stupidly unconsciously sweeping the brilliant sunset sky with his gaze He stopped stared a moment intently then turned with a slow grin Well Nancy it do look like as if she d tried ter get as nigh Heaven as she could and that s a fact he agreed pointing with a crooked finger to where sharply outlined against the reddening sky a slender wind blown figure was poised on top of a huge rock Well she ain t goin ter Heaven that way ter night not if I has my say declared Nancy doggedly If the mistress asks tell her I ain t furgettin the dishes but I gone on a stroll she flung back over her shoulder as she sped toward the path that led through the open field CHAPTER V THE GAME For the land s sake Miss Pollyanna what a scare you did give me panted Nancy hurrying up to the big rock down which Pollyanna had just regretfully slid Scare Oh I m so sorry but you mustn t really ever get scared about me Nancy Father and the Ladies Aid used to do it too till they found I always came back all right But I didn t even know you d went cried Nancy tucking the little girl s hand under her arm and hurrying her down the hill I didn t see you go and nobody didn t I guess you flew right up through the roof I do I do Pollyanna skipped gleefully I did most only I flew down instead of up I came down the tree Nancy stopped short You did what Came down the tree outside my window My stars and stockings gasped Nancy hurrying on again I d like ter know what yer aunt would say ter that Would you Well I ll tell her then so you can find out promised the little girl cheerfully Mercy gasped Nancy No no Why you don t mean she d CARE cried Pollyanna plainly disturbed No er yes well never mind I I ain t so very particular about knowin what she d say truly stammered Nancy determined to keep one scolding from Pollyanna if nothing more But say we better hurry I ve got ter get them dishes done ye know I ll help promised Pollyanna promptly Oh Miss Pollyanna demurred Nancy For a moment there was silence The sky was darkening fast Pollyanna took a firmer hold of her friend s arm I reckon I m glad after all that you DID get scared a little cause then you came after me she shivered Poor little lamb And you must be hungry too I I m afraid you ll have ter have bread and milk in the kitchen with me Yer aunt didn t like it because you didn t come down ter supper ye know But I couldn t I was up here Yes but she didn t know that you see observed Nancy dryly stifling a chuckle I m sorry about the bread and milk I am I am Oh I m not I m glad Glad Why Why I like bread and milk and I d like to eat with you I don t see any trouble about being glad about that You don t seem ter see any trouble bein glad about everythin retorted Nancy choking a little over her remembrance of Pollyanna s brave attempts to like the bare little attic room Pollyanna laughed softly Well that s the game you know anyway The GAME Yes the just being glad game Whatever in the world are you talkin about Why it s a game Father told it to me and it s lovely rejoined Pollyanna We ve played it always ever since I was a little little girl I told the Ladies Aid and they played it some of them What is it I ain t much on games though Pollyanna laughed again but she sighed too and in the gathering twilight her face looked thin and wistful Why we began it on some crutches that came in a missionary barrel CRUTCHES Yes You see I d wanted a doll and father had written them so but when the barrel came the lady wrote that there hadn t any dolls come in but the little crutches had So she sent em along as they might come in handy for some child sometime And that s when we began it Well I must say I can t see any game about that about that declared Nancy almost irritably Oh yes the game was to just find something about everything to be glad about no matter what twas rejoined Pollyanna earnestly And we began right then on the crutches Well goodness me I can t see anythin ter be glad about gettin a pair of crutches when you wanted a doll Pollyanna clapped her hands There is there is she crowed But I couldn t see it either Nancy at first she added with quick honesty Father had to tell it to me Well then suppose YOU tell ME almost snapped Nancy Goosey Why just be glad because you don t NEED EM exulted Pollyanna triumphantly You see it s just as easy when you know how Well of all the queer doin s breathed Nancy regarding Pollyanna with almost fearful eyes Oh but it isn t queer it s lovely maintained Pollyanna enthusiastically And we ve played it ever since And the harder tis the more fun tis to get em out only only sometimes it s almost too hard like when your father goes to Heaven and there isn t anybody but a Ladies Aid left Yes or when you re put in a snippy little room way at the top of the house with nothin in it growled Nancy Pollyanna sighed That was a hard one at first she admitted specially when I was so kind of lonesome I just didn t feel like playing the game anyway and I HAD been wanting pretty things so Then I happened to think how I hated to see my freckles in the looking glass and I saw that lovely picture out the window too so then I knew I d found the things to be glad about You see when you re hunting for the glad things you sort of forget the other kind like the doll you wanted you know Humph choked Nancy trying to swallow the lump in her throat Most generally it doesn t take so long sighed Pollyanna and lots of times now I just think of them WITHOUT thinking you know I ve got so used to playing it It s a lovely game F father and I used to like it so much she faltered I suppose though it it ll be a little harder now as long as I haven t anybody to play it with Maybe Aunt Polly will play it though she added as an after thought My stars and stockings HER breathed Nancy behind her teeth Then aloud she said doggedly See here Miss Pollyanna I ain t sayin that I ll play it very well and I ain t sayin that I know how anyway but I ll play it with ye after a fashion I just will I will Oh Nancy exulted Pollyanna giving her a rapturous hug That ll be splendid Won t we have fun Er maybe conceded Nancy in open doubt But you mustn t count too much on me ye know I never was no case fur games but I m a goin ter make a most awful old try on this one You re goin ter have some one ter play it with anyhow she finished as they entered the kitchen together Pollyanna ate her bread and milk with good appetite then at Nancy s suggestion she went into the sitting room where her aunt sat reading Miss Polly looked up coldly Have you had your supper Pollyanna Yes Aunt Polly I m very sorry Pollyanna to have been obliged so soon to send you into the kitchen to eat bread and milk But I was real glad you did it Aunt Polly I like bread and milk and Nancy too You mustn t feel bad about that one bit Aunt Polly sat suddenly a little more erect in her chair Pollyanna it s quite time you were in bed You have had a hard day and to morrow we must plan your hours and go over your clothing to see what it is necessary to get for you Nancy will give you a candle Be careful how you handle it Breakfast will be at half past seven See that you are down to that Good night Quite as a matter of course Pollyanna came straight to her aunt s side and gave her an affectionate hug I ve had such a beautiful time so far she sighed happily I know I m going to just love living with you but then I knew I should before I came Good night she called cheerfully as she ran from the room Well upon my soul ejaculated Miss Polly half aloud What a most extraordinary child Then she frowned She s glad I punished her and I mustn t feel bad one bit and she s going to love to live with me Well upon my soul ejaculated Miss Polly again as she took up her book Fifteen minutes later in the attic room a lonely little girl sobbed into the tightly clutched sheet I know father among the angels I m not playing the game one bit now not one bit but I don t believe even you could find anything to be glad about sleeping all alone way off up here in the dark like this If only I was near Nancy or Aunt Polly or even a Ladies Aider it would be easier Down stairs in the kitchen Nancy hurrying with her belated work jabbed her dish mop into the milk pitcher and muttered jerkily If playin a silly fool game about bein glad you ve got crutches when you want dolls is got ter be my way o bein that rock o refuge why I m a goin ter play it I am I am CHAPTER VI A QUESTION OF DUTY It was nearly seven o clock when Pollyanna awoke that first day after her arrival Her windows faced the south and the west so she could not see the sun yet but she could see the hazy blue of the morning sky and she knew that the day promised to be a fair one The little room was cooler now and the air blew in fresh and sweet Outside the birds were twittering joyously and Pollyanna flew to the window to talk to them She saw then that down in the garden her aunt was already out among the rosebushes With rapid fingers therefore she made herself ready to join her Down the attic stairs sped Pollyanna leaving both doors wide open Through the hall down the next flight then bang through the front screened door and around to the garden she ran Aunt Polly with the bent old man was leaning over a rose bush when Pollyanna gurgling with delight flung herself upon her Oh Aunt Polly Aunt Polly I reckon I am glad this morning just to be alive PollyANNA remonstrated the lady sternly pulling herself as erect as she could with a dragging weight of ninety pounds hanging about her neck Is this the usual way you say good morning The little girl dropped to her toes and danced lightly up and down No only when I love folks so I just can t help it I saw you from my window Aunt Polly and I got to thinking how you WEREN T a Ladies Aider and you were my really truly aunt and you looked so good I just had to come down and hug you The bent old man turned his back suddenly Miss Polly attempted a frown with not her usual success Pollyanna you I Thomas that will do for this morning I think you understand about those rose bushes she said stiffly Then she turned and walked rapidly away Do you always work in the garden mister Man asked Pollyanna interestedly The man turned His lips were twitching but his eyes looked blurred as if with tears Yes Miss I m Old Tom the gardener he answered Timidly but as if impelled by an irresistible force he reached out a shaking hand and let it rest for a moment on her bright hair You are so like your mother little Miss I used ter know her when she was even littler than you be You see I used ter work in the garden then Pollyanna caught her breath audibly You did And you knew my mother really when she was just a little earth angel and not a Heaven one Oh please tell me about her And down plumped Pollyanna in the middle of the dirt path by the old man s side A bell sounded from the house The next moment Nancy was seen flying out the back door Miss Pollyanna that bell means breakfast mornin s she panted pulling the little girl to her feet and hurrying her back to the house and other times it means other meals But it always means that you re ter run like time when ye hear it no matter where ye be If ye don t well it ll take somethin smarter n we be ter find ANYTHIN ter be glad about in that she finished shooing Pollyanna into the house as she would shoo an unruly chicken into a coop Breakfast for the first five minutes was a silent meal then Miss Polly her disapproving eyes following the airy wings of two flies darting here and there over the table said sternly Nancy where did those flies come from I don t know ma am There wasn t one in the kitchen Nancy had been too excited to notice Pollyanna s up flung windows the afternoon before I reckon maybe they re my flies Aunt Polly observed Pollyanna amiably There were lots of them this morning having a beautiful time upstairs Nancy left the room precipitately though to do so she had to carry out the hot muffins she had just brought in Yours gasped Miss Polly What do you mean Where did they come from Why Aunt Polly they came from out of doors of course through the windows I SAW some of them come in You saw them You mean you raised those windows without any screens Why yes There weren t any screens there Aunt Polly Nancy at this moment came in again with the muffins Her face was grave but very red Nancy directed her mistress sharply you may set the muffins down and go at once to Miss Pollyanna s room and shut the windows Shut the doors also Later when your morning work is done go through every room with the spatter See that you make a thorough search To her niece she said Pollyanna I have ordered screens for those windows I knew of course that it was my duty to do that But it seems to me that you have quite forgotten YOUR duty My duty Pollyanna s eyes were wide with wonder Certainly I know it is warm but I consider it your duty to keep your windows closed till those screens come Flies Pollyanna are not only unclean and annoying but very dangerous to health After breakfast I will give you a little pamphlet on this matter to read To read Oh thank you Aunt Polly I love to read Miss Polly drew in her breath audibly then she shut her lips together hard Pollyanna seeing her stern face frowned a little thoughtfully Of course I m sorry about the duty I forgot Aunt Polly she apologized timidly I won t raise the windows again Her aunt made no reply She did not speak indeed until the meal was over Then she rose went to the bookcase in the sitting room took out a small paper booklet and crossed the room to her niece s side This is the article I spoke of Pollyanna I desire you to go to your room at once and read it I will be up in half an hour to look over your things Pollyanna her eyes on the illustration of a fly s head many times magnified cried joyously Oh thank you Aunt Polly The next moment she skipped merrily from the room banging the door behind her Miss Polly frowned hesitated then crossed the room majestically and opened the door but Pollyanna was already out of sight clattering up the attic stairs Half an hour later when Miss Polly her face expressing stern duty in every line climbed those stairs and entered Pollyanna s room she was greeted with a burst of eager enthusiasm Oh Aunt Polly I never saw anything so perfectly lovely and interesting in my life I m so glad you gave me that book to read Why I didn t suppose flies could carry such a lot of things on their feet and That will do observed Aunt Polly with dignity Pollyanna you may bring out your clothes now and I will look them over What are not suitable for you I shall give to the Sullivans of course With visible reluctance Pollyanna laid down the pamphlet and turned toward the closet I m afraid you ll think they re worse than the Ladies Aid did and THEY said they were shameful she sighed But there were mostly things for boys and older folks in the last two or three barrels and did you ever have a missionary barrel Aunt Polly At her aunt s look of shocked anger Pollyanna corrected herself at once Why no of course you didn t Aunt Polly she hurried on with a hot blush I forgot rich folks never have to have them But you see sometimes I kind of forget that you are rich up here in this room you know Miss Polly s lips parted indignantly but no words came Pollyanna plainly unaware that she had said anything in the least unpleasant was hurrying on Well as I was going to say you can t tell a thing about missionary barrels except that you won t find in em what you think you re going to even when you think you won t It was the barrels every time too that were hardest to play the game on for father and Just in time Pollyanna remembered that she was not to talk of her father to her aunt She dived into her closet then hurriedly and brought out all the poor little dresses in both her arms They aren t nice at all she choked and they d been black if it hadn t been for the red carpet for the church but they re all I ve got With the tips of her fingers Miss Polly turned over the conglomerate garments so obviously made for anybody but Pollyanna Next she bestowed frowning attention on the patched undergarments in the bureau drawers I ve got the best ones on confessed Pollyanna anxiously The Ladies Aid bought me one set straight through all whole missus Jones she s the president told em I should have that if they had to clatter down bare aisles themselves the rest of their days But they won t mister White doesn t like the noise He s got nerves his wife says but he s got money too and they expect he ll give a lot toward the carpet on account of the nerves you know I should think he d be glad that if he did have the nerves he d got money too shouldn t you Miss Polly did not seem to hear Her scrutiny of the undergarments finished she turned to Pollyanna somewhat abruptly You have been to school of course Pollyanna Oh yes Aunt Polly Besides fath I mean I was taught at home some too Miss Polly frowned Very good In the fall you will enter school here of course mister Hall the principal will doubtless settle in which grade you belong Meanwhile I suppose I ought to hear you read aloud half an hour each day I love to read but if you don t want to hear me I d be just glad to read to myself truly Aunt Polly And I wouldn t have to half try to be glad either for I like best to read to myself on account of the big words you know I don t doubt it rejoined Miss Polly grimly Have you studied music Not much I don t like my music I like other people s though I learned to play on the piano a little Miss Gray she plays for church she taught me But I d just as soon let that go as not Aunt Polly I d rather truly Very likely observed Aunt Polly with slightly uplifted eyebrows Nevertheless I think it is my duty to see that you are properly instructed in at least the rudiments of music You sew of course Yes ma am Pollyanna sighed The Ladies Aid taught me that But I had an awful time missus Jones didn t believe in holding your needle like the rest of em did on buttonholing and missus White thought backstitching ought to be taught you before hemming or else the other way and missus Harriman didn t believe in putting you on patchwork ever at all Well there will be no difficulty of that kind any longer Pollyanna I shall teach you sewing myself of course You do not know how to cook I presume Pollyanna laughed suddenly They were just beginning to teach me that this summer but I hadn t got far They were more divided up on that than they were on the sewing They were GOING to begin on bread but there wasn t two of em that made it alike so after arguing it all one sewing meeting they decided to take turns at me one forenoon a week in their own kitchens you know I d only learned chocolate fudge and fig cake though when when I had to stop Her voice broke Chocolate fudge and fig cake indeed scorned Miss Polly I think we can remedy that very soon She paused in thought for a minute then went on slowly At nine o clock every morning you will read aloud one half hour to me Before that you will use the time to put this room in order Wednesday and Saturday forenoons after half past nine you will spend with Nancy in the kitchen learning to cook Other mornings you will sew with me That will leave the afternoons for your music I shall of course procure a teacher at once for you she finished decisively as she arose from her chair Pollyanna cried out in dismay Oh but Aunt Polly Aunt Polly you haven t left me any time at all just to to live To live child What do you mean As if you weren t living all the time Oh of course I d be BREATHING all the time I was doing those things Aunt Polly but I wouldn t be living You breathe all the time you re asleep but you aren t living I mean living doing the things you want to do playing outdoors reading to myself of course climbing hills talking to mister Tom in the garden and Nancy and finding out all about the houses and the people and everything everywhere all through the perfectly lovely streets I came through yesterday That s what I call living Aunt Polly Just breathing isn t living Miss Polly lifted her head irritably Pollyanna you ARE the most extraordinary child You will be allowed a proper amount of playtime of course But surely it seems to me if I am willing to do my duty in seeing that you have proper care and instruction YOU ought to be willing to do yours by seeing that that care and instruction are not ungratefully wasted Pollyanna looked shocked Oh Aunt Polly as if I ever could be ungrateful to YOU Why I LOVE YOU and you aren t even a Ladies Aider you re an aunt Very well then see that you don t act ungrateful vouchsafed Miss Polly as she turned toward the door She had gone halfway down the stairs when a small unsteady voice called after her Please Aunt Polly you didn t tell me which of my things you wanted to to give away Aunt Polly emitted a tired sigh a sigh that ascended straight to Pollyanna s ears Oh I forgot to tell you Pollyanna Timothy will drive us into town at half past one this afternoon Not one of your garments is fit for my niece to wear Certainly I should be very far from doing my duty by you if I should let you appear out in any one of them Pollyanna sighed now she believed she was going to hate that word duty Aunt Polly please she called wistfully isn t there ANY way you can be glad about all that duty business What Miss Polly looked up in dazed surprise then suddenly with very red cheeks she turned and swept angrily down the stairs Don t be impertinent Pollyanna In the hot little attic room Pollyanna dropped herself on to one of the straight backed chairs To her existence loomed ahead one endless round of duty I don t see really what there was impertinent about that she sighed I was only asking her if she couldn t tell me something to be glad about in all that duty business For several minutes Pollyanna sat in silence her rueful eyes fixed on the forlorn heap of garments on the bed Then slowly she rose and began to put away the dresses There just isn t anything to be glad about that I can see she said aloud unless it s to be glad when the duty s done Whereupon she laughed suddenly CHAPTER VII POLLYANNA AND PUNISHMENTS At half past one o clock Timothy drove Miss Polly and her niece to the four or five principal dry goods stores which were about half a mile from the homestead Fitting Pollyanna with a new wardrobe proved to be more or less of an exciting experience for all concerned Miss Polly came out of it with the feeling of limp relaxation that one might have at finding oneself at last on solid earth after a perilous walk across the very thin crust of a volcano The various clerks who had waited upon the pair came out of it with very red faces and enough amusing stories of Pollyanna to keep their friends in gales of laughter the rest of the week Pollyanna herself came out of it with radiant smiles and a heart content for as she expressed it to one of the clerks When you haven t had anybody but missionary barrels and Ladies Aiders to dress you it IS perfectly lovely to just walk right in and buy clothes that are brand new and that don t have to be tucked up or let down because they don t fit The shopping expedition consumed the entire afternoon then came supper and a delightful talk with Old Tom in the garden and another with Nancy on the back porch after the dishes were done and while Aunt Polly paid a visit to a neighbor Old Tom told Pollyanna wonderful things of her mother that made her very happy indeed and Nancy told her all about the little farm six miles away at The Corners where lived her own dear mother and her equally dear brother and sisters She promised too that sometime if Miss Polly were willing Pollyanna should be taken to see them And THEY VE got lovely names too You ll like THEIR names sighed Nancy They re Algernon and Florabelle and Estelle I I just hate Nancy Oh Nancy what a dreadful thing to say Why Because it isn t pretty like the others You see I was the first baby and mother hadn t begun ter read so many stories with the pretty names in em then But I love Nancy just because it s you declared Pollyanna Humph Well I guess you could love Clarissa Mabelle just as well retorted Nancy and it would be a heap happier for me I think THAT name s just grand Pollyanna laughed Well anyhow she chuckled you can be glad it isn t Hephzibah Hephzibah Yes missus White s name is that Her husband calls her Hep and she doesn t like it She says when he calls out Hep Hep she feels just as if the next minute he was going to yell Hurrah And she doesn t like to be hurrahed at Nancy s gloomy face relaxed into a broad smile Well if you don t beat the Dutch Say do you know I sha n t never hear Nancy now that I don t think o that Hep Hep and giggle My I guess I AM glad She stopped short and turned amazed eyes on the little girl Say Miss Pollyanna do you mean was you playin that ere game THEN about my bein glad I wa n t named Hephzibah Pollyanna frowned then she laughed Why Nancy that s so I WAS playing the game but that s one of the times I just did it without thinking I reckon You see you DO lots of times you get so used to it looking for something to be glad about you know And most generally there is something about everything that you can be glad about if you keep hunting long enough to find it Well m maybe granted Nancy with open doubt At half past eight Pollyanna went up to bed The screens had not yet come and the close little room was like an oven With longing eyes Pollyanna looked at the two fast closed windows but she did not raise them She undressed folded her clothes neatly said her prayers blew out her candle and climbed into bed Just how long she lay in sleepless misery tossing from side to side of the hot little cot she did not know but it seemed to her that it must have been hours before she finally slipped out of bed felt her way across the room and opened her door Out in the main attic all was velvet blackness save where the moon flung a path of silver half way across the floor from the east dormer window With a resolute ignoring of that fearsome darkness to the right and to the left Pollyanna drew a quick breath and pattered straight into that silvery path and on to the window She had hoped vaguely that this window might have a screen but it did not Outside however there was a wide world of fairy like beauty and there was too she knew fresh sweet air that would feel so good to hot cheeks and hands As she stepped nearer and peered longingly out she saw something else she saw only a little way below the window the wide flat tin roof of Miss Polly s sun parlor built over the porte cochere The sight filled her with longing If only now she were out there Fearfully she looked behind her Back there somewhere were her hot little room and her still hotter bed but between her and them lay a horrid desert of blackness across which one must feel one s way with outstretched shrinking arms while before her out on the sun parlor roof were the moonlight and the cool sweet night air If only her bed were out there And folks did sleep out of doors Joel Hartley at home who was so sick with the consumption HAD to sleep out of doors Suddenly Pollyanna remembered that she had seen near this attic window a row of long white bags hanging from nails Nancy had said that they contained the winter clothing put away for the summer A little fearfully now Pollyanna felt her way to these bags selected a nice fat soft one it contained Miss Polly s sealskin coat for a bed and a thinner one to be doubled up for a pillow and still another which was so thin it seemed almost empty for a covering Thus equipped Pollyanna in high glee pattered to the moonlit window again raised the sash stuffed her burden through to the roof below then let herself down after it closing the window carefully behind her Pollyanna had not forgotten those flies with the marvellous feet that carried things How deliciously cool it was Pollyanna quite danced up and down with delight drawing in long full breaths of the refreshing air The tin roof under her feet crackled with little resounding snaps that Pollyanna rather liked She walked indeed two or three times back and forth from end to end it gave her such a pleasant sensation of airy space after her hot little room and the roof was so broad and flat that she had no fear of falling off Finally with a sigh of content she curled herself up on the sealskin coat mattress arranged one bag for a pillow and the other for a covering and settled herself to sleep I m so glad now that the screens didn t come she murmured blinking up at the stars else I couldn t have had this Down stairs in Miss Polly s room next the sun parlor Miss Polly herself was hurrying into dressing gown and slippers her face white and frightened A minute before she had been telephoning in a shaking voice to Timothy Come up quick you and your father Bring lanterns Somebody is on the roof of the sun parlor He must have climbed up the rose trellis or somewhere and of course he can get right into the house through the east window in the attic I have locked the attic door down here but hurry quick Some time later Pollyanna just dropping off to sleep was startled by a lantern flash and a trio of amazed ejaculations She opened her eyes to find Timothy at the top of a ladder near her Old Tom just getting through the window and her aunt peering out at her from behind him Pollyanna what does this mean cried Aunt Polly then Pollyanna blinked sleepy eyes and sat up Why mister Tom Aunt Polly she stammered Don t look so scared It isn t that I ve got the consumption you know like Joel Hartley It s only that I was so hot in there But I shut the window Aunt Polly so the flies couldn t carry those germ things in Timothy disappeared suddenly down the ladder Old Tom with almost equal precipitation handed his lantern to Miss Polly and followed his son Miss Polly bit her lip hard until the men were gone then she said sternly Pollyanna hand those things to me at once and come in here Of all the extraordinary children she ejaculated a little later as with Pollyanna by her side and the lantern in her hand she turned back into the attic To Pollyanna the air was all the more stifling after that cool breath of the out of doors but she did not complain She only drew a long quivering sigh At the top of the stairs Miss Polly jerked out crisply For the rest of the night Pollyanna you are to sleep in my bed with me The screens will be here to morrow but until then I consider it my duty to keep you where I know where you are Pollyanna drew in her breath With you in your bed she cried rapturously Oh Aunt Polly Aunt Polly how perfectly lovely of you And when I ve so wanted to sleep with some one sometime some one that belonged to me you know not a Ladies Aider I ve HAD them My I reckon I am glad now those screens didn t come Wouldn t you be There was no reply Miss Polly was stalking on ahead Miss Polly to tell the truth was feeling curiously helpless For the third time since Pollyanna s arrival Miss Polly was punishing Pollyanna and for the third time she was being confronted with the amazing fact that her punishment was being taken as a special reward of merit No wonder Miss Polly was feeling curiously helpless CHAPTER VIII POLLYANNA PAYS A VISIT It was not long before life at the Harrington homestead settled into something like order though not exactly the order that Miss Polly had at first prescribed Pollyanna sewed practised read aloud and studied cooking in the kitchen it is true but she did not give to any of these things quite so much time as had first been planned She had more time also to just live as she expressed it for almost all of every afternoon from two until six o clock was hers to do with as she liked provided she did not like to do certain things already prohibited by Aunt Polly It is a question perhaps whether all this leisure time was given to the child as a relief to Pollyanna from work or as a relief to Aunt Polly from Pollyanna Certainly as those first July days passed Miss Polly found occasion many times to ejaculate What an extraordinary child and certainly the reading and sewing lessons found her at their conclusion each day somewhat dazed and wholly exhausted Nancy in the kitchen fared better She was not dazed nor exhausted Wednesdays and Saturdays came to be indeed red letter days to her There were no children in the immediate neighborhood of the Harrington homestead for Pollyanna to play with The house itself was on the outskirts of the village and though there were other houses not far away they did not chance to contain any boys or girls near Pollyanna s age This however did not seem to disturb Pollyanna in the least Oh no I don t mind it at all she explained to Nancy I m happy just to walk around and see the streets and the houses and watch the people I just love people Don t you Nancy Well I can t say I do all of em retorted Nancy tersely Almost every pleasant afternoon found Pollyanna begging for an errand to run so that she might be off for a walk in one direction or another and it was on these walks that frequently she met the Man To herself Pollyanna always called him the Man no matter if she met a dozen other men the same day The Man often wore a long black coat and a high silk hat two things that the just men never wore His face was clean shaven and rather pale and his hair showing below his hat was somewhat gray He walked erect and rather rapidly and he was always alone which made Pollyanna vaguely sorry for him Perhaps it was because of this that she one day spoke to him How do you do sir Isn t this a nice day she called cheerily as she approached him The man threw a hurried glance about him then stopped uncertainly Did you speak to me he asked in a sharp voice Yes sir beamed Pollyanna I say it s a nice day isn t it Eh Oh Humph he grunted and strode on again Pollyanna laughed He was such a funny man she thought The next day she saw him again Tisn t quite so nice as yesterday but it s pretty nice she called out cheerfully Eh Oh Humph grunted the man as before and once again Pollyanna laughed happily When for the third time Pollyanna accosted him in much the same manner the man stopped abruptly See here child who are you and why are you speaking to me every day I m Pollyanna Whittier and I thought you looked lonesome I m so glad you stopped Now we re introduced only I don t know your name yet Well of all the The man did not finish his sentence but strode on faster than ever Pollyanna looked after him with a disappointed droop to her usually smiling lips Maybe he didn t understand but that was only half an introduction I don t know HIS name yet she murmured as she proceeded on her way Pollyanna was carrying calf s foot jelly to missus Snow to day Miss Polly Harrington always sent something to missus Snow once a week She said she thought that it was her duty inasmuch as missus Snow was poor sick and a member of her church it was the duty of all the church members to look out for her of course Miss Polly did her duty by missus Snow usually on Thursday afternoons not personally but through Nancy To day Pollyanna had begged the privilege and Nancy had promptly given it to her in accordance with Miss Polly s orders And it s glad that I am ter get rid of it Nancy had declared in private afterwards to Pollyanna though it s a shame ter be tuckin the job off on ter you poor lamb so it is it is But I d love to do it Nancy Well you won t after you ve done it once predicted Nancy sourly Why not Because nobody does If folks wa n t sorry for her there wouldn t a soul go near her from mornin till night she s that cantankerous All is I pity her daughter what HAS ter take care of her But why Nancy Nancy shrugged her shoulders Well in plain words it s just that nothin what ever has happened has happened right in Mis Snow s eyes Even the days of the week ain t run ter her mind If it s Monday she s bound ter say she wished twas Sunday and if you take her jelly you re pretty sure ter hear she wanted chicken but if you DID bring her chicken she d be jest hankerin for lamb broth Why what a funny woman laughed Pollyanna I think I shall like to go to see her She must be so surprising and and different I love DIFFERENT folks Humph Well Mis Snow s different all right I hope for the sake of the rest of us Nancy had finished grimly Pollyanna was thinking of these remarks to day as she turned in at the gate of the shabby little cottage Her eyes were quite sparkling indeed at the prospect of meeting this different missus Snow A pale faced tired looking young girl answered her knock at the door How do you do began Pollyanna politely I m from Miss Polly Harrington and I d like to see missus Snow please Well if you would you re the first one that ever liked to see her muttered the girl under her breath but Pollyanna did not hear this The girl had turned and was leading the way through the hall to a door at the end of it In the sick room after the girl had ushered her in and closed the door Pollyanna blinked a little before she could accustom her eyes to the gloom Then she saw dimly outlined a woman half sitting up in the bed across the room Pollyanna advanced at once How do you do missus Snow Aunt Polly says she hopes you are comfortable to day and she s sent you some calf s foot jelly Dear me Jelly murmured a fretful voice Of course I m very much obliged but I was hoping twould be lamb broth to day Pollyanna frowned a little Why I thought it was CHICKEN you wanted when folks brought you jelly she said What The sick woman turned sharply Why nothing much apologized Pollyanna hurriedly and of course it doesn t really make any difference It s only that Nancy said it was chicken you wanted when we brought jelly and lamb broth when we brought chicken but maybe twas the other way and Nancy forgot The sick woman pulled herself up till she sat erect in the bed a most unusual thing for her to do though Pollyanna did not know this Well Miss Impertinence who are you she demanded Pollyanna laughed gleefully Oh THAT isn t my name missus Snow and I m so glad tisn t too That would be worse than Hephzibah wouldn t it I m Pollyanna Whittier Miss Polly Harrington s niece and I ve come to live with her That s why I m here with the jelly this morning All through the first part of this sentence the sick woman had sat interestedly erect but at the reference to the jelly she fell back on her pillow listlessly Very well thank you Your aunt is very kind of course but my appetite isn t very good this morning and I was wanting lamb She stopped suddenly then went on with an abrupt change of subject I never slept a wink last night not a wink O dear I wish I didn t sighed Pollyanna placing the jelly on the little stand and seating herself comfortably in the nearest chair You lose such a lot of time just sleeping Don t you think so Lose time sleeping exclaimed the sick woman Yes when you might be just living you know It seems such a pity we can t live nights too Once again the woman pulled herself erect in her bed Well if you ain t the amazing young one she cried Here do you go to that window and pull up the curtain she directed I should like to know what you look like Pollyanna rose to her feet but she laughed a little ruefully O dear then you ll see my freckles won t you she sighed as she went to the window and just when I was being so glad it was dark and you couldn t see em There Now you can oh she broke off excitedly as she turned back to the bed I m so glad you wanted to see me because now I can see you They didn t tell me you were so pretty Me pretty scoffed the woman bitterly Why yes Didn t you know it cried Pollyanna Well no I didn t retorted missus Snow dryly missus Snow had lived forty years and for fifteen of those years she had been too busy wishing things were different to find much time to enjoy things as they were Oh but your eyes are so big and dark and your hair s all dark too and curly cooed Pollyanna I love black curls That s one of the things I m going to have when I get to Heaven And you ve got two little red spots in your cheeks Why missus Snow you ARE pretty I should think you d know it when you looked at yourself in the glass The glass snapped the sick woman falling back on her pillow Yes well I hain t done much prinkin before the mirror these days and you wouldn t if you was flat on your back as I am Why no of course not agreed Pollyanna sympathetically But wait just let me show you she exclaimed skipping over to the bureau and picking up a small hand glass On the way back to the bed she stopped eyeing the sick woman with a critical gaze I reckon maybe if you don t mind I d like to fix your hair just a little before I let you see it she proposed May I fix your hair please Why I suppose so if you want to permitted missus Snow grudgingly but twon t stay you know Oh thank you I love to fix people s hair exulted Pollyanna carefully laying down the hand glass and reaching for a comb I sha n t do much to day of course I m in such a hurry for you to see how pretty you are but some day I m going to take it all down and have a perfectly lovely time with it she cried touching with soft fingers the waving hair above the sick woman s forehead For five minutes Pollyanna worked swiftly deftly combing a refractory curl into fluffiness perking up a drooping ruffle at the neck or shaking a pillow into plumpness so that the head might have a better pose Meanwhile the sick woman frowning prodigiously and openly scoffing at the whole procedure was in spite of herself beginning to tingle with a feeling perilously near to excitement There panted Pollyanna hastily plucking a pink from a vase near by and tucking it into the dark hair where it would give the best effect Now I reckon we re ready to be looked at And she held out the mirror in triumph Humph grunted the sick woman eyeing her reflection severely I like red pinks better than pink ones but then it ll fade anyhow before night so what s the difference But I should think you d be glad they did fade laughed Pollyanna cause then you can have the fun of getting some more I just love your hair fluffed out like that she finished with a satisfied gaze Don t you Hm m maybe Still twon t last with me tossing back and forth on the pillow as I do Of course not and I m glad too nodded Pollyanna cheerfully because then I can fix it again Anyhow I should think you d be glad it s black black shows up so much nicer on a pillow than yellow hair like mine does Maybe but I never did set much store by black hair shows gray too soon retorted missus Snow She spoke fretfully but she still held the mirror before her face Oh I love black hair I should be so glad if I only had it sighed Pollyanna missus Snow dropped the mirror and turned irritably Well you wouldn t not if you were me You wouldn t be glad for black hair nor anything else if you had to lie here all day as I do Pollyanna bent her brows in a thoughtful frown Why twould be kind of hard to do it then wouldn t it she mused aloud Do what Be glad about things Be glad about things when you re sick in bed all your days Well I should say it would retorted missus Snow If you don t think so just tell me something to be glad about that s all To missus Snow s unbounded amazement Pollyanna sprang to her feet and clapped her hands Oh goody That ll be a hard one won t it I ve got to go now but I ll think and think all the way home and maybe the next time I come I can tell it to you Good by I ve had a lovely time Good by she called again as she tripped through the doorway Well I never Now what does she mean by that ejaculated missus Snow staring after her visitor By and by she turned her head and picked up the mirror eyeing her reflection critically That little thing HAS got a knack with hair and no mistake she muttered under her breath I declare I didn t know it could look so pretty But then what s the use she sighed dropping the little glass into the bedclothes and rolling her head on the pillow fretfully A little later when Milly missus Snow s daughter came in the mirror still lay among the bedclothes thought it had been carefully hidden from sight Why mother the curtain is up cried Milly dividing her amazed stare between the window and the pink in her mother s hair Well what if it is snapped the sick woman I needn t stay in the dark all my life if I am sick need I Why n no of course not rejoined Milly in hasty conciliation as she reached for the medicine bottle It s only well you know very well that I ve tried to get you to have a lighter room for ages and you wouldn t There was no reply to this missus Snow was picking at the lace on her nightgown At last she spoke fretfully I should think SOMEBODY might give me a new nightdress instead of lamb broth for a change Why mother No wonder Milly quite gasped aloud with bewilderment In the drawer behind her at that moment lay two new nightdresses that Milly for months had been vainly urging her mother to wear CHAPTER IX WHICH TELLS OF THE MAN It rained the next time Pollyanna saw the Man She greeted him however with a bright smile It isn t so nice to day is it she called blithesomely I m glad it doesn t rain always anyhow The man did not even grunt this time nor turn his head Pollyanna decided that of course he did not hear her The next time therefore which happened to be the following day she spoke up louder She thought it particularly necessary to do this anyway for the Man was striding along his hands behind his back and his eyes on the ground which seemed to Pollyanna preposterous in the face of the glorious sunshine and the freshly washed morning air Pollyanna as a special treat was on a morning errand to day How do you do she chirped I m so glad it isn t yesterday aren t you The man stopped abruptly There was an angry scowl on his face See here little girl we might just as well settle this thing right now once for all he began testily I ve got something besides the weather to think of I don t know whether the sun shines or not Pollyanna beamed joyously No sir I thought you didn t That s why I told you Yes well Eh What he broke off sharply in sudden understanding of her words I say that s why I told you so you would notice it you know that the sun shines and all that I knew you d be glad it did if you only stopped to think of it and you didn t look a bit as if you WERE thinking of it Well of all the ejaculated the man with an oddly impotent gesture He started forward again but after the second step he turned back still frowning See here why don t you find some one your own age to talk to I d like to sir but there aren t any round here Nancy says Still I don t mind so very much I like old folks just as well maybe better sometimes being used to the Ladies Aid so Humph The Ladies Aid indeed Is that what you took me for The man s lips were threatening to smile but the scowl above them was still trying to hold them grimly stern Pollyanna laughed gleefully Oh no sir You don t look a mite like a Ladies Aider not but that you re just as good of course maybe better she added in hurried politeness You see I m sure you re much nicer than you look The man made a queer noise in his throat Well of all the he ejaculated again as he turned and strode on as before The next time Pollyanna met the Man his eyes were gazing straight into hers with a quizzical directness that made his face look really pleasant Pollyanna thought Good afternoon he greeted her a little stiffly Perhaps I d better say right away that I KNOW the sun is shining to day But you don t have to tell me nodded Pollyanna brightly I KNEW you knew it just as soon as I saw you Oh you did did you Yes sir I saw it in your eyes you know and in your smile Humph grunted the man as he passed on The Man always spoke to Pollyanna after this and frequently he spoke first though usually he said little but good afternoon Even that however was a great surprise to Nancy who chanced to be with Pollyanna one day when the greeting was given Sakes alive Miss Pollyanna she gasped did that man SPEAK TO YOU Why yes he always does now smiled Pollyanna He always does Goodness Do you know who he is demanded Nancy Pollyanna frowned and shook her head I reckon he forgot to tell me one day You see I did my part of the introducing but he didn t Nancy s eyes widened But he never speaks ter anybody child he hain t for years I guess except when he just has to for business and all that He s John Pendleton He lives all by himself in the big house on Pendleton Hill He won t even have any one round ter cook for him comes down ter the hotel for his meals three times a day I know Sally Miner who waits on him and she says he hardly opens his head enough ter tell what he wants ter eat She has ter guess it more n half the time only it ll be somethin CHEAP She knows that without no tellin Pollyanna nodded sympathetically I know You have to look for cheap things when you re poor Father and I took meals out a lot We had beans and fish balls most generally We used to say how glad we were we liked beans that is we said it specially when we were looking at the roast turkey place you know that was sixty cents Does mister Pendleton like beans Like em What if he does or don t Why Miss Pollyanna he ain t poor He s got loads of money John Pendleton has from his father There ain t nobody in town as rich as he is He could eat dollar bills if he wanted to and not know it Pollyanna giggled As if anybody COULD eat dollar bills and not know it Nancy when they come to try to chew em Ho I mean he s rich enough ter do it shrugged Nancy He ain t spendin his money that s all He s a savin of it Oh for the heathen surmised Pollyanna How perfectly splendid That s denying yourself and taking up your cross I know father told me Nancy s lips parted abruptly as if there were angry words all ready to come but her eyes resting on Pollyanna s jubilantly trustful face saw something that prevented the words being spoken Humph she vouchsafed Then showing her old time interest she went on But say it is queer his speakin to you honestly Miss Pollyanna He don t speak ter no one and he lives all alone in a great big lovely house all full of jest grand things they say Some says he s crazy and some jest cross and some says he s got a skeleton in his closet Oh Nancy shuddered Pollyanna How can he keep such a dreadful thing I should think he d throw it away Nancy chuckled That Pollyanna had taken the skeleton literally instead of figuratively she knew very well but perversely she refrained from correcting the mistake And EVERYBODY says he s mysterious she went on Some years he jest travels week in and week out and it s always in heathen countries Egypt and Asia and the Desert of Sarah you know Oh a missionary nodded Pollyanna 
188_136483_000033_000000	train-clean-360	Nancy laughed 
none	none	oddly Well I didn t say that Miss Pollyanna When he comes back he writes books queer odd books they say about some gimcrack he s found in them heathen countries But he don t never seem ter want ter spend no money here leastways not for jest livin Of course not if he s saving it for the heathen declared Pollyanna But he is a funny man and he s different too just like missus Snow only he s a different different Well I guess he is rather chuckled Nancy I m gladder n ever now anyhow that he speaks to me sighed Pollyanna contentedly CHAPTER X A SURPRISE FOR missus SNOW The next time Pollyanna went to see missus Snow she found that lady as at first in a darkened room It s the little girl from Miss Polly s mother announced Milly in a tired manner then Pollyanna found herself alone with the invalid Oh it s you is it asked a fretful voice from the bed I remember you ANYbody d remember you I guess if they saw you once I wish you had come yesterday I WANTED you yesterday Did you Well I m glad tisn t any farther away from yesterday than to day is then laughed Pollyanna advancing cheerily into the room and setting her basket carefully down on a chair My but aren t you dark here though I can t see you a bit she cried unhesitatingly crossing to the window and pulling up the shade I want to see if you ve fixed your hair like I did oh you haven t But never mind I m glad you haven t after all cause maybe you ll let me do it later But now I want you to see what I ve brought you The woman stirred restlessly Just as if how it looks would make any difference in how it tastes she scoffed but she turned her eyes toward the basket Well what is it Guess What do you want Pollyanna had skipped back to the basket Her face was alight The sick woman frowned Why I don t WANT anything as I know of she sighed After all they all taste alike Pollyanna chuckled This won t Guess If you DID want something what would it be The woman hesitated She did not realize it herself but she had so long been accustomed to wanting what she did not have that to state off hand what she DID want seemed impossible until she knew what she had Obviously however she must say something This extraordinary child was waiting Well of course there s lamb broth I ve got it crowed Pollyanna But that s what I DIDN T want sighed the sick woman sure now of what her stomach craved It was chicken I wanted Oh I ve got that too chuckled Pollyanna The woman turned in amazement Both of them she demanded Yes and calf s foot jelly triumphed Pollyanna I was just bound you should have what you wanted for once so Nancy and I fixed it Oh of course there s only a little of each but there s some of all of em I m so glad you did want chicken she went on contentedly as she lifted the three little bowls from her basket You see I got to thinking on the way here what if you should say tripe or onions or something like that that I didn t have Wouldn t it have been a shame when I d tried so hard she laughed merrily There was no reply The sick woman seemed to be trying mentally to find something she had lost There I m to leave them all announced Pollyanna as she arranged the three bowls in a row on the table Like enough it ll be lamb broth you want to morrow How do you do to day she finished in polite inquiry Very poorly thank you murmured missus Snow falling back into her usual listless attitude I lost my nap this morning Nellie Higgins next door has begun music lessons and her practising drives me nearly wild She was at it all the morning every minute I m sure I don t know what I shall do Polly nodded sympathetically I know It IS awful missus White had it once one of my Ladies Aiders you know She had rheumatic fever too at the same time so she couldn t thrash round She said twould have been easier if she could have Can you Can I what Thrash round move you know so as to change your position when the music gets too hard to stand missus Snow stared a little Why of course I can move anywhere in bed she rejoined a little irritably Well you can be glad of that then anyhow can t you nodded Pollyanna missus White couldn t You can t thrash when you have rheumatic fever though you want to something awful missus White says She told me afterwards she reckoned she d have gone raving crazy if it hadn t been for mister White s sister s ears being deaf so Sister s EARS What do you mean Pollyanna laughed Well I reckon I didn t tell it all and I forgot you didn t know missus White You see Miss White was deaf awfully deaf and she came to visit em and to help take care of missus White and the house Well they had such an awful time making her understand ANYTHING that after that every time the piano commenced to play across the street missus White felt so glad she COULD hear it that she didn t mind so much that she DID hear it cause she couldn t help thinking how awful twould be if she was deaf and couldn t hear anything like her husband s sister You see she was playing the game too I d told her about it The game Pollyanna clapped her hands There I most forgot but I ve thought it up missus Snow what you can be glad about GLAD about What do you mean Why I told you I would Don t you remember You asked me to tell you something to be glad about glad you know even though you did have to lie here abed all day Oh scoffed the woman THAT Yes I remember that but I didn t suppose you were in earnest any more than I was Oh yes I was nodded Pollyanna triumphantly and I found it too But TWAS hard It s all the more fun though always when tis hard And I will own up honest to true that I couldn t think of anything for a while Then I got it Did you really Well what is it missus Snow s voice was sarcastically polite Pollyanna drew a long breath I thought how glad you could be that other folks weren t like you all sick in bed like this you know she announced impressively missus Snow stared Her eyes were angry Well really she ejaculated then in not quite an agreeable tone of voice And now I ll tell you the game proposed Pollyanna blithely confident It ll be just lovely for you to play it ll be so hard And there s so much more fun when it is hard You see it s like this And she began to tell of the missionary barrel the crutches and the doll that did not come The story was just finished when Milly appeared at the door Your aunt is wanting you Miss Pollyanna she said with dreary listlessness She telephoned down to the Harlows across the way She says you re to hurry that you ve got some practising to make up before dark Pollyanna rose reluctantly All right she sighed I ll hurry Suddenly she laughed I suppose I ought to be glad I ve got legs to hurry with hadn t I missus Snow There was no answer missus Snow s eyes were closed But Milly whose eyes were wide open with surprise saw that there were tears on the wasted cheeks Good by flung Pollyanna over her shoulder as she reached the door I m awfully sorry about the hair I wanted to do it But maybe I can next time One by one the July days passed To Pollyanna they were happy days indeed She often told her aunt joyously how very happy they were Whereupon her aunt would usually reply wearily Very well Pollyanna I am gratified of course that they are happy but I trust that they are profitable as well otherwise I should have failed signally in my duty Generally Pollyanna would answer this with a hug and a kiss a proceeding that was still always most disconcerting to Miss Polly but one day she spoke It was during the sewing hour Do you mean that it wouldn t be enough then Aunt Polly that they should be just happy days she asked wistfully That is what I mean Pollyanna They must be pro fi ta ble as well Certainly What is being pro fi ta ble Why it it s just being profitable having profit something to show for it Pollyanna What an extraordinary child you are Then just being glad isn t pro fi ta ble questioned Pollyanna a little anxiously Certainly not O dear Then you wouldn t like it of course I m afraid now you won t ever play the game Aunt Polly Game What game Why that father Pollyanna clapped her hand to her lips N nothing she stammered Miss Polly frowned That will do for this morning Pollyanna she said tersely And the sewing lesson was over It was that afternoon that Pollyanna coming down from her attic room met her aunt on the stairway Why Aunt Polly how perfectly lovely she cried You were coming up to see me Come right in I love company she finished scampering up the stairs and throwing her door wide open Now Miss Polly had not been intending to call on her niece She had been planning to look for a certain white wool shawl in the cedar chest near the east window But to her unbounded surprise now she found herself not in the main attic before the cedar chest but in Pollyanna s little room sitting in one of the straight backed chairs so many many times since Pollyanna came Miss Polly had found herself like this doing some utterly unexpected surprising thing quite unlike the thing she had set out to do I love company said Pollyanna again flitting about as if she were dispensing the hospitality of a palace specially since I ve had this room all mine you know Oh of course I had a room always but twas a hired room and hired rooms aren t half as nice as owned ones are they And of course I do own this one don t I Why y yes Pollyanna murmured Miss Polly vaguely wondering why she did not get up at once and go to look for that shawl And of course NOW I just love this room even if it hasn t got the carpets and curtains and pictures that I d been want With a painful blush Pollyanna stopped short She was plunging into an entirely different sentence when her aunt interrupted her sharply What s that Pollyanna N nothing Aunt Polly truly I didn t mean to say it Probably not returned Miss Polly coldly but you did say it so suppose we have the rest of it But it wasn t anything only that I d been kind of planning on pretty carpets and lace curtains and things you know But of course PLANNING on them interrupted Miss Polly sharply Pollyanna blushed still more painfully I ought not to have of course Aunt Polly she apologized It was only because I d always wanted them and hadn t had them I suppose Oh we d had two rugs in the barrels but they were little you know and one had ink spots and the other holes and there never were only those two pictures the one fath I mean the good one we sold and the bad one that broke Of course if it hadn t been for all that I shouldn t have wanted them so pretty things I mean and I shouldn t have got to planning all through the hall that first day how pretty mine would be here and and but truly Aunt Polly it wasn t but just a minute I mean a few minutes before I was being glad that the bureau DIDN T have a looking glass because it didn t show my freckles and there couldn t be a nicer picture than the one out my window there and you ve been so good to me that Miss Polly rose suddenly to her feet Her face was very red That will do Pollyanna she said stiffly You have said quite enough I m sure The next minute she had swept down the stairs and not until she reached the first floor did it suddenly occur to her that she had gone up into the attic to find a white wool shawl in the cedar chest near the east window Less than twenty four hours later Miss Polly said to Nancy crisply Nancy you may move Miss Pollyanna s things down stairs this morning to the room directly beneath I have decided to have my niece sleep there for the present Yes ma am said Nancy aloud O glory said Nancy to herself To Pollyanna a minute later she cried joyously And won t ye jest be listenin ter this Miss Pollyanna You re ter sleep down stairs in the room straight under this You are you are Pollyanna actually grew white You mean why Nancy not really really and truly I guess you ll think it s really and truly prophesied Nancy exultingly nodding her head to Pollyanna over the armful of dresses she had taken from the closet I m told ter take down yer things and I m goin ter take em too fore she gets a chance ter change her mind Pollyanna did not stop to hear the end of this sentence At the imminent risk of being dashed headlong she was flying down stairs two steps at a time Bang went two doors and a chair before Pollyanna at last reached her goal Aunt Polly Oh Aunt Polly Aunt Polly did you mean it really Why that room s got EVERYTHING the carpet and curtains and three pictures besides the one outdoors too cause the windows look the same way Oh Aunt Polly Very well Pollyanna I am gratified that you like the change of course but if you think so much of all those things I trust you will take proper care of them that s all Pollyanna please pick up that chair and you have banged two doors in the last half minute Miss Polly spoke sternly all the more sternly because for some inexplicable reason she felt inclined to cry and Miss Polly was not used to feeling inclined to cry Pollyanna picked up the chair Yes m I know I banged em those doors she admitted cheerfully You see I d just found out about the room and I reckon you d have banged doors if Pollyanna stopped short and eyed her aunt with new interest Aunt Polly DID you ever bang doors I hope not Pollyanna Miss Polly s voice was properly shocked Why Aunt Polly what a shame Pollyanna s face expressed only concerned sympathy A shame repeated Aunt Polly too dazed to say more Why yes You see if you d felt like banging doors you d have banged em of course and if you didn t that must have meant that you weren t ever glad over anything or you would have banged em You couldn t have helped it And I m so sorry you weren t ever glad over anything PollyANna gasped the lady but Pollyanna was gone and only the distant bang of the attic stairway door answered for her Pollyanna had gone to help Nancy bring down her things Miss Polly in the sitting room felt vaguely disturbed but then of course she HAD been glad over some things CHAPTER XI INTRODUCING JIMMY August came August brought several surprises and some changes none of which however were really a surprise to Nancy Nancy since Pollyanna s arrival had come to look for surprises and changes First there was the kitten Pollyanna found the kitten mewing pitifully some distance down the road When systematic questioning of the neighbors failed to find any one who claimed it Pollyanna brought it home at once as a matter of course And I was glad I didn t find any one who owned it too she told her aunt in happy confidence cause I wanted to bring it home all the time I love kitties I knew you d be glad to let it live here Miss Polly looked at the forlorn little gray bunch of neglected misery in Pollyanna s arms and shivered Miss Polly did not care for cats not even pretty healthy clean ones Ugh Pollyanna What a dirty little beast And it s sick I m sure and all mangy and fleay I know it poor little thing crooned Pollyanna tenderly looking into the little creature s frightened eyes And it s all trembly too it s so scared You see it doesn t know yet that we re going to keep it of course No nor anybody else retorted Miss Polly with meaning emphasis Oh yes they do nodded Pollyanna entirely misunderstanding her aunt s words I told everybody we should keep it if I didn t find where it belonged I knew you d be glad to have it poor little lonesome thing Miss Polly opened her lips and tried to speak but in vain The curious helpless feeling that had been hers so often since Pollyanna s arrival had her now fast in its grip Of course I knew hurried on Pollyanna gratefully that you wouldn t let a dear little lonesome kitty go hunting for a home when you d just taken ME in and I said so to missus Ford when she asked if you d let me keep it Why I had the Ladies Aid you know and kitty didn t have anybody I knew you d feel that way she nodded happily as she ran from the room But Pollyanna Pollyanna remonstrated Miss Polly I don t But Pollyanna was already halfway to the kitchen calling Nancy Nancy just see this dear little kitty that Aunt Polly is going to bring up along with me And Aunt Polly in the sitting room who abhorred cats fell back in her chair with a gasp of dismay powerless to remonstrate The next day it was a dog even dirtier and more forlorn perhaps than was the kitten and again Miss Polly to her dumfounded amazement found herself figuring as a kind protector and an angel of mercy a role that Pollyanna so unhesitatingly thrust upon her as a matter of course that the woman who abhorred dogs even more than she did cats if possible found herself as before powerless to remonstrate When in less than a week however Pollyanna brought home a small ragged boy and confidently claimed the same protection for him Miss Polly did have something to say It happened after this wise On a pleasant Thursday morning Pollyanna had been taking calf s foot jelly again to missus Snow missus Snow and Pollyanna were the best of friends now Their friendship had started from the third visit Pollyanna had made the one after she had told missus Snow of the game missus Snow herself was playing the game now with Pollyanna To be sure she was not playing it very well she had been sorry for everything for so long that it was not easy to be glad for anything now But under Pollyanna s cheery instructions and merry laughter at her mistakes she was learning fast To day even to Pollyanna s huge delight she had said that she was glad Pollyanna brought calf s foot jelly because that was just what she had been wanting she did not know that Milly at the front door had told Pollyanna that the minister s wife had already that day sent over a great bowlful of that same kind of jelly Pollyanna was thinking of this now when suddenly she saw the boy The boy was sitting in a disconsolate little heap by the roadside whittling half heartedly at a small stick Hullo smiled Pollyanna engagingly The boy glanced up but he looked away again at once Hullo yourself he mumbled Pollyanna laughed Now you don t look as if you d be glad even for calf s foot jelly she chuckled stopping before him The boy stirred restlessly gave her a surprised look and began to whittle again at his stick with the dull broken bladed knife in his hand Pollyanna hesitated then dropped herself comfortably down on the grass near him In spite of Pollyanna s brave assertion that she was used to Ladies Aiders and didn t mind she had sighed at times for some companion of her own age Hence her determination to make the most of this one My name s Pollyanna Whittier she began pleasantly What s yours Again the boy stirred restlessly He even almost got to his feet But he settled back Jimmy Bean he grunted with ungracious indifference Good Now we re introduced I m glad you did your part some folks don t you know I live at Miss Polly Harrington s house Where do you live Nowhere Nowhere Why you can t do that everybody lives somewhere asserted Pollyanna Well I don t just now I m huntin up a new place Oh Where is it The boy regarded her with scornful eyes Silly As if I d be a huntin for it if I knew Pollyanna tossed her head a little This was not a nice boy and she did not like to be called silly Still he was somebody besides old folks Where did you live before she queried Well if you ain t the beat em for askin questions sighed the boy impatiently I have to be retorted Pollyanna calmly else I couldn t find out a thing about you If you d talk more I wouldn t talk so much The boy gave a short laugh It was a sheepish laugh and not quite a willing one but his face looked a little pleasanter when he spoke this time All right then here goes I m Jimmy Bean and I m ten years old goin on eleven I come last year ter live at the Orphans Home but they ve got so many kids there ain t much room for me an I wa n t never wanted anyhow I don t believe So I ve quit I m goin ter live somewheres else but I hain t found the place yet I d LIKE a home jest a common one ye know with a mother in it instead of a Matron If ye has a home ye has folks an I hain t had folks since dad died So I m a huntin now I ve tried four houses but they didn t want me though I said I expected ter work course There Is that all you want ter know The boy s voice had broken a little over the last two sentences Why what a shame sympathized Pollyanna And didn t there anybody want you O dear I know just how you feel because after after my father died too there wasn t anybody but the Ladies Aid for me until Aunt Polly said she d take Pollyanna stopped abruptly The dawning of a wonderful idea began to show in her face Oh I know just the place for you she cried Aunt Polly ll take you I know she will Didn t she take me And didn t she take Fluffy and Buffy when they didn t have any one to love them or any place to go and they re only cats and dogs Oh come I know Aunt Polly ll take you You don t know how good and kind she is Jimmy Bean s thin little face brightened Honest Injun Would she now I d work ye know an I m real strong He bared a small bony arm Of course she would Why my Aunt Polly is the nicest lady in the world now that my mama has gone to be a Heaven angel And there s rooms heaps of em she continued springing to her feet and tugging at his arm It s an awful big house Maybe though she added a little anxiously as they hurried on maybe you ll have to sleep in the attic room I did at first But there s screens there now so twon t be so hot and the flies can t get in either to bring in the germ things on their feet Did you know about that It s perfectly lovely Maybe she ll let you read the book if you re good I mean if you re bad And you ve got freckles too with a critical glance so you ll be glad there isn t any looking glass and the outdoor picture is nicer than any wall one could be so you won t mind sleeping in that room at all I m sure panted Pollyanna finding suddenly that she needed the rest of her breath for purposes other than talking Gorry exclaimed Jimmy Bean tersely and uncomprehendingly but admiringly Then he added I shouldn t think anybody who could talk like that runnin would need ter ask no questions ter fill up time with Pollyanna laughed Well anyhow you can be glad of that she retorted for when I m talking YOU don t have to When the house was reached Pollyanna unhesitatingly piloted her companion straight into the presence of her amazed aunt Oh Aunt Polly she triumphed just look a here I ve got something ever so much nicer even than Fluffy and Buffy for you to bring up It s a real live boy He won t mind a bit sleeping in the attic at first you know and he says he ll work but I shall need him the most of the time to play with I reckon Miss Polly grew white then very red She did not quite understand but she thought she understood enough Pollyanna what does this mean Who is this dirty little boy Where did you find him she demanded sharply The dirty little boy fell back a step and looked toward the door Pollyanna laughed merrily There if I didn t forget to tell you his name I m as bad as the Man And he is dirty too isn t he I mean the boy is just like Fluffy and Buffy were when you took them in But I reckon he ll improve all right by washing just as they did and Oh I most forgot again she broke off with a laugh This is Jimmy Bean Aunt Polly Well what is he doing here Why Aunt Polly I just told you Pollyanna s eyes were wide with surprise He s for you I brought him home so he could live here you know He wants a home and folks I told him how good you were to me and to Fluffy and Buffy and that I knew you would be to him because of course he s even nicer than cats and dogs Miss Polly dropped back in her chair and raised a shaking hand to her throat The old helplessness was threatening once more to overcome her With a visible struggle however Miss Polly pulled herself suddenly erect That will do Pollyanna This is a little the most absurd thing you ve done yet As if tramp cats and mangy dogs weren t bad enough but you must needs bring home ragged little beggars from the street who There was a sudden stir from the boy His eyes flashed and his chin came up With two strides of his sturdy little legs he confronted Miss Polly fearlessly I ain t a beggar marm an I don t want nothin o you I was cal latin ter work of course fur my board an keep I wouldn t have come ter your old house anyhow if this ere girl hadn t a made me a tellin me how you was so good an kind that you d be jest dyin ter take me in So there And he wheeled about and stalked from the room with a dignity that would have been absurd had it not been so pitiful Oh Aunt Polly choked Pollyanna Why I thought you d be GLAD to have him here I m sure I should think you d be glad Miss Polly raised her hand with a peremptory gesture of silence Miss Polly s nerves had snapped at last The good and kind of the boy s words were still ringing in her ears and the old helplessness was almost upon her she knew Yet she rallied her forces with the last atom of her will power Pollyanna she cried sharply WILL you stop using that everlasting word glad It s glad glad glad from morning till night until I think I shall grow wild From sheer amazement Pollyanna s jaw dropped Why Aunt Polly she breathed I should think you d be glad to have me gl Oh she broke off clapping her hand to her lips and hurrying blindly from the room Before the boy had reached the end of the driveway Pollyanna overtook him Boy Boy Jimmy Bean I want you to know how how sorry I am she panted catching him with a detaining hand Sorry nothin I ain t blamin you retorted the boy sullenly But I ain t no beggar he added with sudden spirit Of course you aren t But you mustn t blame auntie appealed Pollyanna Probably I didn t do the introducing right anyhow and I reckon I didn t tell her much who you were She is good and kind really she s always been but I probably didn t explain it right I do wish I could find some place for you though The boy shrugged his shoulders and half turned away Never mind I guess I can find one myself I ain t no beggar you know Pollyanna was frowning thoughtfully Of a sudden she turned her face illumined Say I ll tell you what I WILL do The Ladies Aid meets this afternoon I heard Aunt Polly say so I ll lay your case before them That s what father always did when he wanted anything educating the heathen and new carpets you know The boy turned fiercely Well I ain t a heathen or a new carpet Besides what is a Ladies Aid Pollyanna stared in shocked disapproval Why Jimmy Bean wherever have you been brought up not to know what a Ladies Aid is Oh all right if you ain t tellin grunted the boy turning and beginning to walk away indifferently Pollyanna sprang to his side at once It s it s why it s just a lot of ladies that meet and sew and give suppers and raise money and and talk that s what a Ladies Aid is They re awfully kind that is most of mine was back home I haven t seen this one here but they re always good I reckon I m going to tell them about you this afternoon Again the boy turned fiercely Not much you will Maybe you think I m goin ter stand round an hear a whole LOT o women call me a beggar instead of jest ONE Not much Oh but you wouldn t be there argued Pollyanna quickly I d go alone of course and tell them You would Yes and I d tell it better this time hurried on Pollyanna quick to see the signs of relenting in the boy s face And there d be some of em I know that would be glad to give you a home I d work don t forget ter say that cautioned the boy Of course not promised Pollyanna happily sure now that her point was gained Then I ll let you know to morrow Where By the road where I found you to day near missus Snow s house All right I ll be there The boy paused before he went on slowly Maybe I d better go back then for ter night ter the Home You see I hain t no other place ter stay and and I didn t leave till this mornin I slipped out I didn t tell em I wasn t comin back else they d pretend I couldn t come though I m thinkin they won t do no worryin when I don t show up sometime They ain t like FOLKS ye know They don t CARE I know nodded Pollyanna with understanding eyes But I m sure when I see you to morrow I ll have just a common home and folks that do care all ready for you Good by she called brightly as she turned back toward the house In the sitting room window at that moment Miss Polly who had been watching the two children followed with sombre eyes the boy until a bend of the road hid him from sight Then she sighed turned and walked listlesly up stairs and Miss Polly did not usually move listlessly In her ears still was the boy s scornful you was so good and kind In her heart was a curious sense of desolation as of something lost CHAPTER XII BEFORE THE LADIES AID Dinner which came at noon in the Harrington homestead was a silent meal on the day of the Ladies Aid meeting Pollyanna it is true tried to talk but she did not make a success of it chiefly because four times she was obliged to break off a glad in the middle of it much to her blushing discomfort The fifth time it happened Miss Polly moved her head wearily There there child say it if you want to she sighed I m sure I d rather you did than not if it s going to make all this fuss Pollyanna s puckered little face cleared Oh thank you I m afraid it would be pretty hard not to say it You see I ve played it so long You ve what demanded Aunt Polly Played it the game you know that father Pollyanna stopped with a painful blush at finding herself so soon again on forbidden ground Aunt Polly frowned and said nothing The rest of the meal was a silent one Pollyanna was not sorry to hear Aunt Polly tell the minister s wife over the telephone a little later that she would not be at the Ladies Aid meeting that afternoon owing to a headache When Aunt Polly went up stairs to her room and closed the door Pollyanna tried to be sorry for the headache but she could not help feeling glad that her aunt was not to be present that afternoon when she laid the case of Jimmy Bean before the Ladies Aid She could not forget that Aunt Polly had called Jimmy Bean a little beggar and she did not want Aunt Polly to call him that before the Ladies Aid Pollyanna knew that the Ladies Aid met at two o clock in the chapel next the church not quite half a mile from home She planned her going therefore so that she should get there a little before three I want them all to be there she said to herself else the very one that wasn t there might be the one who would be wanting to give Jimmy Bean a home and of course two o clock always means three really to Ladies Aiders Quietly but with confident courage Pollyanna ascended the chapel steps pushed open the door and entered the vestibule A soft babel of feminine chatter and laughter came from the main room Hesitating only a brief moment Pollyanna pushed open one of the inner doors The chatter dropped to a surprised hush Pollyanna advanced a little timidly Now that the time had come she felt unwontedly shy After all these half strange half familiar faces about her were not her own dear Ladies Aid How do you do Ladies Aiders she faltered politely I m Pollyanna Whittier I I reckon some of you know me maybe anyway I do YOU only I don t know you all together this way The silence could almost be felt now Some of the ladies did know this rather extraordinary niece of their fellow member and nearly all had heard of her but not one of them could think of anything to say just then I I ve come to to lay the case before you stammered Pollyanna after a moment unconsciously falling into her father s familiar phraseology There was a slight rustle Did did your aunt send you my dear asked missus Ford the minister s wife Pollyanna colored a little Oh no I came all by myself You see I m used to Ladies Aiders It was Ladies Aiders that brought me up with father Somebody tittered hysterically and the minister s wife frowned Yes dear What is it Well it it s Jimmy Bean sighed Pollyanna He hasn t any home except the Orphan one and they re full and don t want him anyhow he thinks so he wants another He wants one of the common kind that has a mother instead of a Matron in it folks you know that ll care He s ten years old going on eleven I thought some of you might like him to live with you you know Well did you ever murmured a voice breaking the dazed pause that followed Pollyanna s words With anxious eyes Pollyanna swept the circle of faces about her Oh I forgot to say he will work she supplemented eagerly Still there was silence then coldly one or two women began to question her After a time they all had the story and began to talk among themselves animatedly not quite pleasantly Pollyanna listened with growing anxiety Some of what was said she could not understand She did gather after a time however that there was no woman there who had a home to give him though every woman seemed to think that some of the others might take him as there were several who had no little boys of their own already in their homes But there was no one who agreed herself to take him Then she heard the minister s wife suggest timidly that they as a society might perhaps assume his support and education instead of sending quite so much money this year to the little boys in far away India A great many ladies talked then and several of them talked all at once and even more loudly and more unpleasantly than before It seemed that their society was famous for its offering to Hindu missions and several said they should die of mortification if it should be less this year Some of what was said at this time Pollyanna again thought she could not have understood too for it sounded almost as if they did not care at all what the money DID so long as the sum opposite the name of their society in a certain report headed the list and of course that could not be what they meant at all But it was all very confusing and not quite pleasant so that Pollyanna was glad indeed when at last she found herself outside in the hushed sweet air only she was very sorry too for she knew it was not going to be easy or anything but sad to tell Jimmy Bean to morrow that the Ladies Aid had decided that they would rather send all their money to bring up the little India boys than to save out enough to bring up one little boy in their own town for which they would not get a bit of credit in the report according to the tall lady who wore spectacles Not but that it s good of course to send money to the heathen and I shouldn t want em not to send SOME there sighed Pollyanna to herself as she trudged sorrowfully along But they acted as if little boys HERE weren t any account only little boys way off I should THINK though they d rather see Jimmy Bean grow than just a report CHAPTER XIII IN PENDLETON WOODS Pollyanna had not turned her steps toward home when she left the chapel She had turned them instead toward Pendleton Hill It had been a hard day for all it had been a vacation one as she termed the infrequent days when there was no sewing or cooking lesson and Pollyanna was sure that nothing would do her quite so much good as a walk through the green quiet of Pendleton Woods Up Pendleton Hill therefore she climbed steadily in spite of the warm sun on her back I don t have to get home till half past five anyway she was telling herself and it ll be so much nicer to go around by the way of the woods even if I do have to climb to get there It was very beautiful in the Pendleton Woods as Pollyanna knew by experience But to day it seemed even more delightful than ever notwithstanding her disappointment over what she must tell Jimmy Bean to morrow I wish they were up here all those ladies who talked so loud sighed Pollyanna to herself raising her eyes to the patches of vivid blue between the sunlit green of the tree tops Anyhow if they were up here I just reckon they d change and take Jimmy Bean for their little boy all right she finished secure in her conviction but unable to give a reason for it even to herself Suddenly Pollyanna lifted her head and listened A dog had barked some distance ahead A moment later he came dashing toward her still barking Hullo doggie hullo Pollyanna snapped her fingers at the dog and looked expectantly down the path She had seen the dog once before she was sure He had been then with the Man mister John Pendleton She was looking now hoping to see him For some minutes she watched eagerly but he did not appear Then she turned her attention toward the dog The dog as even Pollyanna could see was acting strangely He was still barking giving little short sharp yelps as if of alarm He was running back and forth too in the path ahead Soon they reached a side path and down this the little dog fairly flew only to come back at once whining and barking Ho That isn t the way home laughed Pollyanna still keeping to the main path The little dog seemed frantic now Back and forth back and forth between Pollyanna and the side path he vibrated barking and whining pitifully Every quiver of his little brown body and every glance from his beseeching brown eyes were eloquent with appeal so eloquent that at last Pollyanna understood turned and followed him Straight ahead now the little dog dashed madly and it was not long before Pollyanna came upon the reason for it all a man lying motionless at the foot of a steep overhanging mass of rock a few yards from the side path A twig cracked sharply under Pollyanna s foot and the man turned his head With a cry of dismay Pollyanna ran to his side mister Pendleton Oh are you hurt Hurt Oh no I m just taking a siesta in the sunshine snapped the man irritably See here how much do you know What can you do Have you got any sense Pollyanna caught her breath with a little gasp but as was her habit she answered the questions literally one by one Why mister Pendleton I I don t know so very much and I can t do a great many things but most of the Ladies Aiders except missus Rawson said I had real good sense I heard em say so one day they didn t know I heard though The man smiled grimly There there child I beg your pardon I m sure it s only this confounded leg of mine Now listen He paused and with some difficulty reached his hand into his trousers pocket and brought out a bunch of keys singling out one between his thumb and forefinger Straight through the path there about five minutes walk is my house This key will admit you to the side door under the porte cochere Do you know what a porte cochere is Oh yes sir Auntie has one with a sun parlor over it That s the roof I slept on only I didn t sleep you know They found me Eh Oh Well when you get into the house go straight through the vestibule and hall to the door at the end On the big flat topped desk in the middle of the room you ll find a telephone Do you know how to use a telephone Oh yes sir Why once when Aunt Polly Never mind Aunt Polly now cut in the man scowlingly as he tried to move himself a little Hunt up doctor Thomas Chilton s number on the card you ll find somewhere around there it ought to be on the hook down at the side but it probably won t be You know a telephone card I suppose when you see one Oh yes sir I just love Aunt Polly s There s such a lot of queer names and Tell doctor Chilton that John Pendleton is at the foot of Little Eagle Ledge in Pendleton Woods with a broken leg and to come at once with a stretcher and two men He ll know what to do besides that Tell him to come by the path from the house A broken leg Oh mister Pendleton how perfectly awful shuddered Pollyanna But I m so glad I came Can t I do Yes you can but evidently you won t WILL you go and do what I ask and stop talking moaned the man faintly And with a little sobbing cry Pollyanna went Pollyanna did not stop now to look up at the patches of blue between the sunlit tops of the trees She kept her eyes on the ground to make sure that no twig nor stone tripped her hurrying feet It was not long before she came in sight of the house She had seen it before though never so near as this She was almost frightened now at the massiveness of the great pile of gray stone with its pillared verandas and its imposing entrance Pausing only a moment however she sped across the big neglected lawn and around the house to the side door under the porte cochere Her fingers stiff from their tight clutch upon the keys were anything but skilful in their efforts to turn the bolt in the lock but at last the heavy carved door swung slowly back on its hinges Pollyanna caught her breath In spite of her feeling of haste she paused a moment and looked fearfully through the vestibule to the wide sombre hall beyond her thoughts in a whirl This was John Pendleton s house the house of mystery the house into which no one but its master entered the house which sheltered somewhere a skeleton Yet she Pollyanna was expected to enter alone these fearsome rooms and telephone the doctor that the master of the house lay now With a little cry Pollyanna looking neither to the right nor the left fairly ran through the hall to the door at the end and opened it The room was large and sombre with dark woods and hangings like the hall but through the west window the sun threw a long shaft of gold across the floor gleamed dully on the tarnished brass andirons in the fireplace and touched the nickel of the telephone on the great desk in the middle of the room It was toward this desk that Pollyanna hurriedly tiptoed The telephone card was not on its hook it was on the floor But Pollyanna found it and ran her shaking forefinger down through the C s to Chilton In due time she had doctor Chilton himself at the other end of the wires and was tremblingly delivering her message and answering the doctor s terse pertinent questions This done she hung up the receiver and drew a long breath of relief Only a brief glance did Pollyanna give about her then with a confused vision in her eyes of crimson draperies book lined walls a littered floor an untidy desk innumerable closed doors any one of which might conceal a skeleton and everywhere dust dust dust she fled back through the hall to the great carved door still half open as she had left it In what seemed even to the injured man an incredibly short time Pollyanna was back in the woods at the man s side Well what is the trouble Couldn t you get in he demanded Pollyanna opened wide her eyes Why of course I could I m HERE she answered As if I d be here if I hadn t got in And the doctor will be right up just as soon as possible with the men and things He said he knew just where you were so I didn t stay to show him I wanted to be with you Did you smiled the man grimly Well I can t say I admire your taste I should think you might find pleasanter companions Do you mean because you re so cross Thanks for your frankness Yes Pollyanna laughed softly But you re only cross OUTSIDE You arn t cross inside a bit Indeed How do you know that asked the man trying to change the position of his head without moving the rest of his body Oh lots of ways there like that the way you act with the dog she added pointing to the long slender hand that rested on the dog s sleek head near him It s funny how dogs and cats know the insides of folks better than other folks do isn t it Say I m going to hold your head she finished abruptly The man winced several times and groaned once softly while the change was being made but in the end he found Pollyanna s lap a very welcome substitute for the rocky hollow in which his head had lain before Well that is better he murmured faintly He did not speak again for some time Pollyanna watching his face wondered if he were asleep She did not think he was He looked as if his lips were tight shut to keep back moans of pain Pollyanna herself almost cried aloud as she looked at his great strong body lying there so helpless One hand with fingers tightly clenched lay outflung motionless The other limply open lay on the dog s head The dog his wistful eager eyes on his master s face was motionless too Minute by minute the time passed The sun dropped lower in the west and the shadows grew deeper under the trees Pollyanna sat so still she hardly seemed to breathe A bird alighted fearlessly within reach of her hand and a squirrel whisked his bushy tail on a tree branch almost under her nose yet with his bright little eyes all the while on the motionless dog At last the dog pricked up his cars and whined softly then he gave a short sharp bark The next moment Pollyanna heard voices and very soon their owners appeared three men carrying a stretcher and various other articles The tallest of the party a smooth shaven kind eyed man whom Pollyanna knew by sight as doctor Chilton advanced cheerily Well my little lady playing nurse Oh no sir smiled Pollyanna I ve only held his head I haven t given him a mite of medicine But I m glad I was here So am I nodded the doctor as he turned his absorbed attention to the injured man CHAPTER XIV JUST A MATTER OF JELLY Pollyanna was a little late for supper on the night of the accident to John Pendleton but as it happened she escaped without reproof Nancy met her at the door Well if I ain t glad ter be settin my two eyes on you she sighed in obvious relief It s half past six I know it admitted Pollyanna anxiously but I m not to blame truly I m not And I don t think even Aunt Polly will say I am either She won t have the chance retorted Nancy with huge satisfaction She s gone Gone gasped Pollyanna You don t mean that I ve driven her away Through Pollyanna s mind at the moment trooped remorseful memories of the morning with its unwanted boy cat and dog and its unwelcome glad and forbidden father that would spring to her forgetful little tongue Oh I DIDN T drive her away Not much you did scoffed Nancy Her cousin died suddenly down to Boston and she had ter go She had one o them yeller telegram letters after you went away this afternoon and she won t be back for three days Now I guess we re glad all right We ll be keepin house tergether jest you and me all that time We will we will Pollyanna looked shocked Glad Oh Nancy when it s a funeral Oh but twa n t the funeral I was glad for Miss Pollyanna It was Nancy stopped abruptly A shrewd twinkle came into her eyes Why Miss Pollyanna as if it wa n t yerself that was teachin me ter play the game she reproached her gravely Pollyanna puckered her forehead into a troubled frown I can t help it Nancy she argued with a shake of her head It must be that there are some things that tisn t right to play the game on and I m sure funerals is one of them There s nothing in a funeral to be glad about Nancy chuckled We can be glad tain t our n she observed demurely But Pollyanna did not hear She had begun to tell of the accident and in a moment Nancy open mouthed was listening At the appointed place the next afternoon Pollyanna met Jimmy Bean according to agreement As was to be expected of course Jimmy showed keen disappointment that the Ladies Aid preferred a little India boy to himself Well maybe tis natural he sighed Of course things you don t know about are always nicer n things you do same as the pertater on tother side of the plate is always the biggest But I wish I looked that way ter somebody way off Wouldn t it be jest great now if only somebody over in India wanted ME Pollyanna clapped her hands Why of course That s the very thing Jimmy I ll write to my Ladies Aiders about you They aren t over in India they re only out West but that s awful far away just the same I reckon you d think so if you d come all the way here as I did Jimmy s face brightened Do you think they would truly take me he asked Of course they would Don t they take little boys in India to bring up Well they can just play you are the little India boy this time I reckon you re far enough away to make a report all right You wait I ll write em I ll write missus White No I ll write missus Jones missus White has got the most money but missus Jones gives the most which is kind of funny isn t it when you think of it But I reckon some of the Aiders will take you All right but don t furgit ter say I ll work fur my board an keep put in Jimmy I ain t no beggar an biz ness is biz ness even with Ladies Aiders I m thinkin He hesitated then added An I s pose I better stay where I be fur a spell yet till you hear Of course nodded Pollyanna emphatically Then I ll know just where to find you And they ll take you I m sure you re far enough away for that Didn t Aunt Polly take Say she broke off suddenly DO you suppose I was Aunt Polly s little girl from India Well if you ain t the queerest kid grinned Jimmy as he turned away It was about a week after the accident in Pendleton Woods that Pollyanna said to her aunt one morning Aunt Polly please would you mind very much if I took missus Snow s calf s foot jelly this week to some one else I m sure missus Snow wouldn t this once Dear me Pollyanna what ARE you up to now sighed her aunt You ARE the most extraordinary child Pollyanna frowned a little anxiously Aunt Polly please what is extraordinary If you re EXtraordinary you can t be ORdinary can you You certainly can not Oh that s all right then I m glad I m EXtraordinary sighed Pollyanna her face clearing You see missus White used to say missus Rawson was a very ordinary woman and she disliked missus Rawson something awful They were always fight I mean father had that is I mean WE had more trouble keeping peace between them than we did between any of the rest of the Aiders corrected Pollyanna a little breathless from her efforts to steer between the Scylla of her father s past commands in regard to speaking of church quarrels and the Charybdis of her aunt s present commands in regard to speaking of her father Yes yes well never mind interposed Aunt Polly a trifle impatiently You do run on so Pollyanna and no matter what we re talking about you always bring up at those Ladies Aiders Yes m smiled Pollyanna cheerfully I reckon I do maybe But you see they used to bring me up and That will do Pollyanna interrupted a cold voice Now what is it about this jelly Nothing Aunt Polly truly that you would mind I m sure You let me take jelly to HER so I thought you would to HIM this once You see broken legs aren t like like lifelong invalids so his won t last forever as missus Snow s does and she can have all the rest of the things after just once or twice Him He Broken leg What are you talking about Pollyanna Pollyanna stared then her face relaxed Oh I forgot I reckon you didn t know You see it happened while you were gone It was the very day you went that I found him in the woods you know and I had to unlock his house and telephone for the men and the doctor and hold his head and everything And of course then I came away and haven t seen him since But when Nancy made the jelly for missus Snow this week I thought how nice it would be if I could take it to him instead of her just this once Aunt Polly may I Yes yes I suppose so acquiesced Miss Polly a little wearily Who did you say he was The Man I mean mister John Pendleton Miss Polly almost sprang from her chair JOHN PENDLETON Yes Nancy told me his name Maybe you know him Miss Polly did not answer this Instead she asked Do YOU know him Pollyanna nodded Oh yes He always speaks and smiles now He s only cross OUTSIDE you know I ll go and get the jelly Nancy had it most fixed when I came in finished Pollyanna already halfway across the room Pollyanna wait Miss Polly s voice was suddenly very stern I ve changed my mind I would prefer that missus Snow had that jelly to day as usual That is all You may go now Pollyanna s face fell Oh but Aunt Polly HERS will last She can always be sick and have things you know but his is just a broken leg and legs don t last I mean broken ones He s had it a whole week now Yes I remember I heard mister John Pendleton had met with an accident said Miss Polly a little stiffly but I do not care to be sending jelly to John Pendleton Pollyanna I know he is cross outside admitted Pollyanna sadly so I suppose you don t like him But I wouldn t say twas you sent it I d say twas me I like him I d be glad to send him jelly Miss Polly began to shake her head again Then suddenly she stopped and asked in a curiously quiet voice Does he know who you are Pollyanna The little girl sighed I reckon not I told him my name once but he never calls me it never Does he know where you live Oh no I never told him that Then he doesn t know you re my niece I don t think so For a moment there was silence Miss Polly was looking at Pollyanna with eyes that did not seem to see her at all The little girl shifting impatiently from one small foot to the other sighed audibly Then Miss Polly roused herself with a start Very well Pollyanna she said at last still in that queer voice so unlike her own you may you may take the jelly to mister Pendleton as your own gift But understand I do not send it Be very sure that he does not think I do Yes m no m thank you Aunt Polly exulted Pollyanna as she flew through the door CHAPTER XV doctor CHILTON The great gray pile of masonry looked very different to Pollyanna when she made her second visit to the house of mister John Pendleton Windows were open an elderly woman was hanging out clothes in the back yard and the doctor s gig stood under the porte cochere As before Pollyanna went to the side door This time she rang the bell her fingers were not stiff to day from a tight clutch on a bunch of keys A familiar looking small dog bounded up the steps to greet her but there was a slight delay before the woman who had been hanging out the clothes opened the door If you please I ve brought some calf s foot jelly for mister Pendleton smiled Pollyanna Thank you said the woman reaching for the bowl in the little girl s hand Who shall I say sent it And it s calf s foot jelly The doctor coming into the hall at that moment heard the woman s words and saw the disappointed look on Pollyanna s face He stepped quickly forward Ah Some calf s foot jelly he asked genially That will be fine Maybe you d like to see our patient eh Oh yes sir beamed Pollyanna and the woman in obedience to a nod from the doctor led the way down the hall at once though plainly with vast surprise on her face Behind the doctor a young man a trained nurse from the nearest city gave a disturbed exclamation But Doctor didn t mister Pendleton give orders not to admit any one Oh yes nodded the doctor imperturbably But I m giving orders now I ll take the risk Then he added whimsically You don t know of course but that little girl is better than a six quart bottle of tonic any day If anything or anybody can take the grouch out of Pendleton this afternoon she can That s why I sent her in Who is she For one brief moment the doctor hesitated She s the niece of one of our best known residents Her name is Pollyanna Whittier I I don t happen to enjoy a very extensive personal acquaintance with the little lady as yet but lots of my patients do I m thankful to say The nurse smiled Indeed And what are the special ingredients of this wonder working tonic of hers The doctor shook his head I don t know As near as I can find out it is an overwhelming unquenchable gladness for everything that has happened or is going to happen At any rate her quaint speeches are constantly being repeated to me and as near as I can make out just being glad is the tenor of most of them All is he added with another whimsical smile as he stepped out on to the porch I wish I could prescribe her and buy her as I would a box of pills though if there gets to be many of her in the world you and I might as well go to ribbon selling and ditch digging for all the money we d get out of nursing and doctoring he laughed picking up the reins and stepping into the gig Pollyanna meanwhile in accordance with the doctor s orders was being escorted to John Pendleton s rooms Her way led through the great library at the end of the hall and rapid as was her progress through it Pollyanna saw at once that great changes had taken place The book lined walls and the crimson curtains were the same but there was no litter on the floor no untidiness on the desk and not so much as a grain of dust in sight The telephone card hung in its proper place and the brass andirons had been polished One of the mysterious doors was open and it was toward this that the maid led the way A moment later Pollyanna found herself in a sumptuously furnished bedroom while the maid was saying in a frightened voice If you please sir here here s a little girl with some jelly The doctor said I was to to bring her in The next moment Pollyanna found herself alone with a very cross looking man lying flat on his back in bed See here didn t I say began an angry voice Oh it s you it broke off not very graciously as Pollyanna advanced toward the bed Yes sir smiled Pollyanna Oh I m so glad they let me in You see at first the lady most took my jelly and I was so afraid I wasn t going to see you at all Then the doctor came and he said I might Wasn t he lovely to let me see you In spite of himself the man s lips twitched into a smile but all he said was Humph And I ve brought you some jelly resumed Pollyanna calf s foot I hope you like it There was a rising inflection in her voice Never ate it The fleeting smile had gone and the scowl had come back to the man s face For a brief instant Pollyanna s countenance showed disappointment but it cleared as she set the bowl of jelly down Didn t you Well if you didn t then you can t know you DON T like it anyhow can you So I reckon I m glad you haven t after all Now if you knew Yes yes well there s one thing I know all right and that is that I m flat on my back right here this minute and that I m liable to stay here till doomsday I guess Pollyanna looked shocked Oh no It couldn t be till doomsday you know when the angel Gabriel blows his trumpet unless it should come quicker than we think it will oh of course I know the Bible says it may come quicker than we think but I don t think it will that is of course I believe the Bible but I mean I don t think it will come as much quicker as it would if it should come now and John Pendleton laughed suddenly and aloud The nurse coming in at that moment heard the laugh and beat a hurried but a very silent retreat He had the air of a frightened cook who seeing the danger of a breath of cold air striking a half done cake hastily shuts the oven door Aren t you getting a little mixed asked John Pendleton of Pollyanna The little girl laughed Maybe But what I mean is that legs don t last broken ones you know like lifelong invalids same as missus Snow has got So yours won t last till doomsday at all I should think you could be glad of that Oh I am retorted the man grimly And you didn t break but one You can be glad twasn t two Pollyanna was warming to her task Of course So fortunate sniffed the man with uplifted eyebrows looking at it from that standpoint I suppose I might be glad I wasn t a centipede and didn t break fifty Pollyanna chuckled Oh that s the best yet she crowed I know what a centipede is they ve got lots of legs And you can be glad Oh of course interrupted the man sharply all the old bitterness coming back to his voice I can be glad too for all the rest I suppose the nurse and the doctor and that confounded woman in the kitchen Why yes sir only think how bad twould be if you DIDN T have them Well I eh he demanded sharply Why I say only think how bad it would be if you didn t have em and you lying here like this As if that wasn t the very thing that was at the bottom of the whole matter retorted the man testily because I am lying here like this And yet you expect me to say I m glad because of a fool woman who disarranges the whole house and calls it regulating and a man who aids and abets her in it and calls it nursing to say nothing of the doctor who eggs em both on and the whole bunch of them meanwhile expecting me to pay them for it and pay them well too Pollyanna frowned sympathetically Yes I know THAT part is too bad about the money when you ve been saving it too all this time When eh Saving it buying beans and fish balls you know Say DO you like beans or do you like turkey better only on account of the sixty cents Look a here child what are you talking about Pollyanna smiled radiantly About your money you know denying yourself and saving it for the heathen You see I found out about it Why mister Pendleton that s one of the ways I knew you weren t cross inside Nancy told me The man s jaw dropped Nancy told you I was saving money for the Well may I inquire who Nancy is Our Nancy She works for Aunt Polly Aunt Polly Well who is Aunt Polly She s Miss Polly Harrington I live with her The man made a sudden movement Miss Polly Harrington he breathed You live with HER Yes I m her niece She s taken me to bring up on account of my mother you know faltered Pollyanna in a low voice She was her sister And after father went to be with her and the rest of us in Heaven there wasn t any one left for me down here but the Ladies Aid so she took me The man did not answer His face as he lay back on the pillow now was very white so white that Pollyanna was frightened She rose uncertainly to her feet I reckon maybe I d better go now she proposed I I hope you ll like the jelly The man turned his head suddenly and opened his eyes There was a curious longing in their dark depths which even Pollyanna saw and at which she marvelled And so you are Miss Polly Harrington s niece he said gently Yes sir Still the man s dark eyes lingered on her face until Pollyanna feeling vaguely restless murmured I I suppose you know her John Pendleton s lips curved in an odd smile Oh yes I know her He hesitated then went on still with that curious smile But you don t mean you can t mean that it was Miss Polly Harrington who sent that jelly to me he said slowly Pollyanna looked distressed N no sir she didn t She said I must be very sure not to let you think she did send it But I I thought as much vouchsafed the man shortly turning away his head And Pollyanna still more distressed tiptoed from the room Under the porte cochere she found the doctor waiting in his gig The nurse stood on the steps Well Miss Pollyanna may I have the pleasure of seeing you home asked the doctor smilingly I started to drive on a few minutes ago then it occurred to me that I d wait for you Thank you sir I m glad you did I just love to ride beamed Pollyanna as he reached out his hand to help her in Do you smiled the doctor nodding his head in farewell to the young man on the steps Well as near as I can judge there are a good many things you love to do eh he added as they drove briskly away Pollyanna laughed Why I don t know I reckon perhaps there are she admitted I like to do most everything that s LIVING Of course I don t like the other things very well sewing and reading out loud and all that But THEY aren t LIVING No What are they then Aunt Polly says they re learning to live sighed Pollyanna with a rueful smile The doctor smiled now a little queerly Does she Well I should think she might say just that Yes responded Pollyanna But I don t see it that way at all I don t think you have to LEARN how to live I didn t anyhow The doctor drew a long sigh After all I m afraid some of us do have to little girl he said Then for a time he was silent Pollyanna stealing a glance at his face felt vaguely sorry for him He looked so sad She wished uneasily that she could do something It was this perhaps that caused her to say in a timid voice doctor Chilton I should think being a doctor would be the very gladdest kind of a business there was The doctor turned in surprise Gladdest when I see so much suffering always everywhere I go he cried She nodded I know but you re HELPING it don t you see and of course you re glad to help it And so that makes you the gladdest of any of us all the time The doctor s eyes filled with sudden hot tears The doctor s life was a singularly lonely one He had no wife and no home save his two room office in a boarding house His profession was very dear to him Looking now into Pollyanna s shining eyes he felt as if a loving hand had been suddenly laid on his head in blessing He knew too that never again would a long day s work or a long night s weariness be quite without that new found exaltation that had come to him through Pollyanna s eyes God bless you little girl he said unsteadily Then with the bright smile his patients knew and loved so well he added And I m thinking after all that it was the doctor quite as much as his patients that needed a draft of that tonic All of which puzzled Pollyanna very much until a chipmunk running across the road drove the whole matter from her mind The doctor left Pollyanna at her own door smiled at Nancy who was sweeping off the front porch then drove rapidly away I ve had a perfectly beautiful ride with the doctor announced Pollyanna bounding up the steps He s lovely Nancy Is he Yes And I told him I should think his business would be the very gladdest one there was What goin ter see sick folks an folks what ain t sick but thinks they is which is worse Nancy s face showed open skepticism Pollyanna laughed gleefully Yes That s most what he said too but there is a way to be glad even then Guess Nancy frowned in meditation Nancy was getting so she could play this game of being glad quite successfully she thought She rather enjoyed studying out Pollyanna s posers too as she called some of the little girl s questions Oh I know she chuckled It s just the opposite from what you told Mis Snow Opposite repeated Pollyanna obviously puzzled Yes You told her she could be glad because other folks wasn t like her all sick you know Yes nodded Pollyanna Well the doctor can be glad because he isn t like other folks the sick ones I mean what he doctors finished Nancy in triumph It was Pollyanna s turn to frown Why y yes she admitted Of course that IS one way but it isn t the way I said and someway I don t seem to quite like the sound of it It isn t exactly as if he said he was glad they WERE sick but You do play the game so funny sometimes Nancy she sighed as she went into the house Pollyanna found her aunt in the sitting room Who was that man the one who drove into the yard Pollyanna questioned the lady a little sharply Why Aunt Polly that was doctor Chilton Don t you know him doctor Chilton What was he doing here He drove me home Oh and I gave the jelly to mister Pendleton and Miss Polly lifted her head quickly Pollyanna he did not think I sent it Oh no Aunt Polly I told him you didn t Miss Polly grew a sudden vivid pink You TOLD him I didn t Pollyanna opened wide her eyes at the remonstrative dismay in her aunt s voice Why Aunt Polly you SAID to Aunt Polly sighed I SAID Pollyanna that I did not send it and for you to be very sure that he did not think I DID which is a very different matter from TELLING him outright that I did not send it And she turned vexedly away Dear me Well I don t see where the difference is sighed Pollyanna as she went to hang her hat on the one particular hook in the house upon which Aunt Polly had said that it must be hung CHAPTER XVI A RED ROSE AND A LACE SHAWL It was on a rainy day about a week after Pollyanna s visit to mister John Pendleton that Miss Polly was driven by Timothy to an early afternoon committee meeting of the Ladies Aid Society When she returned at three o clock her cheeks were a bright pretty pink and her hair blown by the damp wind had fluffed into kinks and curls wherever the loosened pins had given leave Pollyanna had never before seen her aunt look like this Oh oh oh Why Aunt Polly you ve got em too she cried rapturously dancing round and round her aunt as that lady entered the sitting room Got what you impossible child Pollyanna was still revolving round and round her aunt And I never knew you had em Can folks have em when you don t know they ve got em DO you suppose I could fore I get to Heaven I mean she cried pulling out with eager fingers the straight locks above her ears But then they wouldn t be black if they did come You can t hide the black part Pollyanna what does all this mean demanded Aunt Polly hurriedly removing her hat and trying to smooth back her disordered hair No no please Aunt Polly Pollyanna s jubilant voice turned to one of distressed appeal Don t smooth em out It s those that I m talking about those darling little black curls Oh Aunt Polly they re so pretty Nonsense What do you mean Pollyanna by going to the Ladies Aid the other day in that absurd fashion about that beggar boy But it isn t nonsense urged Pollyanna answering only the first of her aunt s remarks You don t know how pretty you look with your hair like that Oh Aunt Polly please mayn t I do your hair like I did missus Snow s and put in a flower I d so love to see you that way Why you d be ever so much prettier than she was Pollyanna Miss Polly spoke very sharply all the more sharply because Pollyanna s words had given her an odd throb of joy when before had anybody cared how she or her hair looked When before had anybody loved to see her pretty Pollyanna you did not answer my question Why did you go to the Ladies Aid in that absurd fashion Yes m I know but please I didn t know it was absurd until I went and found out they d rather see their report grow than Jimmy So then I wrote to MY Ladies Aiders cause Jimmy is far away from them you know and I thought maybe he could be their little India boy same as Aunt Polly WAS I your little India girl And Aunt Polly you WILL let me do your hair won t you Aunt Polly put her hand to her throat the old helpless feeling was upon her she knew But Pollyanna when the ladies told me this afternoon how you came to them I was so ashamed I Pollyanna began to dance up and down lightly on her toes You didn t You didn t say I COULDN T do your hair she crowed triumphantly and so I m sure it means just the other way round sort of like it did the other day about mister Pendleton s jelly that you didn t send but didn t want me to say you didn t send you know Now wait just where you are I ll get a comb But Pollyanna Pollyanna remonstrated Aunt Polly following the little girl from the room and panting up stairs after her Oh did you come up here Pollyanna greeted her at the door of Miss Polly s own room That ll be nicer yet I ve got the comb Now sit down please right here Oh I m so glad you let me do it But Pollyanna I I Miss Polly did not finish her sentence To her helpless amazement she found herself in the low chair before the dressing table with her hair already tumbling about her ears under ten eager but very gentle fingers Oh my what pretty hair you ve got prattled Pollyanna and there s so much more of it than missus Snow has too But of course you need more anyhow because you re well and can go to places where folks can see it My I reckon folks ll be glad when they do see it and surprised too cause you ve hid it so long Why Aunt Polly I ll make you so pretty everybody ll just love to look at you Pollyanna gasped a stifled but shocked voice from a veil of hair I I m sure I don t know why I m letting you do this silly thing Why Aunt Polly I should think you d be glad to have folks like to look at you Don t you like to look at pretty things I m ever so much happier when I look at pretty folks cause when I look at the other kind I m so sorry for them But but And I just love to do folks hair purred Pollyanna contentedly I did quite a lot of the Ladies Aiders but there wasn t any of them so nice as yours missus White s was pretty nice though and she looked just lovely one day when I dressed her up in Oh Aunt Polly I ve just happened to think of something But it s a secret and I sha n t tell Now your hair is almost done and pretty quick I m going to leave you just a minute and you must promise promise PROMISE not to stir nor peek even till I come back Now remember she finished as she ran from the room Aloud Miss Polly said nothing To herself she said that of course she should at once undo the absurd work of her niece s fingers and put her hair up properly again As for peeking just as if she cared how At that moment unaccountably Miss Polly caught a glimpse of herself in the mirror of the dressing table And what she saw sent such a flush of rosy color to her cheeks that she only flushed the more at the sight She saw a face not young it is true but just now alight with excitement and surprise The cheeks were a pretty pink The eyes sparkled The hair dark and still damp from the outdoor air lay in loose waves about the forehead and curved back over the ears in wonderfully becoming lines with softening little curls here and there So amazed and so absorbed was Miss Polly with what she saw in the glass that she quite forgot her determination to do over her hair until she heard Pollyanna enter the room again Before she could move then she felt a folded something slipped across her eyes and tied in the back Pollyanna Pollyanna What are you doing she cried Pollyanna chuckled That s just what I don t want you to know Aunt Polly and I was afraid you WOULD peek so I tied on the handkerchief Now sit still It won t take but just a minute then I ll let you see But Pollyanna began Miss Polly struggling blindly to her feet you must take this off You child child what ARE you doing she gasped as she felt a soft something slipped about her shoulders Pollyanna only chuckled the more gleefully With trembling fingers she was draping about her aunt s shoulders the fleecy folds of a beautiful lace shawl yellowed from long years of packing away and fragrant with lavender Pollyanna had found the shawl the week before when Nancy had been regulating the attic and it had occurred to her to day that there was no reason why her aunt as well as missus White of her Western home should not be dressed up Her task completed Pollyanna surveyed her work with eyes that approved but that saw yet one touch wanting Promptly therefore she pulled her aunt toward the sun parlor where she could see a belated red rose blooming on the trellis within reach of her hand Pollyanna what are you doing Where are you taking me to recoiled Aunt Polly vainly trying to hold herself back Pollyanna I shall not It s just to the sun parlor only a minute I ll have you ready now quicker n no time panted Pollyanna reaching for the rose and thrusting it into the soft hair above Miss Polly s left ear There she exulted untying the knot of the handkerchief and flinging the bit of linen far from her Oh Aunt Polly now I reckon you ll be glad I dressed you up For one dazed moment Miss Polly looked at her bedecked self and at her surroundings then she gave a low cry and fled to her room Pollyanna following the direction of her aunt s last dismayed gaze saw through the open windows of the sun parlor the horse and gig turning into the driveway She recognized at once the man who held the reins Delightedly she leaned forward doctor Chilton doctor Chilton Did you want to see me I m up here Yes smiled the doctor a little gravely Will you come down please In the bedroom Pollyanna found a flushed faced angry eyed woman plucking at the pins that held a lace shawl in place Pollyanna how could you moaned the woman To think of your rigging me up like this and then letting me BE SEEN Pollyanna stopped in dismay But you looked lovely perfectly lovely Aunt Polly and Lovely scorned the woman flinging the shawl to one side and attacking her hair with shaking fingers Oh Aunt Polly please please let the hair stay Stay Like this As if I would And Miss Polly pulled the locks so tightly back that the last curl lay stretched dead at the ends of her fingers O dear And you did look so pretty almost sobbed Pollyanna as she stumbled through the door Down stairs Pollyanna found the doctor waiting in his gig I ve prescribed you for a patient and he s sent me to get the prescription filled announced the doctor Will you go You mean an errand to the drug store asked Pollyanna a little uncertainly I used to go some for the Ladies Aiders The doctor shook his head with a smile Not exactly It s mister John Pendleton He would like to see you to day if you ll be so good as to come It s stopped raining so I drove down after you Will you come I ll call for you and bring you back before six o clock I d love to exclaimed Pollyanna Let me ask Aunt Polly In a few moments she returned hat in hand but with rather a sober face Didn t your aunt want you to go asked the doctor a little diffidently as they drove away Y yes sighed Pollyanna She she wanted me to go TOO much I m afraid Wanted you to go TOO MUCH Pollyanna sighed again Yes I reckon she meant she didn t want me there You see she said Yes yes run along run along do I wish you d gone before The doctor smiled but with his lips only His eyes were very grave For some time he said nothing then a little hesitatingly he asked Wasn t it your aunt I saw with you a few minutes ago in the window of the sun parlor Pollyanna drew a long breath Yes that s what s the whole trouble I suppose You see I d dressed her up in a perfectly lovely lace shawl I found up stairs and I d fixed her hair and put on a rose and she looked so pretty Didn t YOU think she looked just lovely For a moment the doctor did not answer When he did speak his voice was so low Pollyanna could but just hear the words Yes Pollyanna I I thought she did look just lovely Did you I m so glad I ll tell her nodded the little girl contentedly To her surprise the doctor gave a sudden exclamation Never Pollyanna I I m afraid I shall have to ask you not to tell her that Why doctor Chilton Why not I should think you d be glad But she might not be cut in the doctor Pollyanna considered this for a moment That s so maybe she wouldn t she sighed I remember now twas cause she saw you that she ran And she she spoke afterwards about her being seen in that rig I thought as much declared the doctor under his breath Still I don t see why maintained Pollyanna when she looked so pretty The doctor said nothing He did not speak again indeed until they were almost to the great stone house in which John Pendleton lay with a broken leg CHAPTER XVII JUST LIKE A BOOK John Pendleton greeted Pollyanna to day with a smile Well Miss Pollyanna I m thinking you must be a very forgiving little person else you wouldn t have come to see me again to day Why mister Pendleton I was real glad to come and I m sure I don t see why I shouldn t be either Oh well you know I was pretty cross with you I m afraid both the other day when you so kindly brought me the jelly and that time when you found me with the broken leg at first By the way too I don t think I ve ever thanked you for that Now I m sure that even you would admit that you were very forgiving to come and see me after such ungrateful treatment as that Pollyanna stirred uneasily But I was glad to find you that is I don t mean I was glad your leg was broken of course she corrected hurriedly John Pendleton smiled I understand Your tongue does get away with you once in a while doesn t it Miss Pollyanna I do thank you however and I consider you a very brave little girl to do what you did that day I thank you for the jelly too he added in a lighter voice Did you like it asked Pollyanna with interest Very much I suppose there isn t any more to day that that Aunt Polly DIDN T send is there he asked with an odd smile His visitor looked distressed N no sir She hesitated then went on with heightened color Please mister Pendleton I didn t mean to be rude the other day when I said Aunt Polly did NOT send the jelly There was no answer John Pendleton was not smiling now He was looking straight ahead of him with eyes that seemed to be gazing through and beyond the object before them After a time he drew a long sigh and turned to Pollyanna When he spoke his voice carried the old nervous fretfulness Well well this will never do at all I didn t send for you to see me moping this time Listen Out in the library the big room where the telephone is you know you will find a carved box on the lower shelf of the big case with glass doors in the corner not far from the fireplace That is it ll be there if that confounded woman hasn t regulated it to somewhere else You may bring it to me It is heavy but not too heavy for you to carry I think Oh I m awfully strong declared Pollyanna cheerfully as she sprang to her feet In a minute she had returned with the box It was a wonderful half hour that Pollyanna spent then The box was full of treasures curios that John Pendleton had picked up in years of travel and concerning each there was some entertaining story whether it were a set of exquisitely carved chessmen from China or a little jade idol from India It was after she had heard the story about the idol that Pollyanna murmured wistfully Well I suppose it WOULD be better to take a little boy in India to bring up one that didn t know any more than to think that God was in that doll thing than it would be to take Jimmy Bean a little boy who knows God is up in the sky Still I can t help wishing they had wanted Jimmy Bean too besides the India boys John Pendleton did not seem to hear Again his eyes were staring straight before him looking at nothing But soon he had roused himself and had picked up another curio to talk about The visit certainly was a delightful one but before it was over Pollyanna was realizing that they were talking about something besides the wonderful things in the beautiful carved box They were talking of herself of Nancy of Aunt Polly and of her daily life They were talking too even of the life and home long ago in the far Western town Not until it was nearly time for her to go did the man say in a voice Pollyanna had never before heard from stern John Pendleton Little girl I want you to come to see me often Will you I m lonesome and I need you There s another reason and I m going to tell you that too I thought at first after I found out who you were the other day that I didn t want you to come any more You reminded me of of something I have tried for long years to forget So I said to myself that I never wanted to see you again and every day when the doctor asked if I wouldn t let him bring you to me I said no But after a time I found I was wanting to see you so much that that the fact that I WASN T seeing you was making me remember all the more vividly the thing I was so wanting to forget So now I want you to come Will you little girl Why yes mister Pendleton breathed Pollyanna her eyes luminous with sympathy for the sad faced man lying back on the pillow before her I d love to come Thank you said John Pendleton gently After supper that evening Pollyanna sitting on the back porch told Nancy all about mister John Pendleton s wonderful carved box and the still more wonderful things it contained And ter think sighed Nancy that he SHOWED ye all them things and told ye about em like that him that s so cross he never talks ter no one no one Oh but he isn t cross Nancy only outside demurred Pollyanna with quick loyalty I don t see why everybody thinks he s so bad either They wouldn t if they knew him But even Aunt Polly doesn t like him very well She wouldn t send the jelly to him you know and she was so afraid he d think she did send it Probably she didn t call him no duty shrugged Nancy But what beats me is how he happened ter take ter you so Miss Pollyanna meanin no offence ter you of course but he ain t the sort o man what general rally takes ter kids he ain t he ain t Pollyanna smiled happily But he did Nancy she nodded only I reckon even he didn t want to ALL the time Why only to day he owned up that one time he just felt he never wanted to see me again because I reminded him of something he wanted to forget But afterwards What s that interrupted Nancy excitedly He said you reminded him of something he wanted to forget Yes But afterwards What was it Nancy was eagerly insistent He didn t tell me He just said it was something THE MYSTERY breathed Nancy in an awestruck voice That s why he took to you in the first place Oh Miss Pollyanna Why that s just like a book I ve read lots of em Lady Maud s Secret and The Lost Heir and Hidden for Years all of em had mysteries and things just like this My stars and stockings Just think of havin a book lived right under yer nose like this an me not knowin it all this time Now tell me everythin everythin he said Miss Pollyanna there s a dear No wonder he took ter you no wonder no wonder But he didn t cried Pollyanna not till I talked to HIM first And he didn t even know who I was till I took the calf s foot jelly and had to make him understand that Aunt Polly didn t send it and Nancy sprang to her feet and clasped her hands together suddenly Oh Miss Pollyanna I know I know I KNOW I know she exulted rapturously The next minute she was down at Pollyanna s side again Tell me now think and answer straight and true she urged excitedly It was after he found out you was Miss Polly s niece that he said he didn t ever want ter see ye again wa n t it Oh yes I told him that the last time I saw him and he told me this to day I thought as much triumphed Nancy And Miss Polly wouldn t send the jelly herself would she No And you told him she didn t send it Why yes I And he began ter act queer and cry out sudden after he found out you was her niece He did that didn t he Why y yes he did act a little queer over that jelly admitted Pollyanna with a thoughtful frown Nancy drew a long sigh Then I ve got it sure Now listen mister JOHN PENDLETON WAS MISS POLLY HARRINGTON S LOVER she announced impressively but with a furtive glance over her shoulder Why Nancy he couldn t be She doesn t like him objected Pollyanna Nancy gave her a scornful glance Of course she don t THAT S the quarrel Pollyanna still looked incredulous and with another long breath Nancy happily settled herself to tell the story It s like this Just before you come mister Tom told me Miss Polly had had a lover once I didn t believe it I couldn t her and a lover But mister Tom said she had and that he was livin now right in this town And NOW I know of course It s John Pendleton Hain t he got a mystery in his life Don t he shut himself up in that grand house alone and never speak ter no one Didn t he act queer when he found out you was Miss Polly s niece And now hain t he owned up that you remind him of somethin he wants ter forget Just as if ANYBODY couldn t see twas Miss Polly an her sayin she wouldn t send him no jelly too Why Miss Pollyanna it s as plain as the nose on yer face it is it is Oh h breathed Pollyanna in wide eyed amazement But Nancy I should think if they loved each other they d make up some time Both of em all alone so all these years I should think they d be glad to make up Nancy sniffed disdainfully I guess maybe you don t know much about lovers Miss Pollyanna You ain t big enough yet anyhow But if there IS a set o folks in the world that wouldn t have no use for that ere glad game o your n it d be a pair o quarrellin lovers and that s what they be Ain t he cross as sticks most general rally and ain t she Nancy stopped abruptly remembering just in time to whom and about whom she was speaking Suddenly however she chuckled I ain t sayin though Miss Pollyanna but what it would be a pretty slick piece of business if you could GET em ter playin it so they WOULD be glad ter make up But my land wouldn t folks stare some Miss Polly and him I guess though there ain t much chance much chance Pollyanna said nothing but when she went into the house a little later her face was very thoughtful CHAPTER XVIII PRISMS As the warm August days passed Pollyanna went very frequently to the great house on Pendleton Hill She did not feel however that her visits were really a success Not but that the man seemed to want her there he sent for her indeed frequently but that when she was there he seemed scarcely any the happier for her presence at least so Pollyanna thought He talked to her it was true and he showed her many strange and beautiful things books pictures and curios But he still fretted audibly over his own helplessness and he chafed visibly under the rules and regulatings of the unwelcome members of his household He did indeed seem to like to hear Pollyanna talk however and Pollyanna talked Pollyanna liked to talk but she was never sure that she would not look up and find him lying back on his pillow with that white hurt look that always pained her and she was never sure which if any of her words had brought it there As for telling him the glad game and trying to get him to play it Pollyanna had never seen the time yet when she thought he would care to hear about it She had twice tried to tell him but neither time had she got beyond the beginning of what her father had said John Pendleton had on each occasion turned the conversation abruptly to another subject Pollyanna never doubted now that John Pendleton was her Aunt Polly s one time lover and with all the strength of her loving loyal heart she wished she could in some way bring happiness into their to her mind miserably lonely lives Just how she was to do this however she could not see She talked to mister Pendleton about her aunt and he listened sometimes politely sometimes irritably frequently with a quizzical smile on his usually stern lips She talked to her aunt about mister Pendleton or rather she tried to talk to her about him As a general thing however Miss Polly would not listen long She always found something else to talk about She frequently did that however when Pollyanna was talking of others of doctor Chilton for instance Pollyanna laid this though to the fact that it had been doctor Chilton who had seen her in the sun parlor with the rose in her hair and the lace shawl draped about her shoulders Aunt Polly indeed seemed particularly bitter against doctor Chilton as Pollyanna found out one day when a hard cold shut her up in the house If you are not better by night I shall send for the doctor Aunt Polly said Shall you Then I m going to be worse gurgled Pollyanna I d love to have doctor Chilton come to see me She wondered then at the look that came to her aunt s face It will not be doctor Chilton Pollyanna Miss Polly said sternly doctor Chilton is not our family physician I shall send for doctor Warren if you are worse Pollyanna did not grow worse however and doctor Warren was not summoned And I m so glad too Pollyanna said to her aunt that evening Of course I like doctor Warren and all that but I like doctor Chilton better and I m afraid he d feel hurt if I didn t have him You see he wasn t really to blame after all that he happened to see you when I d dressed you up so pretty that day Aunt Polly she finished wistfully That will do Pollyanna I really do not wish to discuss doctor Chilton or his feelings reproved Miss Polly decisively Pollyanna looked at her for a moment with mournfully interested eyes then she sighed I just love to see you when your cheeks are pink like that Aunt Polly but I would so like to fix your hair If Why Aunt Polly But her aunt was already out of sight down the hall It was toward the end of August that Pollyanna making an early morning call on John Pendleton found the flaming band of blue and gold and green edged with red and violet lying across his pillow She stopped short in awed delight Why mister Pendleton it s a baby rainbow a real rainbow come in to pay you a visit she exclaimed clapping her hands together softly Oh oh oh how pretty it is But how DID it get in she cried The man laughed a little grimly John Pendleton was particularly out of sorts with the world this morning Well I suppose it got in through the bevelled edge of that glass thermometer in the window he said wearily The sun shouldn t strike it at all but it does in the morning Oh but it s so pretty mister Pendleton And does just the sun do that My if it was mine I d have it hang in the sun all day long Lots of good you d get out of the thermometer then laughed the man How do you suppose you could tell how hot it was or how cold it was if the thermometer hung in the sun all day I shouldn t care breathed Pollyanna her fascinated eyes on the brilliant band of colors across the pillow Just as if anybody d care when they were living all the time in a rainbow The man laughed He was watching Pollyanna s rapt face a little curiously Suddenly a new thought came to him He touched the bell at his side Nora he said when the elderly maid appeared at the door bring me one of the big brass candle sticks from the mantel in the front drawing room Yes sir murmured the woman looking slightly dazed In a minute she had returned A musical tinkling entered the room with her as she advanced wonderingly toward the bed It came from the prism pendants encircling the old fashioned candelabrum in her hand Thank you You may set it here on the stand directed the man Now get a string and fasten it to the sash curtain fixtures of that window there Take down the sash curtain and let the string reach straight across the window from side to side That will be all Thank you he said when she had carried out his directions As she left the room he turned smiling eyes toward the wondering Pollyanna Bring me the candlestick now please Pollyanna With both hands she brought it and in a moment he was slipping off the pendants one by one until they lay a round dozen of them side by side on the bed Now my dear suppose you take them and hook them to that little string Nora fixed across the window If you really WANT to live in a rainbow I don t see but we ll have to have a rainbow for you to live in Pollyanna had not hung up three of the pendants in the sunlit window before she saw a little of what was going to happen She was so excited then she could scarcely control her shaking fingers enough to hang up the rest But at last her task was finished and she stepped back with a low cry of delight It had become a fairyland that sumptuous but dreary bedroom Everywhere were bits of dancing red and green violet and orange gold and blue The wall the floor and the furniture even to the bed itself were aflame with shimmering bits of color Oh oh oh how lovely breathed Pollyanna then she laughed suddenly I just reckon the sun himself is trying to play the game now don t you she cried forgetting for the moment that mister Pendleton could not know what she was talking about Oh how I wish I had a lot of those things How I would like to give them to Aunt Polly and missus Snow and lots of folks I reckon THEN they d be glad all right Why I think even Aunt Polly d get so glad she couldn t help banging doors if she lived in a rainbow like that Don t you mister Pendleton laughed Well from my remembrance of your aunt Miss Pollyanna I must say I think it would take something more than a few prisms in the sunlight to to make her bang many doors for gladness But come now really what do you mean Pollyanna stared slightly then she drew a long breath Oh I forgot You don t know about the game I remember now Suppose you tell me then And this time Pollyanna told him She told him the whole thing from the very first from the crutches that should have been a doll As she talked she did not look at his face Her rapt eyes were still on the dancing flecks of color from the prism pendants swaying in the sunlit window And that s all she sighed when she had finished And now you know why I said the sun was trying to play it that game For a moment there was silence Then a low voice from the bed said unsteadily Perhaps but I m thinking that the very finest prism of them all is yourself Pollyanna Oh but I don t show beautiful red and green and purple when the sun shines through me mister Pendleton Don t you smiled the man And Pollyanna looking into his face wondered why there were tears in his eyes No she said Then after a minute she added mournfully I m afraid mister Pendleton the sun doesn t make anything but freckles out of me Aunt Polly says it DOES make them The man laughed a little and again Pollyanna looked at him the laugh had sounded almost like a sob CHAPTER XIX WHICH IS SOMEWHAT SURPRISING Pollyanna entered school in September Preliminary examinations showed that she was well advanced for a girl of her years and she was soon a happy member of a class of girls and boys her own age School in some ways was a surprise to Pollyanna and Pollyanna certainly in many ways was very much of a surprise to school They were soon on the best of terms however and to her aunt Pollyanna confessed that going to school WAS living after all though she had had her doubts before In spite of her delight in her new work Pollyanna did not forget her old friends True she could not give them quite so much time now of course but she gave them what time she could Perhaps John Pendleton of them all however was the most dissatisfied One Saturday afternoon he spoke to her about it See here Pollyanna how would you like to come and live with me he asked a little impatiently I don t see anything of you nowadays Pollyanna laughed mister Pendleton was such a funny man I thought you didn t like to have folks round she said He made a wry face Oh but that was before you taught me to play that wonderful game of yours Now I m glad to be waited on hand and foot Never mind I ll be on my own two feet yet one of these days then I ll see who steps around he finished picking up one of the crutches at his side and shaking it playfully at the little girl They were sitting in the great library to day Oh but you aren t really glad at all for things you just SAY you are pouted Pollyanna her eyes on the dog dozing before the fire You know you don t play the game right EVER mister Pendleton you know you don t The man s face grew suddenly very grave That s why I want you little girl to help me play it Will you come Pollyanna turned in surprise mister Pendleton you don t really mean that But I do I want you Will you come Pollyanna looked distressed Why mister Pendleton I can t you know I can t Why I m Aunt Polly s A quick something crossed the man s face that Pollyanna could not quite understand His head came up almost fiercely You re no more hers than Perhaps she would let you come to me he finished more gently Would you come if she did Pollyanna frowned in deep thought But Aunt Polly has been so good to me she began slowly and she took me when I didn t have anybody left but the Ladies Aid and Again that spasm of something crossed the man s face but this time when he spoke his voice was low and very sad Pollyanna long years ago I loved somebody very much I hoped to bring her some day to this house I pictured how happy we d be together in our home all the long years to come Yes pitied Pollyanna her eyes shining with sympathy But well I didn t bring her here Never mind why I just didn t that s all And ever since then this great gray pile of stone has been a house never a home It takes a woman s hand and heart or a child s presence to make a home Pollyanna and I have not had either Now will you come my dear Pollyanna sprang to her feet Her face was fairly illumined mister Pendleton you you mean that you wish you you had had that woman s hand and heart all this time Why y yes Pollyanna Oh I m so glad Then it s all right sighed the little girl Now you can take us both and everything will be lovely Take you both repeated the man dazedly A faint doubt crossed Pollyanna s countenance Well of course Aunt Polly isn t won over yet but I m sure she will be if you tell it to her just as you did to me and then we d both come of course A look of actual terror leaped to the man s eyes Aunt Polly come HERE Pollyanna s eyes widened a little Would you rather go THERE she asked Of course the house isn t quite so pretty but it s nearer Pollyanna what ARE you talking about asked the man very gently now Why about where we re going to live of course rejoined Pollyanna in obvious surprise I THOUGHT you meant here at first You said it was here that you had wanted Aunt Polly s hand and heart all these years to make a home and An inarticulate cry came from the man s throat He raised his hand and began to speak but the next moment he dropped his hand nervelessly at his side The doctor sir said the maid in the doorway Pollyanna rose at once John Pendleton turned to her feverishly Pollyanna for Heaven s sake say nothing of what I asked you yet he begged in a low voice Pollyanna dimpled into a sunny smile Of course not Just as if I didn t know you d rather tell her yourself she called back merrily over her shoulder John Pendleton fell limply back in his chair Why what s up demanded the doctor a minute later his fingers on his patient s galloping pulse A whimsical smile trembled on John Pendleton s lips Overdose of your tonic I guess he laughed as he noted the doctor s eyes following Pollyanna s little figure down the driveway CHAPTER XX WHICH IS MORE SURPRISING Sunday mornings Pollyanna usually attended church and Sunday school Sunday afternoons she frequently went for a walk with Nancy She had planned one for the day after her Saturday afternoon visit to mister John Pendleton but on the way home from Sunday school doctor Chilton overtook her in his gig and brought his horse to a stop Suppose you let me drive you home Pollyanna he suggested I want to speak to you a minute I was just driving out to your place to tell you he went on as Pollyanna settled herself at his side mister Pendleton sent a special request for you to go to see him this afternoon SURE He says it s very important Pollyanna nodded happily Yes it is I know I ll go The doctor eyed her with some surprise I m not sure I shall let you after all he declared his eyes twinkling You seemed more upsetting than soothing yesterday young lady Pollyanna laughed Oh it wasn t me truly not really you know not so much as it was Aunt Polly The doctor turned with a quick start Your aunt he ejaculated Pollyanna gave a happy little bounce in her seat Yes And it s so exciting and lovely just like a story you know I I m going to tell you she burst out with sudden decision He said not to mention it but he wouldn t mind your knowing of course He meant not to mention it to HER HER Yes Aunt Polly And of course he WOULD want to tell her himself instead of having me do it lovers so Lovers As the doctor said the word the horse started violently as if the hand that held the reins had given them a sharp jerk Yes nodded Pollyanna happily That s the story part you see I didn t know it till Nancy told me She said Aunt Polly had a lover years ago and they quarrelled She didn t know who it was at first But we ve found out now It s mister Pendleton you know The doctor relaxed suddenly The hand holding the reins fell limply to his lap Oh No I didn t know he said quietly Pollyanna hurried on they were nearing the Harrington homestead Yes and I m so glad now It s come out lovely mister Pendleton asked me to come and live with him but of course I wouldn t leave Aunt Polly like that after she d been so good to me Then he told me all about the woman s hand and heart that he used to want and I found out that he wanted it now and I was so glad For of course if he wants to make up the quarrel everything will be all right now and Aunt Polly and I will both go to live there or else he ll come to live with us Of course Aunt Polly doesn t know yet and we haven t got everything settled so I suppose that is why he wanted to see me this afternoon sure The doctor sat suddenly erect There was an odd smile on his lips Yes I can well imagine that mister John Pendleton does want to see you Pollyanna he nodded as he pulled his horse to a stop before the door There s Aunt Polly now in the window cried Pollyanna then a second later Why no she isn t but I thought I saw her No she isn t there now said the doctor His lips had suddenly lost their smile Pollyanna found a very nervous John Pendleton waiting for her that afternoon Pollyanna he began at once I ve been trying all night to puzzle out what you meant by all that yesterday about my wanting your Aunt Polly s hand and heart here all those years What did you mean Why because you were lovers you know once and I was so glad you still felt that way now Lovers your Aunt Polly and I At the obvious surprise in the man s voice Pollyanna opened wide her eyes Why mister Pendleton Nancy said you were The man gave a short little laugh Indeed Well I m afraid I shall have to say that Nancy didn t know Then you weren t lovers Pollyanna s voice was tragic with dismay Never And it ISN T all coming out like a book There was no answer The man s eyes were moodily fixed out the window O dear And it was all going so splendidly almost sobbed Pollyanna I d have been so glad to come with Aunt Polly And you won t now The man asked the question without turning his head Of course not I m Aunt Polly s The man turned now almost fiercely Before you were hers Pollyanna you were your mother s And it was your mother s hand and heart that I wanted long years ago My mother s Yes I had not meant to tell you but perhaps it s better after all that I do now John Pendleton s face had grown very white He was speaking with evident difficulty Pollyanna her eyes wide and frightened and her lips parted was gazing at him fixedly I loved your mother but she didn t love me And after a time she went away with your father I did not know until then how much I did care The whole world suddenly seemed to turn black under my fingers and But never mind For long years I have been a cross crabbed unlovable unloved old man though I m not nearly sixty yet Pollyanna Then One day like one of the prisms that you love so well little girl you danced into my life and flecked my dreary old world with dashes of the purple and gold and scarlet of your own bright cheeriness I found out after a time who you were and and I thought then I never wanted to see you again I didn t want to be reminded of your mother But you know how that came out I just had to have you come And now I want you always Pollyanna won t you come NOW But mister Pendleton I There s Aunt Polly Pollyanna s eyes were blurred with tears The man made an impatient gesture What about me How do you suppose I m going to be glad about anything without you Why Pollyanna it s only since you came that I ve been even half glad to live But if I had you for my own little girl I d be glad for anything and I d try to make you glad too my dear You shouldn t have a wish ungratified All my money to the last cent should go to make you happy Pollyanna looked shocked Why mister Pendleton as if I d let you spend it on me all that money you ve saved for the heathen A dull red came to the man s face He started to speak but Pollyanna was still talking Besides anybody with such a lot of money as you have doesn t need me to make you glad about things You re making other folks so glad giving them things that you just can t help being glad yourself Why look at those prisms you gave missus Snow and me and the gold piece you gave Nancy on her birthday and Yes yes never mind about all that interrupted the man His face was very very red now and no wonder perhaps it was not for giving things that John Pendleton had been best known in the past That s all nonsense Twasn t much anyhow but what there was was because of you YOU gave those things not I Yes you did he repeated in answer to the shocked denial in her face And that only goes to prove all the more how I need you little girl he added his voice softening into tender pleading once more If ever ever I am to play the glad game Pollyanna you ll have to come and play it with me The little girl s forehead puckered into a wistful frown Aunt Polly has been so good to me she began but the man interrupted her sharply The old irritability had come back to his face Impatience which would brook no opposition had been a part of John Pendleton s nature too long to yield very easily now to restraint Of course she s been good to you But she doesn t want you I ll warrant half so much as I do he contested Why mister Pendleton she s glad I know to have Glad interrupted the man thoroughly losing his patience now I ll wager Miss Polly doesn t know how to be glad for anything Oh she does her duty I know She s a very DUTIFUL woman I ve had experience with her duty before I ll acknowledge we haven t been the best of friends for the last fifteen or twenty years But I know her Every one knows her and she isn t the glad kind Pollyanna She doesn t know how to be As for your coming to me you just ask her and see if she won t let you come And oh little girl little girl I want you so he finished brokenly Pollyanna rose to her feet with a long sigh All right I ll ask her she said wistfully Of course I don t mean that I wouldn t like to live here with you mister Pendleton but She did not complete her sentence There was a moment s silence then she added Well anyhow I m glad I didn t tell her yesterday cause then I supposed SHE was wanted too John Pendleton smiled grimly Well yes Pollyanna I guess it is just as well you didn t mention it yesterday I didn t only to the doctor and of course he doesn t count The doctor cried John Pendleton turning quickly Not doctor Chilton Yes when he came to tell me you wanted to see me to day you know Well of all the muttered the man falling back in his chair Then he sat up with sudden interest And what did doctor Chilton say he asked Pollyanna frowned thoughtfully Why I don t remember Not much I reckon Oh he did say he could well imagine you did want to see me Oh did he indeed answered John Pendleton And Pollyanna wondered why he gave that sudden queer little laugh CHAPTER XXI A QUESTION ANSWERED The sky was darkening fast with what appeared to be an approaching thunder shower when Pollyanna hurried down the hill from John Pendleton s house Half way home she met Nancy with an umbrella By that time however the clouds had shifted their position and the shower was not so imminent Guess it s goin round ter the north announced Nancy eyeing the sky critically I thought twas all the time but Miss Polly wanted me ter come with this She was WORRIED about ye Was she murmured Pollyanna abstractedly eyeing the clouds in her turn Nancy sniffed a little You don t seem ter notice what I said she observed aggrievedly I said yer aunt was WORRIED about ye Oh sighed Pollyanna remembering suddenly the question she was so soon to ask her aunt I m sorry I didn t mean to scare her Well I m glad retorted Nancy unexpectedly I am I am Pollyanna stared GLAD that Aunt Polly was scared about me Why Nancy THAT isn t the way to play the game to be glad for things like that she objected There wa n t no game in it retorted Nancy Never thought of it YOU don t seem ter sense what it means ter have Miss Polly WORRIED about ye child Why it means worried and worried is horrid to feel maintained Pollyanna What else can it mean Nancy tossed her head Well I ll tell ye what it means It means she s at last gettin down somewheres near human like folks an that she ain t jest doin her duty by ye all the time Why Nancy demurred the scandalized Pollyanna Aunt Polly always does her duty She she s a very dutiful woman Unconsciously Pollyanna repeated John Pendleton s words of half an hour before Nancy chuckled You re right she is and she always was I guess But she s somethin more now since you came Pollyanna s face changed Her brows drew into a troubled frown There that s what I was going to ask you Nancy she sighed Do you think Aunt Polly likes to have me here Would she mind if if I wasn t here any more Nancy threw a quick look into the little girl s absorbed face She had expected to be asked this question long before and she had dreaded it She had wondered how she should answer it how she could answer it honestly without cruelly hurting the questioner But now NOW in the face of the new suspicions that had become convictions by the afternoon s umbrella sending Nancy only welcomed the question with open arms She was sure that with a clean conscience to day she could set the love hungry little girl s heart at rest Likes ter have ye here Would she miss ye if ye wa n t here cried Nancy indignantly As if that wa n t jest what I was tellin of ye Didn t she send me posthaste with an umbrella cause she see a little cloud in the sky Didn t she make me tote yer things all down stairs so you could have the pretty room you wanted Why Miss Pollyanna when ye remember how at first she hated ter have With a choking cough Nancy pulled herself up just in time And it ain t jest things I can put my fingers on neither rushed on Nancy breathlessly It s little ways she has that shows how you ve been softenin her up an mellerin her down the cat and the dog and the way she speaks ter me and oh lots o things Why Miss Pollyanna there ain t no tellin how she d miss ye if ye wa n t here finished Nancy speaking with an enthusiastic certainty that was meant to hide the perilous admission she had almost made before Even then she was not quite prepared for the sudden joy that illumined Pollyanna s face Oh Nancy I m so glad glad glad You don t know how glad I am that Aunt Polly wants me As if I d leave her now thought Pollyanna as she climbed the stairs to her room a little later I always knew I wanted to live with Aunt Polly but I reckon maybe I didn t know quite how much I wanted Aunt Polly to want to live with ME The task of telling John Pendleton of her decision would not be an easy one Pollyanna knew and she dreaded it She was very fond of John Pendleton and she was very sorry for him because he seemed to be so sorry for himself She was sorry too for the long lonely life that had made him so unhappy and she was grieved that it had been because of her mother that he had spent those dreary years She pictured the great gray house as it would be after its master was well again with its silent rooms its littered floors its disordered desk and her heart ached for his loneliness She wished that somewhere some one might be found who And it was at this point that she sprang to her feet with a little cry of joy at the thought that had come to her As soon as she could after that she hurried up the hill to John Pendleton s house and in due time she found herself in the great dim library with John Pendleton himself sitting near her his long thin hands lying idle on the arms of his chair and his faithful little dog at his feet Well Pollyanna is it to be the glad game with me all the rest of my life asked the man gently Oh yes cried Pollyanna I ve thought of the very gladdest kind of a thing for you to do and With YOU asked John Pendleton his mouth growing a little stern at the corners N no but Pollyanna you aren t going to say no interrupted a voice deep with emotion I I ve got to mister Pendleton truly I have Aunt Polly Did she REFUSE to let you come I I didn t ask her stammered the little girl miserably Pollyanna Pollyanna turned away her eyes She could not meet the hurt grieved gaze of her friend So you didn t even ask her I couldn t sir truly faltered Pollyanna You see I found out without asking Aunt Polly WANTS me with her and and I want to stay too she confessed bravely You don t know how good she s been to me and and I think really sometimes she s beginning to be glad about things lots of things And you know she never used to be You said it yourself Oh mister Pendleton I COULDN T leave Aunt Polly now There was a long pause Only the snapping of the wood fire in the grate broke the silence At last however the man spoke No Pollyanna I see You couldn t leave her now he said I won t ask you again The last word was so low it was almost inaudible but Pollyanna heard Oh but you don t know about the rest of it she reminded him eagerly There s the very gladdest thing you CAN do truly there is Not for me Pollyanna Yes sir for you You SAID it You said only a a woman s hand and heart or a child s presence could make a home And I can get it for you a child s presence not me you know but another one As if I would have any but you resented an indignant voice But you will when you know you re so kind and good Why think of the prisms and the gold pieces and all that money you save for the heathen and Pollyanna interrupted the man savagely Once for all let us end that nonsense I ve tried to tell you half a dozen times before There is no money for the heathen I never sent a penny to them in my life There He lifted his chin and braced himself to meet what he expected the grieved disappointment of Pollyanna s eyes To his amazement however there was neither grief nor disappointment in Pollyanna s eyes There was only surprised joy Oh oh she cried clapping her hands I m so glad That is she corrected coloring distressfully I don t mean that I m not sorry for the heathen only just now I can t help being glad that you don t want the little India boys because all the rest have wanted them And so I m glad you d rather have Jimmy Bean Now I know you ll take him Take WHO Jimmy Bean He s the child s presence you know and he ll be so glad to be it I had to tell him last week that even my Ladies Aid out West wouldn t take him and he was so disappointed But now when he hears of this he ll be so glad Will he Well I won t ejaculated the man decisively Pollyanna this is sheer nonsense You don t mean you won t take him I certainly do mean just that But he d be a lovely child s presence faltered Pollyanna She was almost crying now And you COULDN T be lonesome with Jimmy round I don t doubt it rejoined the man but I think I prefer the lonesomeness It was then that Pollyanna for the first time in weeks suddenly remembered something Nancy had once told her She raised her chin aggrievedly Maybe you think a nice live little boy wouldn t be better than that old dead skeleton you keep somewhere but I think it would SKELETON Yes Nancy said you had one in your closet somewhere Why what Suddenly the man threw back his head and laughed He laughed very heartily indeed so heartily that Pollyanna began to cry from pure nervousness When he saw that John Pendleton sat erect very promptly His face grew grave at once Pollyanna I suspect you are right more right than you know he said gently In fact I KNOW that a nice live little boy would be far better than my skeleton in the closet only we aren t always willing to make the exchange We are apt to still cling to our skeletons Pollyanna However suppose you tell me a little more about this nice little boy And Pollyanna told him Perhaps the laugh cleared the air or perhaps the pathos of Jimmy Bean s story as told by Pollyanna s eager little lips touched a heart already strangely softened At all events when Pollyanna went home that night she carried with her an invitation for Jimmy Bean himself to call at the great house with Pollyanna the next Saturday afternoon And I m so glad and I m sure you ll like him sighed Pollyanna as she said good by I do so want Jimmy Bean to have a home and folks that care you know CHAPTER XXII SERMONS AND WOODBOXES On the afternoon that Pollyanna told John Pendleton of Jimmy Bean the reverend Paul Ford climbed the hill and entered the Pendleton Woods hoping that the hushed beauty of God s out of doors would still the tumult that His children of men had wrought The reverend Paul Ford was sick at heart Month by month for a year past conditions in the parish under him had been growing worse and worse until it seemed that now turn which way he would he encountered only wrangling backbiting scandal and jealousy He had argued pleaded rebuked and ignored by turns and always and through all he had prayed earnestly hopefully But to day miserably he was forced to own that matters were no better but rather worse Two of his deacons were at swords points over a silly something that only endless brooding had made of any account Three of his most energetic women workers had withdrawn from the Ladies Aid Society because a tiny spark of gossip had been fanned by wagging tongues into a devouring flame of scandal The choir had split over the amount of solo work given to a fanciedly preferred singer Even the Christian Endeavor Society was in a ferment of unrest owing to open criticism of two of its officers As to the Sunday school it had been the resignation of its superintendent and two of its teachers that had been the last straw and that had sent the harassed minister to the quiet woods for prayer and meditation Under the green arch of the trees the reverend Paul Ford faced the thing squarely To his mind the crisis had come Something must be done and done at once The entire work of the church was at a standstill The Sunday services the week day prayer meeting the missionary teas even the suppers and socials were becoming less and less well attended True a few conscientious workers were still left But they pulled at cross purposes usually and always they showed themselves to be acutely aware of the critical eyes all about them and of the tongues that had nothing to do but to talk about what the eyes saw And because of all this the reverend Paul Ford understood very well that he God s minister the church the town and even Christianity itself was suffering and must suffer still more unless Clearly something must be done and done at once But what Slowly the minister took from his pocket the notes he had made for his next Sunday s sermon Frowningly he looked at them His mouth settled into stern lines as aloud very impressively he read the verses on which he had determined to speak But woe unto you scribes and Pharisees hypocrites for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men for ye neither go in yourselves neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in Woe unto you scribes and Pharisees hypocrites for ye devour widows houses and for a pretence make long prayer therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation Woe unto you scribes and Pharisees hypocrites for ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin and have omitted the weightier matters of the law judgment mercy and faith these ought ye to have done and not to leave the other undone It was a bitter denunciation In the green aisles of the woods the minister s deep voice rang out with scathing effect Even the birds and squirrels seemed hushed into awed silence It brought to the minister a vivid realization of how those words would sound the next Sunday when he should utter them before his people in the sacred hush of the church His people they WERE his people Could he do it Dare he do it Dare he not do it It was a fearful denunciation even without the words that would follow his own words He had prayed and prayed He had pleaded earnestly for help for guidance He longed oh how earnestly he longed to take now in this crisis the right step But was this the right step Slowly the minister folded the papers and thrust them back into his pocket Then with a sigh that was almost a moan he flung himself down at the foot of a tree and covered his face with his hands It was there that Pollyanna on her way home from the Pendleton house found him With a little cry she ran forward Oh oh mister Ford You YOU haven t broken YOUR leg or or anything have you she gasped The minister dropped his hands and looked up quickly He tried to smile No dear no indeed I m just resting Oh sighed Pollyanna falling back a little That s all right then You see mister Pendleton HAD broken his leg when I found him but he was lying down though And you are sitting up Yes I am sitting up and I haven t broken anything that doctors can mend The last words were very low but Pollyanna heard them A swift change crossed her face Her eyes glowed with tender sympathy I know what you mean something plagues you Father used to feel like that lots of times I reckon ministers do most generally You see there s such a lot depends on em somehow The reverend Paul Ford turned a little wonderingly Was YOUR father a minister Pollyanna Yes sir Didn t you know I supposed everybody knew that He married Aunt Polly s sister and she was my mother Oh I understand But you see I haven t been here many years so I don t know all the family histories Yes sir I mean no sir smiled Pollyanna There was a long pause The minister still sitting at the foot of the tree appeared to have forgotten Pollyanna s presence He had pulled some papers from his pocket and unfolded them but he was not looking at them He was gazing instead at a leaf on the ground a little distance away and it was not even a pretty leaf It was brown and dead Pollyanna looking at him felt vaguely sorry for him It it s a nice day she began hopefully For a moment there was no answer then the minister looked up with a start What Oh yes it is a very nice day And tisn t cold at all either even if tis October observed Pollyanna still more hopefully mister Pendleton had a fire but he said he didn t need it It was just to look at I like to look at fires don t you There was no reply this time though Pollyanna waited patiently before she tried again by a new route Do You like being a minister The reverend Paul Ford looked up now very quickly Do I like Why what an odd question Why do you ask that my dear Nothing only the way you looked It made me think of my father He used to look like that sometimes Did he The minister s voice was polite but his eyes had gone back to the dried leaf on the ground Yes and I used to ask him just as I did you if he was glad he was a minister The man under the tree smiled a little sadly Well what did he say Oh he always said he was of course but most always he said too that he wouldn t STAY a minister a minute if twasn t for the rejoicing texts The WHAT The reverend Paul Ford s eyes left the leaf and gazed wonderingly into Pollyanna s merry little face Well that s what father used to call em she laughed Of course the Bible didn t name em that But it s all those that begin Be glad in the Lord or Rejoice greatly or Shout for joy and all that you know such a lot of em Once when father felt specially bad he counted em There were eight hundred of em Eight hundred Yes that told you to rejoice and be glad you know that s why father named em the rejoicing texts Oh There was an odd look on the minister s face His eyes had fallen to the words on the top paper in his hands But woe unto you scribes and Pharisees hypocrites And so your father liked those rejoicing texts he murmured Oh yes nodded Pollyanna emphatically He said he felt better right away that first day he thought to count em He said if God took the trouble to tell us eight hundred times to be glad and rejoice He must want us to do it SOME And father felt ashamed that he hadn t done it more After that they got to be such a comfort to him you know when things went wrong when the Ladies Aiders got to fight I mean when they DIDN T AGREE about something corrected Pollyanna hastily Why it was those texts too father said that made HIM think of the game he began with ME on the crutches but he said twas the rejoicing texts that started him on it And what game might that be asked the minister About finding something in everything to be glad about you know As I said he began with me on the crutches And once more Pollyanna told her story this time to a man who listened with tender eyes and understanding ears A little later Pollyanna and the minister descended the hill hand in hand Pollyanna s face was radiant Pollyanna loved to talk and she had been talking now for some time there seemed to be so many many things about the game her father and the old home life that the minister wanted to know At the foot of the hill their ways parted and Pollyanna down one road and the minister down another walked on alone In the reverend Paul Ford s study that evening the minister sat thinking Near him on the desk lay a few loose sheets of paper his sermon notes Under the suspended pencil in his fingers lay other sheets of paper blank his sermon to be But the minister was not thinking either of what he had written or of what he intended to write In his imagination he was far away in a little Western town with a missionary minister who was poor sick worried and almost alone in the world but who was poring over the Bible to find how many times his Lord and Master had told him to rejoice and be glad After a time with a long sigh the reverend Paul Ford roused himself came back from the far Western town and adjusted the sheets of paper under his hand Matthew twenty third thirteen fourteen and twenty three he wrote then with a gesture of impatience he dropped his pencil and pulled toward him a magazine left on the desk by his wife a few minutes before Listlessly his tired eyes turned from paragraph to paragraph until these words arrested them A father one day said to his son Tom who he knew had refused to fill his mother s woodbox that morning Tom I m sure you ll be glad to go and bring in some wood for your mother And without a word Tom went Why Just because his father showed so plainly that he expected him to do the right thing Suppose he had said Tom I overheard what you said to your mother this morning and I m ashamed of you Go at once and fill that woodbox I ll warrant that woodbox would be empty yet so far as Tom was concerned On and on read the minister a word here a line there a paragraph somewhere else What men and women need is encouragement Their natural resisting powers should be strengthened not weakened Instead of always harping on a man s faults tell him of his virtues Try to pull him out of his rut of bad habits Hold up to him his better self his REAL self that can dare and do and win out The influence of a beautiful helpful hopeful character is contagious and may revolutionize a whole town People radiate what is in their minds and in their hearts If a man feels kindly and obliging his neighbors will feel that way too before long But if he scolds and scowls and criticizes his neighbors will return scowl for scowl and add interest When you look for the bad expecting it you will get it When you know you will find the good you will get that Tell your son Tom you KNOW he ll be glad to fill that woodbox then watch him start alert and interested The minister dropped the paper and lifted his chin In a moment he was on his feet tramping the narrow room back and forth back and forth Later some time later he drew a long breath and dropped himself in the chair at his desk God helping me I ll do it he cried softly I ll tell all my Toms I KNOW they ll be glad to fill that woodbox I ll give them work to do and I ll make them so full of the very joy of doing it that they won t have TIME to look at their neighbors woodboxes And he picked up his sermon notes tore straight through the sheets and cast them from him so that on one side of his chair lay But woe unto you and on the other scribes and Pharisees hypocrites while across the smooth white paper before him his pencil fairly flew after first drawing one black line through Matthew twenty third thirteen fourteen and twenty three Thus it happened that the reverend Paul Ford s sermon the next Sunday was a veritable bugle call to the best that was in every man and woman and child that heard it and its text was one of Pollyanna s shining eight hundred Be glad in the Lord and rejoice ye righteous and shout for joy all ye that are upright in heart CHAPTER XXIII AN ACCIDENT At missus Snow s request Pollyanna went one day to doctor Chilton s office to get the name of a medicine which missus Snow had forgotten As it chanced Pollyanna had never before seen the inside of doctor Chilton s office I ve never been to your home before This IS your home isn t it she said looking interestedly about her The doctor smiled a little sadly Yes such as tis he answered as he wrote something on the pad of paper in his hand but it s a pretty poor apology for a home Pollyanna They re just rooms that s all not a home Pollyanna nodded her head wisely Her eyes glowed with sympathetic understanding I know It takes a woman s hand and heart or a child s presence to make a home she said Eh The doctor wheeled about abruptly mister Pendleton told me nodded Pollyanna again about the woman s hand and heart or the child s presence you know Why don t you get a woman s hand and heart doctor Chilton Or maybe you d take Jimmy Bean if mister Pendleton doesn t want him doctor Chilton laughed a little constrainedly So mister Pendleton says it takes a woman s hand and heart to make a home does he he asked evasively Yes He says his is just a house too Why don t you doctor Chilton Why don t I what The doctor had turned back to his desk Get a woman s hand and heart Oh and I forgot Pollyanna s face showed suddenly a painful color I suppose I ought to tell you It wasn t Aunt Polly that mister Pendleton loved long ago and so we we aren t going there to live You see I told you it was but I made a mistake I hope YOU didn t tell any one she finished anxiously No I didn t tell any one Pollyanna replied the doctor a little queerly Oh that s all right then sighed Pollyanna in relief You see you re the only one I told and I thought mister Pendleton looked sort of funny when I said I d told YOU Did he The doctor s lips twitched Yes And of course he wouldn t want many people to know it when twasn t true But why don t you get a woman s hand and heart doctor Chilton There was a moment s silence then very gravely the doctor said They re not always to be had for the asking little girl Pollyanna frowned thoughtfully But I should think you could get em she argued The flattering emphasis was unmistakable Thank you laughed the doctor with uplifted eyebrows Then gravely again I m afraid some of your older sisters would not be quite so confident At least they they haven t shown themselves to be so obliging he observed Pollyanna frowned again Then her eyes widened in surprise Why doctor Chilton you don t mean you didn t try to get somebody s hand and heart once like mister Pendleton and and couldn t did you The doctor got to his feet a little abruptly There there Pollyanna never mind about that now Don t let other people s troubles worry your little head Suppose you run back now to missus Snow I ve written down the name of the medicine and the directions how she is to take it Was there anything else Pollyanna shook her head No Sir thank you Sir she murmured soberly as she turned toward the door From the little hallway she called back her face suddenly alight Anyhow I m glad twasn t my mother s hand and heart that you wanted and couldn t get doctor Chilton Good by It was on the last day of October that the accident occurred Pollyanna hurrying home from school crossed the road at an apparently safe distance in front of a swiftly approaching motor car Just what happened no one could seem to tell afterward Neither was there any one found who could tell why it happened or who was to blame that it did happen Pollyanna however at five o clock was borne limp and unconscious into the little room that was so dear to her There by a white faced Aunt Polly and a weeping Nancy she was undressed tenderly and put to bed while from the village hastily summoned by telephone doctor Warren was hurrying as fast as another motor car could bring him And ye didn t need ter more n look at her aunt s face Nancy was sobbing to Old Tom in the garden after the doctor had arrived and was closeted in the hushed room ye didn t need ter more n look at her aunt s face ter see that twa n t no duty that was eatin her Yer hands don t shake and yer eyes don t look as if ye was tryin ter hold back the Angel o Death himself when you re jest doin yer DUTY mister Tom they don t they don t Is she hurt bad The old man s voice shook There ain t no tellin sobbed Nancy She lay back that white an still she might easy be dead but Miss Polly said she wa n t dead an Miss Polly had oughter know if any one would she kept up such a listenin an a feelin for her heartbeats an her breath Couldn t ye tell anythin what it done to her that that Old Tom s face worked convulsively Nancy s lips relaxed a little I wish ye WOULD call it somethin mister Tom an somethin good an strong too Drat it Ter think of its runnin down our little girl I always hated the evil smellin things anyhow I did I did But where is she hurt I don t know I don t know moaned Nancy There s a little cut on her blessed head but tain t bad that ain t Miss Polly says She says she s afraid it s infernally she s hurt A faint flicker came into Old Tom s eyes I guess you mean internally Nancy he said dryly She s hurt infernally all right plague take that autymobile but I don t guess Miss Polly d be usin that word all the same Eh Well I don t know I don t know moaned Nancy with a shake of her head as she turned away Seems as if I jest couldn t stand it till that doctor gits out o there I wish I had a washin ter do the biggest washin I ever see I do I do she wailed wringing her hands helplessly Even after the doctor was gone however there seemed to be little that Nancy could tell mister Tom There appeared to be no bones broken and the cut was of slight consequence but the doctor had looked very grave had shaken his head slowly and had said that time alone could tell After he had gone Miss Polly had shown a face even whiter and more drawn looking than before The patient had not fully recovered consciousness but at present she seemed to be resting as comfortably as could be expected A trained nurse had been sent for and would come that night That was all And Nancy turned sobbingly and went back to her kitchen It was sometime during the next forenoon that Pollyanna opened conscious eyes and realized where she was Why Aunt Polly what s the matter Isn t it daytime Why don t I get up she cried Why Aunt Polly I can t get up she moaned falling back on the pillow after an ineffectual attempt to lift herself No dear I wouldn t try just yet soothed her aunt quickly but very quietly But what is the matter Why can t I get up Miss Polly s eyes asked an agonized question of the white capped young woman standing in the window out of the range of Pollyanna s eyes The young woman nodded Tell her the lips said Miss Polly cleared her throat and tried to swallow the lump that would scarcely let her speak You were hurt dear by the automobile last night But never mind that now Auntie wants you to rest and go to sleep again Hurt Oh yes I I ran Pollyanna s eyes were dazed She lifted her hand to her forehead Why it s done up and it hurts Yes dear but never mind Just just rest But Aunt Polly I feel so funny and so bad My legs feel so so queer only they don t FEEL at all With an imploring look into the nurse s face Miss Polly struggled to her feet and turned away The nurse came forward quickly Suppose you let me talk to you now she began cheerily I m sure I think it s high time we were getting acquainted and I m going to introduce myself I am Miss Hunt and I ve come to help your aunt take care of you And the very first thing I m going to do is to ask you to swallow these little white pills for me Pollyanna s eyes grew a bit wild But I don t want to be taken care of that is not for long I want to get up You know I go to school Can t I go to school to morrow From the window where Aunt Polly stood now there came a half stifled cry To morrow smiled the nurse brightly Well I may not let you out quite so soon as that Miss Pollyanna But just swallow these little pills for me please and we ll see what THEY LL do All right agreed Pollyanna somewhat doubtfully but I MUST go to school day after to morrow there are examinations then you know She spoke again a minute later She spoke of school and of the automobile and of how her head ached but very soon her voice trailed into silence under the blessed influence of the little white pills she had swallowed CHAPTER XXIV JOHN PENDLETON Pollyanna did not go to school to morrow nor the day after to morrow Pollyanna however did not realize this except momentarily when a brief period of full consciousness sent insistent questions to her lips Pollyanna did not realize anything in fact very clearly until a week had passed then the fever subsided the pain lessened somewhat and her mind awoke to full consciousness She had then to be told all over again what had occurred And so it s hurt that I am and not sick she sighed at last Well I m glad of that G glad Pollyanna asked her aunt who was sitting by the bed Yes I d so much rather have broken legs like mister Pendleton s than life long invalids like missus Snow you know Broken legs get well and lifelong invalids don t Miss Polly who had said nothing whatever about broken legs got suddenly to her feet and walked to the little dressing table across the room She was picking up one object after another now and putting each down in an aimless fashion quite unlike her usual decisiveness Her face was not aimless looking at all however it was white and drawn On the bed Pollyanna lay blinking at the dancing band of colors on the ceiling which came from one of the prisms in the window I m glad it isn t smallpox that ails me too she murmured contentedly That would be worse than freckles And I m glad tisn t whooping cough I ve had that and it s horrid and I m glad tisn t appendicitis nor measles cause they re catching measles are I mean and they wouldn t let you stay here You seem to to be glad for a good many things my dear faltered Aunt Polly putting her hand to her throat as if her collar bound Pollyanna laughed softly I am I ve been thinking of em lots of em all the time I ve been looking up at that rainbow I love rainbows I m so glad mister Pendleton gave me those prisms I m glad of some things I haven t said yet I don t know but I m most glad I was hurt Pollyanna Pollyanna laughed softly again She turned luminous eyes on her aunt Well you see since I have been hurt you ve called me dear lots of times and you didn t before I love to be called dear by folks that belong to you I mean Some of the Ladies Aiders did call me that and of course that was pretty nice but not so nice as if they had belonged to me like you do Oh Aunt Polly I m so glad you belong to me Aunt Polly did not answer Her hand was at her throat again Her eyes were full of tears She had turned away and was hurrying from the room through the door by which the nurse had just entered It was that afternoon that Nancy ran out to Old Tom who was cleaning harnesses in the barn Her eyes were wild mister Tom mister Tom guess what s happened she panted You couldn t guess in a thousand years you couldn t you couldn t Then I cal late I won t try retorted the man grimly specially as I hain t got more n TEN ter live anyhow probably You d better tell me first off Nancy Well listen then Who do you s pose is in the parlor now with the mistress Who I say Old Tom shook his head There s no tellin he declared Yes there is I m tellin It s John Pendleton Sho now You re jokin girl Not much I am an me a lettin him in myself crutches an all An the team he come in a waitin this minute at the door for him jest as if he wa n t the cranky old crosspatch he is what never talks ter no one jest think mister Tom HIM a callin on HER Well why not demanded the old man a little aggressively Nancy gave him a scornful glance As if you didn t know better n me she derided Eh Oh you needn t be so innercent she retorted with mock indignation you what led me wildgoose chasin in the first place What do ye mean Nancy glanced through the open barn door toward the house and came a step nearer to the old man Listen Twas you that was tellin me Miss Polly had a lover in the first place wa n t it Well one day I thinks I finds two and two and I puts em tergether an makes four But it turns out ter be five an no four at all at all With a gesture of indifference Old Tom turned and fell to work If you re goin ter talk ter me you ve got ter talk plain horse sense he declared testily I never was no hand for figgers Nancy laughed Well it s this she explained I heard somethin that made me think him an Miss Polly was lovers mister PENDLETON Old Tom straightened up Yes Oh I know now he wasn t It was that blessed child s mother he was in love with and that s why he wanted but never mind that part she added hastily remembering just in time her promise to Pollyanna not to tell that mister Pendleton had wished her to come and live with him Well I ve been askin folks about him some since and I ve found out that him an Miss Polly hain t been friends for years an that she s been hatin him like pizen owin ter the silly gossip that coupled their names tergether when she was eighteen or twenty Yes I remember nodded Old Tom It was three or four years after Miss Jennie give him the mitten and went off with the other chap Miss Polly knew about it of course and was sorry for him So she tried ter be nice to him Maybe she overdid it a little she hated that minister chap so who had took off her sister At any rate somebody begun ter make trouble They said she was runnin after him Runnin after any man her interjected Nancy I know it but they did declared Old Tom and of course no gal of any spunk ll stand that Then about that time come her own lover an the trouble with HIM After that she shut up like an oyster an wouldn t have nothin ter do with nobody fur a spell Her heart jest seemed to turn bitter at the core Yes I know I ve heard about that now rejoined Nancy an that s why you could a knocked me down with a feather when I see HIM at the door him what she hain t spoke to for years But I let him in an went an told her What did she say Old Tom held his breath suspended Nothin at first She was so still I thought she hadn t heard and I was jest goin ter say it over when she speaks up quiet like Tell mister Pendleton I will be down at once An I come an told him Then I come out here an told you finished Nancy casting another backward glance toward the house Humph grunted Old Tom and fell to work again In the ceremonious parlor of the Harrington homestead mister John Pendleton did not have to wait long before a swift step warned him of Miss Polly s coming As he attempted to rise she made a gesture of remonstrance She did not offer her hand however and her face was coldly reserved I called to ask for Pollyanna he began at once a little brusquely Thank you She is about the same said Miss Polly And that is won t you tell me HOW she is His voice was not quite steady this time A quick spasm of pain crossed the woman s face I can t I wish I could You mean you don t know Yes But the doctor doctor Warren himself seems at sea He is in correspondence now with a New York specialist They have arranged for a consultation at once But but what WERE her injuries that you do know A slight cut on the head one or two bruises and and an injury to the spine which has seemed to cause paralysis from the hips down A low cry came from the man There was a brief silence then huskily he asked And Pollyanna how does she take it She doesn t understand at all how things really are And I CAN T tell her But she must know something Miss Polly lifted her hand to the collar at her throat in the gesture that had become so common to her of late Oh yes She knows she can t move but she thinks her legs are broken She says she s glad it s broken legs like yours rather than lifelong invalids like missus Snow s because broken legs get well and the other doesn t She talks like that all the time until it it seems as if I should die Through the blur of tears in his own eyes the man saw the drawn face opposite twisted with emotion Involuntarily his thoughts went back to what Pollyanna had said when he had made his final plea for her presence Oh I couldn t leave Aunt Polly now It was this thought that made him ask very gently as soon as he could control his voice I wonder if you know Miss Harrington how hard I tried to get Pollyanna to come and live with me With YOU Pollyanna The man winced a little at the tone of her voice but his own voice was still impersonally cool when he spoke again Yes I wanted to adopt her legally you understand making her my heir of course The woman in the opposite chair relaxed a little It came to her suddenly what a brilliant future it would have meant for Pollyanna this adoption and she wondered if Pollyanna were old enough and mercenary enough to be tempted by this man s money and position I am very fond of Pollyanna the man was continuing I am fond of her both for her own sake and for her mother s I stood ready to give Pollyanna the love that had been twenty five years in storage LOVE Miss Polly remembered suddenly why SHE had taken this child in the first place and with the recollection came the remembrance of Pollyanna s own words uttered that very morning I love to be called dear by folks that belong to you And it was this love hungry little girl that had been offered the stored up affection of twenty five years and she was old enough to be tempted by love With a sinking heart Miss Polly realized that With a sinking heart too she realized something else the dreariness of her own future now without Pollyanna Well she said And the man recognizing the self control that vibrated through the harshness of the tone smiled sadly She would not come he answered Why She would not leave you She said you had been so good to her She wanted to stay with you and she said she THOUGHT you wanted her to stay he finished as he pulled himself to his feet He did not look toward Miss Polly He turned his face resolutely toward the door But instantly he heard a swift step at his side and found a shaking hand thrust toward him When the specialist comes and I know anything definite about Pollyanna I will let you hear from me said a trembling voice Good by and thank you for coming Pollyanna will be pleased CHAPTER XXV A WAITING GAME On the day after John Pendleton s call at the Harrington homestead Miss Polly set herself to the task of preparing Pollyanna for the visit of the specialist Pollyanna my dear she began gently we have decided that we want another doctor besides doctor Warren to see you Another one might tell us something new to do to help you get well faster you know A joyous light came to Pollyanna s face doctor Chilton Oh Aunt Polly I d so love to have doctor Chilton I ve wanted him all the time but I was afraid you didn t on account of his seeing you in the sun parlor that day you know so I didn t like to say anything But I m so glad you do want him Aunt Polly s face had turned white then red then back to white again But when she answered she showed very plainly that she was trying to speak lightly and cheerfully Oh no dear It wasn t doctor Chilton at all that I meant 
188_136483_000008_000002	train-clean-360	It is a new doctor a very famous doctor from New York who who knows a great deal about about hurts like yours 
none	none	Pollyanna s face fell I don t believe he knows half so much as doctor Chilton Oh yes he does I m sure dear But it was doctor Chilton who doctored mister Pendleton s broken leg Aunt Polly 
188_136483_000012_000001	train-clean-360	If if you don t mind VERY much I WOULD LIKE to have doctor Chilton truly I would 
none	none	A distressed color suffused Miss Polly s face For a moment she did not speak at all then she said gently though yet with a touch of her old stern decisiveness But I do mind Pollyanna 
188_136483_000014_000001	train-clean-360	I mind very much 
none	none	I would do anything almost anything for you my dear but I for reasons which I do not care to speak of now I don t wish doctor Chilton called in on on this case 
188_136483_000014_000003	train-clean-360	And believe me he can NOT know so much about about your trouble as this great doctor does who will come from New York to morrow 
188_136483_000015_000000	train-clean-360	Pollyanna still looked unconvinced 
188_136483_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 But Aunt Polly if you LOVED doctor Chilton 
188_136483_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 WHAT Pollyanna Aunt Polly s voice was very sharp now 
none	none	Her cheeks were very red too I say if you loved doctor Chilton and didn t love the other one sighed Pollyanna seems to me that would make some difference in the good he would do and I love doctor Chilton The nurse entered the room at that moment and Aunt Polly rose to her feet abruptly a look of relief on her face I am very sorry Pollyanna she said a little stiffly but I m afraid you ll have to let me be the judge this time Besides it s already arranged 
188_136483_000020_000002	train-clean-360	The New York doctor is coming to morrow 
none	none	As it happened however the New York doctor did not come to morrow At the last moment a telegram told of an unavoidable delay owing to the sudden illness of the specialist himself This led Pollyanna into a renewed pleading for the substitution of doctor Chilton which would be so easy now you know But as before Aunt Polly shook her head and said no dear very decisively yet with a still more anxious assurance that she would do anything anything but that to please her dear Pollyanna As the days of waiting passed one by one it did indeed seem that Aunt Polly was doing everything but that that she could do to please her niece I wouldn t a believed it you couldn t a made me believe it Nancy said to Old Tom one morning There don t seem ter be a minute in the day that Miss Polly ain t jest hangin round waitin ter do somethin for that blessed lamb if tain t more than ter let in the cat an her what wouldn t let Fluff nor Buff up stairs for love nor money a week ago an now she lets em tumble all over the bed jest cause it pleases Miss Pollyanna An when she ain t doin nothin else she s movin them little glass danglers round ter diff rent winders in the room so the sun ll make the rainbows dance as that blessed child calls it She s sent Timothy down ter Cobb s greenhouse three times for fresh flowers an that besides all the posies fetched in ter her too An the other day if I didn t find her sittin fore the bed with the nurse actually doin her hair an Miss Pollyanna lookin on an bossin from the bed her eyes all shinin an happy An I declare ter goodness if Miss Polly hain t wore her hair like that every day now jest ter please that blessed child 
188_136483_000026_000000	train-clean-360	Old Tom chuckled 
none	none	Well it strikes me Miss Polly herself ain t lookin none the worse for wearin them ere curls round her forehead he observed dryly Course she ain t retorted Nancy indignantly
188_136483_000028_000001	train-clean-360	 She looks like FOLKS now 
188_136483_000028_000002	train-clean-360	She s actually almost 
none	none	Keerful now Nancy interrupted the old man with a slow grin You know what you said when I told ye she was handsome once Nancy shrugged her shoulders Oh she ain t handsome of course but I will own up she don t look like the same woman what with the ribbons an lace jiggers Miss Pollyanna makes her wear round her neck I told ye so nodded the man
188_136483_000032_000001	train-clean-360	 I told ye she wa n t old 
none	none	Nancy laughed Well I ll own up she HAIN T got quite so good an imitation of it as she did have fore Miss Pollyanna come 
188_136483_000034_000001	train-clean-360	Say mister Tom who WAS her A lover 
188_136483_000034_000002	train-clean-360	I hain t found that out yet I hain t I hain t 
none	none	Hain t ye asked the old man with an odd look on his face Well I guess ye won t then from me Oh mister Tom come on now wheedled the girl Ye see there ain t many folks here that I CAN ask
188_136483_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 Maybe not 
none	none	But there s one anyhow that ain t answerin grinned Old Tom Then abruptly the light died from his eyes
188_136483_000037_000003	train-clean-360	 How is she ter day the little gal 
none	none	Nancy shook her head Her face too had sobered Just the same mister Tom There ain t no special diff rence as I can see or anybody I guess She jest lays there an sleeps an talks some an tries ter smile an be glad cause the sun sets or the moon rises or some other such thing till it s enough ter make yer heart break with achin I know it s the game bless her sweet heart nodded Old Tom blinking a little She told YOU then too about that ere game Oh yes 
188_136483_000042_000001	train-clean-360	She told me long ago The old man hesitated then went on his lips twitching a little 
none	none	I was growlin one day cause I was so bent up and crooked an what do ye s pose the little thing said I couldn t guess I wouldn t think she could find ANYTHIN about THAT ter be glad about She did She said I could be glad anyhow that I didn t have ter STOOP SO FAR TER DO MY WEEDIN cause I was already bent part way over Nancy gave a wistful laugh Well I ain t surprised after all You might know she d find somethin We ve been playin it that game since almost the first cause there wa n t no one else she could play it with though she did speak of her aunt MISS POLLY Nancy chuckled I guess you hain t got such an awful diff rent opinion o the mistress than I have she bridled 
188_136483_000050_000000	train-clean-360	Old Tom stiffened 
none	none	I was only thinkin twould be some of a surprise to her he explained with dignity Well yes I guess twould be THEN retorted Nancy I ain t sayin what twould be NOW I d believe anythin o the mistress now even that she d take ter playin it herself But hain t the little gal told her ever She s told ev ry one else I guess I m hearin of it ev rywhere now since she was hurted said Tom Well she didn t tell Miss Polly rejoined Nancy Miss Pollyanna told me long ago that she couldn t tell her cause her aunt didn t like ter have her talk about her father an twas her father s game an she d have ter talk about him if she did tell it 
188_136483_000054_000002	train-clean-360	So she never told her 
none	none	Oh I see I see The old man nodded his head slowly They was always bitter against the minister chap all of em cause he took Miss Jennie away from em 
188_136483_000055_000002	train-clean-360	An Miss Polly young as she was couldn t never forgive him she was that fond of Miss Jennie in them days 
none	none	I see I see Twas a bad mess he sighed as he turned away Yes twas all round all round sighed Nancy in her turn as she went back to her kitchen For no one were those days of waiting easy The nurse tried to look cheerful but her eyes were troubled The doctor was openly nervous and impatient Miss Polly said little but even the softening waves of hair about her face and the becoming laces at her throat could not hide the fact that she was growing thin and pale As to Pollyanna Pollyanna petted the dog smoothed the cat s sleek head admired the flowers and ate the fruits and jellies that were sent in to her and returned innumerable cheery answers to the many messages of love and inquiry that were brought to her bedside But she too grew pale and thin and the nervous activity of the poor little hands and arms only emphasized the pitiful motionlessness of the once active little feet and legs now lying so woefully quiet under the blankets As to the game Pollyanna told Nancy these days how glad she was going to be when she could go to school again go to see missus Snow go to call on mister Pendleton and go to ride with doctor Chilton nor did she seem to realize that all this gladness was in the future not the present Nancy however did realize it and cry about it when she was alone CHAPTER XXVI A DOOR AJAR Just a week from the time doctor Mead the specialist was first expected he came He was a tall broad shouldered man with kind gray eyes and a cheerful smile Pollyanna liked him at once and told him so You look quite a lot like MY doctor you see she added engagingly YOUR doctor doctor Mead glanced in evident surprise at doctor Warren talking with the nurse a few feet away doctor Warren was a small brown eyed man with a pointed brown beard Oh THAT isn t my doctor smiled Pollyanna divining his thought doctor Warren is Aunt Polly s doctor My doctor is doctor Chilton Oh h said doctor Mead a little oddly his eyes resting on Miss Polly who with a vivid blush had turned hastily away Yes Pollyanna hesitated then continued with her usual truthfulness You see I wanted doctor Chilton all the time but Aunt Polly wanted you She said you knew more than doctor Chilton anyway about about broken legs like mine And of course if you do I can be glad for that Do you A swift something crossed the doctor s face that Pollyanna could not quite translate Only time can tell that little girl he said gently then he turned a grave face toward doctor Warren who had just come to the bedside Every one said afterward that it was the cat that did it Certainly if Fluffy had not poked an insistent paw and nose against Pollyanna s unlatched door the door would not have swung noiselessly open on its hinges until it stood perhaps a foot ajar and if the door had not been open Pollyanna would not have heard her aunt s words In the hall the two doctors the nurse and Miss Polly stood talking In Pollyanna s room Fluffy had just jumped to the bed with a little purring meow of joy when through the open door sounded clearly and sharply Aunt Polly s agonized exclamation Not that Doctor not that You don t mean the child will NEVER WALK again It was all confusion then First from the bedroom came Pollyanna s terrified Aunt Polly Aunt Polly Then Miss Polly seeing the open door and realizing that her words had been heard gave a low little moan and for the first time in her life fainted dead away The nurse with a choking She heard stumbled toward the open door The two doctors stayed with Miss Polly doctor Mead had to stay he had caught Miss Polly as she fell doctor Warren stood by helplessly It was not until Pollyanna cried out again sharply and the nurse closed the door that the two men with a despairing glance into each other s eyes awoke to the immediate duty of bringing the woman in doctor Mead s arms back to unhappy consciousness In Pollyanna s room the nurse had found a purring gray cat on the bed vainly trying to attract the attention of a white faced wild eyed little girl Miss Hunt please I want Aunt Polly I want her right away quick please The nurse closed the door and came forward hurriedly Her face was very pale She she can t come just this minute dear She will a little later What is it Can t I get it Pollyanna shook her head But I want to know what she said just now Did you hear her I want Aunt Polly she said something I want her to tell me tisn t true tisn t true The nurse tried to speak but no words came Something in her face sent an added terror to Pollyanna s eyes Miss Hunt you DID hear her It is true Oh it isn t true You don t mean I can t ever walk again There there dear don t don t choked the nurse Perhaps he didn t know Perhaps he was mistaken There s lots of things that could happen you know But Aunt Polly said he did know She said he knew more than anybody else about about broken legs like mine Yes yes I know dear but all doctors make mistakes sometimes Just just don t think any more about it now please don t dear Pollyanna flung out her arms wildly But I can t help thinking about it she sobbed It s all there is now to think about Why Miss Hunt how am I going to school or to see mister Pendleton or missus Snow or or anybody She caught her breath and sobbed wildly for a moment Suddenly she stopped and looked up a new terror in her eyes Why Miss Hunt if I can t walk how am I ever going to be glad for ANYTHING Miss Hunt did not know the game but she did know that her patient must be quieted and that at once In spite of her own perturbation and heartache her hands had not been idle and she stood now at the bedside with the quieting powder ready There there dear just take this she soothed and by and by we ll be more rested and we ll see what can be done then Things aren t half as bad as they seem dear lots of times you know Obediently Pollyanna took the medicine and sipped the water from the glass in Miss Hunt s hand I know that sounds like things father used to say faltered Pollyanna blinking off the tears He said there was always something about everything that might be worse but I reckon he d never just heard he couldn t ever walk again I don t see how there CAN be anything about that that could be worse do you Miss Hunt did not reply She could not trust herself to speak just then CHAPTER XXVII TWO VISITS It was Nancy who was sent to tell mister John Pendleton of doctor Mead s verdict Miss Polly had remembered her promise to let him have direct information from the house To go herself or to write a letter she felt to be almost equally out of the question It occurred to her then to send Nancy There had been a time when Nancy would have rejoiced greatly at this extraordinary opportunity to see something of the House of Mystery and its master But to day her heart was too heavy to rejoice at anything She scarcely even looked about her at all indeed during the few minutes she waited for mister John Pendleton to appear I m Nancy sir she said respectfully in response to the surprised questioning of his eyes when he came into the room Miss Harrington sent me to tell you about Miss Pollyanna Well In spite of the curt terseness of the word Nancy quite understood the anxiety that lay behind that short well It ain t well mister Pendleton she choked You don t mean He paused and she bowed her head miserably Yes sir He says she can t walk again never For a moment there was absolute silence in the room then the man spoke in a voice shaken with emotion Poor little girl Poor little girl Nancy glanced at him but dropped her eyes at once She had not supposed that sour cross stern John Pendleton could look like that In a moment he spoke again still in the low unsteady voice It seems cruel never to dance in the sunshine again My little prism girl There was another silence then abruptly the man asked She herself doesn t know yet of course does she But she does sir sobbed Nancy an that s what makes it all the harder She found out drat that cat I begs yer pardon apologized the girl hurriedly It s only that the cat pushed open the door an Miss Pollyanna overheard em talkin She found out that way Poor little girl sighed the man again Yes sir You d say so sir if you could see her choked Nancy I hain t seen her but twice since she knew about it an it done me up both times Ye see it s all so fresh an new to her an she keeps thinkin all the time of new things she can t do NOW It worries her too cause she can t seem ter be glad maybe you don t know about her game though broke off Nancy apologetically The glad game asked the man Oh yes she told me of that Oh she did Well I guess she has told it generally ter most folks But ye see now she she can t play it herself an it worries her She says she can t think of a thing not a thing about this not walkin again ter be glad about Well why should she retorted the man almost savagely Nancy shifted her feet uneasily That s the way I felt too till I happened ter think it WOULD be easier if she could find somethin ye know So I tried to to remind her To remind her Of what John Pendleton s voice was still angrily impatient Of of how she told others ter play it Mis Snow and the rest ye know and what she said for them ter do But the poor little lamb just cries an says it don t seem the same somehow She says it s easy ter TELL lifelong invalids how ter be glad but tain t the same thing when you re the lifelong invalid yerself an have ter try ter do it She says she s told herself over an over again how glad she is that other folks ain t like her but that all the time she s sayin it she ain t really THINKIN of anythin only how she can t ever walk again Nancy paused but the man did not speak He sat with his hand over his eyes Then I tried ter remind her how she used ter say the game was all the nicer ter play when when it was hard resumed Nancy in a dull voice But she says that too is diff rent when it really IS hard An I must be goin now sir she broke off abruptly At the door she hesitated turned and asked timidly I couldn t be tellin Miss Pollyanna that that you d seen Jimmy Bean again I s pose sir could I I don t see how you could as I haven t seen him observed the man a little shortly Why Nothin sir only well ye see that s one of the things that she was feelin bad about that she couldn t take him ter see you now She said she d taken him once but she didn t think he showed off very well that day and that she was afraid you didn t think he would make a very nice child s presence after all Maybe you know what she means by that but I didn t sir Yes I know what she means All right sir It was only that she was wantin ter take him again she said so s ter show ye he really was a lovely child s presence And now she can t drat that autymobile I begs yer pardon sir Good by And Nancy fled precipitately It did not take long for the entire town of Beldingsville to learn that the great New York doctor had said Pollyanna Whittier would never walk again and certainly never before had the town been so stirred Everybody knew by sight now the piquant little freckled face that had always a smile of greeting and almost everybody knew of the game that Pollyanna was playing To think that now never again would that smiling face be seen on their streets never again would that cheery little voice proclaim the gladness of some everyday experience It seemed unbelievable impossible cruel In kitchens and sitting rooms and over back yard fences women talked of it and wept openly On street corners and in store lounging places the men talked too and wept though not so openly And neither the talking nor the weeping grew less when fast on the heels of the news itself came Nancy s pitiful story that Pollyanna face to face with what had come to her was bemoaning most of all the fact that she could not play the game that she could not now be glad over anything It was then that the same thought must have in some way come to Pollyanna s friends At all events almost at once the mistress of the Harrington homestead greatly to her surprise began to receive calls calls from people she knew and people she did not know calls from men women and children many of whom Miss Polly had not supposed that her niece knew at all Some came in and sat down for a stiff five or ten minutes Some stood awkwardly on the porch steps fumbling with hats or hand bags according to their sex Some brought a book a bunch of flowers or a dainty to tempt the palate Some cried frankly Some turned their backs and blew their noses furiously But all inquired very anxiously for the little injured girl and all sent to her some message and it was these messages which after a time stirred Miss Polly to action First came mister John Pendleton He came without his crutches to day I don t need to tell you how shocked I am he began almost harshly But can nothing be done Miss Polly gave a gesture of despair Oh we re doing of course all the time doctor Mead prescribed certain treatments and medicines that might help and doctor Warren is carrying them out to the letter of course But doctor Mead held out almost no hope John Pendleton rose abruptly though he had but just come His face was white and his mouth was set into stern lines Miss Polly looking at him knew very well why he felt that he could not stay longer in her presence At the door he turned I have a message for Pollyanna he said Will you tell her please that I have seen Jimmy Bean and that he s going to be my boy hereafter Tell her I thought she would be GLAD to know I shall adopt him probably For a brief moment Miss Polly lost her usual well bred self control You will adopt Jimmy Bean she gasped The man lifted his chin a little Yes I think Pollyanna will understand You will tell her I thought she would be GLAD Why of of course faltered Miss Polly Thank you bowed John Pendleton as he turned to go In the middle of the floor Miss Polly stood silent and amazed still looking after the man who had just left her Even yet she could scarcely believe what her ears had heard John Pendleton ADOPT Jimmy Bean John Pendleton wealthy independent morose reputed to be miserly and supremely selfish to adopt a little boy and such a little boy With a somewhat dazed face Miss Polly went up stairs to Pollyanna s room Pollyanna I have a message for you from mister John Pendleton He has just been here He says to tell you he has taken Jimmy Bean for his little boy He said he thought you d be glad to know it Pollyanna s wistful little face flamed into sudden joy Glad GLAD Well I reckon I am glad Oh Aunt Polly I ve so wanted to find a place for Jimmy and that s such a lovely place Besides I m so glad for mister Pendleton too You see now he ll have the child s presence The what Pollyanna colored painfully She had forgotten that she had never told her aunt of mister Pendleton s desire to adopt her and certainly she would not wish to tell her now that she had ever thought for a minute of leaving her this dear Aunt Polly The child s presence stammered Pollyanna hastily mister Pendleton told me once you see that only a woman s hand and heart or a child s presence could make a a home And now he s got it the child s presence Oh I see said Miss Polly very gently and she did see more than Pollyanna realized She saw something of the pressure that was probably brought to bear on Pollyanna herself at the time John Pendleton was asking HER to be the child s presence which was to transform his great pile of gray stone into a home I see she finished her eyes stinging with sudden tears Pollyanna fearful that her aunt might ask further embarrassing questions hastened to lead the conversation away from the Pendleton house and its master doctor Chilton says so too that it takes a woman s hand and heart or a child s presence to make a home you know she remarked Miss Polly turned with a start doctor CHILTON How do you know that He told me so Twas when he said he lived in just rooms you know not a home Miss Polly did not answer Her eyes were out the window So I asked him why he didn t get em a woman s hand and heart and have a home Pollyanna Miss Polly had turned sharply Her cheeks showed a sudden color Well I did He looked so so sorrowful What did he say Miss Polly asked the question as if in spite of some force within her that was urging her not to ask it He didn t say anything for a minute then he said very low that you couldn t always get em for the asking There was a brief silence Miss Polly s eyes had turned again to the window Her cheeks were still unnaturally pink Pollyanna sighed He wants one anyhow I know and I wish he could have one Why Pollyanna HOW do you know Because afterwards on another day he said something else He said that low too but I heard him He said that he d give all the world if he did have one woman s hand and heart Why Aunt Polly what s the matter Aunt Polly had risen hurriedly and gone to the window Nothing dear I was changing the position of this prism said Aunt Polly whose whole face now was aflame CHAPTER XXVIII THE GAME AND ITS PLAYERS It was not long after John Pendleton s second visit that Milly Snow called one afternoon Milly Snow had never before been to the Harrington homestead She blushed and looked very embarrassed when Miss Polly entered the room I I came to inquire for the little girl she stammered You are very kind She is about the same How is your mother rejoined Miss Polly wearily That is what I came to tell you that is to ask you to tell Miss Pollyanna hurried on the girl breathlessly and incoherently We think it s so awful so perfectly awful that the little thing can t ever walk again and after all she s done for us too for mother you know teaching her to play the game and all that And when we heard how now she couldn t play it herself poor little dear I m sure I don t see how she CAN either in her condition but when we remembered all the things she d said to us we thought if she could only know what she HAD done for us that it would HELP you know in her own case about the game because she could be glad that is a little glad Milly stopped helplessly and seemed to be waiting for Miss Polly to speak Miss Polly had sat politely listening but with a puzzled questioning in her eyes Only about half of what had been said had she understood She was thinking now that she always had known that Milly Snow was queer but she had not supposed she was crazy In no other way however could she account for this incoherent illogical unmeaning rush of words When the pause came she filled it with a quiet I don t think I quite understand Milly Just what is it that you want me to tell my niece Yes that s it I want you to tell her answered the girl feverishly Make her see what she s done for us Of course she s SEEN some things because she s been there and she s known mother is different but I want her to know HOW different she is and me too I m different I ve been trying to play it the game a little Miss Polly frowned She would have asked what Milly meant by this game but there was no opportunity Milly was rushing on again with nervous volubility You know nothing was ever right before for mother She was always wanting em different And really I don t know as one could blame her much under the circumstances But now she lets me keep the shades up and she takes interest in things how she looks and her nightdress and all that And she s actually begun to knit little things reins and baby blankets for fairs and hospitals And she s so interested and so GLAD to think she can do it and that was all Miss Pollyanna s doings you know cause she told mother she could be glad she d got her hands and arms anyway and that made mother wonder right away why she didn t DO something with her hands and arms And so she began to do something to knit you know And you can t think what a different room it is now what with the red and blue and yellow worsteds and the prisms in the window that SHE gave her why it actually makes you feel BETTER just to go in there now and before I used to dread it awfully it was so dark and gloomy and mother was so so unhappy you know And so we want you to please tell Miss Pollyanna that we understand it s all because of her And please say we re so glad we know her that we thought maybe if she knew it it would make her a little glad that she knew us And and that s all sighed Milly rising hurriedly to her feet You ll tell her Why of course murmured Miss Polly wondering just how much of this remarkable discourse she could remember to tell These visits of John Pendleton and Milly Snow were only the first of many and always there were the messages the messages which were in some ways so curious that they caused Miss Polly more and more to puzzle over them One day there was the little Widow Benton Miss Polly knew her well though they had never called upon each other By reputation she knew her as the saddest little woman in town one who was always in black To day however missus Benton wore a knot of pale blue at the throat though there were tears in her eyes She spoke of her grief and horror at the accident then she asked diffidently if she might see Pollyanna Miss Polly shook her head I am sorry but she sees no one yet A little later perhaps missus Benton wiped her eyes rose and turned to go But after she had almost reached the hall door she came back hurriedly Miss Harrington perhaps you d give her a message she stammered Certainly missus Benton I shall be very glad to Still the little woman hesitated then she spoke Will you tell her please that that I ve put on THIS she said just touching the blue bow at her throat Then at Miss Polly s ill concealed look of surprise she added The little girl has been trying for so long to make me wear some color that I thought she d be glad to know I d begun She said that Freddy would be so glad to see it if I would You know Freddy s ALL I have now The others have all missus Benton shook her head and turned away If you ll just tell Pollyanna SHE LL understand And the door closed after her A little later that same day there was the other widow at least she wore widow s garments Miss Polly did not know her at all She wondered vaguely how Pollyanna could have known her The lady gave her name as missus Tarbell I m a stranger to you of course she began at once But I m not a stranger to your little niece Pollyanna I ve been at the hotel all summer and every day I ve had to take long walks for my health It was on these walks that I ve met your niece she s such a dear little girl I wish I could make you understand what she s been to me I was very sad when I came up here and her bright face and cheery ways reminded me of my own little girl that I lost years ago I was so shocked to hear of the accident and then when I learned that the poor child would never walk again and that she was so unhappy because she couldn t be glad any longer the dear child I just had to come to you You are very kind murmured Miss Polly But it is you who are to be kind demurred the other I I want you to give her a message from me Will you Certainly Will you just tell her then that missus Tarbell is glad now Yes I know it sounds odd and you don t understand But if you ll pardon me I d rather not explain Sad lines came to the lady s mouth and the smile left her eyes Your niece will know just what I mean and I felt that I must tell her Thank you and pardon me please for any seeming rudeness in my call she begged as she took her leave Thoroughly mystified now Miss Polly hurried up stairs to Pollyanna s room Pollyanna do you know a missus Tarbell Oh yes I love missus Tarbell She s sick and awfully sad and she s at the hotel and takes long walks We go together I mean we used to Pollyanna s voice broke and two big tears rolled down her cheeks Miss Polly cleared her throat hurriedly We ll she s just been here dear She left a message for you but she wouldn t tell me what it meant She said to tell you that missus Tarbell is glad now Pollyanna clapped her hands softly Did she say that really Oh I m so glad But Pollyanna what did she mean Why it s the game and Pollyanna stopped short her fingers to her lips What game N nothing much Aunt Polly that is I can t tell it unless I tell other things that that I m not to speak of It was on Miss Polly s tongue to question her niece further but the obvious distress on the little girl s face stayed the words before they were uttered Not long after missus Tarbell s visit the climax came It came in the shape of a call from a certain young woman with unnaturally pink cheeks and abnormally yellow hair a young woman who wore high heels and cheap jewelry a young woman whom Miss Polly knew very well by reputation but whom she was angrily amazed to meet beneath the roof of the Harrington homestead Miss Polly did not offer her hand She drew back indeed as she entered the room The woman rose at once Her eyes were very red as if she had been crying Half defiantly she asked if she might for a moment see the little girl Pollyanna Miss Polly said no She began to say it very sternly but something in the woman s pleading eyes made her add the civil explanation that no one was allowed yet to see Pollyanna The woman hesitated then a little brusquely she spoke Her chin was still at a slightly defiant tilt My name is missus Payson missus Tom Payson I presume you ve heard of me most of the good people in the town have and maybe some of the things you ve heard ain t true But never mind that It s about the little girl I came I heard about the accident and and it broke me all up Last week I heard how she couldn t ever walk again and and I wished I could give up my two uselessly well legs for hers She d do more good trotting around on em one hour than I could in a hundred years But never mind that Legs ain t always given to the one who can make the best use of em I notice She paused and cleared her throat but when she resumed her voice was still husky Maybe you don t know it but I ve seen a good deal of that little girl of yours We live on the Pendleton Hill road and she used to go by often only she didn t always GO BY She came in and played with the kids and talked to me and my man when he was home She seemed to like it and to like us She didn t know I suspect that her kind of folks don t generally call on my kind Maybe if they DID call more Miss Harrington there wouldn t be so many of my kind she added with sudden bitterness Be that as it may she came and she didn t do herself no harm and she did do us good a lot o good How much she won t know nor can t know I hope cause if she did she d know other things that I don t want her to know But it s just this It s been hard times with us this year in more ways than one We ve been blue and discouraged my man and me and ready for most anything We was reckoning on getting a divorce about now and letting the kids well we didn t know what we would do with the kids Then came the accident and what we heard about the little girl s never walking again And we got to thinking how she used to come and sit on our doorstep and train with the kids and laugh and and just be glad She was always being glad about something and then one day she told us why and about the game you know and tried to coax us to play it Well we ve heard now that she s fretting her poor little life out of her because she can t play it no more that there s nothing to be glad about And that s what I came to tell her to day that maybe she can be a little glad for us cause we ve decided to stick to each other and play the game ourselves I knew she would be glad because she used to feel kind of bad at things we said sometimes Just how the game is going to help us I can t say that I exactly see yet but maybe twill Anyhow we re going to try cause she wanted us to Will you tell her Yes I will tell her promised Miss Polly a little faintly Then with sudden impulse she stepped forward and held out her hand And thank you for coming missus Payson she said simply The defiant chin fell The lips above it trembled visibly With an incoherently mumbled something missus Payson blindly clutched at the outstretched hand turned and fled The door had scarcely closed behind her before Miss Polly was confronting Nancy in the kitchen Nancy Miss Polly spoke sharply The series of puzzling disconcerting visits of the last few days culminating as they had in the extraordinary experience of the afternoon had strained her nerves to the snapping point Not since Miss Pollyanna s accident had Nancy heard her mistress speak so sternly Nancy WILL you tell me what this absurd game is that the whole town seems to be babbling about And what please has my niece to do with it WHY does everybody from Milly Snow to missus Tom Payson send word to her that they re playing it As near as I can judge half the town are putting on blue ribbons or stopping family quarrels or learning to like something they never liked before and all because of Pollyanna I tried to ask the child herself about it but I can t seem to make much headway and of course I don t like to worry her now But from something I heard her say to you last night I should judge you were one of them too Now WILL you tell me what it all means To Miss Polly s surprise and dismay Nancy burst into tears It means that ever since last June that blessed child has jest been makin the whole town glad an now they re turnin round an tryin ter make her a little glad too Glad of what Just glad That s the game Miss Polly actually stamped her foot There you go like all the rest Nancy What game Nancy lifted her chin She faced her mistress and looked her squarely in the eye I ll tell ye ma am It s a game Miss Pollyanna s father learned her ter play She got a pair of crutches once in a missionary barrel when she was wantin a doll an she cried of course like any child would It seems twas then her father told her that there wasn t ever anythin but what there was somethin about it that you could be glad about an that she could be glad about them crutches Glad for CRUTCHES Miss Polly choked back a sob she was thinking of the helpless little legs on the bed up stairs Yes m That s what I said an Miss Pollyanna said that s what she said too But he told her she COULD be glad cause she DIDN T NEED EM Oh h cried Miss Polly And after that she said he made a regular game of it findin somethin in everythin ter be glad about An she said ye could do it too and that ye didn t seem ter mind not havin the doll so much cause ye was so glad ye DIDN T need the crutches An they called it the jest bein glad game That s the game ma am She s played it ever since But how how Miss Polly came to a helpless pause An you d be surprised ter find how cute it works ma am too maintained Nancy with almost the eagerness of Pollyanna herself I wish I could tell ye what a lot she s done for mother an the folks out home She s been ter see em ye know twice with me She s made me glad too on such a lot o things little things an big things an it s made em so much easier For instance I don t mind Nancy for a name half as much since she told me I could be glad twa n t Hephzibah An there s Monday mornin s too that I used ter hate so She s actually made me glad for Monday mornin s Glad for Monday mornings Nancy laughed I know it does sound nutty ma am But let me tell ye That blessed lamb found out I hated Monday mornin s somethin awful an what does she up an tell me one day but this Well anyhow Nancy I should think you could be gladder on Monday mornin than on any other day in the week because twould be a whole WEEK before you d have another one An I m blest if I hain t thought of it ev ry Monday mornin since an it HAS helped ma am It made me laugh anyhow ev ry time I thought of it an laughin helps ye know it does it does But why hasn t she told me the game faltered Miss Polly Why has she made such a mystery of it when I asked her Nancy hesitated Beggin yer pardon ma am you told her not ter speak of her father so she couldn t tell ye Twas her father s game ye see Miss Polly bit her lip She wanted ter tell ye first off continued Nancy a little unsteadily She wanted somebody ter play it with ye know That s why I begun it so she could have some one And and these others Miss Polly s voice shook now Oh ev rybody most knows it now I guess Anyhow I should think they did from the way I m hearin of it ev rywhere I go Of course she told a lot and they told the rest Them things go ye know when they gets started An she was always so smilin an pleasant ter ev ry one an so so jest glad herself all the time that they couldn t help knowin it anyhow Now since she s hurt ev rybody feels so bad specially when they heard how bad SHE feels cause she can t find anythin ter be glad about An so they ve been comin ev ry day ter tell her how glad she s made THEM hopin that ll help some Ye see she s always wanted ev rybody ter play the game with her Well I know somebody who ll play it now choked Miss Polly as she turned and sped through the kitchen doorway Behind her Nancy stood staring amazedly Well I ll believe anythin anythin now she muttered to herself Ye can t stump me with anythin I wouldn t believe now o Miss Polly A little later in Pollyanna s room the nurse left Miss Polly and Pollyanna alone together And you ve had still another caller to day my dear announced Miss Polly in a voice she vainly tried to steady Do you remember missus Payson missus Payson Why I reckon I do She lives on the way to mister Pendleton s and she s got the prettiest little girl baby three years old and a boy most five She s awfully nice and so s her husband only they don t seem to know how nice each other is Sometimes they fight I mean they don t quite agree They re poor too they say and of course they don t ever have barrels cause he isn t a missionary minister you know like well he isn t A faint color stole into Pollyanna s cheeks which was duplicated suddenly in those of her aunt But she wears real pretty clothes sometimes in spite of their being so poor resumed Pollyanna in some haste And she s got perfectly beautiful rings with diamonds and rubies and emeralds in them but she says she s got one ring too many and that she s going to throw it away and get a divorce instead What is a divorce Aunt Polly I m afraid it isn t very nice because she didn t look happy when she talked about it And she said if she did get it they wouldn t live there any more and that mister Payson would go way off and maybe the children too But I should think they d rather keep the ring even if they did have so many more Shouldn t you Aunt Polly what is a divorce But they aren t going way off dear evaded Aunt Polly hurriedly They re going to stay right there together Oh I m so glad Then they ll be there when I go up to see O dear broke off the little girl miserably Aunt Polly why CAN T I remember that my legs don t go any more and that I won t ever ever go up to see mister Pendleton again There there don t choked her aunt Perhaps you ll drive up sometime But listen I haven t told you yet all that missus Payson said She wanted me to tell you that they they were going to stay together and to play the game just as you wanted them to Pollyanna smiled through tear wet eyes Did they Did they really Oh I am glad of that Yes she said she hoped you d be That s why she told you to make you GLAD Pollyanna Pollyanna looked up quickly Why Aunt Polly you you spoke just as if you knew DO you know about the game Aunt Polly Yes dear Miss Polly sternly forced her voice to be cheerfully matter of fact Nancy told me I think it s a beautiful game I m going to play it now with you Oh Aunt Polly YOU I m so glad You see I ve really wanted you most of anybody all the time Aunt Polly caught her breath a little sharply It was even harder this time to keep her voice steady but she did it Yes dear and there are all those others too Why Pollyanna I think all the town is playing that game now with you even to the minister I haven t had a chance to tell you yet but this morning I met mister Ford when I was down to the village and he told me to say to you that just as soon as you could see him he was coming to tell you that he hadn t stopped being glad over those eight hundred rejoicing texts that you told him about So you see dear it s just you that have done it The whole town is playing the game and the whole town is wonderfully happier and all because of one little girl who taught the people a new game and how to play it Pollyanna clapped her hands Oh I m so glad she cried Then suddenly a wonderful light illumined her face Why Aunt Polly there IS something I can be glad about after all I can be glad I ve HAD my legs anyway else I couldn t have done that CHAPTER XXIX THROUGH AN OPEN WINDOW One by one the short winter days came and went but they were not short to Pollyanna They were long and sometimes full of pain Very resolutely these days however Pollyanna was turning a cheerful face toward whatever came Was she not specially bound to play the game now that Aunt Polly was playing it too And Aunt Polly found so many things to be glad about It was Aunt Polly too who discovered the story one day about the two poor little waifs in a snow storm who found a blown down door to crawl under and who wondered what poor folks did that didn t have any door And it was Aunt Polly who brought home the other story that she had heard about the poor old lady who had only two teeth but who was so glad that those two teeth hit Pollyanna now like missus Snow was knitting wonderful things out of bright colored worsteds that trailed their cheery lengths across the white spread and made Pollyanna again like missus Snow so glad she had her hands and arms anyway Pollyanna saw people now occasionally and always there were the loving messages from those she could not see and always they brought her something new to think about and Pollyanna needed new things to think about Once she had seen John Pendleton and twice she had seen Jimmy Bean John Pendleton had told her what a fine boy Jimmy was getting to be and how well he was doing Jimmy had told her what a first rate home he had and what bang up folks mister Pendleton made and both had said that it was all owing to her Which makes me all the gladder you know that I HAVE had my legs Pollyanna confided to her aunt afterwards The winter passed and spring came The anxious watchers over Pollyanna s condition could see little change wrought by the prescribed treatment There seemed every reason to believe indeed that doctor Mead s worst fears would be realized that Pollyanna would never walk again Beldingsville of course kept itself informed concerning Pollyanna and of Beldingsville one man in particular fumed and fretted himself into a fever of anxiety over the daily bulletins which he managed in some way to procure from the bed of suffering As the days passed however and the news came to be no better but rather worse something besides anxiety began to show in the man s face despair and a very dogged determination each fighting for the mastery In the end the dogged determination won and it was then that mister John Pendleton somewhat to his surprise received one Saturday morning a call from doctor Thomas Chilton Pendleton began the doctor abruptly I ve come to you because you better than any one else in town know something of my relations with Miss Polly Harrington John Pendleton was conscious that he must have started visibly he did know something of the affair between Polly Harrington and Thomas Chilton but the matter had not been mentioned between them for fifteen years or more Yes he said trying to make his voice sound concerned enough for sympathy and not eager enough for curiosity In a moment he saw that he need not have worried however the doctor was quite too intent on his errand to notice how that errand was received Pendleton I want to see that child I want to make an examination I MUST make an examination Well can t you CAN T I Pendleton you know very well I haven t been inside that door for more than fifteen years You don t know but I will tell you that the mistress of that house told me that the NEXT time she ASKED me to enter it I might take it that she was begging my pardon and that all would be as before which meant that she d marry me Perhaps you see her summoning me now but I don t But couldn t you go without a summons The doctor frowned Well hardly I have some pride you know But if you re so anxious couldn t you swallow your pride and forget the quarrel Forget the quarrel interrupted the doctor savagely I m not talking of that kind of pride So far as THAT is concerned I d go from here there on my knees or on my head if that would do any good It s PROFESSIONAL pride I m talking about It s a case of sickness and I m a doctor I can t butt in and say Here take me can I Chilton what was the quarrel demanded Pendleton The doctor made an impatient gesture and got to his feet What was it What s any lovers quarrel after it s over he snarled pacing the room angrily A silly wrangle over the size of the moon or the depth of a river maybe it might as well be so far as its having any real significance compared to the years of misery that follow them Never mind the quarrel So far as I am concerned I am willing to say there was no quarrel Pendleton I must see that child It may mean life or death It will mean I honestly believe nine chances out of ten that Pollyanna Whittier will walk again The words were spoken clearly impressively and they were spoken just as the one who uttered them had almost reached the open window near John Pendleton s chair Thus it happened that very distinctly they reached the ears of a small boy kneeling beneath the window on the ground outside Jimmy Bean at his Saturday morning task of pulling up the first little green weeds of the flowerbeds sat up with ears and eyes wide open Walk Pollyanna John Pendleton was saying What do you mean I mean that from what I can hear and learn a mile from her bedside that her case is very much like one that a college friend of mine has just helped For years he s been making this sort of thing a special study I ve kept in touch with him and studied too in a way And from what I hear but I want to SEE the girl John Pendleton came erect in his chair You must see her man Couldn t you say through doctor Warren The other shook his head I m afraid not Warren has been very decent though He told me himself that he suggested consultation with me at the first but Miss Harrington said no so decisively that he didn t dare venture it again even though he knew of my desire to see the child Lately some of his best patients have come over to me so of course that ties my hands still more effectually But Pendleton I ve got to see that child Think of what it may mean to her if I do Yes and think of what it will mean if you don t retorted Pendleton But how can I without a direct request from her aunt which I ll never get She must be made to ask you How I don t know No I guess you don t nor anybody else She s too proud and too angry to ask me after what she said years ago it would mean if she did ask me But when I think of that child doomed to lifelong misery and when I think that maybe in my hands lies a chance of escape but for that confounded nonsense we call pride and professional etiquette I He did not finish his sentence but with his hands thrust deep into his pockets he turned and began to tramp up and down the room again angrily But if she could be made to see to understand urged John Pendleton Yes and who s going to do it demanded the doctor with a savage turn I don t know I don t know groaned the other miserably Outside the window Jimmy Bean stirred suddenly Up to now he had scarcely breathed so intently had he listened to every word Well by Jinks I know he whispered exultingly I M a goin ter do it And forthwith he rose to his feet crept stealthily around the corner of the house and ran with all his might down Pendleton Hill CHAPTER XXX JIMMY TAKES THE HELM It s Jimmy Bean He wants ter see ye ma am announced Nancy in the doorway Me rejoined Miss Polly plainly surprised Are you sure he did not mean Miss Pollyanna He may see her a few minutes to day if he likes Yes m I told him But he said it was you he wanted Very well I ll come down And Miss Polly arose from her chair a little wearily In the sitting room she found waiting for her a round eyed flushed faced boy who began to speak at once Ma am I s pose it s dreadful what I m doin an what I m sayin but I can t help it It s for Pollyanna and I d walk over hot coals for her or face you or or anythin like that any time An I think you would too if you thought there was a chance for her ter walk again An so that s why I come ter tell ye that as long as it s only pride an et et somethin that s keepin Pollyanna from walkin why I knew you WOULD ask doctor Chilton here if you understood Wh at interrupted Miss Polly the look of stupefaction on her face changing to one of angry indignation Jimmy sighed despairingly There I didn t mean ter make ye mad That s why I begun by tellin ye about her walkin again I thought you d listen ter that Jimmy what are you talking about Jimmy sighed again That s what I m tryin ter tell ye Well then tell me But begin at the beginning and be sure I understand each thing as you go Don t plunge into the middle of it as you did before and mix everything all up Jimmy wet his lips determinedly Well ter begin with doctor Chilton come ter

going to cry But she did not cry After a minute she said brokenly Yes I ll let doctor Chilton see her Now run home Jimmy quick I ve got to speak to doctor Warren He s up stairs now I saw him drive in a few minutes ago A little later doctor Warren was surprised to meet an agitated flushed faced Miss Polly in the hall He was still more surprised to hear the lady say a little breathlessly doctor Warren you asked me once to allow doctor Chilton to be called in consultation and I refused Since then I have reconsidered I very much desire that you SHOULD call in doctor Chilton Will you not ask him at once please Thank you CHAPTER XXXI A NEW UNCLE The next time doctor Warren entered the chamber where Pollyanna lay watching the dancing shimmer of color on the ceiling a tall broad shouldered man followed close behind him doctor Chilton oh doctor Chilton how glad I am to see YOU cried Pollyanna And at the joyous rapture of the voice more than one pair of eyes in the room brimmed hot with sudden tears But of course if Aunt Polly doesn t want It is all right my dear don t worry soothed Miss Polly agitatedly hurrying forward I have told doctor Chilton that that I want him to look you over with doctor Warren this morning Oh then you asked him to come murmured Pollyanna contentedly Yes dear I asked him That is But it was too late The adoring happiness that had leaped to doctor Chilton s eyes was unmistakable and Miss Polly had seen it With very pink cheeks she turned and left the room hurriedly Over in the window the nurse and doctor Warren were talking earnestly doctor Chilton held out both his hands to Pollyanna Little girl I m thinking that one of the very gladdest jobs you ever did has been done to day he said in a voice shaken with emotion At twilight a wonderfully tremulous wonderfully different Aunt Polly crept to Pollyanna s bedside The nurse was at supper They had the room to themselves Pollyanna dear I m going to tell you the very first one of all Some day I m going to give doctor Chilton to you for your uncle And it s you that have done it all Oh Pollyanna I m so happy And so glad darling Pollyanna began to clap her hands but even as she brought her small palms together the first time she stopped and held them suspended Aunt Polly Aunt Polly WERE you the woman s hand and heart he wanted so long ago You were I know you were And that s what he meant by saying I d done the gladdest job of all to day I m so glad Why Aunt Polly I don t know but I m so glad that I don t mind even my legs now Aunt Polly swallowed a sob Perhaps some day dear But Aunt Polly did not finish Aunt Polly did not dare to tell yet the great hope that doctor Chilton had put into her heart But she did say this and surely this was quite wonderful enough to Pollyanna s mind Pollyanna next week you re going to take a journey On a nice comfortable little bed you re going to be carried in cars and carriages to a great doctor who has a big house many miles from here made on purpose for just such people as you are He s a dear friend of doctor Chilton s and we re going to see what he can do for you CHAPTER XXXII WHICH IS A LETTER FROM POLLYANNA Dear Aunt Polly and Uncle Tom Oh I can I can I CAN walk I did to day all the way from my bed to the window It was six steps My how good it was to be on legs again All the doctors stood around and smiled and all the nurses stood beside of them and cried A lady in the next ward who walked last week first peeked into the door and another one who hopes she can walk next month was invited in to the party and she laid on my nurse s bed and clapped her hands Even Black Tilly who washes the floor looked through the piazza window and called me Honey child when she wasn t crying too much to call me anything I don t see why they cried I wanted to sing and shout and yell Oh oh oh just think I can walk walk WALK Now I don t mind being here almost ten months and I didn t miss the wedding anyhow Wasn t that just
