PUTNAM S SONS eighteen eighty three X Y Z A STORY TOLD BY A DETECTIVE I THE MYSTERIOUS RENDEZVOUS Sometimes in the course of his experience a detective while engaged in ferreting out the mystery of one crime runs inadvertently upon the clue to another But rarely has this been done in a manner more unexpected or with attendant circumstances of greater interest than in the instance I am now about to relate For some time the penetration of certain Washington officials had been baffled by the clever devices of a gang of counterfeiters who had inundated the western portion of Massachusetts with spurious Treasury notes Some of the best talent of the Secret Service had been expended upon the matter but with no favorable result when one day notice was received at Washington that a number of suspicious looking letters addressed to the simple initials X Y Z Brandon Mass were being daily forwarded through the mails of that region and it being deemed possible that a clue had at last been offered to the mystery in hand I was sent northward to investigate It was in the middle of June eighteen eighty one and the weather was simply delightful As I stepped from the cars at Brandon and looked up the long straight street with its double row of maple trees sparkling fresh and beautiful in the noonday sun I thought I had never seen a prettier village or entered upon any enterprise with a lighter or more hopeful heart Intent on my task I went straight to the post office and after coming to an understanding with the postmaster proceeded at once to look over the mail addressed to the mysterious X Y Z I found it to consist entirely of letters They were about a dozen in number and were with one exception similar in general appearance and manner of direction though inscribed in widely different handwritings and posted from various New England towns The exception to which I allude had these few extra words written in the lower left hand corner of the envelope To be kept till called for As I bundled up the letters preparatory to thrusting them back into the box I noticed that the latter was the only one in a blue envelope all the others being in the various shades of cream color and buff Who is in the habit of calling for these letters I asked of the postmaster Well said he I don t know his name The fact is nobody knows him around here He usually drives up in a buggy about nightfall calls for letters addressed to X Y Z and having got them whips up his horse and is off again before one can say a word Describe him said I Well he is very lean and very lank In appearance he is both green and awkward His complexion is pale almost sickly Were it not for his eye which is keen and twinkling I should call him an extremely inoffensive looking person The type was not new to me I should like to see him said I You will have to wait till nightfall then returned the postmaster He never comes till about dusk Drop in here say at seven o clock and I will see that you have the opportunity of handing him his mail I nodded acquiescence to this and sauntered out of the enclosure devoted to the uses of the post office As I did so I ran against a young man who was hurriedly approaching from the other end of the store Your pardon he cried and I turned to look at him so gentlemanly was his tone and so easy the bow with which he accompanied this simple apology He was standing before the window of the post office waiting for his mail a good looking well made young man of a fine countenance but with a restless eye whose alert yet anxious expression I could not but note even in the casual glance I gave him There appeared to be some difficulty in procuring him his mail and each minute he was kept waiting seemed to increase his impatience almost beyond the bounds of endurance I saw him lean forward and gasp out a hurried word to the postmaster and was idly wondering over his anxiety and its probable causes when I heard a hasty exclamation near me and looking around saw the postmaster himself beckoning to me from the door of the enclosure I immediately hastened forward I don t know what it means he whispered but here is a young man different from any who have been here before asking for a letter addressed to X Y Z A letter I repeated Yes a letter Give him the whole batch and see what he does I returned drawing back where I could myself watch the result of my instructions The postmaster did as I requested In another moment I saw the young man start with amazement as a dozen letters were put in his hand These are not all for me he cried but even as he made the exclamation drew to one side and with a look of mingled perplexity and concern began opening them one after another his expression deepening to amazement as he glanced at their contents The one in the blue envelope however seemed to awaken quite different emotions With an unconscious look of relief he hastily read the short letter it contained then with a quick gesture folded it up and thrust it back into the envelope he held together with the other letters in his left hand There must be another X Y Z said he approaching the window of the post office and handing back all the letters he had received with the exception of the one in the blue envelope which with a quick movement he had separated from the rest and thrust into his coat pocket I can lay claim to none of these And with a repetition of his easy bow he turned away and hurriedly quitted the store followed by the eyes of clerks and customers to whom he was evidently as much of a stranger as he was to me Without hesitation I went to the door and looked after him He was just crossing the street to the tavern on the other side of the way I saw him enter felt that he was safe to remain there for a few minutes and conscious of the great opportunity awaiting me hastened back to the postmaster Well cried I in secret exultation our plan has worked admirably Let me see the letters As they have been opened and through no fault of ours a peep at them now in the cause of justice will harm none but the guilty The postmaster demurred but I soon overcame his scruples and taking down the letters once more hastily investigated their contents I own that I was considerably disappointed at the result In fact I found nothing that pointed toward the counterfeiters only in each letter a written address together with fifty cents worth of stamps Some common fraud I exclaimed One of those cheap affairs where for fifty cents enclosed a piece of information calculated to insure fortune to the recipient is promised by return of mail And disgusted with the whole affair I bundled up the letters and was about to replace them in the box for the third time when I discovered that it still held a folded paper Drawing this out I opened it and started in fresh amazement If I was not very much mistaken in the appearance of the letter in the blue envelope which I had seen the young man read with so much interest this was certainly it But how came it here Had I not seen him thrust it back into its envelope and afterward put envelope and all into his pocket But here was no envelope and here was the letter By what freak of necromancy had it been transferred from its legitimate quarters to this spot I could not imagine Suddenly I remembered that his hand had been full of the other letters when he put or endeavored to put this special one back into its envelope and however unaccountable it may seem it must be that from haste or agitation he had only succeeded in thrusting it between two letters instead of into the envelope as he supposed Whether or not this explanation be true there was no doubt about my luck being in the ascendant Mastering my satisfaction I read these lines written in what appeared to be a disguised hand All goes well The time has come every thing is in train and success is certain Be in the shrubbery at the northeast corner of the grounds at nine P M precisely you will be given a mask and such other means as are necessary to insure you the accomplishment of the end you have in view He cannot hold out against a surprise The word by which you will know your friends is COUNTERFEIT Ah ha thought I this is more like it And moved by a sudden impulse I hastily copied the letter into my memorandum book and then returning to the original scratched out with my penknife the word northeast and carefully substituting that of southwest put the letter back into the box in the hope that when he came to consult the envelope in his pocket as he would be sure to do sooner or later he would miss its contents and return to the post office in search of it Nor was I mistaken I had scarcely accomplished my task when he re entered the store asked to see the letters he had returned and finding amongst them the one he had lost disappeared with it back to the tavern If he is surprised to read southwest this time instead of northeast he will think his memory played him false in the first instance cried I in inward comment over my last doubtful stroke of policy and turning to the postmaster I asked him what place there was in the vicinity which could be said to possess grounds and a shrubbery There is but one he returned mister Benson s All the rest of the folks are too poor to indulge in any such gimcracks And who is mister Benson Well he is mister Benson the richest man in these parts and the least liked as I take it He came here from Boston two years ago and built a house fit for a king to live in Why nobody knows for he seems to take no pleasure in it His children do though and that is all he cares for I suppose Young mister Benson especially seems to be never tired of walking about the grounds looking at the trees and tying up the vines Miss Carrie is different all she wants is company But little of that has her father ever allowed her till this very day He seems to think nobody is good enough to sit down in his parlors and yet he don t sit there himself the strange man but is always shut up in his library or some other out of the way place A busy man I suppose so but no one ever sees any thing he does Writes perhaps I don t know he never talks about himself How did he get his money That we don t know It seems to accumulate without his help or interference When he came here he was called rich but to day he is said to be worth three times what he was then Perhaps he speculates If he does it must be through his son for he never leaves home himself Has two children you say Yes a son and a daughter a famous young man the son not so much liked perhaps as universally respected He is too severe and reticent to be a favorite but no one ever found him doing any thing unworthy of himself He is the pride of the county and if he were a bit suaver in manner might have been in Congress at this minute How old Thirty I should say And the girl Twenty five perhaps A mother living No there were some strange stories of her having died a year or so before they came here under circumstances of a somewhat distressing nature but they themselves say nothing about it It seems to me they don t say much about any thing That s just it they are the most reserved people you ever saw It isn t from them we have heard there is another son floating somewhere about the world They never speak of him and what s more they never write to him as who should know better than myself An interruption here occurred and I took the opportunity to saunter out into the crowd of idlers always to be found hanging around a country store at mail time My purpose was as you may conceive to pick up any stray bits of information that might be floating about concerning these Bensons Not that I had as yet discovered any thing definite connecting this respectable family with the gang of counterfeiters upon whose track I had been placed but business is business and no clue however slight or unpromising in its nature is to be neglected when the way is as dark as that which lay before me With an easy smile therefore calculated to allay apprehension and awaken confidence I took my stand among these loungers But I soon found that I need do nothing to start the wheel of gossip on the subject of the Bensons It was already going and that with a force and spirit that almost took my breath away A fancy ball were the first words I heard The Bensons give a fancy ball when they never had three persons at a time in their house before Yes and what s more they are going to have folks over from Clayton and Lawrence and Hollowell and devil knows where It s to be a smash up a regular fandango with masks and all that kind of nonsense They say Miss Carrie teased her father till he had to give in in self defence It s her birthday or something like that and she would have a party But such a party who ever heard the like in a respectable town like this It s wicked that s what I call it downright wicked to cover up the face God has given you and go strutting around in clothes a Christian man might well think borrowed from the Evil One if he had to wear them in any decent company All wrong I say all wrong and I am astonished at mister Benson To keep his doors shut as he has and then to open them in a burst to all sorts of folly We are not invited at our house Nor we nor we shouted some half dozen And I don t know of any one in this town who is cried a burly man presumably a butcher by trade We are not good enough for the Bensons They say he is even going to be mean enough to shut the gates and not let a soul inside who hasn t a ticket And they are going to light up the grounds too We can peep through the fence Much we will see that way If you had said climb it We can t climb it Big John is going to be there and Tom Henshaw They mean to keep their good times to themselves just as they have kept every thing else It s a queer set they are anyway and the less we have to do with them the better I should like to see Hartley Benson in masquerade costume I would Oh he won t wear any of the fol de rol he s too dignified And with that there fell a sudden hush over the crowd for which I was at a loss to account till upon looking up I saw approaching on horseback a young man in whom I had no difficulty in recognizing the subject of the last remark Straight slight elegant in appearance but with an undoubted reserve of manner apparent even at a distance he rode up to where I stood and casting a slight glance around bowed almost imperceptibly and alighted A boy caught the bridle of his horse and mister Benson without a word or further look passed quickly into the office leaving a silence behind him that was not disturbed till he returned with what was evidently his noonday mail Remounting his horse he stopped a moment to speak to a man who had just come up and I seized the opportunity to study his face I did not like it It was handsome without doubt the features were regular the complexion fair the expression gentlemanly if not commanding but I did not like it It was too impenetrable perhaps and to a detective anxious to probe a man for his motives this is ever a most fatal defect His smile was without sunshine his glance was an inquiry a rebuke a sarcasm every thing but a revelation As he rode away he carried with him the thought of all yet I doubt if the admiration he undoubtedly inspired was in a single case mixed with any warmer feeling than that of pride in a fellow townsman they could not understand Ice thought I ice in all but its transparency So much for Benson the son The ball was to take place that very night and the knowledge of this fact threw a different light over the letter I had read The word mask had no longer any special significance neither the word counterfeit and yet such was the tenor of the note itself and such the exaggerated nature of its phrases I could not but feel that some plot of a reprehensible if not criminal nature was in the process of formation which as a rising young detective engaged in a mysterious and elusive search it behooved me to know And moved by this consideration I turned to a new leaf in my memorandum book and put down in black and white the following facts thus summarily collected A mysterious family with a secret Rich but with no visible means of wealth Secluded with no apparent reason for the same A father who is a hermit A son who is impenetrable A daughter whose tastes are seldom gratified The strange fact of a ball being given by this family after years of reserve and non intercourse with their neighbors The still stranger fact of it being a masquerade a style of entertainment which from its novelty and the opportunities it affords makes this departure from ordinary rules seem marked and startling The discovery of a letter appointing a rendezvous between two persons of the male sex in the grounds of the party giving this ball in which the opportunities afforded by a masquerade are to be used for forwarding some long cherished scheme At the bottom of this I wrote a deduction Some connection between one or more members of this family giving the ball and the person called to the rendezvous the entertainment being used as a blind if not as a means It was now four o clock five hours before the time of rendezvous How should I employ the interval A glance at the livery stable hard by determined me Procuring a horse I rode out on the road toward mister Benson s for the purpose of reconnoitring the grounds but as I proceeded I was seized by an intense desire to penetrate into the midst of this peculiar household and judge for myself whether it was worth while to cherish any further suspicions in regard to this family But how to effect such an entrance What excuse could I give for my intrusion that would be likely to serve me on a day of such tumult and preoccupation I looked up and down the road as if for inspiration It did not come Meanwhile the huge trees that surrounded the house had loomed in sight and presently the beauties of lawn and parterre began to appear beyond the high iron fence through which I could catch now and then short glimpses of hurrying forms as lanterns were hung on the trees and all things put in readiness for the evening s entertainment Suddenly a thought struck me If mister Benson was the man they said he was not engaged in any of these arrangements mister Benson was a hermit Now what could I say that would interest a hermit I racked my brains a single idea came It was daring in its nature but what of that The gate must be passed mister Benson must be seen or so my adventurous curiosity decided and to do it something must be ventured Taking out my card which was simply inscribed with my name I wrote on it Business private and immediate and assuming my most gentlemanly and inoffensive manner rode calmly through the gate to the front of the house If I had been on foot I doubt if I would have been allowed to pass by the servant lounging about in that region but the horse carried me through in more senses than one and almost before I realized it I found myself pausing before the portico in full view of a dozen or more busy men and boys Imitating the manner of mister Benson at the post office I jumped from my horse and threw the bridle to the boy nearest me Instantly and before I could take a step a servant issued from the open door and with an expression of anxiety somewhat surprising under the circumstances took his stand before me in a way to hinder my advance mister Benson does not receive visitors to day said he I am not a visitor replied I I have business with mister Benson and I handed him my card which he looked at with a doubtful expression mister Benson s commands are not to be disobeyed persisted the man My master sees no one to day But this is an exceptional case I urged my curiosity rising at this unexpected opposition My business is important and concerns him He cannot refuse to see me The servant shook his head with what appeared to me to be an unnecessary expression of alarm but nevertheless retreated a step allowing me to enter I will call mister Hartley cried he But that was just what I did not wish It was Benson the father I had come to see and I was not to be baffled in this way mister Hartley won t do said I in my lowest but most determined accents If mister Benson is not ill I must beg to be admitted to his presence And stepping inside the small reception room at my right I sat down on the first chair I came to The man stood for a moment confounded at my pertinacity then with a last scrutinizing look that took in every detail of my person and apparel drew slowly off shaking his head and murmuring to himself Meanwhile the mingled splendor and elegance of my surroundings were slowly making their impression upon me The hall by which I had entered was spacious and imposing the room in which I sat a model of beauty in design and finish I was allowing myself the luxury of studying its pictures and numerous works of art when the sound of voices reached my ear from the next room A man and woman were conversing there in smothered tones but my senses are very acute and I had no difficulty in overhearing what was said Oh what an exciting day this has been cried the female voice I have wanted to ask you a dozen times what you think of it all Will he succeed this time Has he the nerve to embrace his opportunity or what is more the tact to make one Failure now would be fatal Father Hush broke in the other voice in a masculine tone of repressed intensity Do not forget that success depends upon your prudence One whisper of what you are about and the whole scheme is destroyed I will be careful only do you think that all is going well and as we planned it It will not be my fault if it does not was the reply uttered with an accent so sinister I was conscious of a violent surprise when in the next instant the other with a burst of affectionate fervor cried in an ardent tone Oh how good you are and what a comfort you are to me I was just pondering over the incongruity thus presented when the servant returned with my card mister Benson wishes to know the nature of your business said he in a voice I was uncomfortably conscious must penetrate to the next room and awake its inmates to a knowledge of my proximity Let me have the card said I and taking it I added to my words the simple phrase On behalf of the Constable of the town remembering I had heard the postmaster say this position was held by his brother There said I carry that back to your master The servant took the card glanced down at the words I had written started and hastily drew back You had better come said he leading the way into the hall I was only too glad to comply in fact escape from that room seemed imperative But just as I was crossing the threshold a sudden quick cry half joyful half fearful rose behind me and turning I met the eyes of a young lady peering upon me from a lifted portiere with an expression of mingled terror and longing that would have astonished me greatly if it had not instantly disappeared at the first sight of my face Pardon me she exclaimed drawing back with an embarrassed movement into the room from which she had emerged But soon recovering herself she stepped hastily forward and ignoring me said to the servant at my side Jonas who is this gentleman and where are you taking him With a bow Jonas replied He comes on business miss and mister Benson consents to see him But I thought my father had expressly commanded that no one was to be allowed to enter the library to day she exclaimed but in a musing tone that asked for no response And hastily as we passed down the hall I could not escape the uneasy sense that her eager eyes were following us as we went Too much emotion for so small a matter and a strange desire on the part of every one to keep mister Benson from being intruded upon to day was my mental comment And I was scarcely surprised when upon our arrival at the library door we found it locked However a knock followed by a few whispered words on the part of the servant served to arouse the hermit within and with a quick turn of the key the door flew back on its hinges and the master of the house stood before me It was a moment to be remembered first because the picture presented to my eyes was of a marked and impressive character and secondly because something in the expression of the gentleman before me showed that he had received a shock at my introduction which was not to be expected after the pains which had been taken to prepare his mind for my visit He was a tall remarkable looking man with a head already whitened and a form which if not bowed had only retained its upright carriage by means of the indomitable will that betrayed itself in his eyes Seen against the rich background of the stained glass window that adorned one end of the apartment his stern furrowed face and eagerly repellant aspect imprinted itself upon me like a silhouette while the strong emotion I could not but detect in his bearing lent to the whole a poetic finish that made it a living picture which as I have said I have never been able to forget You have come from the constable of the town said he in a firm hard tone impressive as his look May I ask for what purpose Looking around I saw the servant had disappeared Sir said I gathering up my courage as I became convinced that in this case I had a thoroughly honest man to deal with you are going to give a fancy ball to night Such an event is a novelty in these parts and arouses much curiosity Some of the men about town have even been heard to threaten to leap the fences and steal a look at your company whether you will or not mister White wants to know whether you need any assistance in keeping the grounds clear of all but your legitimate guests if so he is ready to supply whatever force you may need mister White is very kind returned mister Benson in a voice which despite his will power showed that his agitation had in some unaccountable way been increased by my communication I had not thought of any such contingency he murmured moving over to a window and looking out An invasion of rowdies would not be agreeable They might even find their way into the house He paused and cast a sudden look at me Who are you he abruptly asked The question took me by surprise but I answered bravely if not calmly I am a man who sometimes assists mister White in the performance of his duties and in case you need it will be the one to render you assistance to night A line to mister White if you doubt me A wave of his meagre hand stopped me Do you think you could keep out of my house to night any one I did not wish to enter he asked I should at least like to try A ticket is given to every invited guest but if men are going to climb the fences tickets will amount to but little I will see that the fences are guarded cried I gratified at the prospect of being allowed upon the scene of action I can hinder any one from coming in that way if Here I paused conscious of something I could hardly say what that bade me be cautious and weigh my words well If you desire it and will give me the authority to act for you I added in a somewhat more indifferent tone I do desire it he replied shortly moving over to the table and taking up a card Here is a ticket that will insure you entrance into the grounds the rest you will manage without scandal I do not want any disturbance but if you see any one hanging about the house or peering into the windows or attempting to enter in any way except through the front door you are to arrest them no matter who they are I have an especial reason for desiring my wishes attended to in this regard he went on not noticing the preoccupation that had seized me and will pay well if on the morrow I find that every thing has gone off according to my desires Money is a powerful incentive to duty I rejoined with marked emphasis directing a sly glance at the mirror opposite in whose depths I had but a moment before been startled by the sudden apparition of the pale and strongly agitated face of young mister Benson who was peering from a door way half hidden by a screen at our back I will be on hand to night And with what I meant to be a cynical look I made my bow and disappeared from the room As I expected I was met at the front door by mister Hartley A word with you said he Jonas tells me you are from the constable of the town May I ask what has gone amiss that you come here to disturb my father on a day like this His tone was not unkind his expression not without suavity If I had not had imprinted on my memory the startling picture of his face as I had seen it an instant before in the mirror I should have been tempted to believe in his goodness and integrity at this moment As it was I doubted him through and through yet replied with frankness and showed him the ticket I had received from his father And you are going to make it your business to guard the grounds to night he asked gloomily glancing at the card in my hand as if he would like to annihilate it Yes said I He drew me into a small room half filled with plants Now said he see here Such a piece of interference is entirely uncalled for and you have been alarming my father unnecessarily There are no rowdies in this town and if one or two of the villagers should get into the grounds where is the harm They cannot get into the house even if they wanted to which they don t I do not wish this our first show of hospitality to assume a hostile aspect and whatever my father s expectations may be I must request you to curtail your duties as much as possible and limit them to responding by your presence when called upon But your father has a right to expect the fullest obedience to his wishes I protested He would not be satisfied if I should do no more than you request and I cannot afford to disappoint him He looked at me with a calculating eye and I expected to see him put his hand in his pocket but Hartley Benson played his cards better than that Very well said he if you persist in regarding my father s wishes as paramount I have nothing to say Fulfil your duties as you conceive them but don t look for my support if any foolish misadventure makes you ashamed of yourself And drawing back he motioned me out of the room I felt I had received a check and hurried out of the house But scarcely had I entered upon the walk that led down to the gate when I heard a light step behind me Turning I encountered the pretty daughter of the house the youthful Miss Carrie Wait she cried allowing herself to display her emotion freely in face and bearing I have heard who you are from my brother she continued approaching me with a soft grace that at once put me upon my guard Now tell me who are the rowdies that threaten to invade our grounds I do not know their names miss I responded but they are a rough looking set you would not like to see among your guests There are no very rough looking men in our village she declared you must be mistaken in regard to them My father is nervous and easily alarmed It was wrong to arouse his fears I thought of that steady eye of his of force sufficient to hold in awe a regiment of insurgents and smiled at her opinion of my understanding Then you do not wish the grounds guarded I said in as indifferent a tone as I could assume I do not consider it necessary But I have already pledged myself to fulfil your father s commands I know she said drawing a step nearer with a most enchanting smile And that was right under the circumstances but we his children who may be presumed to know more of social matters than a recluse I especially she added with a certain emphasis tell you it is not necessary We fear the scandal it may cause besides some of the guests may choose to linger about the grounds under the trees and would be rather startled at being arrested as intruders What then do you wish me to do I asked leaning toward her with an appearance of yielding To accept this money she murmured blushing and confine yourself to night to remaining in the background unless called upon This was a seconding of her brother s proposition with a vengeance Taking the purse she handed me I weighed it for a moment in my hand and then slowly shook my head Impossible I cried but and I fixed my eyes intently upon her countenance if there is any one in particular whom you desire me to ignore I am ready to listen to a description of his person It has always been my pleasure to accommodate myself as much as possible to the whims of the ladies It was a bold stroke that might have cost me the game Indeed I half expected she would raise her voice and order some of the men about her to eject me from the grounds But instead of that she remained for a moment blushing painfully but surveying me with an unfaltering gaze that reminded me of her father s There is a person said she in a low restrained voice whom I am especially anxious should remain unmolested whatever he may or may not be seen to do He is a guest she went on a sudden pallor taking the place of her blushes and has a right to be here but I doubt if he at once enters the house and I even suspect he may choose to loiter awhile in the grounds before attempting to join the company I ask you to allow him to do so I bowed with an appearance of great respect Describe him said I For a moment she faltered with a distressed look I found it difficult to understand Then with a sudden glance over my person exclaimed Look in the glass when you get home and you will see the fac simile of his form though not of his face He is fair whereas you are dark And with a haughty lift of her head calculated to rob me of any satisfaction I might have taken in her words she stepped slowly back I stopped her with a gesture Miss said I take your purse before you go Payment of any service I may render your father will come in time This affair is between you and me and I hope I am too much of a gentleman to accept money for accommodating a lady in so small a matter as this But she shook her head Take it said she and assure me that I may rely on you You may rely on me without the money I replied forcing the purse back into her hand Then I shall rest easy she returned and retreated with a lightsome air toward the house The next moment I was on the highway with my thoughts What did it all mean Was it then a mere love affair across which I had foolishly stumbled and was I busying myself unnecessarily about a rendezvous that might mean no more than an elopement from under a severe father s eye Taking out the note which had led to all these efforts on my part I read it for the third time All goes well The time has come every thing is in train and success is certain Be in the shrubbery at the northeast corner of the grounds at nine P M precisely you will be given a mask and such other means as are necessary to insure you the accomplishment of the end you have in view He cannot hold out against a surprise The word by which you will know your friends is COUNTERFEIT A love letter of course and I had been a fool to suppose it any thing else The young people are to surprise the old gentleman in the presence of their friends They have been secretly married perhaps who knows and take this method of obtaining a public reconciliation But that word Counterfeit and the sinister tone of Hartley Benson as he said It shall not fail through lack of effort on my part Such a word and such a tone did not rightly tally with this theory Few brothers take such interest in their sister s love affairs as to grow saturnine over them There was beneath all this something which I had not yet penetrated Meantime my duty led me to remain true to the one person of whose integrity of purpose I was most thoroughly convinced Returning to the village I hunted up mister White and acquainted him with what I had undertaken in his name and then perceiving that the time was fast speeding by strolled over to the tavern for my supper The stranger was still there walking up and down the sitting room He joined us at the table but I observed he scarcely tasted his food and both then and afterward manifested the same anxious suspense that had characterized his movements from the time of our first encounter II THE BLACK DOMINO At half past eight I was at my post The mysterious stranger still under my direct surveillance had already entered the grounds and taken his stand in the southwest corner of the shrubbery thereby leaving me free to exercise my zeal in keeping the fences and gates free of intruders At nine the guests were nearly if not all assembled and promptly at the hour mentioned in the note so often referred to I stole away from my post and hid myself amid the bushes that obscured the real place of rendezvous It was a retired spot eminently fitted for a secret meeting The lamps which had been hung in profusion through the grounds had been studiously excluded from this quarter Even the broad blaze of light that poured from the open doors and windows of the brilliantly illuminated mansion sent no glimmer through the broad belt of evergreens that separated this retreat from the open lawn beyond All was dark all was mysterious all was favorable to the daring plan I had undertaken In silence I awaited the sound of approaching steps My suspense was of short duration In a few moments I heard a low rustle in the bushes near me then a form appeared before my eyes and a man s voice whispered Is there any one here My reply was to glide quietly into view Instantly he spoke again this time with more assurance Are you ready for a counterfeit I am ready for any thing I returned in smothered tones hoping by thus disguising my voice to lure him into a revelation of the true purpose of this mysterious rendezvous But instead of the explanations I expected the person before me made a quick movement and I felt a domino thrown over my shoulders Draw it about you well he murmured there are lynx eyes in the crowd to night And while I mechanically obeyed he bent down to my ear and earnestly continued Now listen and be guided by my instructions You will not be able to enter by the front door as it is guarded and you cannot pass without removing your mask But the window on the left hand balcony is at your service It is open and the man appointed to keep intruders away has been bribed to let you pass Once inside the house join the company sans ceremonie and do not hesitate to converse with any one who addresses you by the countersign Promptly at ten o clock look around you for a domino in plain black When you see him move follow him but with discretion so that you may not seem to others to be following Sooner or later he will pause and point to a closed door Notice that door and when your guide has disappeared approach and enter it without fear or hesitation You will find yourself in a small apartment connecting with the library There is but one thing more to say If the wineglass you will observe on the library table smells of wine you may know your father has had his nightly potion and gone to bed But if it contains nothing more than a small white powder you may be certain he has yet to return to the library and that by waiting you will have the long wished for opportunity of seeing him And pausing for no reply my strange companion suddenly thrust a mask into my hand and darted from the circle of trees that surrounded us For a moment I stood dumbfounded at the position in which my recklessness had placed me All the folly the impertinence even of the proceeding upon which I had entered was revealed to me in its true colors and I mentally inquired what could have induced me to thus hamper myself with the details of a mystery so entirely removed from the serious matter I had in charge Resolved to abandon the affair I made a hasty attempt to disengage myself from the domino in which I had been so unceremoniously enveloped But invisible hands seemed to restrain me A vivid remembrance of the tone in which these final instructions had been uttered returned to my mind and while I recognized the voice as that of Hartley Benson I also recognized the almost saturnine intensity of expression which had once before imbued his words with a significance both forcible and surprising The secret if a purely family one was of no ordinary nature and at the thought I felt my old interest revive All the excuses with which I had hitherto silenced my conscience recurred to me with fresh force and mechanically donning my mask I prepared to follow out my guide s instructions to the last detail The window to which I had been directed stood wide open Through it came the murmur of music and the hum of gay voices Visions of a motley crowd decked in grotesque costumes passed constantly before my eyes Sight and sound combined to allure me Hurrying to the window I stepped carelessly in A low guttural Hugh at once greeted me It was from a mask in full Indian costume whom I saw leaning with a warrior s well known dignity against the embrasure of the window by which I had entered Giving him a scrutinizing glance I came to the conclusion he was a young and not inelegant man and impelled by a reasonable curiosity as to how I looked myself I cast my eyes down upon my own person I found my appearance sufficiently striking The domino in which I was wrapped was of a brilliant yellow hue covered here and there with black figures representing all sorts of fantastic creatures from hobgoblins of a terrible type to merry Kate Greenaway silhouettes Humph thought I it seems I am not destined to glide unnoticed amid the crowd The first person who approached me was a gay little shepherdess Ah ha was the sportive exclamation with which she greeted me Here is one of my wandering sheep And with a laugh she endeavored to hook me to her side by means of her silver crook But this blithesome puppet possessed no interest for me So with a growl and a bound I assured her I was nothing more than a wolf in sheep s clothing and would eat her up if she did not run away at which she gayly laughed and vanished and for a moment I was left alone But only for a moment A masked lady whom I had previously observed standing upright and solitary in a distant corner of the room now approached and taking me by the arm led me eagerly to one side Oh Joe she whispered is it you How glad I am to have you here and how I hope we are going to be happy at last Fearing to address a person seemingly so well acquainted with the young man whose place I had usurped I merely pressed with most perfidious duplicity the little hand that was so confidingly clasped in mine It seemed to satisfy her for she launched at once into ardent speech Oh Joe I have been so anxious to have you with us once again Hartley is a good brother but he is not my old playmate Then father will be so much happier if you only succeed in making him forget the past Seeing by this that it was Miss Carrie Benson with whom I had to deal I pressed the little hand again and tenderly drew her closer to my side That I felt all the time like a villain of the blackest dye it is quite unnecessary for me to state Has Hartley told you just what you are to do was her next remark Father is very determined not to relent and has kept himself locked in his library all day for fear you should force yourself upon his presence I could never have gained his consent to give this ball if I had not first persuaded him it would serve as a means to keep you at a distance that if you saw the house thronged with guests natural modesty would restrain you from pushing yourself forward I think he begins to distrust his own firmness He fears he will melt at the sight of you He has been failing this last year and A sudden choke stopped her voice I was at once both touched and alarmed touched at the grief which showed her motives to be pure and good and alarmed at the position in which I had thrust myself to the apparent detriment of these same laudable motives Moved by a desire to right matters I ventured to speak And do you think I whispered in purposely smothered accents that if he sees me he will relent I am sure of it He yearns over you Joe and if he had not sworn never to speak to you again he would have sent for you long ago Hartley believes as well as I that the time for reconciliation has come And is Hartley I ventured again not without a secret fear of the consequences really anxious for reconciliation Oh Joe can you doubt it Has he not striven from the first to make father forget Would he encourage you to come here to night furnish you with a disguise and consent to act both as your champion and adviser if he did not want to see you and father friends again You don t understand Hartley you never have You would not have repelled his advances so long if you had realized how truly he had forgiven every thing and forgotten it Hartley has the pride of a person who has never done wrong himself But even pride gives way before brotherly affection and you have suffered so much and so long poor Joe So so thought I Joe is then the aggressor And for a moment I longed to be the man I represented if only to clasp this dear little sister in my arms and thank her for her goodness You are a darling I faintly articulated inwardly determined to rush forthwith into the garden hand over my domino to the person for whom it was intended and make my escape from a scene which I had so little right to enjoy But at this instant an interruption occurred which robbed me of my companion but kept me effectually in my place A black domino swept by us dragging Miss Benson from my side while at the same time a harsh voice whispered in my ear To counterfeit wrong when one is right necessarily opens one to misunderstanding I started recognizing in this mode of speech a friend and therefore one from whom I could not escape without running the risk of awakening suspicion That is true I returned hoping by my abrupt replies to cut short this fresh colloquy and win a speedy release But something in my answer roused the interest of the person at my side and caused a display of emotion that led to quite an opposite result from what I desired You awaken a thousand conjectures in my mind by that reply exclaimed my friend edging me a little farther back from the crowd I have always had my doubts about about he paused hunting for the proper phrase about your having done what they said he somewhat lamely concluded It was so unlike you But now I begin to see the presence of a possibility that might perhaps explain much we never understood Joe my boy you never said you were innocent but Who are you I asked boldly peering into the twinkling eyes that shone upon me from his sedate mask In the discussion of such matters as these it would be dreadful to make a mistake And don t you recognize your Uncle Joe he asked with a certain plaintive reproach somewhat out of keeping with his costume of potent grave and reverend signior I came over from Hollowell on purpose because Carrie intimated that you were going to make one final effort to see your father Edith is here too he murmured thrusting his face alarmingly near mine She would not stay away though we were all afraid she might betray herself her emotions are so quick Poor child she never doubted you and if my suspicions are correct Edith I interrupted Edith An Edith was the last person I desired to meet under these circumstances Where is she I tremulously inquired starting aside in some dismay at the prospect of encountering this unknown quantity of love and devotion But my companion seizing me by the arm drew me back She is not far away of that you may be sure But it will never do for you to try and hunt her up You would not know her in her mask Besides if you remain still she will come to you That was just what I feared but upon looking round and seeing no suspicious looking damsel anywhere near me I concluded to waive my apprehensions on her account and proceed to the development of an idea that had been awakened by the old gentleman s words You are right I acquiesced edging in my turn toward the curtained recess of a window near by Let us wait here and meantime you shall tell me what your suspicions are for I feel the time has come for the truth to be made known and who could better aid me in proclaiming it than you who have always stood my friend That is true he murmured all eagerness at once Then in a lower tone and with a significant gesture There is something then which has never been made known Edith was right when she said you did not steal the bonds out of your father s desk As he paused and looked me in the face I was obliged to make some reply I chose one of the non committal sort Don t ask me I murmured turning away with every appearance of profound agitation He did not suspect the ruse But my boy I shall have to ask you if I am to help you out of this scrape I must know the truth Yet if it is as I suspect I can see why you should hesitate even now You are a generous fellow Joe but even generosity can be carried past its proper limits Uncle I exclaimed leaning over him and whispering tremulously in his ear what are your suspicions If I hear you give utterance to them perhaps it will not be so hard for me to speak He hesitated looked all about us with a questioning glance put his mouth to my ear and whispered If I should use the name of Hartley in connection with what I have to say would you be so very much surprised With a quick semblance of emotion I drew back You think I tremulously commenced and as suddenly broke off That it was he who did it and that you knowing how your father loved him and built his hopes upon him bore the blame of it yourself Ha I exclaimed with a deep breath as of relief The suspicions of Uncle Joe were worth hearing He seemed to be satisfied with the ejaculation and with an increase of eagerness in his tone went quickly on Am I not right my boy Is not this the secret of your whole conduct from that dreadful day to this Don t ask me I again pleaded taking care however to draw a step nearer and exclaim in almost the same breath Why should you think it must necessarily have been one of us What did you know that you should be so positive it was either he or I who committed this dishonest action What did I know Why what everybody else did That your father hearing a noise in his study one night rose up quietly and slipped to the door of communication in time to hear a stealthy foot leave the room and proceed down the hall toward the apartment usually occupied by you and your brother that alarmed and filled with vague distrust he at once lit the lamp only to discover his desk had been forcibly broken into and a number of coupon bonds taken out that struck to the heart he went immediately to the room where you and your brother lay found him lying quiet and to all appearance asleep while you looked flushed and with difficulty met his eye that without hesitation he thereupon accused you of theft and began to search the apartment that he found the bonds as we both know in a cupboard at the head of your bed and when you were asked if you had put them there you remained silent and neither then nor afterward made any denial of being the one who stole them A mournful Yes was all the reply I ventured upon Now it never seemed to occur to your father to doubt your guilt The open window and the burglar s jimmy found lying on the floor of the study being only so many proofs to his mind of your deep calculation and great duplicity But I could not help thinking even on that horrible morning that your face did not wear a look of guilt so much as it did that of firm and quiet resolution But I was far from suspecting the truth my boy or I should never have allowed you to fall a victim to your father s curse and be sent forth like a criminal from home and kindred If only for Edith s sake I would have spoken dear trusting faithful girl that she is But but I brokenly ejaculated anxious to gain as much of the truth as was possible in the few minutes allotted me what has awakened your suspicions at this late day Why should you doubt Hartley now if you did not then Well I cannot really say Perhaps Edith s persistent aversion to your brother has had something to do with it Then he has grown cold and hard while you have preserved your boyish freshness and affection I I don t like him that is the truth and with my dislike arose doubts and and well I cannot tell how it is but I will believe you if you say he was the one to blame in this matter and what is more your father will believe you too for he does not feel the same satisfaction in Hartley s irreproachable character that he used to and and A sudden movement in the crowd stopped him A tall graceful looking woman clad entirely in white had just entered the room and seemed to be making her way toward us There is Edith he declared She is hunting for the yellow domino ornamented with black that she has been told conceals her lover Shall I go and fetch her here or will you wait until she spies you of her own accord I will wait I uneasily replied edging nearer to the window with the determination of using it as a means of escape if my companion only gave me the chance See she is in the hands of an old Jew who seems to be greatly taken with the silver trimmings on her sleeves Suppose you improve the opportunity to slip away I laughingly suggested Lovers meetings are not usually of an order to interest third parties Aren t they you rogue retorted the old gentleman giving me a jocose poke in the ribs Well well I suppose you are right But you have not told me I will tell you every thing in an hour I hastily assured him I am going to meet my father in the library and after he has heard the truth you shall be admitted and all will be explained That is only fair he replied Your father has the first rights of course But Joe my boy remember I am not over and above patient of disposition and don t keep me waiting too long And with an affectionate squeeze of my hand he stepped out from the recess where we stood and made his way once more into the throng No sooner had he left my side than I threw up the window Now is the time for the real Joe to appear upon the scene was my mental decision I have done for him what he as a gentleman would probably never do for himself pumped this old party and got every thing in trim for Hartley s discomfiture But the courting business is another matter also the interview with the outraged father in the library That cannot be done by proxy so here goes for a change of actors And with reckless disregard of consequences I prepared to jump from the window when a sudden light flashed over the lawn beneath and I saw I was at least twelve feet from the ground Well I exclaimed drawing hastily back such a leap as that is too much to expect of any man And with the humiliating consciousness of being caught in a trap I proceeded to close the window Joe Twas a low whisper but how thrilling Turning I greeted with the show of fervor I considered necessary to the occasion the white veiled lady who had glided into my retreat Did you think I was never coming Joe Everybody who could get in my way certainly managed to do so Then Hartley is so suspicious and followed me with his eyes so persistently I did not dare show my designs too plainly It is only this minute he left my side If you had been anywhere else I do not know as I should have succeeded even now in getting a word with you oh This exclamation was called forth by a sudden movement that took place near us The curtain was drawn back and a tall man dressed in a black domino glanced in gave us a scrutinizing look bowed and dropped the curtain again Hartley she whisperingly explained I took her by the hand there was no help for it gesture and a lover like demeanor must in this case supply the place of speech Hush she entreated Not that I had spoken I dare not stay When you have seen your father perhaps I will have courage to join you but now it would be better for me to go And her eyes roamed toward the curtain while the little hand I held in mine grew cold and slightly trembled I pressed that little hand but as you may well believe did not urge her to remain Yet she did not seem in a hurry to depart and I do not know what complications might have ensued if another movement in the curtain had not reawakened her fears and caused her notwithstanding her evident reluctance to start quickly away I did not linger long behind her Scarcely had the curtain fallen from her hand than I stepped hastily forth But alas for my hopes of escape No sooner had I joined the group of merry makers circling about the open door than I felt a touch on my arm and looking up saw before me the Black Domino The hour of ten had struck and my guide to the library was at hand There was no alternative left me but to follow him III AN UNEXPECTED CALAMITY Five minutes passed during which I threaded more laughing groups and sauntered down more mysterious passage ways than I would care to count Still the mysterious Black Domino glided on before me leading me from door to door till my patience was nearly exhausted and I had well nigh determined to give him the slip and make my way at once to the garden and the no doubt by this time highly impatient Joe But before I had the opportunity of carrying out this scheme the ominous Black Domino paused and carelessly pointing to a door at the termination of a narrow corridor bowed and hastily withdrew Now said I as soon as I found myself alone shall I proceed with this farce or shall I end it To go on means to interview mister Benson acquaint him with what has come to my knowledge during the last half hour in which I have so successfully personified his son and by these means perhaps awake him to the truth concerning this serious matter of Joseph s innocence or Hartley s guilt while to stop now implies nothing more nor less than a full explanation with his son a man of whose character manners and disposition I know little or nothing Either alternative presented infinite difficulties but of the two the former seemed to me more feasible and less embarrassing At all events in talking with mister Benson I should not have the sensibilities of a lover to contend with and however unfortunate in its results our interview might be would be at the mercy of old blood instead of young a point always to be considered in a case where one s presumption has been carried beyond the bounds of decorum Unlocking the door I stepped as I had been told I should into a small room adjoining the library All around me were books Even the door by which I had entered was laden with them so that when it was closed all vestige of the door itself disappeared Across the opening into the library stood a screen and it was not until I had pushed this somewhat aside that I was able to look into that room My first glance assured me it was empty Stark and bare of any occupant the high backed chairs loomed in the funereal gloom while on the table toward which I inadvertently glanced stood a decanter with a solitary wineglass at its side Instantly I remembered what had been told me concerning that glass and stepping forward I took it up and looked at it Immediately I heard or thought I heard an exclamation uttered somewhere near me But upon glancing up and down the room and perceiving no one I concluded I was mistaken and deliberately proceeded to examine the wineglass and assure myself that no wine had as yet been poured upon the powder I found in it Satisfied at last that mister Benson had not yet taken his usual evening potion I put the glass back and withdrew again to my retreat I do not think another minute could have elapsed before I heard a step in the room behind me A door leading into an adjoining apartment had opened and mister Benson had come in He passed immediately to the table poured out the wine upon the powder and drank it off without a moment s hesitation I heard him sigh as he put the glass down With a turn of my hand I slipped off both domino and mask and prepared to announce my presence by tapping on the lintel of the door beside which I stood But a sudden change in mister Benson s lofty figure startled me He was swaying and the arms which had fallen to his side were moving with a convulsive action that greatly alarmed me But almost instantly he recovered himself and paced with a steady step toward the hall door which at that moment resounded with a short loud knock Who is there he asked with every appearance of his usual sternness Hartley was the reply Are you alone the old gentleman again queried making a move as if to unlock the door Carrie is with me no one else came in smothered accents from without mister Benson at once turned the key but no sooner had he done so than he staggered back For an instant or two of horror he stood oscillating from side to side then his frame succumbed and the terrified eyes of his children beheld his white head lying low all movement and appearance of life gone from the form that but a moment before towered so proudly before them With a shriek the daughter flung herself down at his side and even the cheek of Hartley Benson grew white as he leaned over his father s already inanimate body He is dead came in a wild cry from her lips See he does not breathe Oh Hartley what could have happened Do you think that Joe Hush he exclaimed with a furtive glance around him He may be here let me look If Joe has done this He did not continue but rose and with a rapid tread began to cross the floor in my direction In a flash I realized my situation To be found by him now without a domino and in the position of listener would be any thing but desirable But I knew of no way of escape or so for the moment it seemed But great emergencies call forth sudden resources In the quick look I inadvertently threw around me I observed that the portiere hanging between me and the library was gathered at one side in very heavy folds If I could hide behind them perhaps I might elude the casual glance he would probably cast into my place of concealment At all events it was worth trying and at the thought I glided behind the curtain I was not disappointed in my calculations Arrived at the door he looked in perceived the domino lying in a heap on the floor and immediately drew back with an exclamation of undoubted satisfaction He is gone said he crossing back to his sister s side Then in a tone of mingled irony and bitterness hard to describe cried aloud with a glance toward the open door He has first killed his father and then fled Fool that I was to think he could be trusted A horrified Hartley burst from his sister s lips and a suppressed but equally vehement Villain from mine but neither of us had time for more for almost at the same instant the room filled with frightened guests among which I discerned the face and form of the old servant Jonas and the flowing robes and the white garments of Uncle Joe and the graceful Edith To describe the confusion that followed would be beyond my powers especially as my attention was at the time not so much directed to the effect produced by this catastrophe as to the man whom from the moment mister Benson fell to the floor I regarded as my lawful prey He did not quake and lose his presence of mind in this terrible crisis He was gifted with too much self control to betray any unseemly agitation even over such a matter as his father s sudden death Once only did I detect his lip tremble and that was when an elderly gentleman presumably a doctor exclaimed after a careful examination of the fallen man This is no case of apoplexy gentlemen Then indeed mister Hartley Benson shivered and betrayed an emotion for which I considered myself as receiving a due explanation when a few minutes later I observed the same gentleman lay his hand upon the decanter and glass that stood on the table and after raising them one after the other to his nose slowly shake his head and with a furtive look around him lock them both in a small cupboard that opened over the mantel piece IV IN THE LIBRARY mister Benson was really dead The fact being announced most of the guests withdrew In ten minutes after he fell the room was comparatively clear Only the various members of the family together with the gentleman I have already mentioned remained behind and even of these the two ladies were absent they having followed the body into the adjoining room where it had been reverently carried by the attached Jonas and another servant whose face I did not see A most unlooked for catastrophe burst from the lips of Uncle Joe Did you ever suspect he was a victim to heart disease he now asked this time with looks directed toward the doctor No came from that gentleman in a short sharp way which made Hartley Benson s pale face flush though his eye did not waver from its steady solemn look toward the door through which his father s form had just been carried mister Benson was sound through and through a month ago I know because I examined him previous to his making his will There was no heart disease then that I am ready to take my oath upon Hartley Benson s rigid look unfastened itself from the door and turned slowly toward the sombre face of the speaker while Uncle Joe with an increased expression of distress looked slowly around as if he half hoped half feared to behold his favorite nephew advance upon them from some shadowy corner My father consulted you then said the former in his slow reserved way Did not that evince some suspicion of disease on his part Possibly a man in a despondent frame of mind will often imagine he has some deadly complaint or other But he was quite sound too sound he seemed to think Your father was not a happy man mister Benson There was meaning in the tone and I was not surprised to observe Hartley draw back Why said he do you think I think nothing broke in the doctor only and here he brought down his hand vigorously upon the table there has been prussic acid in the glass from which mister Benson drank this evening The smell of bitter almonds is not to be mistaken An interval of silent horror followed this announcement then a vehement Great Heaven broke from the lips of Uncle Joe while Hartley Benson growing more and more rigid in his bearing fixed his eyes on the doctor s face and barely ejaculated Poison I say this continued the doctor too intent upon his own theory to notice either the growth of a terrible fear on the face of Uncle Joe or the equally remarkable expression of subdued expectation on that of the son because long experience has taught me the uselessness of trying to hide such a fact as suicide and also because being the coroner of the county it is my duty to warn you that an investigation will have to take place which will require certain precautions on my part such as the sealing up of his papers et cetera That is true came from the lips of both brother and son over whom a visible change had passed at the word suicide But I cannot think the former began in an agitated voice That my father would do such a deed interposed the latter It does not seem probable and yet he was a very wretched man and grief will often drive the best of us to despair Uncle Joe gave his nephew a strange look but said no more The doctor went quietly on I do not know what your father s troubles were but that he committed suicide I greatly fear unless it can be proved the acid was taken by mistake a conclusion which does not seem probable for from the smell of the decanter it is evident the acid was mixed with the wine in which I now remember advising him to take the nightly powder I prescribed to him for quite a trivial disorder a few days ago The only thing that puzzles me is why if he meditated death he should have troubled himself to take this powder And yet it is certain he did take it for there is still some of the sediment of it remaining in the bottom of the glass He took the powder because it was already in the glass broke in Hartley in a heavy tone of voice My sister put it there before she went up stairs to dress I think she was afraid he would forget it My father was very careless about small matters He was careful enough not to poison any one else in the family quoth the doctor There was scarcely a drop left in the decanter he took the whole dose I beg your pardon sirs but is it suicide you are talking about cried a voice suddenly over their shoulders making them all start Jonas the servant had entered from the inner room and unseen by all but myself had been listening to the last few words as if his life depended upon what they had to say If it is why I have a bit of an observation of my own to make that may help you to settle the matter You What have you to say quoth the doctor turning in surprise at the confident tone of voice in which the man spoke Not much I am sure cried Hartley to whom the appearance at that moment of his father s old servant was evidently most unwelcome That is for you to judge gentlemen I can only tell you what I ve seen and that not ten minutes ago mister Hartley do you mind the man in the yellow dress that was flitting about the parlors all the evening Good heavens burst in uncontrollable agitation from Uncle Joe and he caught his nephew by the arm with a look that called back the old rigid expression to the latter s face Yes was the quiet reply I remember seeing such a person Well sirs I don t know as you will think any thing of it but a little while ago I was walking up and down the balcony outside there when I happened to look into this room and I saw that man in the yellow dress leaning over this very table looking into the wineglass Miss Carrie had put there for master He had it in his hand and his head was down very close to it but what he did to it or to the decanter either I am sure sirs I don t know for I was that frightened at seeing this spectre in the room master had kept locked all day that I just slipped off the balcony and ran round the house to find mister Hartley But you wasn t in the parlors sir nor Miss Carrie neither and when I got to this room there was master lying dead on the floor and everybody crowding around him horror struck Humph ejaculated the doctor looking at Uncle Joe who had sunk in a heap into the arm chair his nephew abstractedly pushed toward him You see sirs Jonas resumed with great earnestness mister Benson for some reason or other had been very particular about keeping his own room to day The library door was locked as early as six this morning and he would let no one in without first asking who was there That s why I felt so dumbfoundered at seeing this yellow man in the room besides But no sooner had the good man arrived at this point than he stopped with a gasp and after a quick look at Hartley flushed and drew back in a state of great agitation and embarrassment Evidently a suspicion had just crossed the mind of this old and attached servant as to whom the Yellow Domino might be Well well cried the doctor go on let us hear the rest I I have nothing more to say mumbled the man while Hartley with an equal display of embarrassment motioned the discomfited servant to withdraw and turned as if to hide his face over some papers on the table I think the man in the yellow domino had better be found quoth the physician dryly glancing from Hartley to the departing form of the servant with a sharp look At all events it would be well enough for us to know who he is I don t see began Uncle Joe but stopped as he perceived the face of Hartley Benson slowly composing itself Evidently he was as much interested as myself in observing what this not easily to be understood man would say and do in this sudden crisis We were not long left in doubt Doctor he began in a slow hesitating tone well calculated to produce the effect he desired we unfortunately already know who wore a yellow domino this evening My brother Joe Hush implored his uncle laying a hand on his nephew s arm with a quick look of distress not lost on the doctor Brother repeated the latter Pardon me I did not know Ah but I do remember now to have heard that mister Benson had another son The face of Hartley grew graver and graver My brother has been alienated from my father for some time so you have never seen him here But to night he hoped or made me think he hoped to effect a reconciliation so I managed with my sister to provide him with the domino necessary to insure him an entrance here Indeed I did more I showed him a private door by which he could find his way into the library never suspecting any harm could come of son and father meeting even in this surreptitious way I I loved my brother and notwithstanding the past had confidence in him Nor can I think now he had any thing to do with the Here the voice of this inimitable actor broke in well simulated distress He sank on a chair and put his hands before his face The doctor had no reason to doubt this man He therefore surveyed him with a look of grave regard mister Benson said he you have my profoundest sympathy A tragedy like this in a family of such eminent respectability is enough to overwhelm the stoutest heart If your brother is here doctor Travis broke in the other rising and grasping the physician s hand with an appearance of manly impulse impressive in one usually so stern and self contained you are or were my father s friend can you or will you be ours Dreadful as it is to think my father undoubtedly committed suicide He had a great dread of this day It is the anniversary of an occurrence harrowing for him to remember My brother you see I shall have to break the secrecy of years was detected by him in the act of robbing his desk three years ago to night and upon each and every recurrence of the day has returned to his father s house to beg for the forgiveness and restoration to favor which he lost by that deed of crime Hitherto my father has been able to escape his importunities by absence or the address of his servants but to day he seemed to have a premonition that his children were in league against him notwithstanding Carrie s ruse of the ball and the knowledge may have worked upon him to that extent that he preferred death to a sight of the son that had ruined his life and made him the hermit you have seen The doctor fell into the trap laid for him with such diabolical art Perhaps but if that is so why is your brother not here Only a few minutes could have elapsed between the time that Jonas saw him leaning over the table with the glass in his hand and the moment when you and your sister entered this room in face of your father s falling form He must have been present therefore when your father came from his bedroom if not when he drank the fatal glass why then did he take such pains to escape if actuated by no keener emotion than horror at a father s suicide I do not know I cannot say but that he himself put the poison in the decanter I will not believe A thief is not necessarily a parricide Even if he were in great straits and needed the money my father s will undoubtedly leaves him he would think twice before he ran the risk of making Carrie and myself his natural enemies No no if my father has died from poison it was through a mistake or by the administration of his own hand never by that of Joe Benson s Ah and has anybody here present dared to charge him with such a deed With a start both gentlemen turned an accusing spirit stood before them Edith broke from Hartley s lips This is no place for you Go back go back My place is where the name of Joseph Benson is uttered she proudly answered whether the words be for good or evil I am his betrothed wife as you know and again I ask who has dared to utter an insinuation however light that he the tender son and generous brother has had a criminal hand in his father s awful death No one no one essayed Hartley taking her hand with a weak attempt at soothing I was but saying But she turned from him with a gesture of repugnance and taking a step toward the doctor looked him entreatingly in the face You have not been expressing doubts of mister Benson s youngest son because he happened to wear a disguise and be present when mister Benson fell You do not know Joe sir nobody in this town knows him His own father was ignorant of his worth but we know him Uncle Joe and I and we know he could never do a deed that could stamp him either as a dishonorable or a criminal man If mister Benson has died from poison I should as soon think this man had a hand in it as his poor exiled brother And in a burst of uncontrollable wrath and indignation she pointed with a sudden gesture at the startled Hartley But that worthy though evidently taken aback was not to be caught so easily Edith you forget yourself said he with studied self possession The horrors of this dreadful occurrence have upset you I do not wonder at it myself but the doctor will not so readily understand you Miss Underhill has been strangely attached to my brother he went on turning to the latter with an apologetic smile that made Uncle Joe grind his teeth in silent wrath They were engaged previous to the affair of which I have just made mention and naturally she could never bring herself to consider him guilty of a crime which once acknowledged must necessarily act as a bar of separation between them She calls him a martyr a victim an exile any thing but what he actually is Indeed she seems really to believe in his innocence while we he paused and looked up at his sister Carrie who had entered the room while we he went on slowly and sadly taking this new ally softly by the hand know only too well that the unhappy boy was in every respect guilty of the crime for which his father exiled him But that is neither here nor there the dreadful subject before us is not what he once did but whether his being here to night has had any thing to do with my father s death I cannot think it has and yet The subtle inflection of his voice spoke volumes This great actor had evidently been driven to bay O Hartley came in a terrified cry from his sister what is this You cannot think they cannot think Joe could do any thing so dreadful as that while over the face of Edith passed a look of despair as she saw the countenance of the doctor slowly fill with the gloom of suspicion and even the faithful Uncle Joe turn away as if he too had been touched by the blight of a secret doubt Ah but I wish Joe were here himself she cried with startling emphasis He should speak even if it brought ruin amongst us But the doctor was a man not to be moved by so simple a thing as a woman s unreasoning emotion Yes the Yellow Domino would be very welcome just now he allowed with grim decision That he is not here is the most damning fact of all Hartley slowly observed He fled when he saw our father fall But he shall come back Edith vehemently declared If he does I shall need no further proof of his innocence said Uncle Joe Nor I so that he comes to night returned the doctor Then be satisfied for here he is I exclaimed from my retreat and drawing the mask over my face and hastily enveloping myself in the yellow domino I stepped forth into full view of the crowd around the table V THE YELLOW DOMINO A mingled sound of shrieks and exclamations greeted me 
5244-54280-0000	train-other-500	Joe cried Edith bounding forward But I waved her back and turned with a severe gesture toward Hartley Benson What are your reasons I demanded
5244-54280-0001	train-other-500	for thinking the poisoning that has taken place here was the work of the Yellow Domino Do you ask me he retorted
none	none	 after a moment s pause 
5244-54280-0002	train-other-500	during which my voice echoed through the room waking strange gleams of doubt on the faces of more than one person present You wish to dare me then he hissed coming a step nearer
none	none	 I wish to know what the Yellow Domino has done that you or any one should consider him as responsible for the tragedy that has here taken place 
5244-54280-0003	train-other-500	I steadily replied Are you not my brother then he cried in mingled rage and anxiety Was it not you I met under the evergreens and supplied with a yellow domino
5244-54280-0004	train-other-500	in order to give you the opportunity of seeing our father to night and effecting the reconciliation which you had so long desired
none	none	 Are you not he who afterward followed me to this room 
5244-54280-0005	train-other-500	and hid himself in the closet from which you have just come all for the purpose as you said of throwing yourself at your father s feet and begging pardon for a past of which you had long ago repented
5244-54280-0006	train-other-500	Or are you some reckless buffoon who has presumed to step into the domino my brother left behind him and careless of the terrible trouble that has overwhelmed this family come here with your criminal jests to puzzle and alarm us
none	none	 I am the man to whom you gave the domino 
5244-54280-0007	train-other-500	if that is what you wish to know Hartley Benson and I am the man whom you led into the ambush of this closet for such reasons as your own conscience must inform you
5244-54280-0008	train-other-500	If the Yellow Domino put poison into mister Benson s wine then upon me must lie the burden of the consequences for I alone have worn the disguise of this mask
5244-54280-0009	train-other-500	from the moment we met under the evergreens till now as I think may be proved by this gentleman you call Uncle Joe
none	none	 and this lady you address as Edith 
5244-54280-0010	train-other-500	This mode of attack had the desired effect Who are you burst from Hartley s lips now blanched to the color of clay Unmask him doctor
5244-54280-0011	train-other-500	let us see the man who dares to play us tricks on such a night as this Wait cried I motioning back not only the doctor but Uncle Joe and the ladies the whole group having started forward at Hartley s words
5244-54280-0012	train-other-500	Let us first make sure I am the Yellow Domino who has been paraded through the parlors this evening Miss Benson will you pardon me if I presume to ask you what were the words of salutation with which you greeted me to night
5244-54280-0013	train-other-500	Oh she cried in a tremble of doubt and dismay I do not know as I can remember something about being glad to see you I believe
none	none	 and my hope that your plans for the evening might succeed 
5244-54280-0014	train-other-500	To which said I I made no audible reply but pressed your hand in mine with the certainty you were a friend
none	none	 though you had not used the word Counterfeit 
5244-54280-0015	train-other-500	Yes yes she returned blushing and wildly disturbed as she had reason to be And you Uncle Joe
none	none	 I went on what were your words 
5244-54280-0016	train-other-500	How did you greet the man you had been told was your erring nephew I said To counterfeit wrong when one is right necessarily opens one to a misunderstanding To which ambiguous phrase I answered as you will remember
5244-54280-0017	train-other-500	with a simple That is true a reply by the way that seemed to arouse your curiosity and lead to strange revelations God defend us cried Uncle Joe The exclamation was enough
5244-54280-0018	train-other-500	I turned to the trembling Edith I shall not attempt said I to repeat or ask you to repeat any conversation which may have passed between us for you will remember it was too quickly interrupted by mister Benson
5244-54280-0019	train-other-500	for us to succeed in uttering more than a dozen or so words However you will do me the kindness to acknowledge your belief that I am the man who stood with you behind the parlor curtains an hour ago I will
5244-54280-0020	train-other-500	she replied with a haughty lift of her head that spoke more loudly than her blushes It only remains then for mister Benson to assure himself I am the person who followed him to the closet
none	none	 I know of no better way of his doing this 
5244-54280-0021	train-other-500	than to ask him if he remembers the injunctions which he was pleased to give me when he bestowed upon me this domino No that is whatever they were they were given to the man I supposed to be my brother Ha then
none	none	 it was to your 
5244-54280-0022	train-other-500	brother I rejoined you gave that hint about the glass I would find on the library table saying that if it did not smell of wine I would know your father had not had his nightly potion and would yet come to the library to drink it
5244-54280-0023	train-other-500	an intimation as all will acknowledge which could have but the one result of leading me to go to the table and take up the glass and look into it in the suspicious manner which has been reported to you
5244-54280-0024	train-other-500	He was caught in his own toils and saw it Muttering a deep curse he drew back while a startled Humph broke from the doctor followed by a quick Is that true
5244-54280-0025	train-other-500	Did you tell him that mister Benson For reply the now thoroughly alarmed villain leaped at my throat Off with that toggery Let us see your face I shall and will know who you are
5244-54280-0026	train-other-500	But I resisted for another moment while I added It is then established to your satisfaction that I am really the man who has worn the yellow domino this evening Very well
5244-54280-0027	train-other-500	now look at me one and all and say if you think I am likely to be a person to destroy mister Benson And with a quick gesture I threw aside my mask
none	none	 and yielded the fatal yellow domino to the impatient hands of mister Hartley Benson 
5244-54280-0028	train-other-500	The result was a cry of astonishment from those to whom the face thus revealed was a strange one and a curse deep and loud from him to whom the shock of that moment s surprise must have been nearly overwhelming Villain
5244-54280-0029	train-other-500	he shrieked losing his self possession in a sudden burst of fury spy informer I understand it all now You have been set over me by my brother Instructed by him you have dared to enter this house worm yourself into its secrets
5244-54280-0030	train-other-500	and by a deviltry only equalled by your presumption taken advantage of your position to poison my father and fling the dreadful consequences of your crime in the faces of his mourning family It was a plot well laid
5244-54280-0031	train-other-500	but it is foiled sir foiled as you will see when I have you committed to prison to morrow mister Benson I returned shaking him loose as I would a feather this is all very well
none	none	 but in your haste and surprise you have made a slight mistake You call me a spy so I am 
5244-54280-0032	train-other-500	but a spy backed by the United States Government is not a man to be put lightly into prison I am a detective sir connected at present with the Secret Service at Washington
5244-54280-0033	train-other-500	My business is to ferret out crime and recognize a rogue under any disguise and in the exercise of any vile or deceptive practices And I looked him steadily in the face
5244-54280-0034	train-other-500	Then indeed his cheek turned livid and the eye which had hitherto preserved its steadiness sought the floor A detective murmured Miss Carrie shrinking back from the cringing form of the brother whom
5244-54280-0035	train-other-500	but a few hours before she had deemed every thing that was noble and kind A detective echoed Edith brightening like a rose in the sunshine In government employ repeated Uncle Joe
5244-54280-0036	train-other-500	honoring me with a stare that was almost comic in its mingled awe and surprise Yes I rejoined if any one doubts me I have papers with me to establish my identity
5244-54280-0037	train-other-500	By what means I find myself in this place a witness of mister Benson s death and the repository of certain family secrets it is not necessary for me to inform you It is enough that I am here
5244-54280-0038	train-other-500	have been here for a good hour posted behind that curtain that I heard Jonas exclamation as he withdrew from the balcony saw mister Benson come in from his bedroom drink his glass of wine
5244-54280-0039	train-other-500	and afterward fall at the feet of his son and daughter and that having been here and the witness of all this
none	none	 I can swear that if mister Benson drank poison from yonder decanter he drank poison that was put into it before either he 
5244-54280-0040	train-other-500	or the Yellow Domino entered this room Who put it there it is for you to determine my duty is done for to night And with a bow I withdrew from the group about me and crossed to the door
5244-54280-0041	train-other-500	But Miss Carrie s voice rising in mingled shame and appeal stopped me Don t go said she not at least until you tell me where my brother Joseph is Is he in this town
5244-54280-0042	train-other-500	or has he planned this deception from a distance I I am an orphan sir who at one blow has lost not only a dearly beloved father but as I fear a brother too in whom
5244-54280-0043	train-other-500	up to this hour I have had every confidence Tell me then if any support is left for a most unhappy girl
none	none	 or whether I must give up all hopes of even my brother Joe s sympathy and protection Your brother Joe I replied has had nothing to do with my appearance here He and I are perfect strangers but if he is a tall broad shouldered young man shaped something like myself but with a ruddy cheek and light curling hair I can tell you I saw such a person enter the shrubbery at the southwest corner of the garden an hour or so ago No he is here came in startling accents over my shoulders And with a quick leap Joe Benson sprang by me and stood handsome tall and commanding in the centre of the room Hartley Carrie Edith what is this I hear My father stricken down my father dying or dead and I left to wander up and down through the shrubbery while you knelt at his bedside and received his parting blessing Is this the recompense you promised me Hartley this your sisterly devotion Carrie this your love and attention to my interests Edith O Joe dear Joe do not blame us Carrie made haste to reply We thought you were here A man was here that man behind you simulating you in every regard and to him we gave the domino and from him we have learned What sprang in thundering tones from the young giant s throat as he wheeled on his heel and confronted me That your brother Hartley is a villain I declared looking him steadily in the eye God was his only exclamation as he turned slowly back and glanced toward his trembling brother Sir said I taking a step toward Uncle Joe who between his eagerness to embrace the new comer and his dread of the consequences of this unexpected meeting stood oscillating from one side to the other in a manner ridiculous enough to see what do you think of the propriety of uttering aloud and here the suspicions which you were good enough to whisper into my ears an hour ago Do you see any reason for altering your opinion as to which of the two sons of mister Benson invaded his desk and appropriated the bonds afterward found in their common apartment when you survey the downfallen crest of the one and compare it with the unfaltering look of the other No he returned roused into sudden energy by the start given by Hartley And advancing between the brothers he looked first at one and then at the other with a long solemn gaze that called out the color on Hartley s pale cheek and made the crest of Joe rise still higher in manly pride and assertion Joe said he for three years now your life has lain under a shadow Accused by your father of a dreadful crime you have resolutely refused to exonerate yourself notwithstanding the fact that a dear young girl waited patiently for the establishment of your innocence in order to marry you To your family this silence meant guilt but to me and mine it has told only a tale of self renunciation and devotion Joe was I right in this was Edith right The father you so loved and feared to grieve is dead Speak then Did you or did you not take the bonds that were found in the cupboard at the head of your bed three years ago to night The future welfare not only of this faithful child but of the helpless sister who despite her belief in your guilt has clung to you with unwavering devotion depends upon your reply Let my brother speak was the young man s answer given in a steady and nobly restrained tone Your brother will not speak his uncle returned Don t you see you must answer for yourself Say then Are you the guilty man your father thought you or are you not Let us hear Joe I am not avowed the young man bowing his head in a sort of noble shame that must have sent a pang of anguish through the heart of his brother Oh I knew it I knew it came from Edith s lips in a joyous cry as she bounded to his side and seized him by one hand just as his sister grasped the other in a burst of shame and contrition that showed how far she was removed from any participation in the evil machinations of her elder brother The sight seemed to goad Hartley Benson to madness Looking from one to the other he uttered a cry that yet rings in my memory Carrie Edith do you both forsake me and all because of a word which any villain might have uttered Is this the truth and constancy of women Is this what I had a right to expect from a sister a a friend Carrie you at least always gave me your trust will you take it away because a juggling spy and a recreant brother have combined to destroy me But beyond a wistful look and a solemn shake of the head Carrie made no response while Edith with her eyes fixed on the agitated countenance of her lover did not even seem to hear the words of pleading that were addressed to her The shock of the disappointment was too much for Hartley Benson Clenching his hand upon his breast he gave one groan of anguish and despair and sank into a chair inert and helpless But before we could any of us take a step toward him before the eyes of the doctor and mine could meet in mutual understanding he had bounded again to his feet and in a burst of desperation seized the chair in which he sat and held it high above his head Fools dotards he exclaimed his eyes rolling in frenzy from face to face but lingering longest on mine as if there he read the true secret of his overthrow as well as the promise of his future doom You think it is all over with me that there is nothing left for you to do but to stand still and watch how I take my defeat But I am a man who never acknowledges defeat There is still a word I have to say that will make things a little more even between us Listen for it you It will not be long in coming and when you hear it let my brother declare how much enjoyment he will ever get out of his victory And whirling the chair about his head he plunged through our midst into the hall without For an instant we stood stupefied then Carrie Benson s voice rose in one long thrilling cry and with a bound she rushed toward the door I put out my hand to stop her but it was not necessary Before she could cross the threshold the sudden sharp detonation of a pistol shot was heard in the hall and we knew that the last dreadful word of that night s tragedy had been spoken The true secret of Hartley Benson s action in this matter was never discovered That he planned his father s violent death no one who was present at the above interview ever doubted That he went further than that and laid his plans in such a manner that the blame if blame ensued should fall upon his innocent brother was equally plain especially after the acknowledgment we received from Jonas that he went out on the balcony and looked in the window at the special instigation of his young master But why this arch villain either at his own risk or at that of the man he hated felt himself driven to such a revolting crime will never be known unless indeed the solution be found in his undoubted passion for the beautiful Edith and in the accumulated pressure of certain secret debts for whose liquidation he dared not apply to his father I never revealed to this family the true nature of the motives which actuated me in my performance of the part I played that fatal night It was supposed by Miss Carrie and the rest that I was but obeying instructions given me by mister Benson and I never undeceived them I was too much ashamed of the curiosity which was the mainspring of my action to publish each and every particular of my conduct abroad though I could not but congratulate myself upon its results when some time afterward I read of the marriage of Joe and Edith The counterfeiters were discovered and taken but not by me FINIS Transcriber s notes

tm electronic works Professor Michael S Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone For thirty years he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support Project Gutenberg tm eBooks are often created from several printed editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U S unless a copyright notice is included Thus we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition Most people start at our Web site which has the
