Park Not far off swirled the traffic of Piccadilly glancing across to Hyde Park Corner they could see the great red motor buses meeting halting and then rocking away in different directions hooting as they fled The roar of London was in their ears It was a sunny morning in September The Park was dotted in every direction with shining perambulators propelled by smart nurses in uniform and tenanted by proud little people fair haired and rosy and extremely cheerful Wally liked the Park babies He referred to them collectively as young dukes They all look so jolly well tubbed don t they he remarked straying from the subject in hand Might be soap advertisements Look there s a jolly little duke in that gorgeous white pram and a bigger sized duke trotting alongside with a Teddy bear as big as himself Awful nice kids He smiled at the babies in the way that made it seem ridiculous that he should be grown up and in uniform They can t both be dukes said Jim literally Can t grow more than one in a family at least not at the same time I believe Oh well it doesn t matter and anyhow the one in the pram s a duchess returned Wally I say the duke s fallen in love with you Jim The duke a curly haired person in a white coat hesitated on the footpath near the two subalterns then mustering his courage came close to Jim and gravely presented him with his Teddy bear Jim received the gift as gravely and shook hands with the small boy to his great delight Thanks awfully he said It s a splendid Teddy isn t it The nurse greatly scandalized swooped down upon her charge exhorting him to be ashamed now and not worry the gentleman But the duke showed such distress when Jim attempted to return the Teddy bear that the matter had to be adjusted by distracting his attention in the direction of some drilling soldiers while Wally concealed the toy under the embroidered rug which protected the plump legs of the duchess who submitted with delighted gurgles to being tickled under the chin They withdrew reluctantly urged by the still horrified nurse See what it is to be beautiful and have the glad eye jeered Wally Dukes never give me Teddy bears It s my look of benevolent age Jim said grinning Anyhow young Wally if you ll stop beguiling the infant peerage and attend to business I ll be glad We ll have Norah and Dad here presently I m all attention said his friend But there s nothing more to be said than that it is rum is there And we said that Norah gave me a letter from poor old O Neill to show you Jim said I ll read it if you like The merriment that was never very far from Wally Meadows eyes died out as his chum unfolded a sheet of paper closely written He wrote it in the hotel in Carrignarone I suppose he asked gently Yes just after dinner on the night of the fight You see he was certain he wasn t coming back Anyhow this is what he says My Dear Norah If I am alive after to night you will not get this letter it is only to come to you if I shall have gone West And please don t worry if I do go West You see between you all you have managed almost to make me forget that I am just an apology for a man I did not think it could be done but you have done it Still now and then I remember and I know that there will be long years after you have all gone back to that beloved Australia of yours when there will be nothing to keep me from realizing that I am crippled and a hunchback To night I have the one chance of my life of living up to the traditions of O Neills who were fighting men so if by good luck I manage to wing a German or two and then get in the way of an odd bullet myself you mustn t grudge my finishing so much more pleasantly than I had ever hoped to do If I do fall I am leaving you that place of mine in Surrey I have hardly any one belonging to me and they have all more money than is good for them The family estates are entailed but this is mine to do as I please with I know you don t need it but it will be a home for you and your father while Jim and Wally are fighting if you care for it And perhaps you will make some use of it that will interest you I liked the place as well as I could like any place outside Ireland and if I can look back and I am very sure that I shall be able to look back I shall like to see you all there you people who brought the sun and light and laughter of Australia into the grey shadows of my life who never seemed to see that I was different from other men Well good bye and God keep you happy little mate Your friend John O Neill Jim folded the letter and put it back in his pocket and there was a long silence Each boy was seeing again a strip of Irish beach where a brave man had died proudly Different Wall said at last with a catch in his voice He wasn t different at least only in being a jolly sight better than most fellows Jim nodded Well he had his fight and he did his bit and seeing how he felt about things I m glad for his sake that he went out he said Only I m sorry for us because it was a pretty big thing to be friends with a man like that Anyhow we won t forget him We wouldn t even without this astonishing legacy of Norah s Have you any particulars about it Wally asked Dad got a letter from O Neill too both were sent to his lawyers he must have posted them himself that evening in Carrignarone Dad s was only business The place is really left to him in trust for Norah until she comes of age that s so that there wouldn t be any legal bother about her taking possession of it at once if she wants to Poor old Norah s just about bowled over She felt O Neill s death so awfully and now this has brought it all back Yes it s rough on Norah Wally said I expect she hates taking the place She can t bear the idea of it Dad and I don t much care about it either Wally pondered May I see that letter again he asked presently Jim Linton took out the letter and handed it to his friend He filled his pipe leisurely and lit it while Wally knitted his brows over the sheet of cheap hotel paper Presently he looked up a flash of eagerness in his keen brown eyes Well I think O Neill left that place to Norah with a purpose he said I don t believe it s just an ordinary legacy Of course it s hers all right but don t you think he wanted something done with it Done with it Yes Look here Wally put a thin forefinger on the letter Look what he says Perhaps you will make some use of it that may interest you Don t you think that means something I believe it might Jim said cautiously But what Wally hesitated Well he was just mad keen on the War he said He was always planning what he could do to help since he couldn t fight at least since he thought he couldn t the boy added with a sigh I wonder he hadn t used it himself for something in connexion with the War He couldn t it s let Jim put in quickly The lawyers wrote about it to Dad It s been let for a year and the lease expires this month they said O Neill had refused to renew it That rather looks as if he had meant to do something with it doesn t it Wally nodded vigorously I ll bet he did Now he s left it to Norah to carry on You see they told us his own relations weren t up to much I expect he knew they wouldn t make any use of it except for themselves Why it s as clear as mud Jim O Neill knew that Norah didn t actually need the place and that she and your father wanted to be near you and still help the war themselves They didn t like working in London Norah s too much of a kid and your father says himself he s not trained Now they ve got a perfectly ripping chance Oh bless you Wally said a thankful voice behind them The boys sprang to their feet Behind them stood a tall girl with a sun tanned face and straight grey eyes eyes that bore marks of tears of which Norah for once was unashamed Her brown curls were tied back with a broad black ribbon She was very slender skinny Norah would have said but despite that she was at what is known as the awkward age no movement of Norah Linton s was ever awkward She moved with something of the unconcerned grace of a deer In her blue serge coat and skirt she presented the well groomed look that was part and parcel of her She smiled at the two boys a little tremulously Hallo said her brother We didn t hear you where did you spring from Dad dropped me at the Corner he had to go on to Harrods Norah answered I came across the grass and you two were so busy talking you didn t know I was there I couldn t help hearing what you said Wally Well I m glad you did Wally answered But what do you think yourself Nor I was just miserable until I heard you Norah said It seemed too awful to take Sir John s house to profit by his death I couldn t bear it But of course you re right I do think I was stupid I read his letter a dozen times but I never saw it that way But you agree with Wally now Jim asked Why of course don t you I suppose I might have had the sense to see his meaning in time but I could only think of seeming to benefit by his death However as long as one member of the family has seen it it s all right She flashed a smile at Wally I m just ever so much happier It makes it all different We were such her voice trembled such good chums and now it seems as if he had really trusted us to carry on for him Of course he did Wally said He knew jolly well you would make good use of it and it would help you too when Jim was away Jim said that gentleman Jim What are you leaving yourself out for Aren t you coming Got a Staff job at home I m ashamed of you Wally said Norah severely Of course if you don t want to belong Whereat Wally Meadows flushed and laughed and muttered something unintelligible that nevertheless was quite sufficient for his friends It was not a thing of yesterday that friendship It went back to days of small boyhood when Wally a lonely orphan from Queensland had been Jim Linton s chum at the Melbourne Grammar School and had fallen into a habit of spending his holidays at the Linton s big station in the north of Victoria until it seemed that he was really one of the Billabong family Years had knitted him and Jim and Norah into a firm triumvirate mates in the work and play of an Australian cattle run watched over by the silent grey man whose existence centred in his motherless son and daughter with a warm corner in his affections for the lithe merry Queensland boy whose loyalty to Billabong and its people had never wavered since his childhood Then just as Jim had outgrown school and was becoming his father s right hand man on the station came the world upheaval of the European War which had whisked them all to England Business had at the moment summoned mister Linton to London to leave Norah behind was not to be thought of and as both the boys were wild to enlist and Wally was too young to be accepted in Australia though not in England it seemed that the simplest thing to do was to make the pilgrimage a general one and let the chums enlist in London They had joined a famous British regiment obtaining commissions without difficulty thanks to cadet training in Australia But their first experience of war in Flanders had been a short one they were amongst the first to suffer from the German poison gas and a long furlough had resulted mister Linton and Norah had taken them to Ireland as soon as they were fit to travel and the bogs and moors of Donegal coupled with trout fishing had gone far to effect a cure But there unexpected adventure had awaited them They had made friends with Sir John O Neill the last of an old North of Ireland family a half crippled man eating out his heart against the fate that held him back from an active part in the war Together they had managed to stumble on an oil base for German submarines concealed on the rocky coast and luck and boldness favouring them to trap a U boat and her crew It had been a short and triumphant campaign skilfully engineered by O Neill and he alone had paid for the triumph with his life John O Neill had died happily rejoicing in for once having played the part of a fighting man but to the Australians his death had been a blow that robbed their victory of all its joy They mourned for him as for one of themselves cherishing the memory of the high souled man whose spirit had outstripped his weak body Jim and Wally from exposure on the night of the fight had suffered a relapse and throat trouble had caused their sick leave to be extended several times Now once more fit they were back in London expecting to rejoin their regiment immediately So now Jim said the only question is what are you going to do with it I m going to think hard for a day said Norah So can you two and we ll ask Dad of course And then Dad will tell you what to do said Jim grinning Yes of course he will Dad always has splendid ideas said Norah laughing But we won t have any decision for a day because it s a terribly big thing to think of I wish I was grown up it must be easier to settle big questions if you haven t got your hair down your back I don t quite see what your old curly mop has to do with it but anyhow you needn t be in a hurry to put it up said her brother It s awful to be old and responsible isn t it Wally To which Wally responded with feeling Beastly and endeavoured to look more than nineteen failing signally Let s go and look at the Row Norah said Dad will find us all right I suppose Jim hesitated Why he couldn t miss you said Norah laughing Come on Even when more than a year of War had made uniform a commonplace in London streets you might have turned to look at Jim and Wally Jim was immensely tall his chum little less so and both were lean and clean shaven tanned to a deep bronze and stamped with a look of resolute keenness In their eyes was the deep glint that comes to those who have habitually looked across great spaces The type has become familiar enough in London now but it generally exists under a slouch hat and these lads were in British uniform bearing the badges of a famous marching regiment At first they had hankered after the cavalry being much more accustomed to ride than to walk but as the armies settled down into the Flanders mud it became increasingly apparent that this was not to be a horseman s war and that therefore as Wally put it if they wanted to be in the fun they had better make up their minds to paddle with the rest The amount of fun had so far been a negligible quantity which caused them some bitterness of spirit They earnestly hoped to increase it as speedily as might be and to give the Hun as much inconvenience as they could manage in the process They strolled across the grass to the railings and looked up and down the tan ribbon of Rotten Row Small boys and girls on smart ponies and woolly Shetlands walked or trotted sedately or occasionally galloped followed by elderly grooms torn between pride and anxiety Jim and Wally thought the famous Row an over rated concern failing to realize from its war aspect the Row of other days crammed from fence to fence with beautiful horses and well turned out riders and with half the world looking on from the railings Nowadays the small boys and girls had it chiefly to themselves and could stray from side to side at their own sweet will A few ladies were riding and there was a sprinkling of officers in khaki obviously on Army horses and out for exercise Now and then came a wounded man slowly on a reliable cob or sturdy pony bandages visible or one arm in a sling A few people sat about or leaned on the fences watching but there was nothing to attract a crowd Every one looked business like purposeful clothes were plain and useful with little frippery The old glitter and splendour of the Row was gone the London that used to watch it was a London that had forgotten how to play Beyond the Row carriages drawn by beautiful pairs of horses high stepping with harness flashing in the sunlight drove up and down Some contained old ladies and grey haired men but nearly all bore a load of wounded soldiers with sometimes a tired faced nurse There s that nice old Lady Ellison the one that used to take Jim and me out when we were in hospital Wally said indicating a carriage with a magnificent pair of bays She was an old dear My word I d like to have the driving of those horses in a good light buggy on the Billabong track So would I Jim assented But I d take those beastly bearing reins off before I started Yes said Norah eagerly Poor darlings how they must hate them Jim I wish we d struck London when the coaches used to be seen Rather said Jim Anstruther used to tell me about them Coaches bigger than Cobb company s and smart as paint with teams of four so matched you could hardly tell which was which and educated beyond anything Australians could dream about There was one man poor chap Anstruther said he was drowned in the Lusitania who had a team of four black cobs I think Anstruther used to dream about them at night he got poetical and incoherent when he tried to describe em Fancy seeing a dozen or so of those coaches swinging down Piccadilly on a fine morning said Wally That would be something to tell black Billy about Norah He d only say Plenty said Norah laughing Look there s Dad They turned to meet a tall grey man who came swinging across the grass with a step as light as his son s David Linton greeted them with a smile I knew I should find you as near as you could get to the horses he said This place is almost a rest cure after Harrod s I never find myself in that amazing shop without wishing I had a bell on my neck so that I couldn t get lost And I always take the wrong lift and find myself among garden tools when all I want is collars Well they have lifts round every corner you want a special lift sense not to take the wrong one Norah defended him Yes and when you ask your way anywhere in one of these fifty acre London shops they say Through the archway sir and disappear and you look round you frantically and see about seventeen different archways and there you are Wally stated So you plunge into them all in turn and get hopelessly lost But it s rather fun I d like it better if they didn t call me Moddam said Norah Shoes Moddam Certainly Moddam first to the right second to the left lift Number fifteen fifth floor and the attendant will direct you Then you stagger into space wishing for a wet towel round your head I could almost believe said her father regarding her gravely that you would prefer Cunjee with one street one general store one blacksmith s and not much else at all Why of course I do Norah laughed At least you can t get lost there and you haven t got half a day s journey from the oatmeal place to the ribbon department they ll sell you both at the same counter and a frying pan and a new song too Think of the economy of time and boot leather And mister Wilkins knows all about you and talks to you like a nice fat uncle while he wraps up your parcels And if you re on a young horse you needn t get off at all all you have to do is to coo ee and mister Wilkins comes out prepared to sell you all his shop on the footpath If that isn t more convenient than seventeen archways and fifty seven lifts then I d like to know what is Moddam always had a great turn of eloquence hadn t she murmured Wally eyeing her with respect Whereat Norah reddened and laughed and accused him of sentiments precisely similar to her own I think we re all much the same Jim said London s all very well for a visit But just imagine what it would be if we didn t know we were going back to Billabong some day What a horrible idea Norah said But we are when the old War s over and the Kaiser has retired to saint Helena and the Huns are busy building up Belgium and France And you ll both be captains if you aren t brigadiers and all Billabong will expect to see you come back in uniform glittering with medals and things I like their chance said Wally firmly Anyhow we ll all go back and that s all that matters said Norah Her eyes dwelt wistfully on the two tall lads And meanwhile said Jim we ll all go down to Fuller s and have morning tea One thing young Norah you won t find a Fuller s in Cunjee Why would I be trying Norah asked cheerfully Sure isn t there Brownie at Billabong Hear hear agreed Wally When I think of Brownie s pikelets Or Brownie s scones added Norah Or her sponge cakes Or Brownie s tea pot as large and as brown as herself said mister Linton then London is a desert But we ll make the best of it for the present Come along to Fuller s CHAPTER II THE HOME FOR TIRED PEOPLE To begin with said Jim what s the place like Eighty acres with improvements answered his father And three farms all let Daddy you re like an auctioneer s advertisement Norah protested Tell us what it is like the house I mean We ll run down and see it soon said mister Linton Meanwhile the lawyers tell me it s a good house Queen Anne style What s that queried Jim Oh gables and things said Wally airily Go on sir please Standing in well timbered park lands said mister Linton fishing a paper out of his pocket and reading from it Sorry Norah but I can t remember all these thrills without the lawyers letter Lounge hall four reception rooms Who are you going to receive Nor Be quiet said Norah aiming a cushion at the offender Not you if you re not extra polite Be quiet all of you or I will discontinue this penny reading said mister Linton severely Billiard room thirteen bedrooms three baths h and c Hydraulic and condensed murmured Wally Jim sat upon him with silent firmness and the reading was unchecked Excellent domestic offices modern drainage central heating electric plant Company s water What on earth said Jim I really don t know said his father But I suppose it means you can turn taps without fear of a drought or they wouldn t put it Grounds including shady old world gardens walled kitchen garden stone flagged terrace lily pond excellent pasture Squash racquet court What s that asked Norah You play it with pumpkins came muffled from beneath Jim Let me up Jimmy I ll be good That ll be something unusual said Jim rising Yes Dad Stabling heated garage thatched cottage Fine timber Two of the farms let on long leases one lease expires with lease of house All in excellent order I think that s about all So there you are Norah And what are you going to do with it It was the next morning and the treacherous September sunshine had vanished giving place to a cold wet drizzle which blurred the windows of the Lintons flat in South Kensington Looking down nothing was to be seen but a few mackintoshed pedestrians splashing dismally along the wet grey street Across the road the trees in a little fenced square were already getting shabby and a few leaves fluttered idly down The brief gay English summer had gone already the grey heralds of the sky sounded the approach of winter long and cold and gloomy I ve been thinking terribly hard Norah said I don t think I ever lay awake so long in my life But I can t make up my mind Of course it must be some way of helping the War But how We couldn t make it a hospital could we I think not said her father The hospital idea occurred to me but I don t think it would do You see you d need nurses and a big staff and doctors and already that kind of thing is organized People well established might do it but not lone Australians like you and me Norah How about a convalescent home Well the same thing applies in a less degree I believe too that they are all under Government supervision and I must admit I ve no hankering after that We wouldn t be able to call our souls our own and we d be perpetually irritated by Government under strappers interfering with us and giving orders no I don t think we could stand it You and I have always run our own show haven t we Norah that is until Jim came back to boss us He smiled at his tall son There was a pause Well Dad you always have ideas said Norah in the voice of one who waits patiently mister Linton hesitated I don t know that I have anything very brilliant now he said But I was thinking do you remember Garrett the fellow you boys used to tell us about who never cared to get leave because he hadn t any home Rather said the boys Fellow from Jamaica He was an awfully sociable chap Wally added and he didn t like cities So London bored him stiff when he was alone He said the trenches were much more homelike Well there must be plenty of people like that said mister Linton Especially of course among the Australians Fellows to whom leave can t mean what it should for want of a home and without any ties it s easy for them to get into all sorts of mischief And they should get all they can out of leave for the sake of the War if for nothing else they need a thorough mental re fitting to go back fresh and keen so that they can give the very best of themselves when the work begins again So you think of making Sir John s place into a Home for Tired people said Norah excitedly Dad it s a lovely plan What do you think Jim asked mister Linton Yes I think it s a great idea Jim said slowly Even the little bit of France we had showed us what I told you that you ve got to give your mind a spring cleaning whenever you can if you want to keep fit I suppose if people are a bit older they can stick it better some of them at least But when you re in the line for any time you sometimes feel you ve just got to forget things smells and pain and things you see Well you d forget pretty soon at a place like the one you ve been reading about said Wally Do you remember Jim how old poor old Garrett used to look He was always cheery and ragging and all that sort of thing but often he used to look like his own grandfather and his eyes gave you the creeps And he couldn t sleep M said Jim I remember If Garrett s still going will you have him for your first patient Nor What will you call them by the way guests patients cases Inmates grinned Wally Sounds like a lunatic asylum rejoined Jim How about lodgers Or patrons They ll be neither donkey said Norah pleasantly Just Tired People I think Oh Dad I want to begin You shouldn t call your superiors names especially when I have more ideas coming to me said Jim severely Look here I agree with Dad that you couldn t have a convalescent home where you d need nurses and doctors but I do think you might ask fellows on final sick leave like us who d been discharged from hospitals but were not quite fit yet Chaps not really needing nursing but not up to much travelling or to the racket and fuss of an hotel Yes said Wally Or chaps who had lost a limb and were trying to plan out how they were going to do without it His young face looked suddenly grave Norah remembered a saying of his once before I don t in the least mind getting killed but I don t want Fritz to wing me She moved a little nearer to him That s a grand idea yours too Jimmy she said Dad do you think Sir John would be satisfied If we can carry out our plan as we hope I think he would mister Linton said We ll find difficulties of course and make mistakes but we ll do our best Norah And if we can send back to the Front cheery men rested and refreshed and keen well I think we ll be doing our bit And after the War What then I was thinking about that too said Norah And I got a clearer notion than about using it now I think Of course she hesitated I don t know much about money matters or if you think I ought to keep the place You see you always seem to have enough to give us everything we want Dad I won t need to keep it will I I don t want to even if I haven t got much money I m not a millionaire said David Linton laughing But no you won t need an English income Norah I m so glad said Norah Then when we go back to Billabong Dad couldn t we turn it all into a place for partly disabled soldiers where they could work a bit just as much as they were able to but they d be sure of a home and wouldn t have any anxiety I don t know if it could be made self self you know earning its own living Self supporting assisted her father Yes self supporting said Norah gratefully Perhaps it could But they d all have their pensions to help them Yes and it could be put under a partly disabled officer with a wife and kids that he couldn t support some poor beggar feeling like committing suicide because he couldn t tell where little Johnny s next pair of boots was coming from added Jim That s the most ripping idea Norah What do you think Dad Yes excellent said mister Linton The details would want a lot of working out of course but there will be plenty of time for that I would like to make it as nearly self supporting as possible so that there would be no idea of charity about it A kind of colony said Wally Yes It ought to be workable The land is good and with poultry farming and gardening and intensive culture it should pay well enough We ll get all sorts of expert advice Norah and plan the thing thoroughly And we ll call it The O Neill Colony or something like that said Norah her eyes shining I d like it to carry on Sir John s name wouldn t you Dad Indeed yes said David Linton It has some sort of quiet inoffensive name already by the way yes Homewood Well that sounds nice and restful said Jim Sort of name you d like to think of in the trenches When do we go to see it Dad The lawyers have written to ask the tenants what day will suit them said his father They re an old Indian Army officer and his wife I believe General Somers I don t suppose they will raise any objection to our seeing the house By the way there is another important thing there s a motor and some vehicles and horses and a few cows that go with the place O Neill used to like to have it ready to go to at any time no matter how unexpectedly It was only when War work claimed him that he let it to these people He was unusually well off for an Irish landowner it seems that his father made a heap of money on the Stock Exchange Horses said Norah blissfully And a motor That will be handy for bringing the Tired People from the station said she Horses that one could ride I wonder Daddy I shouldn t be surprised said her father laughing Anyhow I daresay you will ride them I ll try said Norah modestly It sounds too good to be true Can I run the fowls Daddy I d like that job Yes you can be poultry expert said mister Linton As for me I shall control the pigs You won t be allowed to said Wally You ll find a cold proud steward or bailiff or head keeper or something who would die of apoplexy if either of you did anything so lowering You may be allowed to ride Norah but it won t be an Australian scurry you ll have to be awfully prim and proper and have a groom trotting behind you With a top hat He beamed upon her cheerfully Me said Norah aghast Wally don t talk of such horrible things It s rubbish isn t it Dad Grooms and top hats don t seem to be included in the catalogue said mister Linton studying it Bless you that s not necessary said Jim I mean you needn t get too bucked because they re not Public opinion will force you to get them Probably Nor will have to ride in a top hat too Never said Norah firmly Unless you promise to do it too Jimmy My King and Country have called me said Jim with unction Therefore I shall accompany you in uniform and watch you trying to keep the top hat on It will be ever so cheery You won t said Norah You ll be in the mud in Flanders and then broke off and changed the subject laboriously There were few subjects that did not furnish more or less fun to the Linton family but Norah never could manage to joke successfully about even the Flanders mud which appeared to be a matter for humorous recollection to Jim and Wally Whenever the thought of their return to that dim and terrible region that had swallowed up so many crossed her vision something caught at her heart and made her breath come unevenly She knew they must go she would not have had it otherwise even had it been certain that they would never come back to her But that they should not so alive so splendid in their laughing strength the agony of the thought haunted her dreams no matter how she strove to put it from her by day Jim saw the shadow in her eyes and came to her rescue There was never a moment when Jim and Norah failed to understand each other You ll want a good deal of organization about that place Dad he said I suppose you ll try to grow things vegetables and crops I ve been trying to look ahead said mister Linton This is only the second year of the War and I ve never thought it would be a short business It doesn t seem to me that England realizes war at all so far everything goes on just the same not only business as usual but other things too pleasure luxuries eating clothes everything as usual I reckon that conscription is bound to come and before the Hun gets put in his place nearly every able bodied man in these islands will be forced to help in the job I think you re about right Jim said Well then other things will happen when the men go Food will get scarcer the enemy will sink more and more ships everything that the shops and the farmers sell will get dearer and dearer and many things will cease to exist altogether You ll find that coal will run short and live stock will get scarce because people won t be able to get imported food stuffs that they depend on now Oh it s my idea that there are tight times coming for the people of England And that of course means a good deal of anxiety in planning a Home for Tired People Tired People must be well fed and kept warm Can t we do it Daddy queried Norah distressed We re going to try my girl But I m looking ahead One farm comes in with the house you know I think we had better get a man to run that with us on the shares system and we ll grow every bit of food for the house that we can We ll have plenty of good cows plenty of fowls vegetables fruit we ll grow potatoes wherever we can put them in and we ll make thorough provision for storing food that will keep Eggs in water glass said Norah And I ll make tons of jam and bottle tons of fruit and vegetables Yes We ll find out how to preserve lots of things that we know nothing about now I don t in the least imagine that if real shortage came private people would be allowed to store food but a house run for a war purpose might be different Anyhow there s no shortage yet so there s no harm in beginning as soon as we can Of course we can t do very much before we grow things and that won t be until next year There s marmalade said Norah wisely And apple jam and we ll dry apples And if the hens are good there may be eggs to save Hens get discouraged in an English winter and I m sure I don t blame them said Jim laughing Never mind Nor they ll buck up in the spring Then there s the question of labour said mister Linton I m inclined to employ only men who wouldn t be conscripted partially disabled soldiers or sailors who could still work or men with other physical drawbacks Lots of men whose hearts are too weak to go over the top from the trenches could drive a plough quite well Then if conscription does come we shall be safe I ll like to do it too said Norah It would be jolly to help them Of course it will cut both ways mister Linton said There should be no difficulty in getting men of the kind poor lads there are plenty of disabled ones I m inclined to think that the question of women servants will be more difficult Well I can cook a bit said Norah thanks to Brownie My dear child said her father slightly irritated you ve no idea of what a fairly big English house means apart from housekeeping and managing We shall need a really good housekeeper as well as a cook and goodness knows how many maids under her You see the thing has got to be done very thoroughly If it were just you and the boys and me you d cook our eggs and bacon and keep us quite comfortable But it will be quite another matter when we fill up all those rooms with Tired People I suppose so said Norah meekly But I can be useful Daddy He patted her shoulder Of course you can mate I m only afraid you ll have too much to do I must say I wish Brownie were here instead of in Australia Dear old Brownie wouldn t she love it all said Norah her eyes tender at the thought of the old woman who had been nurse and mother and mainspring of the Billabong house since Norah s own mother had laid her baby in her kind arms and closed tired eyes so many years ago Wouldn t she love fixing the house And how she d hate cooking with coal instead of wood Only nothing would make Brownie bad tempered Not even Wal and I said Jim And I ll bet we were trying enough to damage a saint s patience However as we can t have Brownie I suppose you ll advertise for some one else Dad Oh I suppose so but sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof returned mister Linton I ve thought of nothing but this inheritance of Norah s all day and I m arriving at the conclusion that it s going to be an inheritance of something very like hard work Well that s all right cause there shouldn t be any loafers in war time Norah said She looked out of the window The rain is stopping come along everybody and we ll go down Regent Street on a bus To do which Norah always maintained was the finest thing in London They went down to see Norah s inheritance two days later A quick train from London dropped them at a tiny station where the stationmaster a grizzled man apparently given over to the care of nasturtiums directed them to Homewood A walk of a mile along a wide white road brought them to big iron gates standing open beside a tiny lodge with diamond paned windows set in lattice work under overhanging eaves and all smothered with ivy out of which sparrows fluttered busily The lodgekeeper a neat woman looked at the party curiously no doubt the news of their coming had spread From the lodge the drive to the house wound through the park a wide stretch of green with noble trees oak beech and elm not towering like Norah s native gum trees but flinging wide arms as though to embrace as much as possible of the beauty of the landscape Bracken beginning to turn gold fringed the edge of the gravelled track A few sheep and cows were to be seen across the grass Nice looking sheep said mister Linton Yes but you wouldn t call it over stocked was Jim s comment Jim was not used to English parks He was apt to think of any grass as feed in terms of so many head per acre The drive well gravelled and smoothly rolled took them on sauntering slowly until it turned in a great sweep round a lawn ending under a stone porch flung out from the front of the house A wide porch almost a verandah to the delighted eyes of the Australians who considered verandah less houses a curious English custom verging on lunacy Near the house it was shut in with glass and furnished with a few lounge chairs and a table or two That s a jolly place Jim said quickly The house itself was long and rambling and covered with ivy There were big windows it seemed planned to catch all the sunlight that could possibly be tempted into it The lawn ended in a terrace with a stone balustrade where one could sit and look across the park and to woods beyond it now turning a little yellow in the sunlight and soon to glow with orange and flame colour and bronze when the early frosts should have painted the dying leaves From the lawn to right and left ran shrubberies and flower beds with winding grass walks Why it s lovely Norah breathed She slipped a hand into her father s arm Jim rang the bell A severe butler appeared and explained that General and missus Somers had gone out for the day and had begged that mister Linton and his party would make themselves at home and explore the house and grounds thoroughly an arrangement which considerably relieved the minds of the Australians who had rather dreaded the prospect of poking about the house under the eyes of its tenants The butler stiffened respectfully at the sight of the boys uniforms It appeared presently that he had been a mess sergeant in days gone by and now regarded himself as the personal property of the General Very sorry they are to leave the ouse too sir said the butler A nice place but too big for them Haven t they any children Norah asked Only the Captain miss and he s in Mesopotamia which is an orrible ole for any gentleman to be stuck in said the butler with a fine contempt for Mesopotamia and all its works And the mistress is tired of ousekeeping so they re going to live in one of them there family otels as they call them The butler sighed and then as if conscious of having lapsed from correct behaviour stiffened to rigidity and became merely butler once more Will you see the ouse now sir They entered a wide hall in which was a fireplace that drew an exclamation from Norah since she had not seen so large a one since she left Billabong This was built to take logs four feet long to hold which massive iron dogs stood in readiness Big leather armchairs and couches and tables strewn with magazines and papers together with a faint fragrance of tobacco in the air gave to the hall a comforting sense of use The drawing room on the other hand was chillingly splendid and formal and looked as though no one had ever sat in the brocaded chairs and the great dining room was almost as forbidding The butler intimated that the General and his wife preferred the morning room which proved to be a cheery place facing south and west with a great window recess filled with flowering plants This is jolly Jim said But so would the other rooms be if they weren t so awfully empty They only want people in them Tired people Norah said Yes Wally put in I m blessed if I think they would stay tired for long here There was a long billiard room with a ghostly table shrouded in dust sheets and upstairs a range of bedrooms of all shapes and sizes but all bright and cheerful and looking out upon different aspects of park and woodland Nothing was out of order everything was plain but care and taste were evident in each detail Then down a back staircase they penetrated to outer regions where the corner of Norah s soul that Brownie had made housewifely rejoiced over a big bright kitchen with pantries and larders and sculleries of the most modern type The cook who looked severe was reading the Daily Mail in the servants hall here and there they had glimpses of smart maids irreproachably clad who seemed of a race apart from either the cheery friendly housemaids of Donegal or Sarah and Mary of Billabong who disliked caps but had not the slightest objection to helping to put out a bush fire or break in a young colt Norah tried to picture the Homewood maids at either task and failed signally From the house they wandered out to visit well appointed stables with room for a dozen horses and a garage where a big touring car stood Norah found herself quite unable to realize that it belonged to her But in the stables were living things that came and nuzzled softly in her hand with inquiring noses that were evidently accustomed to gifts of sugar and apples and Norah felt suddenly for the first time at home There were two good cobs and a hunter with a beautiful lean head and splendid shoulders a Welsh pony designed for a roomy tub cart in the coach house and a good old stager able for anything from carrying a nervous rider to drawing a light plough The cobs the groom explained were equally good in saddle or harness and there was another pony temporarily on a visit to a vet which Sir John had liked to ride But of course Killaloe was Sir John s favourite he added stroking the hunter s soft brown muzzle There wasn t no one could show them two the way in a big run They tore themselves with difficulty from the stables and still guided by the butler who seemed to think he must not let them out of his sight wandered through the grounds Thatched cottage orchard and walled garden rosery with a pergola still covered with late blooms lawns and shrubberies There was nothing very grand but all was exquisitely kept and a kind of still peace brooded over the beauty of the whole and made War and its shadows seem very far away The farms well tilled and prosperous looking were at the western side of the park mister Linton and Jim talked with the tenant whose lease was expiring while Norah and Wally sat on an old oak log and chatted to the butler who told them tales of India and asked questions about Australia being quite unable to realize any difference between the natives of the two countries All niggers I calls them said the butler loftily That seems a decent fellow said mister Linton as they walked back across the park Hawkins the tenant farmer I mean Has he made a success of his place do you know Awkins as an excellent name sir replied the butler A good steady man and a rare farmer The General thinks ighly of im E s sorry enough that is lease is up Awkins is I think of renewing it under slightly different conditions mister Linton observed I don t wish to turn the man out if he will grow what I want Well that s good news said the butler heartily I m sure Awkins ll do anything you may ask im to sir A sudden dull flush came into his cheeks and he looked for a moment half eagerly at mister Linton as if about to speak He checked himself however and they returned to the house where by the General s orders coffee and sandwiches awaited the visitors in the morning room The butler flitted about them seeing to their comfort unobtrusively If I may make so bold as to ask sir he said presently you ll be coming to live here shortly As soon as General Somers leaves mister Linton answered The man dropped his voice standing rigidly to attention I suppose sir he said wistfully you would not be needing a butler A butler why I hadn t thought of such a thing said mister Linton laughing There are not very many of you in Australia you know But indeed sir you ll need one in a place like this said the ex sergeant growing bold Every one as them and if you would be so kind as to consider if I d do sir I know the place and the General ud give me a good record I ve been under him these fifteen years but he doesn t need me after he leaves here Well said mister Linton thoughtfully But we shan t be a small family we mean to fill this place up with officers needing rest We re coming here to work not to play Officers said the ex sergeant joyfully But where d you get any one to elp you better sir Lookin after officers as been my job this many a year And I d serve you faithful sir Norah slipped her hand into her father s arm We really would need him I believe Daddy she whispered You would indeed miss said the butler gratefully I could valet the young gentlemen and if there s any special attention needed I could give it I d do my very utmost miss I m old to go out looking for a new place at my time of life And if you ve once been in the Army you like to stay as near it as you can Well we ll see mister Linton said guardedly I ll probably write to General Somers about you At which the butler forgetting his butlerhood came smartly to attention and then became covered with confusion and concealed himself as well as he could behind a coffee pot You might do much worse Jim remarked on their way to the station He looks a smart man and though this place is glorious it s going to take a bit of running Keep him for a bit at any rate Dad I think it might be as well mister Linton answered He turned at a bend in the drive to look back at Homewood standing calm and peaceful in its clustering trees Well Norah what do you think of your property I m quite unable to believe it s mine said Norah laughing But I suppose that will come in time However there s one thing quite certain Dad you and I will have to get very busy CHAPTER III OF LONDON AND OTHER MATTERS Jim and Wally dropped lightly from the footboard of a swift motor bus dodged through the traffic and swung quickly down a quiet side street They stopped before a stone house where from a window above Norah watched their eager faces as Jim fitted his latchkey and opened the door She turned back into the room with a little sigh There they are Dad And they re passed fit I know David Linton looked up from the elbow splint he was making Well it had to come mate he said Yes I know But I hoped it wouldn t said poor Norah inconsistently You wouldn t like them not to go said her father And then cheery footsteps clattered up the stairs and the boys burst in Passed shouted Jim Fit as fiddles When Norah asked This day week So we ll have nice time to settle you into Homewood and try those horses won t we Yes rather said Norah Were they quite satisfied with your arm Wally Yes they say it s a lovely arm said that gentleman modestly I always knew it but it s nice to have other people agreeing with me And they say our lungs are beautiful too not a trace of gas left And oh you tell them Jim And we re not to go out yet said Jim grinning widely Special Lewis gun course at Aldershot first and after that a bombing course So there you are He broke off his utterance hindered by the fact that Norah had suddenly hugged him very hard while David Linton jumping up caught Wally s hand Not the Front my dear boys Well not yet said Wally pumping the hand and finding Norah s searching for his free one It s pretty decent isn t it because every one knows there will be plenty of war at the Front yet Plenty indeed said mister Linton I say buck up old chap said Jim patting Norah s shoulder very hard One would think we were booked for the trenches to night I wouldn t have made an ass of myself if you had been said Norah shaking back her curls and mopping her eyes defiantly I was prepared for that and then you struck me all of a heap Oh Jimmy I am glad I d like to hug the War Office You re the first person I ever heard with such sentiments returned her brother Most people want to heave bombs at it However they ve treated us decently and no mistake You see ever since June we ve kept bothering them to go out and then getting throat trouble and having to cave in again and now that we really are all right I suppose they think they ll make sure of us So that s that I would have been awfully wild if they hadn t passed us Wally said But since they have and they ll put us to work I don t weep a bit at being kept back for awhile Lots of chaps seem to think being at the Front is heavenly but I m blessed if I can see it that way We didn t have very much time there certainly but there were only three ingredients in what we did have mud barbed wire and gas Yes and it s not much of a mixture said Jim All the same it s got to be taken if necessary Still I m not sorry it s postponed for a bit there will be heaps of war yet and meanwhile we re just learning the trade He straightened his great shoulders I never felt so horribly young and ignorant as when I found grown up men in my charge in France Poor old Jimmy always did take his responsibilities heavily said Wally laughing mister Linton looked at his big son remembering a certain letter from his commanding officer which had caused him and Norah to glow with pride remembering also how the men on Billabong Station had worked under Master Jim But he knew that soldiering had always been a serious business to his boy Personal danger had never entered into Jim s mind but the danger of ignorant handling of his men had been a tremendous thing to him Even without mud barbed wire and gas Jim was never likely to enjoy war in the light hearted way in which Wally would certainly take it under more pleasant conditions Well we ve a week then boys he said cheerfully and no anxieties immediately before us except the new cook ladies Well goodness knows they are enough Norah said fervently Anything more settled Jim asked I have an ecstatic letter from Allenby Allenby was the ex sergeant He seems in a condition of trembling joy at the prospect of being our butler and what is more to the point he says he has a niece whom he can recommend as a housemaid So I have told him to instal her before we get to Homewood on Thursday Hawkins has written a three volume list of things he will require for the farm but I haven t had time to study it yet And Norah has had letters from nineteen registry offices all asking for a deposit The boys roared That makes seventy one doesn t it Nor Wally asked Something like it Norah admitted ruefully And the beauty of it is not one of them will guarantee so much as a kitchenmaid They say sadly that in the present crisis it s difficult to supply servants They don t seem to think there s any difficulty about paying them deposit fees That phrase in the present crisis is the backbone of business to day mister Linton said If a shop can t sell you anything or if they mislay your property or sell your purchase to some one else or keep your repairs six months and then lose them or send in your account with a lot of items you never ordered or received they simply wave the present crisis at you and all is well Yes but they don t regard it as any excuse if you pay too little or don t pay at all Jim said Of course not that wouldn t be business my son said Wally laughing The one department the Crisis doesn t hit is the one that sends out bills He turned to Norah What about the cook lady Nor She s safe said Norah sighing with relief There s an awfully elegant letter from her saying she ll come Oh that s good business Jim said For a fortnight Norah had had the unforgettable experience of sitting in registry offices attempting to engage a staff for Homewood She had always been escorted by one or more of her male belongings and their extreme ignorance of how to conduct the business had been plain to the meanest intelligence The ex sergeant whose spirit of meekness in proposing himself had been in extraordinary contrast to the condescending truculence of other candidates had been thankfully retained There had at times seemed a danger that instead of butler he might awake to find himself maid of all work since not one of the applicants came up to even Norah s limited standard Finally however mister Linton had refused to enter any more registry offices or to let Norah enter them describing them in good set terms as abominable holes and judicious advertising had secured them a housekeeper who seemed promising and a cook who insisted far more on the fact that she was a lady than on any ability to prepare meals The family while not enthusiastic was hopeful I hope she s all right Norah said doubtfully I suppose we can t expect much they all tell you that nearly every servant in England has gone into munitions which always sounds as though she d get fired out of a trench mortar presently Some of those we saw might be benefited by the process said mister Linton shuddering at memories of registry offices Well what about the rest haven t you got to get a kitchenmaid and some more housemaids or things queried Jim vaguely I m not going to try here said mister Linton firmly Life is too short I d sooner be my own kitchenmaid than let Norah into one of those offices again Allenby s niece will have to double a few parts at first and I ve written to Ireland to missus Moroney to see if she can find us two or three nice country girls I believe she ll be able to do it Meanwhile we ll throw care to the winds I ve told Allenby to order in all necessary stores so that we can be sure of getting something to eat when we go down beyond that I decline to worry or let Norah worry about anything Then let s go out and play cried Norah jumping up Right said the boys Where Oh anywhere we ll settle as we go said Norah airily She fled for her hat and coat So they went to the Tower of London a place little known to the English but of which Australians never tire and spent a blissful afternoon in the Armoury examining every variety of weapons and armament from Crusaders chain mail to twentieth century rifles There is no place so full of old stories and of history history that suddenly becomes quite a different matter from something you learn by the half page out of an extremely dull book at school This is history alive and the dim old Tower becomes peopled with gay and gallant figures clad in shining armour bent on knightly adventures There you see mail shirts of woven links that slip like silken mesh through the fingers yet could withstand the deadliest thrust of a dagger maces with spiked heads that only a mighty man could swing swords such as that with which Coeur de Lion could slice through such a mace as though it were no more than a carrot sinuous blades that Saladin loved that would sever a down cushion flung in the air Daggers and poignards too of every age needle pointed yet viciously strong with exquisitely inlaid hilts and fine lined blades long rapiers that brought visions of gallants with curls and lace stocks and silken hose as ready to fight as to dance or to make a poem to a fair lady s eyebrow Helmets of every age with visors behind which the knights of old had looked grimly as they charged down the lists at gentle and joyous passages of arms Horse armour of amazing weight I always pictured those old knights prancing out on a thirteen stone hack but you d want a Suffolk Punch to carry that ironmongery said Wally So through room after room each full of brave ghosts of the past looking benevolently at the tall boy soldiers from the New World until at length came closing time and they went out reluctantly across the flagged yard where poor young Anne Boleyn laid her gentle head on the block where the ravens hop and caw to day as their ancestors did in the sixteenth century when she walked across from her grim prison that still bears on its wall a scrawled Anne A dull little prison room it must have been after the glitter and pomp of castles and palaces with only the rugged walls of the Tower Yard to look upon from the tiny window And she must have had such a jolly good time at first said Wally Old Henry VIII was very keen on her wasn t he And then she was only his second wife by the time he d had six they must have begun to feel themselves rather two a penny They found a bus that took them by devious ways through the City the part of London that many Londoners never see since it is another world from the world of Bond Street and Oxford Street with their newness and their glittering shops But to the queer folk who come from overseas it is the real London and they wander in its narrow streets and link fingers with the past Old names look down from the smoke grimed walls Black Friars and White Friars Bread Street saint Martin s Lane Leadenhall Street Temple Bar the hurrying crowd of to day fades and instead come ghosts of armed men and of leather jerkined prentices less ready to work than to fight of gallants with ruffs and fierce sailor men of the days of Queen Bess home from the Spanish Main with ships laden with gold swaggering up from the Docks to spend their prize money as quickly as they earned it Visions of dark nights with link boys running beside chair bearers carrying exquisite ladies to routs and masques of foot pads slinking into dark alleys and doorways as the watch comes tramping down the street Visions of the press gang hunting stout lads into every tavern whisking them from their hiding places and off to the ships to disappear with never a word of farewell until years later bronzed and tarred and strange of speech they returned to astounded families who had long mourned them as dead Visions of Queen Bess with her haughty face and her red hair riding through the City that adored her her white palfrey stepping daintily through the cheering crowd and great gentlemen beside her Raleigh Essex Howard They all wander together through the grey streets where the centuries old buildings tower overhead all blending together a formless jumble of the Past and yet very much alive and it does not seem to matter in the least that you look down upon them from a rattling motor bus that leaves pools of oil where perchance lay the puddle over which Raleigh flung his cloak lest his queen s slipper should be soiled Very soon we shall look down on the City from airships while conductors come and stamp our tickets with a bell punch but the old City will be unchanged and it will be only we who look upon it who will pass like shadows from its face The Australians left their bus in Fleet Street and dived down a narrow lane to a low doorway with the sign of the Cheshire Cheese the old inn with sanded floor and bare oak benches and tables where doctor Johnson and his followers used to meet to dine and afterwards to smoke long churchwarden pipes and talk as Wally said such amazing fine language that it made you feel a little light headed It is to be feared that the Australians had not any great enthusiasm for doctor Johnson They had paid a visit of inspection to the room upstairs where the great man used to take his ease but not one of them had felt any desire to sit in his big armchair You don t understand what a chance you re scorning mister Linton had said laughing as his family turned from the seat of honour Why good Americans die happy if they can only say they have sat in doctor Johnson s chair I think he was an ill mannered old man quoth Norah with her nose tilted Which seemed to end the matter so far as they were concerned But if the Billabong family took no interest in doctor Johnson they had a deep affection for the old inn itself They loved its dim rooms with their blackened oak and it was a never ending delight to watch the medley of people who came there for meals actors artists literary folk famous and otherwise Americans foreigners Colonials politicians fighting men of both Services busy City men for everybody comes sooner or later to the old Cheshire Cheese Being people of plain tastes they liked the solid honest meals especially since increasing War prices were already inducing hotels and restaurants everywhere to disguise a tablespoonful of hashed oddments under an elegant French name and sell it for as much money as a dinner for a hungry man Norah used to fight shy of the famous lark pudding until it was whispered to her that what was not good beef steaks in the dish was nothing more than pigeon or possibly even sparrow after which she enjoyed it and afterwards pilgrimaged to the kitchen to see the great blue bowls as big as a wash hand basin in which the puddings have been made since doctor Johnson s time and the great copper in which they are boiled all night Legend says that any one who can eat three helpings of lark pudding is presented with all that remains but no one has ever heard of a hero able to manage his third plateful Best of all the Billabong folk loved the great cellars under the inn which were once the cloisters of an old monastery where there are unexpected steps and dim archways and winding paths where it is very easy to imagine that you see bare footed friars with brown habits and rope girdles pacing slowly along There they bought quaint brown jars and mustard pots of the kind that are used and have always been used on the tables above But best of all were the great oaken beams above them solid as England itself but blackened and charred by the Great Fire of sixteen sixty six Norah used to touch the burned surface gently wondering if it was not a dream if the hand on the broken charcoal were really her own more used to Bosun s bridle on the wide plains of Billabong There were not many people in the room as they came in this evening for it was early dinner indeed was scarcely ready and a few customers sat about reading evening papers and discussing the war news In one corner were an officer and a lady and at sight of the former Jim and Wally saluted and broke into joyful smiles The officer jumped up and greeted them warmly Hullo boys he said I m delighted to see you Fit again you look it Dad this is Major Hunt Jim said dragging his father forward You remember of our regiment And my sister sir I say I m awfully glad to see you Come and meet my wife said Major Hunt Stella here are the two young Australians that used to make my life a burden Everybody shook hands indiscriminately and presently they joined forces round a big table while Jim and Wally poured out questions concerning the regiment and every one in it Most of them are going strong Major Hunt said we have a good few casualties of course but we haven t lost many officers most of them have come back I think all your immediate chums are still in France But I ve been out of it myself for two months stopped a bit shrapnel with my hand and it won t get better He indicated a bandaged left hand as he spoke and they realized that his face was worn and deeply lined with pain It s stupid he said and laughed But when are you coming back We ve plenty of work for you They told him eagerly Well you might just as well learn all you can before you go out Major Hunt said The war s not going to finish this winter or the next Indeed I wouldn t swear that my six year old son who is drilling hard won t have time to be in at the finish At which missus Hunt shuddered and said Don t be so horrible Douglas She was a slight pretty woman cheery and pleasant and she made them all laugh by her stories of work in a canteen All the soldiers used to look upon us as just part of the furniture she said They used to rush in in a break between parades and give their orders in a terrible hurry As for saying Please well You ought to have straightened them up said Major Hunt with a good tempered growl Ah poor boys they hadn t time The Irish regiments were better but then it isn t any trouble for an Irishman to be polite it comes to him naturally But those stolid English country lads can t say things easily She laughed I remember a young lance corporal who used often to come to our house to see my maid He was terribly shy and if I chanced to go into the kitchen he always bolted like a rabbit into the scullery The really terrible thing was that sometimes I had to go on to the scullery myself and run him to earth among the saucepans when he would positively shake with terror I used to wonder how he ever summoned up courage to speak to Susan let alone to face the foe when he went to France That s the sort that gets the V C without thinking about it said Major Hunt laughing I was very busy in the Canteen one morning it was a cold wet day and the men rushed us for hot drinks whenever they had a moment Presently a warrior dashed up to the counter banged down his penny and said Coffee in a voice of thunder I looked up and caught his eye as I was turning to run for the coffee and it was my lance corporal What did you do We just gibbered at each other across the counter for a moment I believe and I never saw a face so horror stricken Then he turned and fled leaving his penny behind him Poor boy I gave it to Susan to return to him Didn t you ever make friends with any of them missus Hunt Norah asked Oh yes when we had time or when they had But often one was on the rush for every minute of our four hour shifts Jolly good of you said Jim Good gracious no It was a very poor sort of war work but busy mothers with only one maid couldn t manage more And I loved it especially in Cork the Irish boys were dears and so keen I had a great respect for those boys The lads who enlisted in England had all their chums doing the same thing and everybody patted them on the back and said how noble they were and gave them parties and speeches and presents But the Irish boys enlisted very often dead against the wishes of their own people and against their priest and you ve got to live in Ireland to know what that means The wonder to me was always the number of Irishmen who did enlist said Major Hunt And aren t they fighters They must be great Jim said You should hear our fellows talk about the Dublins and the Munsters in Gallipoli His face clouded it was a grievous matter to Jim that he had not been with those other Australian boys who had already made the name of Anzac ring through the world Yes you must be very proud of your country missus Hunt said with her charming smile I tell my husband that we must emigrate there after the war It must be a great place in which to bring up children judging by all the Australians one sees Possibly but a man with a damaged hand isn t wanted there Major Hunt said curtly Oh you ll be all right long before we want to go out was his wife s cheerful response But there was a shadow in her eyes Wally did not notice any shadow He had hero worshipped Major Hunt in his first days of soldiering when that much enduring officer a Mons veteran with the D S O to his credit had been chiefly responsible for the training of newly joined subalterns and Major Hunt in his turn had liked the two Australian boys who whatever their faults of carelessness or ignorance were never anything but keen Now in his delight at meeting his senior officer again Wally chattered away like a magpie asking questions telling Irish fishing stories and other stories of adventures in Ireland hazarding wild opinions about the war and generally manifesting a cheerful disregard of the fact that the tired man opposite him was not a subaltern as irresponsible as himself Somehow the weariness died out of Major Hunt s eyes He began to joke in his turn and to tell queer yarns of the trenches and presently indeed the whole party seemed to be infected by the same spirit so that the old walls of the Cheshire Cheese echoed laughter that must have been exceedingly discouraging to the ghost of doctor Johnson if as is said that unamiable maker of dictionaries haunts his ancient tavern Well you ve made us awfully cheerful said Major Hunt when dinner was over and they were dawdling over coffee Stella and I were feeling rather down on our luck I believe when you appeared and now we ve forgotten all about it Do you always behave like this Miss Linton No I have to be very sedate or I d never keep my big family in order said Norah laughing You ve no idea what a responsibility they are Haven t I said he You forget I have a houseful of my own Tell me about them Norah asked Do you keep them in order We say we do for the sake of discipline but I m not too sure about it said missus Hunt As a matter of fact I am very strict but Douglas undoes all my good work Is it really true that he is strict in the regiment mister Jim Jim and Wally shuddered I d find it easier to tell you if he wasn t here Jim said There are awful memories aren t there Wal Rather said Wally feelingly Do you remember the day I didn t salute on parade I believe your mangled remains were carried off the barrack square said Jim with a twinkle I expect I should have been one of the fatigue part only that was the day I was improperly dressed What you didn t come on parade in a bath towel did you his father asked No but I had a shoulder strap undone it s nearly as bad isn t it sir Jim grinned at Major Hunt If I could remember the barrack square frown at the moment I would assume it said that officer laughing Never mind I ll deal with you both when we all get back You haven t told me about the family Norah persisted The family you are strict with I mean she added kindly You have no more respect for a field officer than your brother has said he Whisper said missus Hunt He was only a subaltern himself before the war Her husband eyed her severely You ll get put under arrest if you make statements liable to excite indiscipline among the troops he said Don t listen to her Miss Linton and I ll tell you about the family she spoils There s Geoffrey who is six and Alison who s five at least I think she s five isn t she Stella Much you know of your babies said his wife with a fine scorn Alison won t be five for two months Hasn t she a passion for detail said her husband admiringly Well five ish Miss Linton And finally there s a two year old named Michael And when they all get going together they make rather more noise than a regiment But they re rather jolly and I hope you ll come and see them Oh do said missus Hunt Geoff would just love to hear about Australia He told me the other day that when he grows up he means to go out there and be a kangaroo I suppose you know you must never check a child s natural ambitions mister Linton told her gravely Was that your plan she laughed Oh my pair hadn t any ambitions beyond sitting on horses perpetually and pursuing cattle said mister Linton That was very useful to me so I certainly didn t check it H m said Jim regarding him inquiringly I wonder how your theory would have lasted Dad if I d grown my hair long and taken to painting That wouldn t have been a natural ambition at all so I should have been able to deal with it with a clear conscience said his father laughing In any case the matter could safely have been left to Norah she would have been more than equal to it I trust so said Norah pleasantly You with long hair Jimmy It s amazing and painful to see the number of fellows who take long hair into khaki with them said Major Hunt The old Army custom was to get your hair cut over the comb for home service and under the comb for active service Jolly good rule too But the subaltern of the New Army goes into the trenches with locks like a musician s At least too many of him does Never could understand any one caring for the bother of long hair said Jim running his hand over his dark close cropped poll I say isn t it time we made a move if we re going to a show He looked half shyly at missus Hunt Won t you and the Major come with us It s been so jolly meeting you Good idea said mister Linton cutting across missus Hunt s protest Do come I know Norah is longing to be asked to meet the family and that will give you time to fix it up He over ruled any further objections by the simple process of ignoring them whereupon the Hunts wisely gave up manufacturing any more and presently they had discovered two taxis Norah and her father taking missus Hunt in the first leaving the three soldiers to follow in the second They slid off through the traffic of Fleet Street We really shouldn t let you take possession of us like this said missus Hunt a little helplessly But it has been so lovely to see Douglas cheerful again He has not laughed so much for months You are anxious about his hand David Linton asked Yes very He has had several kinds of treatment for it but it doesn t seem to get better and the pain is wearing The doctors say his best chance is a thorough change as well as treatment but we can t manage it the three babies are expensive atoms Now there is a probability of another operation to his hand and he has been so depressed about it that I dragged him out to dinner in the hope of cheering him up But I don t think I should have succeeded if we hadn t met you It was great luck for us Norah said The boys have always told us so much of Major Hunt He was ever so good to them He told me about them too said missus Hunt He liked them because he said he never succeeded in boring them Why you couldn t bore Jim and Wally said Norah laughing Then a great idea fell upon her and she grew silent leaving the conversation to her companions as the taxi whirred on its swift way through the crowded streets until they drew up before the theatre In the vestibule she found her father close to her and endeavoured to convey many things to him by squeezing his arm very hard among the crowd succeeding in so much that mister Linton knew perfectly well that Norah was the victim of a new idea and was quite content to wait to be told what it was But there was no chance of that until the evening was over and they had bade farewell to the Hunts arranging to have tea with them next day after which a taxi bore them to the Kensington flat and they gathered in the sitting room while Norah brewed coffee over a spirit lamp I m jolly glad we met the Hunts Jim said But isn t it cruel luck for a man like that to be kept back by a damaged hand Rough on missus Hunt too Wally remarked She looked about as seedy as he did Daddy said Norah eagerly David Linton laughed Yes I knew you had one he said Out with it I ll listen They re Tired People said Norah and waited Yes they re certainly tired enough said her father But the children Norah I don t think we could possibly take in little children considering the other weary inmates No I thought that too Norah answered eagerly But don t you remember the cottage Daddy Why shouldn t they have it By Jove said Jim That jolly little thatched place Yes it has several rooms They could let their own house and then they d save heaps of money It would get them right out of London and missus Hunt told me that London is the very worst place for him the doctors said so That is certainly an idea mister Linton said It s near enough to London for Hunt to run up for his treatment We could see that they were comfortable He smiled at Norah whose flushed face was dimly visible through the steam of the coffee I think it would be rather a good way to begin our job Norah It would be so nice that it doesn t feel like any sort of work said Norah I think you may find a chance of work they have three small children and not much money said her father prophetically I say I hope the Major would agree Jim put in I know he s horribly proud We ll kidnap the babies and then they ll just have to come Norah laughed Picture mister Linton said Wally happily carrying on the good work by stalking through London with three kids sticking out of his pockets followed by Norah armed with feeding bottles Wounded officer and wife hard in pursuit armed with shot guns supplemented Jim I like your pacifist ideas of running a home for Tired People I must say Why they would forget that they had ever been tired said Norah I think it s rather a brilliant notion there certainly wouldn t be another convalescent home in England run on the same lines But you re not good on matters of detail people don t have feeding bottles for babies of that age I m not well up in babies said Wally Nice people but I like somebody else to manage em I thought bottles were pretty safe until they were about seven Well we ll talk it over with the Hunts to morrow the cottage not the bottles mister Linton said Meanwhile it s bed time so good night everybody He dispersed the assembly by the simple process of switching off the electric light smiling to himself as Jim and Norah two stepped singing down the tiny corridor in the darkness But the mid day post brought a worried little note from missus Hunt putting off the party Her husband had had a bad report on his hand that morning and was going into hospital for an immediate operation She hoped to fix a day later on the note was a little incoherent Norah had a sudden vision of the three small Hunts who made rather more noise than a regiment rampaging round the harassed mother as she tried to write Perhaps it s as well we ll study the cottage and make sure that it s all right for them said her father Then we ll kidnap them Meanwhile we ll go and send them a big hamper of fruit and put some sweets in for the babies A plan which was so completely after Norah s heart that she quite forgot her disappointment CHAPTER IV SETTLING IN They bade good bye to the flat early next morning and went down to Homewood through a dense fog that rolled up almost to the carriage windows like masses of white wool At the station the closed carriage waited for them with the brown cobs pawing the ground impatiently General Somers chauffeur had gone with his master and so far they had not succeeded in finding a substitute but the groom and coachman who were also gardeners in their spare time considered themselves part and parcel of the place and had no idea of changing their home The cart for the luggage will be here presently sir Jones the old coachman told mister Linton So they left a bewildering assortment of suit cases and trunks piled up on the platform in the care of an ancient porter and packed themselves into the carriage Norah was wont to say that the only vehicle capable of accommodating her three long men folk comfortably was an omnibus The fog was lifting as they rolled smoothly up the long avenue and just as they came within sight of the house a gleam of pale sunlight found its way through the misty clouds and lingered on the ivy clad gables The front door was flung wide to welcome them on the steps hovered the ex sergeant wearing a discreet smile Behind him fluttered a print dress and a white apron presumably worn by his niece I say Norah don t you feel like the Queen of Sheba entering her ancestral halls whispered Wally wickedly as they mounted the steps If she felt simply horrible then I do returned Norah I suppose I ll get used to it in time but at present I want a hollow log to crawl into Allenby greeted them respectfully We did not know what rooms you would like sir he said They are all practically ready of course My niece miss thought you might prefer the blue bedroom Her name is Sarah miss We don t want the best rooms the sunniest I mean Norah said They must be for the Tired People mustn t they Dad Well there are no Tired People except ourselves at present said her father laughing So if you have a fancy for any room you had better take it don t you think Well we ll tour round and see said Norah diplomatically with mental visions of the sudden turning out of rooms should weary guests arrive It might be better to settle down from the first as we mean to be A lady has come miss said Allenby I understood her to say she was the cook but perhaps I made a mistake He paused questioningly his face comically puzzled Oh Miss de Lisle Yes miss Oh yes she s the cook said Norah And the housekeeper missus Atkins No one else has arrived miss Well I expect she ll come said Norah At least she promised Miss de Lisle miss asked for her kitchenmaid There isn t one at present said Norah feeling a little desperate Oh said Allenby looking blank I I am afraid miss that the lady expects one Well she can t have one until one comes said mister Linton Cheer up Norah I ll talk to Miss de Lisle I ll be the kitchenmaid if necessary said Wally cheerfully What does one do Allenby shuddered visibly My niece I am sure will do all she can sir he said His gaze dwelt on Wally s uniform it was easy to see him quailing in spirit before the vision of an officer with a kitchen mop Perhaps miss if you would like to see the rooms They trooped upstairs the silent house suddenly waking to life with the quick footsteps and cheery voices The big front bedrooms were at once put aside for future guests Norah fell in love with and promptly appropriated a little room that appeared to have been tucked into a corner by the architect as an afterthought It was curiously shaped with a quaint little nook for the bed and had a big window furnished with a low cushioned seat wide enough for any one to curl up with a book mister Linton and the boys selected rooms principally remarkable for bareness Jim had a lively hatred for furniture they left him discussing with Allenby the question of removing a spindle legged writing table mister Linton and Norah went downstairs with sinking hearts to encounter Miss de Lisle On the way appeared Sarah very clean and starched as to dress very pink and shiny as to complexion Her hair was strained back from her forehead so tightly it appeared to be pulling her eyes up Oh Sarah said mister Linton pausing Yes sir said Sarah meekly You may be required to help the cook for a few days until we er until the staff is complete said her employer Your uncle tells me you will have no objection It being understood sir as it is only tempory said Sarah firmly Oh quite said mister Linton hurriedly And of course I will help you with the housework Sarah put in Norah Sarah looked more wooden than before Thank you miss I m sure she returned They went on Doesn t she make you feel a worm said Norah This is a terrible business Norah said mister Linton fervently I didn t guess what Brownie was saving me from all these years They found Miss de Lisle in the kitchen where an enormous range glowed like a fiery furnace in which respect Miss de Lisle rather resembled it She was a tall stout woman dressed in an overall several sizes too small for her The overall was rose coloured and Miss de Lisle was many shades deeper in hue She accepted their greetings without enthusiasm and plunged at once into a catalogue of grievances The butler tells me there is no kitchenmaid she boomed wrathfully And I had not expected such an antiquated range Nor could I possibly manage with these saucepans sweeping a scornful hand towards an array which seemed to the hapless Lintons to err only on the side of magnificence There will be a number of necessary items And where am I to sit You will hardly expect me to herd with the servants It would be rough on them rose to Norah s lips But she prudently kept the reflection to herself To sit echoed mister Linton Why I really hadn t thought of it His brow cleared Oh there is the housekeeper s room And who is the housekeeper Is she a lady She hasn t said so yet said mister Linton It was evident that he considered this a point in the absent housekeeper s favour Miss de Lisle flamed anew I cannot sit with your housekeeper she averred You must remember mister Linton that I told you when engaging with you that I expected special treatment And you must remember said mister Linton with sudden firmness that we ourselves have not been half an hour in the house and that we must have time to make arrangements As for what you require we will see into that later Miss de Lisle sniffed It s not what I am accustomed to she said However I will wait And the kitchenmaid I can t make a kitchenmaid out of nothing said mister Linton gloomily I hope to hear of one in a day or two I have written to Ireland To Ireland ejaculated Miss de Lisle in accents of horror My dear sir do you know what Irish maids are like They re the nicest maids I know said Norah speaking for the first time And so kind and obliging H m sniffed the cook lady But you are not sure of obtaining even one of these treasures Well we ll all help said Norah Sarah will give you a hand until we get settled and my brother and mister Meadows and I can do anything There can t be such an awful lot of work She stopped Miss de Lisle was regarding her with an eye in which horror and amazement were mingled But we don t do such things in England she gasped Your brother And the other officer In my kitchen may I ask Well one moment you seem afraid of too much work and the next of too much help said Norah laughing You d find them very useful I trust that I have never been afraid of work said Miss de Lisle severely But I have my position to consider There are duties which belong to it and other duties which do not My province is cooking Cooking And nothing else Who I ask is to keep my kitchen clean Me if necessary said a voice in which Allenby the butler was clearly merged in Allenby the sergeant Begging your pardon sir He was deferential again save for the eye with which he glared upon Miss de Lisle I think perhaps between me and Sarah and er this lady we can arrange matters for the present without troubling you or Miss Linton Do said his employer thankfully He beat a retreat followed by Norah rather to Norah s disappointment She was beginning to feel warlike and hankered for the battle with Allenby ranged on her side I m going to love Allenby she said with conviction as they gained the outer regions He s a trump said her father But isn t that a terrible woman Norah Here s another anyhow said Norah with a wild inclination to giggle A dismal cab halted at a side entrance and the driver was struggling with a stout iron trunk The passenger a tall angular woman was standing in the doorway The housekeeper breathed mister Linton faintly Do you feel equal to her Norah He fled with disgraceful weakness to the billiard room Good morning Norah said advancing Good morning returned the newcomer with severity I have rung three times Oh we re a little shorthanded said Norah and began to giggle hopelessly to her own dismay Her world seemed suddenly full of important upper servants with no one to wait on them It was rather terrible but beyond doubt it was very funny to an Australian mind The housekeeper gazed at her with a sort of cold anger I m afraid I don t know which is your room Norah said recovering under that fish like glare You see we ve only just come I ll send Allenby She hurried off meeting the butler in the passage Oh Allenby she said it s the housekeeper And her trunk Allenby what does a housekeeper do She won t clean the kitchen for Miss de Lisle will she I m afraid not miss said Allenby His manner grew confidential had he not been so correct a butler Norah felt that he might have patted her head Now look miss he said You just leave them women to me I ll fix them And don t you worry Oh thank you Allenby said Norah gratefully She followed in her father s wake leaving the butler to advance upon the wrathful figure that yet blocked the side doorway In the billiard room all her men folk were gathered looking guilty It s awful to see you all huddling together here out of the storm said Norah laughing Isn t it all terrible Do you think we ll ever settle down Daddy Indeed I wouldn t be too certain responded mister Linton gloomily How did you get on Norah Was she anything like Miss de Lisle That s an appalling woman She ought to stand for Parliament She s not like Miss de Lisle but I m not sure that she s any nicer said Norah She s very skinny and vinegarish I say Daddy aren t we going to have a wild time Well if she and the cook lady get going the encounter should be worth seeing remarked Jim Talk about the Kilkenny cats I only hope it will come off before we go said Wally gleefully We haven t had much war yet have we Jim I think we deserve to see a little I should much prefer it in some one else s house said mister Linton with haste But it s bound to come I should think and then I shall be called in as referee Well Australia was never like this Still there are compensations He went out returning in a moment with a battered hat of soft grey felt Now you ll be happy said Norah laughing I am responded her father He put on the hat with tender care I haven t been so comfortable since I was in Ireland It s one of the horrors of war that David Linton of Billabong has worn a stiff bowler hat for nearly a year Never mind no one in Australia would believe it unless they saw it photographed said Jim soothingly And it hasn t had to be a top hat so you really haven t had to bear the worst That is certainly something said his father In the dim future I suppose you and Norah may get married but I warn you here and now that you needn t expect me to appear in a top hat However there s no need to face these problems yet thank goodness Suppose we leave the kitchen to fight it out alone and go and inspect the cottage It nestled at the far side of a belt of shrubbery a cheery thatched place with wide casement windows that looked out on a trim stretch of grass At one side there was actually a little verandah a sight so unusual in England that the Australians could scarcely believe their eyes Certainly it was only a very tiny verandah Within all was bright and cheery and simple The cottage had been used as a barracks when the sons of a former owner had brought home boy friends Two rooms were fitted with bunks built against the wall as in a ship s cabin there was a little dining room plainly furnished and a big sitting room that took up the whole width of the building and had casement windows on three sides There was a roomy kitchen from which a ladder like staircase ascended to big attics one of which was fitted as a bedroom It s no end of a jolly place was Jim s verdict I don t know that I wouldn t rather live here than in your mansion Norah but I suppose it wouldn t do I think it would be rather nice Norah said But you can t because we want it for the Hunts And it will be splendid for them won t it Dad Yes I think it will do very well said mister Linton We ll get the housekeeper to come down and make sure that it has enough pots and pans and working outfit generally And then we ll go up to London and kidnap missus Hunt and the babies said Norah pirouetting gently Now shall we go and see the horses They spent a blissful half hour in the stables and arranged to ride in the afternoon the old coachman was plainly delighted at the absence of a chauffeur and displayed his treasures with a pride to which he had long been a stranger The orses aven t ad enough to do since Sir John used to come he said The General didn t care for them an infantry gent he must have been and it was always the motor for im We exercised em of course but it ain t the same to the orses and don t they know it Of course they do Norah caressed Killaloe s lean head You ll hunt him sir won t you this season asked Jones anxiously The meets ain t what they was of course but there s a few goes out still The Master s a lady missus Ainslie her husband s in France He s ad the ounds these five years Oh we ll hunt won t we Dad Norah s face glowed as she lifted it Rather said Jim Of course you will What about the other horses Jones Can they jump To tell you the truth sir said Jones happily there s not one of them that can t Even the cobs ain t too bad and the black pony that s at the vet s e s a flyer E ll be ome to morrow the vet sent me word yesterday that is shoulder s all right Strained it a bit e did Of course they ain t made hunters like Killaloe but they re quick and clever and once you know the country and the short cuts and the gaps you can generally manage to see most of a run He sighed ecstatically Eh but it ll be like old times to get ready again on a hunting morning The gong sounded from the house and they bade the stables a reluctant good bye Lunch waited in the morning room there was a pleasant sparkle of silver and glass on a little table in the window And there was no doubt that Miss de Lisle could cook If her temper were as good as her pastry I should say we had found a treasure said mister Linton looking at the fragments which remained of a superlative apple pie Let s hope that missus Moroney will discover a kitchenmaid or two and that they will induce her to overlook our other shortcomings I m afraid we ll never be genteel enough for her said Norah shaking her curly head And the other servants will all hate her because she thinks they aren t fit for her to speak to If she only knew how much nicer Allenby is Or Brownie said Wally loyally Brownie could beat that pie with one hand tied behind her Allenby entered sympathy on every line of his face The ousekeeper missus Atkins would like to see you sir Or Miss Linton And so would Miss de Lisle But Miss de Lisle was on his heels breathing threatenings and slaughter There must be some arrangement made as to my instructions she boomed Your housekeeper evidently does not understand my position She has had the impertinence to address me as Cook Cook She paused for breath glaring But good gracious isn t it your profession asked mister Linton Miss de Lisle fairly choked with wrath Wally s voice fell like oil on a stormy sea If I could make a pie like that I d expect to be called Cook said he It s it s a regular poem of a pie Whereat Jim choked in his turn and endeavoured with signal lack of success to turn his emotion into a sneeze Miss de Lisle s lowering countenance cleared somewhat She looked at Wally in a manner that was almost kindly War time cookery is a makeshift not an art she said Before the war I could have shown you what cooking could be That pie wasn t a makeshift persisted Wally It was a dream I say Miss de Lisle can you make pikelets Yes of course said the cook lady Do you like them I d go into a trap for a pikelet said Wally warming to his task Oh Norah do ask Miss de Lisle if she ll make some for tea Oh do pleaded Norah As a matter of stern fact Norah preferred bread and butter to pikelets but the human beam in the cook lady s eye was not to be neglected We haven t had any for ages She cast about for further encouragement for the beam Miss de Lisle I suppose you have a very special cookery book I make my own recipes said the cook lady with pride But for the war I should have brought out my book By Jove you don t say so said Jim I say Norah you ll have to get that when it comes out Rather said Norah I wonder would it bother you awfully to show me some day how to make meringues I never can get them right We ll see said Miss de Lisle graciously And would you really like pikelets for tea Please if it wouldn t be too much trouble Very well Jim held the door open for the cook lady as she marched out Suddenly she paused You will see the housekeeper mister Linton Oh certainly said David Linton hastily The door closed behind it they could hear a tread heavy and martial dying away A fearsome woman said mister Linton Wally you deserve a medal But are we always to lick the ground under the cook s feet in this fashion Oh she ll find her level said Jim But you d better tell missus Atkins not to offend her again Talk to her like a father Dad say she and Miss de Lisle are here to run the house not to bother you and Norah It s excellent in theory said his father sadly but in practice I find my tongue cleaving to the roof of my mouth when these militant females tackle me And if you saw missus Atkins you would realize how difficult it would be for me to regard her as a daughter But I ll do my best missus Atkins admitted by the sympathetic Allenby proved less fierce than the cook lady although by no stretch of imagination could she have been called pleasant I have never worked with a cook as considered herself a lady she remarked It makes all very difficult and no kitchen maid and am I in authority or am I not And such airs turning up her nose at being called Cook Which if she is the cook why not be called so And going off to her bedroom with her dinner no one downstairs being good enough to eat with her I must say it isn t what I m used to and me lived with the first families Quite the first missus Atkins ceased her weary monologue and gazed on the family with conscious virtue She was dressed in dull black silk and looked overwhelmingly respectable Oh well you must put up with things as they are said mister Linton vaguely Miss de Lisle expects a few unusual things but apparently there is no doubt that she can do her work I hope to have more maids in a few days if not a brilliant idea striking him I must send you up to London to find us some missus Atkins I shall be delighted sir replied the housekeeper primly And do I understand that the cook is to have a separate sitting room Oh for goodness sake ask Allenby ejaculated her employer It will have to be managed somewhere or we shall have no cook CHAPTER V HOW THE COOK LADY FOUND HER LEVEL Two days later the morning mail brought relief not too soon for there was evidence that the battle between the housekeeper and the cook lady could not be much longer delayed and Sarah was going about with a face of wooden agony that gave Norah a chilly feeling whenever she encountered her Allenby alone retained any cheerfulness and much of that was due to ancient military discipline Therefore missus Moroney s letter was hailed with acclamation Two maids she can recommend bless her heart said mister Linton She doesn t label their particular activities but says they ll be willing to do anything at all That s the kind I like said Norah thankfully And their names are Bride Kelly and Katty O Gorman doesn t that bring Killard and brown bogs back to you And oh by Jove What is it demanded his family in unison This is what it is I don t know would your honour remember Con Hegarty that was shofer to Sir John at Rathcullen and a decent boy with one leg and he after coming back from the war He have no job since Sir John died and he bid me tell you he d be proud to drive a car for you and to be with ye all And if he have only one leg itself he s as handy as any one with two or more Sir John had him with him at Homewood and he knows the car that s there and tis the way if you had a job for him he could take the two girls over when he went and he used to travelling the world That s all I think mister Linton ended What luck Jim ejaculated We couldn t have a better chauffeur I wonder we never thought of Con said his father A nice boy I d like to have him So would I added Norah When will you get them Dad I ll write at once and send a cheque for their fares said her father I ll tell them to send me a telegram when they start He rose to leave the room What are you going to do this morning children We re all turning out the cottage Norah answered promptly I haven t told Sarah she disapproves of me so painfully if I do any work and hurts my feelings by always doing it over again if possible At the same time she looks so unhappy about working at all and sighs so often that I don t feel equal to telling her that the cottage has to be done So Jim and Wally have nobly volunteered to help me Don t knock yourself up said her father Will you want me No unless you like to come as a guest and sit still and do nothing My two housemaids and I can easily finish off that little job There s not really a great deal to do Norah added the place is very clean Only one likes to have everything extra nice when Tired People come Well I m not coming to sit still and do nothing said her father firmly so I ll stay at home and write letters He watched them from the terrace a little later racing across the lawn and smiled a little It was so unlikely that this long legged family of his would ever really grow up The house was very quiet that morning missus Atkins and Miss de Lisle having quarrelled over the question of dinner had retreated the one to the housekeeper s room the other to the kitchen Sarah went about her duties sourly Allenby was Sarah s uncle and as such felt some duty to her which he considered he had discharged in getting her a good place beyond that Sarah frankly bored him and he saw no reason to let her regard him as anything else than a butler Bad for discipline too he reflected Therefore Allenby was lonely He read the Daily Mail in the seclusion of his pantry and then strolling through the hall with a watchful eye alert lest a speck of dust should have escaped Sarah he saw his master cross the garden and strike across the park in the direction of Hawkins farm Every one else was out Allenby knew not where An impulse for fresh air fell upon him and he sauntered towards the shrubbery Voices and laughter came to him from the cottage He pushed through the shrubs and found himself near a window and peeping through received a severe shock to his well trained nerves Norah enveloped in a huge apron was energetically polishing the kitchen tins the boys in their shirt sleeves were equally busy Wally scrubbing the sink with Monkey soap and Jim blackleading the stove It was very clear that work was no new thing to any of the trio Allenby gasped with horror Officers too he ejaculated What s the world coming to I wonder He hesitated a moment and then walked round to the back door May I come in please miss Oh come in Allenby Norah said a little confused We re busy you see Did you want anything No miss thank you But really miss I could ave got a woman from the village for you to do all this Or Sarah Sarah has quite enough to do said Norah Indeed Sarah s not killed with work said that damsel s uncle I don t like to see you soilin your ands miss Nor the gentlemen The gentlemen are all right said Wally cheerfully Look at this sink now Allenby did you ever see anything better It s it s not right murmured Allenby unhappily He threw off his black coat suddenly and advanced upon Jim If you please sir I ll finish that stove That you won t said Jim Thanks all the same Allenby but I m getting used to it now He laughed Besides don t you forget that you re a butler I can t forget that you re an officer sir said Allenby wretchedly It s not right think of the regiment And Miss Norah Won t you let me elp sir You can clean the paint Allenby said Norah taking pity on his distressed face But there s really no need to keep you If you d only not mind telling any of them at the ouse what I was doing said the butler anxiously It ud undermine me position There s that Miss de Lisle now she looks down on everybody enough without knowin I was doin any job like this She shall never know said Jim tragically waving a blacklead brush Now I m off to do the dining room grate If you re deadly anxious to work Allenby you could wash this floor couldn t he Norah Thanks very much sir said Allenby gratefully I ll leave this place all right just shut the door sir and don t you bother about it any more However did you dare Jim breathed Norah as the cleaning party moved towards the dining room Do you think a butler ever washed a floor before Can t say said Jim easily I m regarding him more as a sergeant than a butler for the moment not that I can remember seeing a sergeant wash a floor either But he seemed anxious to help so why not let him It won t hurt him he s getting disgracefully fat And there s plenty to do Heaps said Wally cheerily Where s that floor polish Nor These boards want a rub What are you going to do Polish brass said Norah beginning on a window catch When I grow up I think I ll be an architect and then I ll make the sort of house that women will care to live in What sort s that asked Jim I don t know what the outside will be like But it won t have any brass to keep clean or any skirting boards with pretty tops to catch dust or any corners in the rooms Brownie and I used to talk about it All the cupboards will be built in so s no dust can get under them and the windows will have some patent dodge to open inwards when they want cleaning And there ll be built in washstands in every room with taps and plugs Brass taps queried Wally Certainly not What then Oh something Something that doesn t need to be kept pretty And then there will be heaps of cupboard room and heaps of shelf room only all the shelves will be narrow so that nothing can be put behind anything else Whatever do you mean asked Jim She means dead mice you know they get behind bottles of jam said Wally kindly Go on Nor you talk like a book Well dead mice are as good as anything said Norah lucidly There won t be any room for their corpses on my shelves And I ll have some arrangement for supplying hot water through the house that doesn t depend on keeping a huge kitchen fire alight That s a good notion said Jim sitting back on his heels blacklead brush in hand I think I ll go architecting with you Nor We ll go in for all sorts of electric dodges plugs in all the rooms to fix to vacuum cleaners you can work with one hand most of em want two men and a boy and electric washing machines and cookers and fans and all kinds of things And everybody will be using them so electricity will have to be cheap I really couldn t help listening to you said a deep voice in the doorway Every one jumped It was Miss de Lisle in her skimpy red overall rather more flushed than usual and a little embarrassed I hope you don t mind she said I heard voices and I didn t think any one lived here I knocked but you were all so busy you didn t hear me So busy talking you mean laughed Wally Terrible chatterboxes Jim and Norah they never get any work done A blacklead brush hurtled across the room he caught it neatly and returned it to the owner But you re working terribly hard said the cook lady in bewilderment Is any one going to live here Norah explained briefly Miss de Lisle listened with interest nodding her head from time to time It s a beautiful idea she said at length Fancy now you rescuing those poor little children and their father and mother It makes me feel quite sentimental Most cooks are sentimental you know it s such a a warm occupation she added vaguely When I m cooking something that requires particular care I always find myself crooning a love song At which Wally collapsed into such a hopeless giggle that Jim and Norah in little better case themselves looked at him in horror expecting to see him annihilated To their relief Miss de Lisle grinned cheerfully Oh yes you may laugh she said whereupon they all did I know I don t look sentimental Perhaps it s just as well nobody would want a cook with golden hair and languishing blue eyes And I do cook so much better than I sing Now I m going to help What can I do Indeed you re not said Norah Thanks ever so Miss de Lisle but we can manage quite well Now you re thinking of what I said the other day said Miss de Lisle disgustedly I know I did say my province was cooking and nothing else But if you knew the places I ve struck Dear me there was one place where the footman chucked me under the chin It was too much for the others They sat down on the floor and shrieked in unison Yes I know it s funny said Miss de Lisle I howled myself after it was all over But I don t think the footman ever chucked any one under the chin again I settled him There was a reminiscent gleam in her eye Norah felt a flash of sympathy for the hapless footman Then there was another house that was a duke s where the butler expected me to walk out with him That s the worst of it if you behave like a human being you get that sort of thing and if you don t you re a pig and treated accordingly She looked at them whimsically Please don t think me a pig she said I I shall never forget how you held the door open for me mister Jim Oh I say don t protested the unhappy Jim turning scarlet Now you re afraid I m going to be sentimental but I m not I m going to polish the boards in the passage and then you can give me another job Lunch is cold to day I ve done all the cooking Now please don t as Norah began to protest Dear me if you only knew how nice it is to speak to some one again She swooped upon Wally s tin of floor polish scooped half of its contents into the lid with a hair pin commandeered two cloths from a basketful of cleaning matters and strode off From the passage came a steady pounding that spoke of as much elbow grease as polish being applied Did you ever said Jim weakly Never said Wally I say I think she s a good sort So do I But who d have thought it Poor old soul said Norah She must be most horribly dull But after our first day I wouldn t have dared to make a remark to her unless she d condescended to address me first I should think you wouldn t said Wally But she s really quite human when she tucks her claws in Oh my aunt said Jim chuckling I d give a month s pay to have seen the footman chuck her under the chin They fell into convulsions of silent laughter From the passage as they regained composure came a broken melody punctuated by the dull pounding on the floor Miss de Lisle on her knees had become sentimental and warbled as she rubbed I do not ask for the heart of thy heart Why wouldn t you murmured Wally with a rapt expression Any one who can make pikelets like you Be quiet Wally grinned Jim She ll hear you Not she she s too happy Listen All that I a a sk for is all that may be All that thou ca a a rest to give unto me I do not ask Crash Bang Splash Heavens what s happened exclaimed Jim They rushed out At the end of the passage Miss de Lisle and the irreproachable Allenby struggled in a heap in an ever widening pool of water that came from an overturned bucket lying a yard away The family rushed to the rescue Allenby got to his feet as they arrived and dragged up the drenched cook lady He was pale with apprehension I I do beg your pardon mum he gasped I adn t an idea in me ead there was any one there least of all you on your knees I just come backin out with the bucket I say Miss de Lisle are you hurt Jim asked anxiously Not a bit which is queer considering Allenby s weight returned Miss de Lisle But it s it s just t too funny isn t it She broke into a shout of laughter and the others who had indeed been choking with repressed feeling followed suit Allenby after a gallant attempt to preserve the correct demeanour of a butler unchanged by any circumstance suddenly bolted into the kitchen like a rabbit They heard strange sounds from the direction of the sink But I say you re drenched said Jim when every one felt a little better Miss de Lisle glanced at her stained and dripping overall Well a little I ll take this off she said suiting the action to the word and appearing in a white blouse and grey skirt which suited her very much better than the roseate garment But my floor And I had it so beautifully polished she raised her voice Allenby What are you going to do about this floor Indeed mum I ve made a pretty mess of it said Allenby reappearing You have indeed said she But I never expected to find you ere a polishin said the bewildered ex sergeant And I certainly never expected to find the butler scrubbing retorted Miss de Lisle at which Allenby s jam dropped and he cast an appealing glance at Jim This is a working bee said Jim promptly We re all in it and no one else knows anything about it Not missus Atkins I hope sir said Allenby Certainly not As for Sarah she s out of it altogether Allenby sighed a relieved butler I ll see to the floor sir he said It s up to me isn t it And polish it after I can easy slip down ere for a couple of hours after lunch when you re all out ridin Then I really had better fly said Miss de Lisle I am pretty wet and there s lunch to think about She looked at them in friendly fashion Thank you all very much she said and was gone with a kind of elephantine swiftness The family returned to the dining room leaving Allenby to grapple with the swamp in the passage Don t we have cheery adventures when we clean house said Wally happily I wouldn t have missed this morning for anything No it has been merry and bright Jim agreed And isn t the cook lady a surprise packet I say Nor do you think you d find a human side to missus Atkins if we let Allenby fall over her with a bucket of water Fraid not said Norah You can t find what doesn t exist said Wally wisely missus Atkins is only a walking cruet sort of mixture of salt and vinegar They told the story to mister Linton over the luncheon table after Allenby had withdrawn Nevertheless the butler listening from his pantry to the shouts of laughter from the morning room had a fairly good idea of the subject under discussion and became rather pink It s lovely in another way Norah finished For you see I thought Miss de Lisle wasn t human but I was all wrong She s rather a dear when you come to know her Yes said her father thoughtfully But you ll have to be careful Norah you mustn t make any distinctions between her and missus Atkins It doesn t matter if Miss de Lisle s pedigree is full of dukes and bishops missus Atkins is the upper servant and she ll resent it if you put Miss de Lisle on a different footing to herself Yes I see said Norah nodding I ll do my best Dad Miss de Lisle however played the game She did not encounter Norah often and when she did it was in missus Atkins presence and on these occasions she maintained an attitude of impersonal politeness which made it hard to realize that she and the butler had indeed bathed together on the floor of the cottage She found various matters in her little sitting room an easy chair a flowering pot plant a pile of books that bore Norah s name or Jim s but she made no sign of having received them except that Norah found on her table at night a twisted note in a masculine hand that said Thank you C de L As for missus Atkins she made her silent way about the house sour and watchful her green eyes rather resembling those of a cat and her step as stealthy Norah tried hard to talk to her on other matters than housekeeping but found her so stolidly unresponsive that at last she gave up the attempt Life as she said to Wally was too short to woo a cruet stand The week flew by swiftly every moment busy with work and plans for the Tired People to come missus Atkins it was plain did not like the scheme She mentioned that it would make a great deal of work and how did Norah expect servants in these days to put up with unexpected people coming at all sorts of hours But said Norah that s what the house is for My father and I would not want a houseful of servants if we didn t mean to have a houseful of people What would we do with you all At which missus Atkins sniffed and replied haughtily that she had been in a place where there was only one lady and she kept eleven servants More shame for her said Norah Anyhow we explained it all to you when we engaged you missus Atkins If we weren t going to have people here we should still be living in London in a flat And if the servants won t do their work we shall just have to get others who will Which was a terrible effort of firmness for poor Norah who inwardly hoped that missus Atkins did not realize that she was shaking in her shoes Easier said than done in war time said the housekeeper morosely Servants don t grow on gooseberry bushes now and what they don t expect Well I don t know what the world s coming to But Norah feeling unequal to more fled and being discovered by Wally and Jim with her head in her hands over an account book was promptly taken out on Killaloe the boys riding the cobs which they untruthfully persisted that they preferred Then came Tuesday morning with early breakfast and the boys once more in khaki and Jones in the carriage keeping the browns moving in the chill air Not such a hard parting as others they had known since for the present there was no anxiety but from the days when Jim used to leave Billabong for his Melbourne boarding school good bye morning had been a difficult one for the Lintons They joked through it in their usual way it was part of the family creed to keep the flag flying Well you may have us back at any time as your first Tired People said Wally his keen face looking as though it never could grow weary Machine gun courses must be very fatiguing don t you think Jim Poor dears said Norah feelingly We ll have a special beef tea diet for you and bath chairs Will they send you in an ambulance Very likely and then you ll be sorry you were so disrespectful won t she mister Linton I m afraid you can t count on it said that gentleman laughing Norah s bump of respect isn t highly developed even for me You ll write soon Jim and tell us how you get on and what your next movements are Rather answered Jim Don t let the lady of the house wear off all her curls over the accounts will you Dad I d hate to see her bald I ll keep an eye on her said his father Now boys it s time you were off They shook hands with Allenby to his secret gratification He closed the carriage door upon them and stood back at attention as they drove off From an upper window unseen unfortunately a figure in a red overall leaned waving a handkerchief The train was late and they all stamped about the platform it was a frosty morning Buck up old kiddie said Jim We ll be home in no time And look after Dad Yes rather said Norah Send me all your socks when they want darning which is every week Right They looked at each other with the blank feeling of having nothing to say that comes on station platforms or on the decks of ships before the final bell rings Then the train came in sight the elderly porter expectant of a tip bustled mightily with suit cases and kit bags and presently they were gone The two brown faces hung out of the carriage window until the train disappeared round a curve Norah and her father looked at each other Well my girl said he Now I suppose we had better begin our job They went out to the carriage Just as they were getting in the ancient porter hurried after them There s some people come by that train for you sir The Lintons turned A thin man with sad Irish eyes was limping out of the station Behind him came two girls Why it s Con Norah cried It is miss said the chauffeur And the gerrls I have with me Bridie and Katty But you didn t write mister Linton said Well indeed I was that rushed an we gettin off said Con But I give Patsy Burke the money and towld him to send the wire But tis the way with Patsy he ll likely think it ll do in a day or two as well as any time And as a matter of fact the telegram duly arrived three days later by which time the new arrivals had shaken down and there seemed some prospect of domestic peace in the Home for Tired People CHAPTER VI KIDNAPPING missus Hunt came slowly down the steps of a Park Lane mansion now used as an officers hospital She was tired and dispirited her steps dragged as she made her way towards Piccadilly Beneath her veil her pretty face showed white with lines of anxiety deepening it An officer hurrying by stopped and came eagerly to speak to her How are you missus Hunt And how s the Major Not very well said missus Hunt answering the second part of the question The operation was more successful than any he has had yet but there has been a good deal of pain and he doesn t seem to pick up strength The doctors say that his hand now depends a good deal upon his general health he ought to live in the country forget that there s a war on and get thoroughly fit She sighed It s so easy for doctors to prescribe these little things Yes they all do it said the other a captain in Major Hunt s regiment May I go to see him do you think Oh do missus Hunt answered It will cheer him up and anything that will do that is good He s terribly depressed poor old boy She said good bye and went on wearily It was a warm afternoon for October Norah Linton and her father had come up to London by an early train and after much shopping had lunched at a little French restaurant in Soho where they ate queer dishes and talked exceedingly bad French to the pretty waitress It was four o clock when they found themselves at the door of a dingy building in Bloomsbury Floor three the Hunts flat Daddy said Norah consulting a note book I suppose there is a lift There was a lift but it was out of order a grimy card tucked into the lattice of the doorway proclaimed the fact So they mounted flight after flight of stairs and finally halted before a doorway bearing Major Hunt s card A slatternly maid answered their ring missus Hunt s out she said curtly Gorn to see the Mijor Oh will she be long Don t think so she s general lly home about half past four Will yer wait Norah looked at her father Oh yes we ll wait he said They followed the girl into a narrow passage close and airless and smelling of Irish stew Sounds of warfare came from behind a closed door a child began to cry loudly and a boy s voice was heard angry and tired The maid ushered the visitors into a dingy little drawing room Norah stopped her as she was departing Could I see the children The girl hesitated They re a bit untidy she said sullenly I ain t had no time to clean em up There ain t no one to take them for a walk to day Oh never mind how untidy they are said Norah hastily Do send them in Oh all right said the girl You ll tell the missus it was you arsked for em won t yer Yes of course She went out and the Lintons looked at each other and then at the hopeless little room The furniture was black horsehair very shiny and hard and slippery there was a gimcrack bamboo overmantel with much speckled glass and the pictures were of the kind peculiar to London lodging houses apt to promote indigestion in the beholder There was one little window looking out upon a blank courtyard and a dirty little side street where children played and fought incessantly and stray curs nosed the rubbish in the gutters in the hope of finding food There was nothing green to be seen nothing clean nothing pleasant Oh poor kiddies said Norah under her breath The door opened and they came in not shyly the London child is seldom shy but frankly curious and in the case of the elder two with suspicion Three white faced mites as children well may be who have spent a London summer in a Bloomsbury square where the very pavements sweat tar and the breathless sticky heat is as cruel by night as by day A boy of six straight and well grown with dark hair and eyes who held by the hand a small toddling person with damp rings of golden hair behind them a slender little girl a little too shadowy for a mother s heart to be easy with big brown eyes peeping elfishly from a cloud of brown curls The boy spoke sullenly Eva told us to come in he said We wanted you to take care of us said Norah You see your mother isn t here But we can t have tea said the boy Eva says she isn t cleaned up yet and besides there s no milk and very likely Mother ll forget the cakes she said But we don t want tea said Norah We had a big lunch not so long ago And besides we ve got something nicer than tea It s in his pocket She nodded at her father who suddenly smiled in the way that made every child love him and fishing in his pocket drew out a square white box at sight of which the baby said delightedly Choc and a kind of incredulous wonder rather pitiful to see came into the eyes of Geoffrey and his sister There s a very difficult red ribbon on this said mister Linton fumbling with it I can t undo it He smiled at little Alison You show me how She was across the room in a flash the baby at her heels while Geoffrey made a slow step or two and then stopped again But you don t undone it tall she said It sticks on top You breaks this paper pointing to the seal and then it undones himself You re quite right said mister Linton as the lid came off So it does How did you know We did have lots of boxes when we lived with the wegiment said the small girl but now the wegiment s in Fwance and Daddy doesn t have enough pennies for chocs Her busy fingers tossed aside tissue paper and silver wrapping until the brown rows of sweets were revealed Then she put her hands by her sides Is we to have some Oh you poor little soul said David Linton hurriedly and caught her up on his knee He held the box in front of her Now which sort do you think is best for weeshy boys like that he asked indicating the baby who was making silent dives in the direction of the box And which do you like and Geoffrey Michael likes these She fished one out carefully and Michael fell upon it sitting on the carpet that he might devour it at his ease And Geoff and me oh we likes any tall Then you shall have any at all He held out his free hand Come on Geoff And the boy who had hesitated digging one foot into the carpet suddenly capitulated and came Are you an officer he asked presently No I m too old said David Linton But I have a big son who is one and another boy too What s their regiment The same as your father s Truly A sparkle came into the boy s eyes I m going to be in it some day Of course you will and Michael too I suppose And then you ll fight the Germans that is if there are any left Daddy says there won t be But I keep hoping there ll be just a few for me and Michael Alison wants some too said that lady Wants to kill vem wiv my wevolver A nice young fire eater you are said mister Linton laughing Girls can t kill Germans silly said Geoffrey scornfully They have to stop at home and make bandages To which his sister replied calmly Shan t I m going to kill forty leven with an air of finality which seemed to end the discussion Norah checked any further warlike reflections by finding a new layer of sweets as attractive as those on top and the three heads clustered over the box in a pleasant anxiety of selection The carriages on the Tube railway had been very stuffy that afternoon missus Hunt emerged thankfully from the crowded lift which shot up the passengers from underground She came with slow step into the dusty street The flat was not far away that was one comfort But she sighed impatiently as she entered the building to be confronted with the Not Working legend on the lift Little wretch she said alluding to the absent lift boy I m sure he s only playing pitch and toss round the corner She toiled up the three long flights of stairs her dainty soul revolting at their unswept dinginess Stella Hunt had been brought up in a big house on a wind swept Cumberland fell and there was no day in crowded Bloomsbury when she did not long for the clean open spaces of her girlhood She let herself into the flat with her latch key Voices came to her from the sitting room with a gurgle of laughter from little Michael She frowned Eva should not have let the children in there she thought anxiously They may do some damage She opened the door hurriedly No one noticed her for a moment David Linton with Alison on one knee and Geoffrey on the other was deep in a story of kangaroo hunting On the floor sat Norah with Michael tucked into her lap his face blissful as she told on his fat fingers the tale of the little pigs who went to market The box of chocolates was on the table its scarlet ribbon making a bright spot of colour in the drab room The mother looked for a minute in silence something of the weariness dying out of her eyes Then Geoffrey looked up and saw her a slight figure holding a paper bag Hallo he said I m glad you didn t forget the cakes cause we ve got people to tea mister Linton placed his burden on the hearthrug and got up How are you missus Hunt I hope you don t mind our taking possession like this We wanted to get acquainted I could wish they were cleaner said missus Hunt laughing as she shook hands I ve seldom seen three grubbier people Geoff dear couldn t Eva have washed your face She said she hadn t time said Geoffrey easily We tried to wash Michael but he only got more streaky Oh please don t mind missus Hunt Norah pleaded They ve been such darlings I m afraid I don t mind at all said missus Hunt sitting down thankfully I ve been picturing my poor babies tired to death of not being out and then to come home and find them in the seventh heaven She broke off her lip quivering a little You re just as tired as you can be said Norah Now you re going to rest and Geoff will show me how to get tea Oh I couldn t let you into that awful little kitchen said missus Hunt hastily And besides I m awfully sorry I don t believe the milkman has been yet I could go to the milk shop round the corner with a jug said Geoffrey anxiously Do let s Mother Is there one Norah asked Now missus Hunt do rest make her put her feet up on the sofa Dad And Geoff and I will go for milk and I ll ask Eva to make tea Can she Oh of course she can said missus Hunt ceasing to argue the point But she s never fit to be seen That doesn t matter said David Linton masterfully We ve seen her once and survived the shock Just put your feet up and tell me all about your husband Norah will see to things Eva however was found to have risen to the situation She had used soap and water with surprising effect and now bloomed in a fresh cap and an apron that had plainly done duty a good many times but being turned inside out still presented a decent front to the world She scorned help in preparing tea but graciously permitted Norah to wash the three children and brush their hair and indicated where clean overalls might be found Then escorted by all three Norah sallied forth jug in hand and found not only the milk shop but another where cakes and scones so clamoured to be bought that they all returned laden with paper bags Eva had made a huge plate of buttered toast so that the meal which presently made its appearance on the big table in the drawing room might well have justified the query as to whether indeed a war were in progress missus Hunt laughed rather mirthlessly I suppose I ought to protest but I m too tired she said And it is very nice to be taken care of again Michael you should have bread and butter first Vere isn t any said Alison with triumph Norah was tucking a feeder under Michael s fat chin Now he s my boy for a bit not yours at all missus Hunt she said laughing Forget them all I m going to be head nurse And missus Hunt lay back thankfully and submitted to be waited on while the shouts of laughter from the tea table smoothed away a few more lines from her face and made even Eva feasting on unaccustomed cakes in the kitchen smile grimly and murmur Lor ain t they avin a time Not until tea was over and the children busy with picture books that had come mysteriously from another of his pockets did David Linton unfold his plan and then he did it somewhat nervously We want to take you all out of this missus Hunt he said There s a little cottage a jolly little thatched place close to our house that is simply clamouring to have you all come and live in it I think it will hold you all comfortably Will you come missus Hunt flushed Don t talk to poor Bloomsbury people of such heavenly things as thatched cottages she said We have this horrible abode on a long lease and I don t see any chance of leaving it Oh never mind the lease we ll sub let it for you said mister Linton He told her briefly of John O Neill s bequest to Norah I want you to put it out of your head that you re accepting the slightest favour he went on We feel that we only hold the place in trust the cottage is there empty and indeed it is you who will be doing us the favour by coming to live in it Oh I couldn t she said breathlessly Just think of it missus Hunt Norah knelt down by the hard little horsehair sofa There s a big lawn in front and a summer house where the babies could play and a big empty attic for them on wet days and heaps of fresh milk and you could keep chickens and the sitting room catches all the sun and when Major Hunt comes out of the hospital it would be so quiet and peaceful He could lie out under the trees on fine days on a rush lounge and there are jolly woods for him to walk in The poor wife caught her breath And he d be such tremendous company for Dad and I know you d help me when I got into difficulties with my cook lady There s a little stream and a tiny lake and When is we goin Muvver The question was Alison s put with calm certainty She and Geoffrey had stolen near and were listening with eager faces Oh my darling I m afraid we can t said missus Hunt tremulously But the big girl says we can When is we going Oh Mother said Geoffrey very low Away from here He caught her hand Oh say we re going Mother darling Of course she ll say it David Linton said The only question is how soon can you be ready Douglas is terribly proud missus Hunt said I am afraid I couldn t be proud But he will never accept a favour I know it would be no use to ask him Then we won t ask him said David Linton calmly When does he leave the hospital This day week if he is well enough Then we ll have you comfortably installed long before that We won t tell him a thing about it on the day he s to come out I ll go for him in the motor and whisk him down to Homewood before he realizes where he s going Now be sensible missus Hunt as she tried to speak You know what his state is how anxious you are you told me all about it just now Can you in justice to him refuse to come can you face bringing him back here Geoffrey suddenly burst into sobs Oh don t Mother he choked You know how he hates it And trees and grass and woods and He hid his face on her arm An tsickens said Alison An ackits to play in You re in a hopeless minority you see missus Hunt said mister Linton You ll have to give in missus Hunt put her arms round the two children who were pressing against her in their eagerness whereupon Michael raised a wrathful howl and flung himself bodily upon them ejaculating Wants to be hugged too Over the three heads the mother looked up at her visitors Yes I give in she said I m not brave enough not to But I don t know what Douglas will say I ll attend to Douglas said mister Linton cheerfully Now how soon can you come He frowned severely There s to be no question of house cleaning here I ll put in people to do that You ll have your husband to nurse next week and I won t have you tiring yourself out beforehand So you have only to pack Look missus Hunt Norah was flushed with another brilliant idea Let us take the babies down to day I m sure they will come with me Then you and Eva will have nothing to do but pack up your things Oh I couldn t missus Hunt began Ah yes you could She turned to the children Geoff will you all come with my Daddy and me and get the cottage ready for Mother Geoffrey hesitated Would you come soon Mother I I believe if I had nothing else to do I could leave the flat to morrow missus Hunt said submitting Would you all be happy Geoff and very good Yes if you d hurry up and come You ll be a good kid Alison won t you Ess said Alison Will I see tsickens Ever so many Norah said And Michael will be a darling and we ll all sleep together in one big room and have pillow fights You had certainly better come soon before your family s manners become ruined missus Hunt said mister Linton laughing Then you can really manage to get away to morrow Very well I ll call for you about five if that will do Yes that will give me time to see Douglas first But you won t tell him anything Oh no he would only worry Of course mister Linton I shall be able to get up to see him every day We re less than an hour by rail he told her And the trains are good Now I think you had better pack up those youngsters and I ll get a taxi Norah helped to pack the little clothes trying hard to remember instructions as to food and insistence on good manners Oh I know you ll spoil them said missus Hunt resignedly Poor mites they could do with a bit of spoiling they have had a dreary year But I think they will be good they have been away with my sister sometimes and she gives them a good character The children said good bye to their mother gaily enough the ride in the motor was sufficient excitement to smooth out any momentary dismay at parting Only Geoffrey sat up very straight with his lips tightly pressed together He leaned from the window Norah gripping his coat anxiously You ll be true certain to come to morrow Mother I promise she said Good bye old son Mother always keeps her promises so it s all right he said leaning back with a little smile Alison had no worries She sang Hi diddle diddle loud and clear as they rushed through the crowded streets When a block in the traffic came people on buses looked down smiling involuntarily at the piping voice coming from the recesses of the taxi As for Michael he sat on Norah s knee and sucked his thumb in complete content Jones met them at the end of the little journey His lips involuntarily shaped themselves to a whistle of amazement as the party filed out of the station though to the credit of his training be it recorded that no sound came Geoffrey caught his breath with delight at the sight of the brown cobs Oh h Are they yours Yes aren t they dears responded Norah The boy caught her hand Oh could I possibly sit in front and look at them Norah laughed Could he Jones Would you take care of him E d be as safe as in a cradle Miss Norah said Jones delightedly Come on up sir and I ll show you ow to drive mister Linton swung him up smiling at the transfigured little face Norah had already got her charges into the carriage a porter stowed away their trunk and the horses trotted off through the dusk I didn t ever want to get out Geoffrey confided to Norah as they went up the steps to the open door of Homewood That kind man let me hold the end of the reins And he says he ll show me more horses to morrow There s a pony too we ll teach you to ride it said mister Linton Whereat Geoffrey gasped with joy and became speechless Well have you got them all tucked up asked mister Linton when Norah joined him in the morning room an hour later Oh yes they were so tired poor mites Bride helped me to bathe them and we fed them all on bread and milk with lots of cream Michael demanded Mummy but he was too sleepy to worry much But Dad Geoff wants you badly to say good night He says his own Daddy always says it to him when he s in bed Would you mind Right said her father He went upstairs with Norah at his heels and tiptoed into the big room where two of his three small guests were already sleeping soundly He looked very tall as he stood beside the little bed in the corner Geoff s bright eyes peeped up at him It was awful good of you to come he said sleepily Daddy does He says Good night old chap and God bless you Good night old chap and God bless you said David Linton gravely He held the small hand a moment in his own and then stooping brushed his forehead with his lips God bless you said Geoff s drowsy voice I m going going to ride the pony to morrow His words trailed off in sleep CHAPTER VII THE THATCHED COTTAGE But for the narrow white beds you would hardly have thought that the big room was a hospital ward In days before all the world was caught into a whirlpool of war it had been a ballroom A famous painter had made the vaulted ceiling an exquisite thing of palest blush roses and laughing Cupids tumbling among vine leaves and tendrils The white walls bore long panels of the same design There were no fittings for light visible when darkness fell the touch of a button flooded the room with a soft glow coming from some unseen source in the carved cornice The shining floor bore heavy Persian rugs and there were tables heaped with books and magazines and the nurses who flitted in and out were all dainty and good to look at All about the room were splendid palms in pots from giants twenty feet high to lesser ones the graceful leaves of which could just catch the eye of a tired man in bed fresh from the grim ugliness of the trenches It was the palms you saw as you came in not the beds here and there among them A good many of the patients were up this afternoon for this was a ward for semi convalescents Not all were fully dressed they moved about in dressing gowns or lay on the sofas or played games at the little tables One man was in uniform Major Hunt who sat in a big chair near his bed and from time to time cast impatient glances at the door Wish we weren t going to lose you Major said a tall man in a purple dressing gown who came up the ward with wonderful swiftness considering that he was on crutches But I expect you re keen to go Oh yes though I ll miss this place Major Hunt cast an appreciative glance down the beautiful room It has been great luck to be here there are not many hospitals like this in England But well even if home is only a beastly little flat in Bloomsbury it is home and I shall be glad to get back to my wife and the youngsters I miss the kids horribly Yes one does said the other I daresay I ll find them something of a crowd on wet days when they can t get out said Major Hunt laughing The flat is small and my wretched nerves are all on edge But I want them badly for all that And it s rough on my wife to be so much alone She has led a kind of wandering life since war broke out sometimes we ve been able to have the kids with us but not always He stretched himself wearily Gad how glad I ll be when the Boche is hammered and we re able to have a decent home again We re all like that said the other man I ve seen my youngsters twice in the last year Yes you re worse off than I am said Major Hunt He looked impatiently towards the door fidgeting I wish Stella would come But when a nurse brought him a summons presently and he said good bye to the ward and went eagerly down to the ground floor in an electric lift worked by an earl s daughter in a very neat uniform it was not his wife who awaited him in a little white and gold sitting room but a very tall man looking slightly apologetic Your wife is perfectly well said David Linton checking the quick inquiry that rose to the soldier s lips But I persuaded her to give me the job of calling for you to day our car is rather more comfortable than a taxi and the doctor thought it would be a good thing for you to have a little run first Major Hunt tried not to look disappointed and failed signally It s awfully good of you he said courteously But I don t believe I m up to much yet and I m rather keen on getting home If you wouldn t mind going there direct David Linton cast an appealing look at the nurse who had accompanied her patient She rose to the occasion promptly Now Major Hunt she protested Doctor s orders You promised to take all the exercise you could and a run in the car would be the very thing for you Oh very well Major Hunt s voice was resigned David Linton leaned towards him I ll make it as short as I can he said confidentially They said good bye and emerged into Park Lane where the big blue motor waited Afraid you must think me horribly rude said the soldier as they started Fact is I m very anxious to see my youngsters I don t know why but Stella wouldn t bring them to the hospital to see me this last week But it s certainly jolly to be out again He leaned back enjoying the comfort of the swift car I suppose he hesitated it would be altogether too much trouble to go round by the flat and pick up my wife and Geoff They would love a run Oh Ah The flat yes the flat said David Linton a little wildly I m afraid that is we should be too early missus Hunt would not expect us so soon and she er she meant to be out with all the children Shopping Fatted calf for the prodigal s return don t you know Awfully sorry Oh it s quite all right said Major Hunt looking rather amazed Only she doesn t generally take them all out But of course it doesn t matter I ll tell you what said his host regaining his composure We ll take all of you out to morrow missus Hunt and the three youngsters as well as yourself The car will hold all Major Hunt thanked him rather wearily They sped on leaving the outskirts of London behind them Up and down long suburban roads beyond the trail of motor buses until the open country gleamed before them The soldier took a long breath of the sweet air Gad it s good to see fields again he said Presently he glanced at the watch on his wrist Nearly time to turn don t you think he said I don t want Stella to be waiting long Very soon said mister Linton Just a little more country air The chauffeur has his orders I won t keep you much longer He racked his brains anxiously for a moment and then plunged into a story of Australia a story in which bushrangers blacks and bushfires mingled so amazingly that it was impossible not to listen to it Having once secured his hapless guest s attention he managed to leave the agony of invention and to slide gracefully to cattle mustering about which it was not necessary to invent anything Major Hunt became interested and asked a few questions and they were deep in a comparison of the ways of handling cattle on an Australian run and a Texan ranch when the car suddenly turned in at a pair of big iron gates and whirled up a drive fringed with trees Major Hunt broke off in the middle of a sentence Hallo Where are we going I have to stop at a house here for an instant said mister Linton Just a moment I won t keep you Major Hunt frowned He was tired the car was wonderfully comfortable but the rush through the keen air was wearying to a semi invalid and he was conscious of a feeling of suppressed irritation He wanted to be home The thought of the hard little sofa in the London flat suddenly became tempting he could lie there and talk to the children and watch Stella moving about Now they were miles into the country long miles that must be covered again before he was back in Bloomsbury He bit his lips to restrain words that might not seem courteous I should really be very grateful if He stopped The car had turned into a side avenue he caught a glimpse of a big many gabled house away to the right Then they turned a corner and the car came to a standstill with her bonnet almost poking into a great clump of rhododendrons There was a thatched cottage beside them And round the corner tore a small boy in a sailor suit with his face alight with a very ecstasy of welcome Daddy Oh Daddy Geoff said Major Hunt amazedly But how I don t understand There were other people coming round the corner his wife tall and slender with her eyes shining behind her Norah Linton with Alison trotting beside her and Michael perched on one shoulder At sight of his father Michael drummed with his heels to Norah s great discomfort and uttered shrill squeaks of joy Come on said Geoffrey breathlessly tugging at the door Come on they re all here Come on Hunt said David Linton jumping out Let me help you mind your hand I suppose I ll wake up in a moment said Major Hunt getting out slowly At present it s a nice dream I don t understand anything How are you Miss Linton You don t need to wake up said his wife in a voice that shook a little Her brave eyes were misty Only you re home It s the loveliest home Daddy Geoff s hand was in his father s pulling him on There s tsickens said Alison in a high pipe An a ackit wiv toys She means an attic said Geoffrey scornfully Come on Daddy We ve got such heaps to show you Somehow they found themselves indoors Norah and her father had disappeared they were all together father mother and babies in a big room flooded with sunlight a room covered with a thick red matting with heavy rugs on it a room with big easy chairs and gate legged tables and a wide couch heaped with bright cushions drawn close to an open casement There was a fire of logs crackling cheerily in the wide fireplace there were their own belongings photographs books his own pipe rack and tobacco jar there were flowers everywhere smiling a greeting Tea cups and silver sparkled on a white cloth a copper kettle bubbled over a spirit lamp And there were his own people clinging round him welcoming holding him wherever little hands could grasp the babies fresh clean even rosy his wife s face no longer tired And there was no Bloomsbury anywhere Major Hunt sat down on the sofa disentangled Michael from his leg and lifted him with his good arm It isn t a dream really I suppose Stella he said I won t wake up presently I don t want to No it s just a blessed reality she told him smiling Hang up Daddy s cap Geoff steady Alison darling mind his hand Don t worry about anything Douglas only you re home I don t even want to ask questions said her husband in the same dazed voice I find one has no curiosity when one suddenly gets to heaven We won t be going away from heaven though will we No we re permanent residents she told him laughing Now get quite comfy we ll all have tea together Tea s is lovely here confided Alison to him They s cweam an cakes evewy day An the tsickens make weal eggs in nesses And I can ride A pony Daddy Geoffrey s voice was quivering with pride He stood by the couch an erect little figure Why he s grown ever so much said Major Hunt They ve all grown you too my little fat Michael I left white faced babies in that beastly flat And you too She bent over him Your dear eyes have forgotten the old War he said very low There was a heavy knock at the door Entered Eva resplendent in a butterfly cap and an apron so stiffly starched that it stood away resentfully from her figure By no stretch of imagination could Eva ever have been called shy but she had a certain amount of awe for her master and found speech in his presence a little difficult But on this occasion it was evident that she felt that something was demanded of her She put her burden of buttered toast on a trivet in the fender and said breathlessly Ope I see yer well sir And ain t this a nice s prise Thank you Eva yes said Major Hunt Whereat the handmaiden withdrew her heavy tread retreating to the kitchen to the accompaniment of song Ow Ow Ow it s a lovely War I didn t know her for a moment Major Hunt said laughing You see she never had less than six smuts on her face in Bloomsbury She s transformed like all of you in this wonderful dream Tea isn t a dream said his wife She made it in the silver tea pot and they all fluttered about him persuading him to eat and made his tea a matter of some difficulty since all three children insisted on getting as close to him as possible and he had but one good hand He did not mind Once as his wife brought him a refilled cup she saw him lean his face down until it rested for a moment on the gold rings of Michael s hair It was with some anxiety that Norah and her father went to call on their guest next morning What will we do if he s stiff necked and proud Dad Norah asked I simply couldn t part with those babies now Let s hope he won t be said her father But if the worst comes to worst we could let him pay us a little rent for the place we could give the money to the Red Cross of course M said Norah wrinkling her nose expressively That would be horrid it would spoil all the idea of the place But they found Major Hunt surprisingly meek I daresay that if you had propounded the idea to me at first I should have said No flatly he admitted But I haven t the heart to disturb them all now and frankly I m too thankful If you ll let me pay you rent Certainly not said mister Linton looking astonished and indignant We don t run our place on those lines Just put it out of your head that we have anything to do with it You re taking nothing from us only from a man who died very cheerfully because he was able to do five minutes work towards helping the War He s helping it still if his money makes it easier for fellows like you and I believe wherever he is he knows and is glad But there are others who may need it more said Hunt weakly If there are I haven t met them yet mister Linton responded He glanced out of the window Look there now Hunt Norah had slipped away leaving the men to talk Now she came riding up the broad gravel path across the lawn on the black pony leading the fat Welsh pony with Geoffrey on his back The small boy sat very straight with his hands well down His flushed little face sought anxiously for his father s at the window Major Hunt uttered a delighted exclamation I didn t know my urchin was so advanced he said Well done old son He scanned him keenly He doesn t sit too badly mister Linton He s not likely to do so with Norah as his teacher But Norah says he doesn t need much teaching and that he has naturally good hands She s proud of him I think said mister Linton laughing that they have visions of hunting together this winter I must go out and see him said the father catching up his cap mister Linton watched him cross the lawn with quick strides and turned to find missus Hunt at his elbow Well he doesn t look much like an invalid Madam he said smiling He s not like the same man she said with grateful eyes He slept well and ate a huge breakfast even the hand is less painful And he s so cheery Oh I m so thankful to you for kidnapping us Indeed it s you that we have to thank he told her You gave us our first chance of beginning our job CHAPTER VIII ASSORTED GUESTS I beg your pardon is this Homewood Norah practising long putts at a hole on the far side of the terrace turned with a start The questioner was in uniform bearing a captain s three stars He was a short strongly built young man with a square determined face Yes this is Homewood she answered Did you have you come to see my father I wrote to him last week the officer said from France It s Miss Linton isn t it I m in your brother s regiment My name is Garrett Oh I ve heard Jim speak of you ever so many times she cried She put out her hand and felt it taken in a close grasp But we haven t had your letter Dad would have told me if one had come Captain Garrett frowned What a nuisance he ejaculated Letters from the front are apt to take their time but I did think a week would have been long enough I wrote directly I knew my leave was coming You see your brother told me He stopped awkwardly Intelligence suddenly dawned upon Norah Why you re a Tired Person she exclaimed beaming Not at all I assure you replied he looking a trifle amazed Norah laughed I don t mean quite that she said at least I ll explain presently But you have come to stay haven t you Well your brother was good enough to He paused again Yes of course Jim told you we wanted you to come This is the Home for Tired People you see we want to get as many of you as we can and make you fit And you re our very first in the house which will make it horribly dull for you Indeed it won t said Garrett gallantly Well we ll do our best for you I m so very sorry you weren t met Did you leave your luggage at the station Yes You re quite sure it s convenient to have me Miss Linton I could easily go back to London Good gracious no said Norah Why you re a godsend We weren t justifying our name But you will be dull to day because Dad has gone to London and there s only me Norah s grammar was never her strong point And little Geoff Hunt was coming to lunch with me Will it bore you very much to have a small boy here Rather not said Garrett I like them got some young brothers of my own in Jamaica Well that s all right Now come in and Allenby will show you your room The car will bring your things up when it goes to meet Dad Norah had often rehearsed in her own mind what she would do when the first Tired Person came The rooms were all ready in assorted sizes Allenby said Norah had awful visions of eight or ten guests arriving together and in her own mind characterized the business of allotting them to their rooms as a nasty bit of drafting But the first guest had tactfully come alone and there was no doubt that he deserved the blue room a delightful little corner room looking south and west with dainty blue hangings and wall paper and a big couch that beckoned temptingly to a tired man Captain Garrett had had fourteen months in France without a break He had spent the previous night in the leave train only pausing in London for a hasty clean up The lavender scented blue room was like a glimpse of Heaven to him He did not want to leave it only that downstairs Jim Linton s sister awaited him and it appeared that the said sister was a very jolly girl with a smile like her brother s cheerful grin and a mop of brown curls framing a decidedly attractive face Bob Garrett decided that there were better things than even the blue room and having thankfully accepted Allenby s offer of a hot tub presently emerged from the house much improved in appearance This time Norah was not alone A small boy was with her who greeted the newcomer with coolness and then suddenly fell upon him excitedly recognizing the badge on his collar You re in Daddy s regiment he exclaimed Am I Garrett smiled at him Who is Daddy He s Major Hunt said Geoff and had the satisfaction of seeing the new officer become as eager as he could have wished By Jove Truly Miss Linton does Major Hunt live here I d give something to see him He lives just round the corner of that bush said Norah laughing She indicated a big rhododendron Is he at home Geoff No he s gone to London Geoff answered But he ll be back for tea Then we ll go and call on missus Hunt and ask her if we may come to tea Norah said They strolled off Geoff capering about them I don t know missus Hunt Garrett said You see I only joined the regiment when war broke out I had done a good bit of training so they gave me a commission among the first I didn t see such a lot of the Major for he was doing special work in Ireland for awhile but he was a regular brick to me We re all awfully sick about his being smashed up But he s going to get better Norah said cheerfully He s ever so much better now They came out in front of the cottage and discovered missus Hunt playing hide and seek with Alison and Michael with Alison much worried by Michael s complete inattention to anything in the shape of a rule Michael indeed declined to be hid and played on a steady line of his own which consisted in toddling after his mother whenever she was in sight and catching her with shrill squeaks of joy It was perfectly satisfactory to him but somewhat harassing to a stickler for detail missus Hunt greeted Garrett warmly Douglas has often talked about you you re from Jamaica aren t you she said He will be so delighted that you have come Yes of course you must come to tea Norah I d ask you to lunch only I m perfectly certain there isn t enough to eat And Geoff would be so disgusted at being done out of his lunch with you which makes me think it s not really your society he wants but the fearful joy of Allenby behind his chair I don t see why you should try to depress me Norah laughed Well we ll all go for a ride after lunch and get back in time for tea if you ll put up with me in a splashed habit the roads are very muddy You ride I suppose Captain Garrett Oh yes thanks Garrett answered It s the only fun I ve had in France since the battalion went back into billets a benevolent gunner used to lend me a horse both of us devoutly hoping that I wouldn t be caught riding it Was it a nice horse Geoffrey demanded Well you wouldn t call it perfect old chap I think it was suffering from shell shock anyhow it had nerves It used to shake all over when it saw a Staff officer He grinned Or perhaps I did On duty that horse was as steady as old Time but when it was alone it jumped out of its skin at anything and everything However it was great exercise to ride it We ll give him Killaloe this afternoon Geoff said Norah Come on and we ll show him the stables now They bade au revoir to missus Hunt and sauntered towards the stables On the way appeared a form in a print frock with flying cap and apron strings Did you want me Katty Norah asked There s a tallygrum after coming miss on a bicycle And the boy s waiting Norah knitted her brows over the sheet of flimsy paper There s no answer Katty tell the boy She turned to Garrett laughing You re not going to be our only guest for long Dad says he s bringing two people down to night Colonel and missus West Isn t it exciting I ll have to leave you to Geoff while I go and talk to the housekeeper Geoff show Captain Garrett all the horses Jones is at the stables Right said Geoffrey bursting with importance Come along Captain Garrett I ll let you pat my pony if you like missus Atkins looked depressed at Norah s information Dear me And dinner ordered for three she said sourly It makes a difference And of course I really had not reckoned on more than you and mister Linton I can telephone for anything you want said Norah meekly The fish will not be sufficient said the housekeeper And other things likewise I must talk to the cook It would be so much easier if one knew earlier in the day And rooms to get ready of course The big pink room with the dressing room Norah said Oh I suppose the maids can find time Those Irish maids have no idea of regular ways I found Bride helping to catch a fowl this morning when she should have been polishing the floor Now I must throw them out of routine again Norah suppressed a smile She had been a spectator of the spirited chase after the truant hen ending with the appearance of missus Atkins full of cold wrath and she had heard Bride s comment afterwards Is it her with her ould routheen Yerra that one wouldn t put a hand to a hin and it eshcapin Yes said missus Atkins Extraordinary ways Very untrained I must say But you find that they do their work don t they Norah asked Oh after a fashion said the housekeeper with a sniff unwilling to admit that Bride and Katty got through more work in two hours than Sarah in a morning were never unwilling and accepted any and every job with the utmost cheerfulness Their ways aren t my ways Very well Miss Linton I ll speak to the cook Feeling somewhat battered Norah escaped In the hall she met Katty who jumped and then broke into a smile of relief I thought twas the Ould Thing hersilf she explained She d ate the face off me if she found me here again tis only yesterday she was explaining to me that a kitchenmaid has no business in the hall at all But Bridie was tellin me ye ve the grandest ould head of an Irish elk here and I thought I d risk her to get a sight of it It s over there Norah said pointing to a mighty pair of horns on the wall behind the girl Katty looked at it in silence It s quare to think of the days when them great things walked the plains of Ireland she said at length Thank you miss it done me good to see it How are you getting on Katty Norah asked Yerra the best in the world said Katty cheerfully Miss de Lisle s that kind to me I ll be the great cook some day if I kape on watchin her She s not like the fine English cooks I ve heard of that ud no more let you see how they made so much as a pudding than they d fly over the moon Tis Bridie has the bad luck to be housemaid Norah knew why and sighed There were moments when her housekeeper seemed a burden too great to be borne But mister Allenby s very pleasant with her and she says wance you find out that Sarah isn t made of wood she s not so bad She found that out when she let fly a pillow at her and they bedmaking said Katty with a joyous twinkle Tis herself had great courage to do that same hadn t she now miss She had indeed Norah said laughing The spectacle of the stiff Sarah overwhelmed with a sudden pillow was indeed staggering And then haven t we Con to cheer us up if we get lonely said Katty And Misther Jones and the groom they re very friendly And the money we ll have to send home But you d be wishful for Ireland no matter how happy you d be The telephone bell rang sharply and Norah ran to answer it It was Jim That you Nor said his deep voice Good I m in a hurry I say can you take in a Tired Person to night Norah gasped Oh certainly she said grimly Who is it Jimmy Not you or Wally No such luck said her brother It s a chap I met last night he s just out of a convalescent home and a bit down on his luck His voice died away in a complicated jumble of whir and buzz the bell rang frantically and Norah like thousands of other people murmured her opinion of the telephone and all its works Are you there she asked B z z z z z said the telephone Norah waited a little anxiously debating whether it would be more prudent to ring up herself and demand the last speaker or to keep quiet and trust to Jim to regain his connexion Finally she decided to ring and was just about to put down the receiver when Jim s voice said Are you there in her ear sharply and once more collapsed into a whir She waited again in dead silence At last she rang Nothing happened so she rang again Number please said a bored voice Some one was speaking to me you ve cut me off said Norah frantically I ve been trying to get you for the last ten minutes You shouldn t have rung off said the voice coldly Wait please Norah swallowed her feelings and waited Hallo Hallo Hallo oh is that you Norah said Jim his tone crisp with feeling Isn t this an unspeakable machine And I m due in three minutes I must fly Sure you can have Hardress He ll get to you by the six point forty five Are you all well Yes we re all right Sorry I ll get told off horribly if I m late Good bye Norah hung up the receiver and stood pondering She wished the telephone had not chosen to behave so abominably only the day before Wally had rung her up and had spent quite half an hour in talking cheerful nonsense without any hindrance at all Norah wished she knew a little more about her new case if he were very weak if special food were needed It was very provoking Also there was missus Atkins to be faced not a prospect to be put off since like taking Gregory s Powder the more you looked at it the worse it got Norah stiffened her shoulders and marched off to the housekeeper s room Oh missus Atkins she said pleasantly there s another officer coming this evening missus Atkins turned cold surprise in her voice Indeed miss And will that be all do you think I really don t know said Norah recklessly That depends on my father you see Oh May I ask which room is to be prepared The one next Captain Garrett s please I can do it if the maids are too busy missus Atkins froze yet more I should very much rather you did not miss thank you she said Just as you like said Norah Con can take a message for anything you want he is going to the station Thank you miss I have already telephoned for larger supplies said the housekeeper The conversation seemed to have ended so Norah departed What did she ever come for she asked herself desperately If she didn t want to housekeep why does she go out as a housekeeper Turning a corner she met the butler Oh Allenby she said We ll have quite a houseful to night She told him of the expected arrivals half expecting to see his face fall Allenby on the contrary beamed It ll be almost like waiting in Mess he said When you re used to officers miss you can t get on very well without them He looked in a fatherly fashion at Norah s anxious face All the arrangements made I suppose miss Oh yes I think they re all right said Norah feeling anything but confident Allenby I don t know much about managing things do you think it s too much for the house No miss it isn t Allenby said firmly Just you leave it all to me and don t worry Nature made some people bad tempered and they can t elp it I ll see that things are all right and as for dinner all that worries Miss de Lisle as a rule is that she ain t got enough cooking to do He bent the same fatherly glance on her that evening as she came into the hall when the hoot of the motor told that her father and his consignment of Tired People were arriving Norah had managed to forget her troubles during the afternoon A long ride had been followed by a very cheerful tea at missus Hunt s from which she and Garrett had returned only in time for Norah to slip into a white frock and race downstairs to meet her guests She hoped vaguely that she looked less nervous than she felt The hall door opened letting in a breath of the cold night air Ah Norah this is my daughter missus West she heard her father s voice and then she was greeting a stout lady and a grey haired officer Dear me said the lady I expected some one grown up How brave Fancy you only what is it a flapper And don t you hate us all very much I should I m sure Over her shoulder Norah caught a glimpse of her father s face set in grim lines She checked a sudden wild desire to laugh and murmured something civil Our hostess Algernon said the stout lady and Norah shook hands with Colonel West who was short and stout and pompous and said explosively Haw Delighted Cold night what which had the effect of making his hostess absolutely speechless Somehow with the assistance of Allenby and Sarah the newcomers were drafted to their rooms and Norah and her father sought cover in the morning room You look worn Daddy said his daughter regarding him critically I feel it said David Linton He sank into an armchair and felt hurriedly for his pipe Haven t had a chance of a smoke for hours They re a little trying I think Norah Where did you get them Norah asked perching on the arm of his chair and dropping a kiss on the top of his head From the hospital where the boys were Colonel West has been ill there Brain fever missus West says but he doesn t look like it Anyhow they re hard up I believe their home is broken up and they have five or six children at school and a boy in Gallipoli They seemed very glad to come Well that s all right said Norah practically We can t expect to have every one as nice as the Hunts But they re not the only ones Dad Captain Garrett is here and Jim is sending some one called Hardress by the six point forty five unfortunately the telephone didn t allow Jim to mention what he is I hope he isn t a brigadier I don t see Jim hob nobbing to any extent with brigadiers said her father I say this is rather a shock Four in a day Yes business is looking up said Norah laughing Captain Garrett is a dear and he can ride Dad I had him out on Killaloe I m a little uneasy about the Hardress person because he s just out of a convalescent home and Jim seemed worried about him But the telephone went mad and Jim was in a hurry so I didn t get any details Oh well we ll look after him How is the household staff standing the invasion Every one s very happy except missus Atkins and she is plunged in woe Even Sarah seems interested I haven t dared to look at Miss de Lisle but Allenby says she is cheerful Has missus Atkins been unpleasant Well said Norah and laughed you wouldn t call her exactly a bright spot in the house But she has seen to things so that is all that counts I won t have that woman worry you said mister Linton firmly I won t have you worried about anything said Norah Don t think about missus Atkins or you won t enjoy your tea And here s Allenby Tea said mister Linton as the butler entered bearing a little tray I thought I was too late for such a luxury but I must say I m glad of it I sent some upstairs sir said Allenby placing a little table near his master Just a little toast sir it being so late And if you please miss Miss de Lisle would be glad if you could spare a moment in the kitchen The cook lady redder than ever was mixing a mysterious compound in a bowl Katty hugely important darted hither and thither A variety of savoury smells filled the air I just wanted to tell you said Miss de Lisle confidentially that I m making a special souffle of my own and Allenby will put it in front of you Promise me she leaned forward earnestly to use a thin spoon to help it and slide it in edgeways as gently as as if you were stroking a baby It s just a perfect thing I wouldn t sleep to night if you used a heavy spoon and plunged it in as if it was a suet pudding I won t forget Norah promised her resisting a wild desire to laugh That s a dear said the cook lady disregarding the relations of employer and employed in the heat of professional enthusiasm And you ll help it as quickly as possible won t you It will be put on the table after all the other sweets Every second will be of importance She sighed A souffle never gets a fair chance It ought of course to be put on a table beside the kitchen range and cut within two seconds of leaving the oven With a hot spoon She sighed tragically We ll do our best for it Norah promised her I m sure it will be lovely Shall I come and tell you how it looked afterwards Miss de Lisle beamed Now that would be very kind of you she said It s so seldom that any one realizes what these things mean to the cook A souffle like this is an inspiration like a sonata to a musician But no one ever dreams of the cook and the most you can expect from a butler is Oh it cut very nice ma am I m sure Very nice She made a despairing gesture But some people would call Chopin very nice Miss de Lisle said Norah earnestly some day when we haven t any guests and Dad goes to London we ll give every one else a holiday and you and I will have lunch here together And we ll have that souffle and eat it beside the range For a moment Miss de Lisle had no words Well she said at length explosively And I was so horrible to you at first To Norah s amazement and dismay a large tear trickled down one cheek and her mouth quivered like a child s Dear me how foolish I am said the poor cook lady rubbing her face with her overall and thereby streaking it most curiously with flour Thank you very much my dear Even if we never manage it I won t forget that you said it Norah found herself patting the stalwart shoulder Indeed we ll manage it she said Now don t you worry about anything but that lovely souffle Oh the souffle is assured now said Miss de Lisle beating her mixture scientifically Now I shall have beautiful thoughts to put into it You have no idea what that means Now if I sat here mixing and thought of say missus Atkins it would probably be as heavy as lead She sighed I believe Miss Linton I could teach you something of the real poetry of cooking I m sure you have the right sort of soul Norah looked embarrassed Jim says I ve no soul beyond mustering cattle she said laughing We ll prove him wrong some day Miss de Lisle shall we Now I must go the motor will be back presently She turned suddenly conscious of a baleful glance Oh missus Atkins she said feebly I came said missus Atkins stonily to see if any help was needed in the kitchen Perhaps as you are here miss you would be so good as to ask the cook Oh nothing thank you said Miss de Lisle airily over her shoulder missus Atkins sniffed and withdrew That s done it hasn t it said the cook lady Well don t worry my dear I ll see you through anything A white capped head peeped in Tis yersilf has all the luck of the place Katty O Gorman said Bride enviously An that Sarah won t give me so much as a look in above if it was to turn down the beds itself it s as much as she ll do to let me Could I give you a hand here at all Miss de Lisle God help us there s Miss Norah If tis the way you d but let her baste the turkey for a minyit she d go upstairs reshted in hersilf said Katty in a loud whisper The creature s destroyed with bein out of all the fun Oh come in if you re not afraid of missus Atkins said Miss de Lisle Norah had a vision of Bride ecstatically grasping a basting ladle as she made her own escape Allenby was just shutting the hall door as she turned the corner A tall man in a big military greatcoat was shaking hands with her father Here s Captain Hardress Norah Norah found herself looking up into a face that at the first glance she thought one of the ugliest she had ever seen Then the newcomer smiled and suddenly the ugliness seemed to vanish It s too bad to take you by storm this way But your brother wouldn t hear of anything else Of course not said mister Linton My daughter was rather afraid you might be a brigadier She loses her nerve at the idea of pouring tea for anything above a colonel Indeed a colonel s bad enough said Norah ruefully I m accustomed to people with one or two stars even three are rather alarming She shot a glance at his shoulder laughing I m sure you re not half as alarmed as I was at coming said Captain Hardress I ve been so long in hospital that I ve almost forgotten how to speak to any one except doctors and nurses His face that lit up so completely when he smiled relapsed into gloom Well you mustn t stand here Norah said Please tell me if you d like dinner in your room or if you d rather come down She had a sudden vision of missus West s shrill voice and decided that she might be tiring to this man with the gaunt sad face Hardress hesitated I think you d better stay upstairs said David Linton Just for to night till you feel rested I ll come and smoke a pipe with you after dinner if I may I should like that awfully said Hardress Well if you re sure it would not be too much trouble Miss Linton It s not a scrap of trouble she said Allenby will show you the way See that Captain Hardress has a good fire Allenby and take some papers and magazines up She looked sadly after the tall figure as it limped away He was not much older than Jim but his face held a world of bitter experience You mustn t let the Tired People make you unhappy mate said her father He put his arm round her as they went into the drawing room to await their guests Remember they wouldn t be here if they didn t need help of some sort I won t be stupid said Norah But he has such a sorry face Dad when he doesn t smile Then our job is to keep him smiling said David Linton practically There came a high pitched voice in the hall and missus West swept in her husband following at her heels To Norah s inexperienced eyes she was more gorgeous than the Queen of Sheba in a dress of sequins that glittered and flashed with every movement Sarah who had assisted in her toilette reported to the kitchen that she didn t take much stock in a dress that was moulting its sequins for all the world like an old hen but Norah saw no deficiencies and was greatly impressed by her guest s magnificence She was also rather overcome by her eloquence which had the effect of making her feel speechless Not that that greatly mattered as missus West never noticed whether any one else happened to speak or remain silent so long as they did not happen to drown her own voice Such a lovely room she twittered So comfortable And I feel sure there is an exquisite view And a fire in one s bedroom in war time Dear me I feel I ought to protest only I haven t sufficient moral courage and those pine logs are too delicious Perhaps you are burning your own timber ah I thought so That makes it easier for me to refrain from prodding up my moral courage ha ha Norah hunted for a reply and failed to find one And you are actually Australians missus West ran on So interesting I always do think that Australians are so original so quaintly original It must be the wild life you lead So unlike dear quiet little England Bushrangers and savage natives and gold mining How I should like to see it all Oh you would find other attractions as well missus West mister Linton told her The wild life in savage places phase of Australian history is rather a back number Oh quite quite agreed his guest We stay at homes know so little of the other side of the world But we are not aloof not uninterested We recognize the fascination of it all The glamour yes the glamour Gordon s poems bring it all before one do they not Such a true Australian You must be very proud of him We are but he wasn t an Australian said mister Linton The lady sailed on unheeding Yes The voice of the native born And your splendid soldiers too I assure you I thrill whenever I meet one of the dear fellows in the street in London So tall and stern under their great slouch hats Outposts of Empire that is what I say to myself Outposts here in the heart of our dear little Surrey Linking the ends of the earth as it were The strangeness of it all Garrett who had made an unobtrusive entrance some little time before and had been enjoying himself hugely in the background now came up to the group on the hearthrug and was duly introduced Lately from France did you say asked missus West Yesterday Fancy Like coming from one world into another is it not Captain Garrett To be only yesterday mid the thunder of shot and shell out yonder and to night in In dear little Surrey said Garrett innocently Quite Such a peaceful county war seems so remote You must tell me some of your experiences to morrow Oh I never have any said Garrett hastily Now now She shook a playful forefinger at him I was a mother to my husband s regiment Captain Garrett I assure you Quite I used to say to all our subalterns Now remember that this house is open to you at any time I felt that they were so far from their own homes Bring your troubles to me I would say and let us straighten them out together And did they Garrett asked They understood me They knew I wanted to help them And my husband encouraged them to come Takes some encouragin the subaltern of the present day unless it s to tennis and two step said Colonel West But such dear boys I felt their mothers would have been so glad And our regiment had quite a name for nice subalterns There is something so delightful about a subaltern so care free By Jove yes said Colonel West Doesn t care for anything on earth not even the adjutant Now Algernon But at that moment dinner was announced and the rest of the sentence was lost which was an unusual fate for any remark of missus West s It was Norah s first experience as hostess at her father s dinner table since in this connexion Billabong did not seem to count No one could ever have been nervous at Billabong Besides there was no butler there here Allenby gravely irreproachable with Sarah and Bride as attendant sprites seemed to intensify the solemnity of everything However no one seemed to notice anything unusual and conversation flowed apace Colonel West did not want to talk such cooking as Miss de Lisle s appeared to him to deserve the compliment of silence and he ate in an abstraction that left Garrett free to talk to Norah while missus West overwhelmed mister Linton with a steady flow of eloquence that began with the soup and lasted until dessert Then Norah and missus West withdrew leaving the men to smoke My dear your cook s a poem said missus West as they returned to the drawing room Such a dinner That souffle well words fail me I m so glad you liked it Norah said It melted in the mouth And I watched you help it your face was so anxious you insinuated the spoon with such an expression I couldn t describe it Norah burst out laughing I could she said The cook was so anxious about that souffle and she said to do it justice it should be helped with a hot spoon So I told Allenby to stand the spoon in a jug of boiling water and give it to me at the very last moment He was holding it in the napkin he had for drying it I suppose and he didn t know that the handle was nearly red hot But I did when I took it up My dear child exclaimed missus West So your expression was due to agony Something like it Norah laughed It was just all I could do to hold it But the souffle was worth it wasn t it I must tell Miss de Lisle Miss de Lisle Your cook Yes it sounds well doesn t it said Norah She s a dear too She is certainly a treasure said missus West Since the regiment went out I have been living in horrible boarding houses where they half starve you and what they do give you to eat is so murdered in the cooking that you can hardly swallow it Economical for the management but not very good for the guests But one must take things as they come in this horrible war She paused the forced smile fading from her lips Somehow Norah felt that she was sorry for her she looked suddenly old and worn and tired Come and sit in this big chair missus West she said You must have had a long day Well quite said missus West You see I went to take my husband from the hospital at twelve o clock and then I found that your father had made this delightful arrangement for us It seemed too good to be true So I had to send Algernon to his club and I rushed back to my boarding house and packed my things and then I had to do some shopping and meet them at the station And of course I never could get a taxi when I wanted one I really think I am a little tired This seems the kind of house where it doesn t matter to admit it Of course not isn t it a Home for Tired People Norah laughed Sarah entered with coffee and she fussed gently about her guest settling her cushions and bringing her cup to her side with cream and sugar It s very delightful to be taken care of said missus West with a sigh The affected jerky manner dropped from her and she became more natural My children are all boys I often have been sorry that one was not a girl A daughter must be a great comfort Have you any sisters my dear No Just one brother he s in Captain Garrett s regiment And you will go back to Australia after the war Oh yes We couldn t possibly stay away from Australia Norah said wide eyed You see it s home And England has not made you care any less for it Goodness no Norah said warmly It s all very well in its way but it simply can t hold a candle to Australia But why Norah hesitated It s a bit hard to say she answered at length Life is more comfortable here in some ways more luxuries and conveniences of living I mean And England is beautiful and it s full of history and we all love it for that But it isn t our own country The people are different more reserved and stiffer But it isn t even that I don t know said Norah getting tangled I think it s the air and the space and the freedom that we re used to and we miss them all the time And the jolly country life But English country life is jolly I think we d get tired of it said Norah It seems to us all play and in Australia we work Even if you go out for a ride there most likely there is a job hanging to it to bring in cattle or count them or see that a fence is all right or to bring home the mail Every one is busy and the life all round is interesting I don t think I explain at all well I expect the real explanation is just that the love for one s own country is in one s bones Quite said missus West Quite But she said the ridiculous word as though for once she understood and there was a comfortable little silence between them for a few minutes Then the men came in and the evening went by quickly enough with games and music Captain Garrett proved to be the possessor of a very fair tenor together with a knack of vamping not unmelodious accompaniments The cheery songs floated out into the hall where Bride and Katty crouched behind a screen torn between delight and nervousness If the Ould Thing was to come she d have the hair torn off of us breathed Katty But tis worth the rishk Blessed Hour haven t he the lovely voice He have but I d rather listen to Miss Norah said Bride loyally Tisn t the big voice she do be having but it s that happy sounding It was after ten o clock when Norah having said good night to her guests and shown missus West to her room went softly along the corridor A light showed under Miss de Lisle s doorway and she tapped gently The door opened revealing the cook lady s comfortable little sitting room with a fire burning merrily in the grate The cook lady herself was an extraordinarily altered being in a pale blue kimono with heavy white embroidery I hoped you would come she said Are you tired Poor child what an evening I wonder would you have a cup of cocoa with me here I have it ready She waved a large hand towards a fat brown jug standing on a trivet by the grate There was a tray on a little table bearing cups and saucers and a spongecake Norah gave way promptly I d love it she said How good of you I was much too excited to eat dinner But the souffle was just perfect Miss de Lisle I never saw anything like it missus West raved about it after dinner I am glad said the cook lady with the rapt expression of a high priestess Allenby told me how you arranged for a hot spoon It was beautiful of you beautiful Did he tell you how hot it was Norah inquired They grew merry over the story and the spongecake dwindled simultaneously with the cocoa in the jug I must go Norah said at last It s been so nice thank you ever so Miss de Lisle It s I who should thank you for staying said the big woman rising Will you come again some time Rather if I may Good night She shut the door softly and scurried along to her room unconscious that another doorway was a couple of inches ajar and that through the space missus Atkins regarded her balefully Her father s door was half open and the room was lit Norah knocked Come in said mister Linton You you bad child I thought you were in bed long ago I m going now Norah said How did things go off Daddy Quite well he said And my daughter made a good hostess I think they all enjoyed themselves Norah I think so said she They seemed happy enough What about Captain Hardress Dad He seemed comfortable mister Linton answered I found him on a couch with a rug over him reading Allenby said he ate a fair dinner He s a nice fellow Norah I like him Was he badly wounded Dad He didn t say much about himself I gathered that he had been a long while in hospital But I m sorry for him Norah he seems very down on his luck Jim said so remarked Norah Well we must try to buck him up I suppose Allenby will look after him Dad if he needs anything I told him to said mister Linton with a grin He looked at me coldly and said I ope sir I know my duty to a wounded officer I believe I found myself apologizing There are times when Allenby quite fails to hide his opinion of a mere civilian I see myself sinking lower and lower in his eyes as we fill this place up with khaki Good night Norah CHAPTER IX HOMEWOOD GETS BUSY Good morning Captain Hardress Hardress turned He was standing in the porch looking out over the park towards the yellowing woods Good morning Miss Linton I hope you ll forgive me for being so lazy as to stay in bed for breakfast You ll have to blame your butler he simply didn t call me The first thing I knew was an enormous tray with enough breakfast for six men and Allenby grinning behind it You stay in bed to breakfast here or get up just as you feel inclined Norah said There aren t any rules except two Isn t that a bit Irish Not exactly because Jim says even those two may be broken But I don t agree to that at least not for Rule two Do tell me them he begged Rule one is Bed at ten o clock That s the one that may be broken when necessary Rule two is Please do just what you feel like doing That s the one I won t have broken unless any one wants to do things that aren t good for them Then I shall remember that they are patients and become severe But I m not a patient No but you re tired You ve got to get quite fit What would you like to do Would you care to come for a ride Hardress flushed darkly Afraid I can t ride Oh I m sorry said Norah looking at him in astonishment This lean active looking fellow with the nervous hands certainly looked as though he should be able to ride Indeed there were no men in Norah s world who could not But perhaps What about a walk then she inquired Do you feel up to it Again Hardress flushed I thought your brother would have explained he said heavily I can t do anything much Miss Linton You see I ve only one leg Norah s grey eyes were wide with distress I didn t know she faltered The telephone was out of order Jim couldn t explain I m so terribly sorry you must have thought me stupid Not a bit after all it s rather a compliment to the shop made article I was afraid it was evident enough Indeed it isn t Norah assured him I knew you limped a little but it wasn t very noticeable It s supposed to be a special one Hardress said I m hardly used to it yet though and it feels awkward enough They ve been experimenting with it for some time and now I m a sort of trial case for that brand of leg The maker swears I ll be able to dance with it he s a hopeful soul I m not You ought to try to be Norah said And it really must be a very good one She felt a kind of horror at talking of it in this cold blooded fashion I think most of the hopefulness was knocked out of me Hardress answered You see I wanted to save the old leg and they tried to and then it was a case of one operation after another until at last they took it off near the hip Norah went white Near the hip Her voice shook Oh it couldn t be you re so big and strong Hardress laughed grimly I used to think it couldn t be myself he said Well I suppose one will get accustomed to it in time I m sorry I distressed you Miss Linton only I thought I had better make a clean breast of it I m glad you did Norah had found control of her voice and her wits she remembered that this maimed lad with the set face was there to be helped and that it was part of her job to do it Her very soul was wrung with pity but she forced a smile Now you have just got to let us help she said We can t try to make forget it I know but we can help to make the best of it You can practise using it in all sorts of ways and seeing just what you can do with it And Captain Hardress I know they do wonders now with artificial legs Dad knew of a man who played tennis with his as bad a case as yours That certainly seems too good to be true said Hardress I don t know about that said Norah eagerly Your leg must be very good none of us guessed the truth about it When you get used to it you ll be able to manage all sorts of things Golf for instance there s a jolly little nine hole course in the park and I know you could play I had thought golf might be a possibility he said Not that I ever cared much for it My two games were polo and Rugby football I don t know about Rugby said Norah thoughtfully But of course you ll play polo again Some one was writing in one of the papers lately saying that so many men had lost a leg in the war that the makers would have to invent special riding legs for hunting and polo I know very well that if Jim came home without a leg he d still go mustering cattle or know the reason why And there was the case of an Irishman a while ago who had no legs at all and he used to hunt By Jove said Hardress Well you cheer a fellow up Miss Linton You see I have Jim and Wally said Norah Do you know Wally by the way Is that Meadows oh yes I met him with your brother Well he s just like my brother he nearly lives with us And from the time that they joined up we had to think of the chance of their losing a limb Jim never says anything about it but I know Wally dreads it Dad and I found out all we could about artificial limbs and what can be done with them so that we could help the boys if they had bad luck They are all right so far but of course there is always the chance Hardress nodded We planned that if bad luck came we would try to get them to do as much as possible Of course an arm is worse to lose a leg is bad enough goodness knows but it s better than an arm That s one of the problems I ve been studying Hardress said grimly Oh but it is And with you why in a few years no one will ever guess that you have anything wrong It s luck in one way because a leg doesn t make you conspicuous and an arm does That s true he said energetically I have hoped desperately that I d be able to hide it I just couldn t stick the idea of people looking at me Well they won t said Norah And the more you can carry on as usual the less bad it will seem Now let s plan what you can tackle first Can you walk much Not much I get tired after about fifty yards Well we ll do fifty yards whenever you feel like it and then we ll sit down and talk until you can go on again She hesitated You it doesn t trouble you to sit down Oh no said Hardress laughing for the first time It s an awfully docile leg Then can you drive There s the motor and a roomy tub cart and the carriage Yes I can drive Oh I say cried Norah inelegantly struck by a brilliant idea Can you drive a motor No I can t I m sorry I m not Con will teach you it will give you quite a new interest Would you like to learn By Jove I would he said eagerly You re sure your father won t mind my risking his car Dad would laugh at such a foolish question said Norah We ll go and see Con now shall we it s not far to the stables You might have a lesson at once Rather he said boyishly I say Miss Linton you are a brick Now about golf Norah said as they moved slowly away Hardress leaning heavily on his stick Will you try to play a little with me We could begin at the practice holes beyond the terrace Yes I d like to he said And billiards We ll wait for a wet day because I want you to live in the open air as much as possible I can t play decently but Captain Garrett is staying here and Jim and Wally come over pretty often You might let me teach you to play he suggested Would you care to Oh I d love it said Norah beaming The beam had he known it was one of delight at the new ring in her patient s voice Life had come back to it he held his head erect and his eyes were no longer hopeless And riding she hesitated I don t know he said I don t believe I could even get on There s a steady old pony Norah said Why not practise on him He stands like a rock I won t stay and look at you but Con could you see he s lost a leg himself so you wouldn t mind him I m sure you ll find you can manage and when you get confidence we ll go out together Well you would put hope into into a dead codfish he said Great Scott if I thought I could get on a horse again Norah laughed We re all horse mad she said If I were like you I know that to ride would be the thing that would help me most So you have just got to They had arrived at the stables where Con had the car out and was lovingly polishing its bonnet Con can you teach Captain Hardress to drive Is it the car asked Con And why not miss Can I manage it do you think asked Hardress I ve only one leg Tis as many as I have meself returned Con cheerfully And I m not that bad a driver am I Miss Norah You re not Norah answered Now I ll leave you to Con Captain Hardress I suppose you ll learn all about the car before you begin to drive her Con can run you round to the house afterwards if you re tired The horses are in the stables too if you d care to look at them Jones have the brown pair out miss said Con But the others are all here Well you can show them to Captain Hardress Con I want him to begin riding Brecon She smiled at Hardress and ran off looking back just before the shrubberies hid the stable yard Hardress was peering into the bonnet of the car with Con evidently explaining its inner mysteries just as she looked he straightened up and threw off his coat with a quick gesture He s all right said Norah happily She hurried on The Tired People were off her hands for the morning Colonel and missus West had gone for a drive Captain Garrett was playing golf with Major Hunt who was developing rapidly in playing a one armed game and was extremely interested in his own progress It was the day for posting to Australia and there was a long letter to Brownie to be finished and one to Jean Yorke her chum in Melbourne Already it was late in the study her father had been deep in his letters for over an hour But as she came up to the porch she saw him in the hall Oh Norah he said with relief I ve been looking for you Here s a letter from Harry Trevor of all people Harry said Norah delightedly Oh I m so glad Where is he Dad He s in London this letter has been wandering round after us We ought to have had it days ago Harry has a commission now got it on the field in Gallipoli more power to him and he s been wounded and sent to England But he says he s all right Oh won t Jim and Wally be glad Harry Trevor was an old school fellow whom Fate had taken to Western Australia it was years since they had met He has two other fellows with him he says and he doesn t know any one in London nor do they His one idea seems to be to see us What are we to do Norah Can we have them here Why we must have them Norah said She made a swift mental calculation Yes we can manage it You re sure asked her father evidently relieved I was afraid it might be too much for the house and I would be very sorry to put them off Put off Australians even if one of them wasn t Harry ejaculated Norah We couldn t do it How will you get them Dad I ll telephone to their hotel at once said her father Shall I tell them to come to day Oh yes You can arrange the train Dad Now I ll go and see missus Atkins Tis yourself has great courage entirely said her father looking at her respectfully I d rather tackle a wild buffalo I m not sure that I wouldn t returned Norah However she s all the buffalo I ve got so I may as well get it over She turned as she reached the door Tell old Harry how glad we are Dad And don t you think you ought to let Jim know Yes I ll ring him up too And off went Norah singing Three Australians in dear little Surrey It was almost too good to be true But missus Atkins did not think so She was sorting linen with a sour face when Norah entered her sanctum and made known her news The housekeeper remained silent for a moment Well I don t see how we re to manage miss she said at length The house is pretty full as it is There is the big room with two single beds Norah said We can put a third bed in They won t mind being together missus Atkins sniffed It isn t usual to crowd people like that miss It won t matter in this case said Norah Did you say Australians miss asked the housekeeper Officers One is an officer And the others miss I don t know privates very possibly said Norah It doesn t matter Not matter Well upon my word ejaculated missus Atkins Well all I can say miss is that it s very funny And how do you think the maids are going to do all that extra work Norah began to experience a curious feeling of tingling I am quite sure the maids can manage it she said commanding her voice with an effort For one thing I can easily help more than I do now We re not accustomed in this country to young ladies doing that sort of thing said missus Atkins Her evil temper mastered her And your pet cook the fine lady who s too grand to sit with me Norah found her voice suddenly calm You mustn t speak to me like that missus Atkins she said marvelling at her own courage You will have to go away if you can t behave properly missus Atkins choked Go away she said thickly Yes I ll go away I m not going to stay in a house like this that s no more and no less than a boarding house You and your friend the cook can Be quiet woman said a voice of thunder Norah who had shrunk back before the angry housekeeper felt a throb of relief as Allenby strode into the room At the moment there was nothing of the butler about him he was Sergeant Allenby and missus Atkins was simply a refractory private I won t be quiet screamed the housekeeper I You will do as you re told said Allenby dropping a heavy hand on her shoulder That s enough now not another word Now go to your room Out of ere or I ll send for the police Something in the hard quiet voice filled missus Atkins with terror She cast a bitter look at Norah and then slunk out of the room Allenby closed the door behind her I m very sorry miss he said butler once more I hope she didn t frighten you Oh no only she was rather horrible said Norah Whatever is the matter with her Allenby I hadn t said anything to make her so idiotic I ve been suspecting what was the matter these last three days said Allenby darkly Look ere miss He opened a cupboard disclosing rows of empty bottles I found these ere this morning when she was in the kitchen I d been missing bottles from the cellar She must have another key to the cellar door owever she managed it There came a tap at the door and mister Linton came in to have the situation briefly explained to him I wouldn t have had it happen for something he said angrily My poor little girl I didn t think we were letting you in for this sort of thing Why you couldn t help it Norah said And she didn t hurt me she was only unpleasant But I think we had better keep her out of Miss de Lisle s way or she might be hard to handle That s so miss said Allenby I ll go and see Ard to andle I should think so See that she packs her box Allenby said mister Linton I ll write her cheque at once and Con can take her to the station as soon as she is ready She s not too bad to travel I suppose She s not bad at all sir Only enough to make her nasty Well she can go and be nasty somewhere else said mister Linton Very well Allenby He turned to Norah looking unhappy Whatever will you do my girl and this houseful of people I d better telephone Harry and put his party off Indeed you won t said Norah very cheerfully I ll manage Dad Don t you worry I m going to talk to Miss de Lisle The cook lady was not in the kitchen Katty washing vegetables diligently referred Norah to her sitting room and there she was found knitting a long khaki muffler She heard the story in silence So I must do just the best I can Miss de Lisle Norah ended And I m wondering if you think I must really advertise for another housekeeper It didn t seem to me that missus Atkins did much except give orders and surely I can do that after a little practice Norah flushed and looked anxious Of course I don t want to make a mess of the whole thing I know the house must be well run Well said Miss de Lisle knitting with feverish energy I couldn t have said it if you hadn t asked me but as you have I would like to propose something Perhaps it may sound as if I thought too much of myself but with a cook like me you don t need a housekeeper I have a conscience and I know how things ought to be run So my proposal is this and you and your father must just do as you like about it Why not make me cook housekeeper Oh but could you Norah cried delightedly Wouldn t it be too much work I don t think so of course I m expecting that you re going to help in supervising things I can teach you anything You see Katty is a treasure I back down in all I ever thought about Irish maids said the cook lady parenthetically And she makes me laugh all day and I wouldn t be without her for anything Give me a smart boy in the kitchen for the rough work then Katty can do more of the plain cooking which she ll love and I shall have more time out of the kitchen Now what do you say Me said Norah I d like to hug you I wish you would said Miss de Lisle knitting more frantically than ever You see this is the first place I ve been in where I ve really been treated like a human being You didn t patronize me and you didn t snub me any of you But you laughed with me and it was a mighty long time since laughing had come into my job Dear me finished Miss de Lisle you ve no idea how at home with you all I ve felt since Allenby fell over me in the passage We loved you from that minute said Norah laughing Then you think we can really manage You ll have to let me consult with you over everything ordering and all that because I do want to learn my job And you won t mind how many people we bring in Fill the house to explosion point if you like said Miss de Lisle If you don t have a housekeeper you ll have two extra rooms to put your Tired People in What s the good of a scheme like this if you don t run it thoroughly She found herself suddenly hugged to the no small disadvantage of the knitting Oh I m so happy Norah cried Now I m going to enjoy the Home for Tired People and up till now missus Atkins has lain on my soul like a ton of bricks Bless you Miss de Lisle I m going to tell Dad Her racing footsteps flew down the corridor But Miss de Lisle sat still with a half smile on her rugged face Once she put her hand up to the place where Norah s lips had brushed her cheek Dear me she murmured Well it s fifteen years since any one did that Still smiling she picked up the knitting CHAPTER X AUSTRALIA IN SURREY The three Australians came that afternoon and like many Australians in the wilds of London with a vague idea of distances having given themselves good time to catch their train managed to catch the one before it and so arrived at Homewood unheralded and unsung Norah and Captain Hardress who had been knocking golf balls about were crossing the terrace on their way to tea when the three slouched hats caught Norah s eye through the trees of the avenue She gasped dropped her clubs and fled to meet them Hardress stared then perceiving the newcomers smiled a little and went on slowly I d like to see her doing a hundred yards he said The three soldiers jumped as the flying figure came upon them round a bend in the drive Then one of them sprang forward Harry said Norah My word I am glad to see you said Harry Trevor pumping her hand I say Norah you haven t changed a bit You re just the same as when you were twelve only that you ve grown several feet Did you expect to find me bald and fat Norah laughed Oh Harry we are glad to see you Well you might have aged a little said he Goodness knows I have Norah where s old Jim He s at Aldershot but you can be certain that he ll be here as soon as he possibly can and Wally too That s good business He suddenly remembered his friends who were affecting great interest in the botanical features of a beech tree Come here you chaps Norah this is Jack Blake and Dick Harrison They re awfully glad to see you too Well you might have let us say it for ourselves digger said the two shaking hands We were just going to It s lovely to have you all said Norah She looked over the tree all tall fellows lean and bronzed with quiet faces and deep set eyes Blake bore a sergeant s stripes Dick Harrison s sleeve modestly proclaimed him a lance corporal We ve been wandering in that funny old London like lost sheep Blake said My word that s a lonesome place if you don t happen to know any one in it And people look at you as if you were something out of a Zoo They re not used to you yet said Norah It s the hat as much as anything I don t know about that Harry said No I think they d know we came out of a different mob even if we weren t branded Perhaps they would and you certainly do Norah answered But come on to the house Dad is just as anxious to see you as any one Indeed as they came in sight of the house David Linton was seen coming with long strides to meet them Hardress told me you had suddenly turned into a Marathon runner at the sight of three big hats he said How are you Harry It s an age since we saw you Yes isn t it Harry shook hands warmly and introduced his friends You haven t changed either mister Linton I ought to be aging only Norah won t hear of it said mister Linton laughing She bullies me more hopelessly than ever Harry She always did Trevor agreed Oh I want to talk about Billabong for an hour How s Brownie Nor and Murty O Toole and Black Billy How do you manage to live away from them It isn t easy Norah answered They re all very fit only they want us back We can t allow ourselves to think of the day that we ll get home or we all grow light headed It will be no end of a day for all of us said Harrison Think of marching down Collins Street again with the crowd cheering us keeping an eye out for the people one knew It was fairly beastly marching up it for the last time It s not Collins Street I want but a bit of the Gippsland track said Jack Blake You know Dick we took cattle there last year Over the Haunted Hills aren t they jolly in the spring and down through the scrub to Morwell and Traralgon I d give something to see that bit of country again Ah it s all good country David Linton said Then they were at the house and a buzz of conversation floated out to them from the hall where tea was in progress Your father simply made me promise to go on without you said missus West as Norah made her apologies I said it was dreadful but he wouldn t listen to me And there are your friends Dear me how large they are and so brown Do introduce them to me I m planning to hear all about Australia And a sergeant and lance corporal Isn t it romantic to see them among us and quite at their ease Don t tell them I m a Colonel s wife my dear I would hate them to feel embarrassed I don t think you need worry said Norah smiling to herself She brought up the three newcomers and introduced them They subsided upon a sofa and listened solemnly while missus West opened all her conversational batteries upon them Norah heard the opening I ve read such a lot about your charming country and felt a throb of pity for the three wanderers from afar Hardress came towards her with a cup of tea his limb a little more evident You re tired she said taking it from him Sure you haven t done too much Not a bit he said I m a little tired but it s the best day I have had for many a month I don t know when I enjoyed anything as much as my motor lesson this morning Con says you ll be able to drive in Piccadilly in no time said Norah He s hopeful Hardress said laughing Particularly as we never started the car at all he made me learn everything I could about it first And did he tell you I rode Brecon No How did you get on asked Norah delightedly Well I literally got on very badly at first The shop leg didn t seem to understand what was wanted of it at all and any steed but Brecon would have strongly resented me But he stood in a pensive attitude while I tried all sorts of experiments In fact I think he went to sleep I told you you could rely on Brecon Norah smiled What happened then Oh I got used to myself and found out the knack of getting on It s not hard with a steady horse once you find out how But I think Brecon will do me very well for awhile Oh we ll soon get you on to Brunette Norah said You d enjoy her Is that the black pony Yes and she s a lovely hack I m going to hunt her in the winter she jumps like a deer She looked a beauty in the stable Hardress said She ought to make a good polo pony He sighed I wonder if I ll really ever play polo again Of course you will Norah told him This morning you didn t think you would ever get on a horse again No I certainly didn t You have put an extraordinary amount of hope into me I feel a different being He stopped and a smile crept into his eyes Listen aren t your friends having a time Life must be so exciting on your great cattle ranches missus West was saying And the dear little woolly lambs on the farms such pets We understood you people over here prefer them frozen Blake said gently So we send em that way Norah choked over her tea She became aware that Colonel West was speaking to her and tried to command her wits hearing as she turned missus West s shrill pipe And what is a wheat belt Is it something you wear Norah would have given much to hear Blake s reply Delightful place you have here barked the Colonel Your father and I have been spending an agricultural afternoon planning all the things he means to do on that farm Hawkins isn t it But I suppose you don t take much interest in that sort of thing Dances and frocks more in your line and chocolates eh what Then you ve changed her in England said Harry Trevor suddenly Is it dances now Norah No more quick things over the grass after a cross grained bullock Don t say you ve forgotten how to use a stockwhip It s hung up at Billabong Norah said laughing But you wait until I get back to it that s all Dear me said missus West And you do these wonderful things too I always longed to do them as a girl to ride over long leagues of plain on a fiery mustang among your lovely eucalyptus trees And do you really go out with the cowboys and use a lasso She does said Harry happily Your wild animals too said missus West It s kangaroos you ride down with spears is it not And wallabies We live in dear quiet little England but we read all about your wonderful life and are oh so interested What a life said Dick Harrison under his breath Quite You know I had a great friend who went out as A D C to one of your Governors He had to return after a month because his father died and he came into the baronetcy but some day he means to write a book on Australia That is why I have always as it were kept in touch with your great country I seem to know it so well though I have never seen it You do indeed said Blake gravely I wish we knew half as much about yours Ah but you must let us show it to you Is it not yours too Outposts of Empire that is what I call you outposts of Empire Is it not that that brought you to fight under our flag Oh rather said Blake vaguely But a lot of us just wanted a look in at the fun Well you got a good deal for a start said Garrett Yes Abdul gave us all we wanted on his little peninsula But he s not a bad fighting man old Abdul we don t mind how often we take tea with him He s a better man to fight than Fritz He could pretty easily be that Garrett said It s one of the worst grudges we owe Fritz that he s taken all the decency out of war It used to be a man s game but the Boche made it one according to his own ideas and everybody knows what they are Yes said Hardress I suppose the Boche will do a good deal of crawling to get back among decent people after the war but he ll never live down his poison gas and flame throwers And wouldn t it have been a gorgeous old war if he d only fought clean said Garrett longingly They drew together and talked as fighting men will veterans in the ways of war though the eldest was not much over one and twenty The sudden hoot of a motor came from the drive far off and then another and another Some one s joy riding said Harry Trevor The hooting increased and with it the hum of a racing car The gravel outside the porch crunched as it drew up and then came cheery voices and two long figures in great coats dashed in Jim and Wally eager eyed Dad Norah Where s old Harry But Harry was grasping a hand of each and submitting to mighty pats on the back from their other hands By Jove it s great to see you Where did you come from you old reprobate Finished Johnny Turk Gradually the boys became aware that there were other people in the hall and made apologies interrupted by another burst of joy at discovering Garrett You must think us bears said Jim with his disarming smile to missus West But we hadn t seen Trevor for years and he s a very old chum It would have been exciting to meet him in Australia but in England well However did you manage to come Norah asked beaming Oh we got leave We ve been good boys at least Wally was until we got your message this morning Since then he has been wandering about like a lost fowl murmuring Harry My Harry Is it me returned Wally Don t believe him Nor it was all I could do to keep him from slapping the C O on the back and borrowing his car to come over I don t doubt it Norah laughed Whose car did you borrow by the way Oh we hired one It was extravagant but we agreed that it wasn t every day we kill a pig Thank you said Harry Years haven t altered your power of putting a thing nicely He smote Wally affectionately I say you were a kid when I saw you last a kid in knickerbockers And look at you now Well you were much the same Wally retorted And now you re a hardened old warrior I ve only played at it so far But you were gassed weren t you Yes but we hadn t had much war before they gassed us That was the annoying part Well didn t you have a little private war in Ireland What about that German submarine Oh that was sheer luck said Wally joyfully Such a lark only for one thing But we don t consider we ve earned our keep yet Oh well you ve got lots of time Harry said I wonder if they ll send any of us to France it would be rather fun if we got somewhere in your part of the line Yes wouldn t it Then Jack Blake who had been at school with the boys came up with Dick Harrison and England ceased to exist for the five Australians They talked of their own country old days at school hard fought battles on the Melbourne Cricket Ground boat racing on the Yarra Billabong and other stations bush fires and cattle yarding long days on the road with cattle and nights spent watching them under the stars All the grim business of life that had been theirs since those care free days seemed but to make their own land dearer by comparison Not that they said so in words But they lingered over their talk with an unspoken delight in being at home again even in memory Norah slipped away regretfully enough after a time her responsibilities as housekeeper weighed upon her and she sought Miss de Lisle in the kitchen What your brother and mister Wally How delightful ejaculated the cook lady That s what I call really jolly Their rooms are always ready I suppose Oh yes Norah said I ve told Bride to put sheets on the beds Then that s all right Dinner My dear you need never worry about a couple extra for dinner in a household of this size Just tell the maids to lay the table accordingly and let me know that is all you need do missus Atkins had destroyed my nerve said Norah laughing I came down to tell you with the same scared feeling that I had when I used to go to her room My very knees were shaking Then you re a very bad child if you are my employer returned Miss de Lisle However I ll forgive you but some time I want you to make a list for me of the things those big boys of yours like most I might just as well cook them as not when they come And of course when they go out to France we shall have to send them splendid hampers That will be a tremendous comfort Norah said You re a brick Miss de Lisle We used to send them hampers before of course but it seemed so unsatisfactory just to order them at the Stores it will be ever so much nicer to cook them things You will let me cook won t you Indeed I will said Miss de Lisle We ll shut ourselves up here for a day now and then and have awful bouts of cookery How did you like the potato cakes at tea by the way They were perfect Norah said I never tasted better even in Ireland At which Katty who had just entered with a saucepan blushed hotly and cast an ecstatic glance at Miss de Lisle I don t suppose you did remarked that lady You see Katty made them Wasn t she good now to let me Miss Norah Katty asked There s them at home that towld me I d get no chance at all of learning under a grand cook here Tis little the likes of them ud give you to do in the kitchen if you asked them for a job barring it was to wash the floor they d pitch you to the Sivin Divils Isn t the scullery good enough for you they d say Cock you up with the cooking But Miss de Lisle isn t one of them and the cakes to go up to the drawing room itself Well every one liked them Katty Norah said Yerra hadn t I Bridie watching behind the big screen with the crack in it said the handmaid She come back to me and she says They re all ate says she tis the way ye had not enough made she says I didn t know if twas on me head or me heels I was She bent a look of adoration upon Miss de Lisle who laughed Oh I ll make a cook of you yet Katty she said Meanwhile you d better put some coal on the fire or the oven won t be hot enough for my pastry Is it early breakfast for your brother and mister Wally Miss Linton I m afraid so Norah said Jim said they must leave at eight o clock Then that means breakfast at seven thirty Will you have yours with them Oh yes please if it s not too much trouble Nothing s a trouble certainly not an early breakfast said Miss de Lisle Now don t worry about anything Norah went back to the hall to find it deserted A buzz of voices came from the billiard room she peeped in to find all the soldiers talking with her father listening happily in a big chair No one saw her she withdrew and went in search of missus West but failed to find her Bride encountered in her evening tour with cans of hot water reported that twas lying down she was and not wishful for talk her resht was more to her Then I may as well go and dress Norah said She had just finished when a quick step came along the corridor and stopped at her door Jim s fingers beat the tattoo that was always their signal Come in Jimmy Norah cried He came in looming huge in the dainty little room Good business you re dressed he said Can I come and yarn Rather said Norah beaming Come and sit down in my armchair This electric heater isn t as jolly to yarn by as a good old log fire but still it s something She pulled her chair forward Can t you wait for me to do that bad kid said Jim He sat down and Norah subsided on the rug near him Now tell me all about everything he said How are things going Quite well especially missus Atkins said Norah In fact she s gone Jim sat up Gone But how Norah told him the story and he listened with joyful ejaculations Well she was always the black spot in the house he remarked It gave one the creeps to look at her sour face and I m certain she was more bother to you than she was worth Oh I feel twenty years younger since she went Norah said And it s going to be great fun to housekeep with Miss de Lisle I shall learn ever so much So will she I imagine said Jim laughing Put her up to all the Australian ways and see if we can t make a good emigrant of her when we go back I might Norah said But she would be a shock to Brownie if she suggested putting her soul into a pudding Rather said Jim twinkling I say tell me about Hardress Do you like him Oh yes ever so much She told him of her morning s work indeed by the time the gong boomed out its summons from the hall there was very little in the daily life of Homewood that Jim had not managed to hear We re always wondering how you are getting on he said It s jolly over there the work is quite interesting and there s a very nice lot of fellows but I d like to look in at you two and see how this show was running He hesitated It won t be long before we go out Nor old chap Won t it Jimmy She put up a hand and caught his Do you know how long A week or two not more But you re not to worry You ve just got to think of the day when we ll get our first leave and then you ll have to leave all your Tired People and come and paint London red He gave a queer laugh Oh I don t know though It seems to be considered the right thing to do But I expect we ll just amble along here and ask you for a job in the house Why you ll be Tired People yourselves said Norah We ll have to look after you and give you nourishment at short intervals We ll take that if it s Miss de Lisle s cooking Now don t think about this business too much I thought I d better tell you but nothing is definite yet Perhaps I d better not tell Dad No don t he s so happy I wish I didn t have to make either of you less happy Jim said in a troubled voice But it can t be helped No I know it can t Jimmy Don t you worry Dear old chap said Jim and stood up I had better go and make myself presentable before the second gong goes He paused You re all ready aren t you Then you might go down Wally will be wandering round everywhere looking for you CHAPTER XI CHEERO It was ten days later that the summons to France came ten days during which the boys had managed to make several meteoric dashes over to Homewood for the night and had accomplished one blissful week end during which with the aid of their fellow countrymen they had brought the household to the verge of exhaustion from laughter Nothing could damp their spirits they rode and danced sang and joked and apparently 
3245-6194-0000	train-other-500	having no cares in the world themselves were determined that no one else should have any The Hunt family were drawn into the fun the kitchen was frequently invaded
3245-6194-0001	train-other-500	and Miss de Lisle declared that even her sitting room was not sacred and was privately very delighted that it was not Allenby began to develop a regrettable lack of control over his once stolid features
none	none	 Sarah herself was observed to stuff her apron into her mouth 
3245-6194-0002	train-other-500	and rush from the dining room on more than one occasion And under cover of his most energetic fooling Jim Linton watched his father and sister
none	none	 and fooled the more happily whenever he made them laugh They arrived together unexpectedly on this last evening preferring to bring their news rather than give it by telephone and found instead of the usual cheery tea party in the hall 
3245-6194-0003	train-other-500	only silence and emptiness Allenby appearing broke into a broad smile of pleasure as he greeted them Every one s out mister Jim So it seems Jim answered Where are they
3245-6194-0004	train-other-500	Not very far sir Allenby said
none	none	 missus Unt has them all to tea with her to day Oh we ll go over Wal Jim said Come and make yourself pretty you ve a splash of mud on your downy cheek At the foot of the stairs he turned We re off to morrow Allenby 
3245-6194-0005	train-other-500	Allenby s face fell To France sir Jim nodded The master and Miss Norah will be very sorry sir
none	none	 If I may say so the ole ousehold will be sorry 
3245-6194-0006	train-other-500	Thanks Allenby We ll miss you all Jim said pleasantly He sprang upstairs after Wally missus Hunt s sitting room was already dangerously crowded there seemed no room at all for the two tall lads
none	none	 for whom Eva opened the door ten minutes later A chorus of welcome greeted them nevertheless This is delightful said missus Hunt I m sure I don t know how you re going to fit in but you must manage it somehow If necessary we ll all stand up and re pack ourselves but I warn you it is risky the walls may not stand it Oh don t trouble missus Hunt Jim said 
3245-6194-0007	train-other-500	We re quite all right Both boys eyes had sought Norah as they entered and Norah meeting the glance felt a sudden pang at her heart and knew
none	none	 My chair is ever so much too big for me she said 
3245-6194-0008	train-other-500	You can each have an arm Good idea said Wally perching on the broad arm of the easy chair that swallowed her up Come along Jim or we ll be lop sided We put Norah in the biggest chair in the room
3245-6194-0009	train-other-500	and everybody is treating her with profound respect missus Hunt said This is the first day for quite a while that she hasn t been hostess so we made her chief guest and she is having a rest cure
3245-6194-0010	train-other-500	If you treat Norah with respect it won t have at all a restful effect on her said Wally I ve tried To which Norah inquired When in a voice of such amazement that every one laughed
none	none	 Misunderstood as usual said Wally pathetically It really doesn t pay to be like me and have a meek spirit 
3245-6194-0011	train-other-500	people only think you are a worm and trample on you Come here Geoff and take care of me and Geoffrey who adored him came Have you been riding old Brecon lately
none	none	 M said Geoffrey nodding I can canter now Good man Any tosses Well just one Geoffrey admitted He cantered before I had gotted ready and I fell off 
3245-6194-0012	train-other-500	But it didn t hurt That s right You practise always falling on a soft spot and you need never worry But I d rather practise sticking on said Geoffrey It s nicer
3245-6194-0013	train-other-500	You might practise both said Wally You ll have plenty of both you know He laughed at the puzzled face Never mind old chap
none	none	 How are the others and why aren t they here They re too little Geoffrey said loftily Small childrens don t come in to tea at least not when there s parties I came cause Mother says I m getting normous 
3245-6194-0014	train-other-500	So you are Are the others quite well Oh yes Geoffrey answered clearly regarding the question as foolish They re all right Alison s got a puppy and Michael s been eating plate powder
3245-6194-0015	train-other-500	His mouf was all pink What s that about my Michael demanded missus Hunt Oh yes we found him making a hearty meal of plate powder this morning Douglas says it should make him very bright
3245-6194-0016	train-other-500	I m thankful to say it doesn t seem to be going to kill him Michael never will realize that there is a war on said Major Hunt aggrieved I found him gnawing the strap of one of my gaiters the other day
3245-6194-0017	train-other-500	You shouldn t underfeed the poor kid said Wally It s clear that he s finding his nourishment when and how he can Isn t there a Society for dealing with people like you
3245-6194-0018	train-other-500	There is said Jim solemnly It s called the Police Force You re two horrible boys said their hostess laughing And my lovely fat Michael
none	none	 he s getting so corpulent he can hardly waddle He and the puppy are really very like each other both of them find it easier to roll than to run She cast an inquiring eye round the room 
3245-6194-0019	train-other-500	Some more tea Norah No thank you missus Hunt Norah s voice sounded strange in her own ears She wanted to get away from the room and the light hearted chatter to make sure
3245-6194-0020	train-other-500	though she was sure already The guns of France seemed to sound very near her The party broke up after a while Jim and Wally lingered behind the others
none	none	 Will you and the Major come over this evening 
3245-6194-0021	train-other-500	missus Hunt We re off to morrow Oh I m sorry missus Hunt s face fell
none	none	 Poor Norah 
3245-6194-0022	train-other-500	Norah will keep smiling said Jim But I m jolly glad you re so near her missus Hunt You ll keep an eye on them won t you I d be awfully obliged if you would
none	none	 You may be very sure I will she said And there will be a tremendous welcome whenever you get leave 
3245-6194-0023	train-other-500	We won t lose any time in coming for it Jim said
none	none	 Blighty means more than ever it did now that we ve got a real home 
3245-6194-0024	train-other-500	Then you ll come to night Of course we will She watched them stride off into the shrubbery and choked back a sigh Norah came back to them through the trees
3245-6194-0025	train-other-500	It s marching orders isn t it Yes it s marching orders old kiddie Jim answered They looked at each other steadily and then Norah s eyes met Wally s When she asked
3245-6194-0026	train-other-500	To morrow morning Well said Norah and drew a long breath And I haven t your last week s socks darned That comes of having too many responsibilities
3245-6194-0027	train-other-500	Any buttons to be sewn on for either of you No thanks they told her greatly relieved
none	none	 She tucked a hand into an arm of each boy and they went towards the house 
3245-6194-0028	train-other-500	David Linton came out hurriedly to meet them Allenby says he began He did not need to go further We were trotting in to tell you said Jim
3245-6194-0029	train-other-500	We ll be just in time to give the Boche a cheery Christmas said Wally Norah are you going to send us a Christmas hamper With a pudding Rather Norah answered
none	none	 And I ll put a lucky pig and a button and a threepenny bit in it so you d better eat it with care or you may damage your teeth Miss de Lisle and I are going to plan great parcels for you she s going to teach me to cook all sorts of things After which you ll try them on the dogs meaning us Jim said laughing 
3245-6194-0030	train-other-500	Well if we don t go into hospital after them we ll let you know They came into the house where already the news of the boys going had spread and the Once Tired s as Wally called their guests
3245-6194-0031	train-other-500	were waiting to wish them luck Then everybody faded away unobtrusively and left them to themselves They went into the morning room and Norah darned socks vigorously
3245-6194-0032	train-other-500	while the boys kept up a running fire of cheery talk Whatever was to come they would meet it with their heads up
none	none	 all four They made dinner a revel every one dressed in their best and playing up to their utmost while Miss de Lisle the only person in the house who had wept 
3245-6194-0033	train-other-500	had sent up a dinner which really left her very little extra chance of celebrating Peace when that most blessed day should come Over dessert Colonel West rose unexpectedly and made a little speech
none	none	 proposing the health of the boys who sat for the first time with utterly miserable faces restraining an inclination to get under the table I am sure said the Colonel that we all wish the ah 
3245-6194-0034	train-other-500	greatest of luck to our host s sons ah that is to his son and to ah his ah Encumbrance said Wally firmly
none	none	 Quite said the Colonel without listening We know they will ah 
3245-6194-0035	train-other-500	make things hot for the Boche ah
none	none	 whenever they get a chance 
3245-6194-0036	train-other-500	I we hope they will get plenty of chances
none	none	 and ah 
3245-6194-0037	train-other-500	that we will see them ah back with decorations and promotion We will miss them ah very much
none	none	 Speaking ah personally 
3245-6194-0038	train-other-500	I came here fit for nothing and have ah
none	none	 laughed so much that I ah could almost believe myself a subaltern 
3245-6194-0039	train-other-500	The Tired People applauded energetically and missus West said Quite quite But there was something like tears in her eyes as she said it The Hunts arrived after dinner
none	none	 and they all woke the house with ringing choruses echoed by Allenby in his pantry as he polished the silver and Garrett sang a song which was not encored because something in his silver tenor 
3245-6194-0040	train-other-500	made a lump come into Norah s throat and there was no room for that to night of all nights Jack Blake sang them a stockrider s song with a chorus in which all the Australians joined
3245-6194-0041	train-other-500	and Dick Harrison recited The Geebung Polo Club without any elocutionary tricks and brought down the house Jim had slipped out to speak to Allenby and presently going out
none	none	 they found the hall cleared and the floor waxed for dancing They danced to gramophone music manipulated by mister Linton and Norah and missus Hunt had to divide each dance into three 
3245-6194-0042	train-other-500	except those with Jim and Wally which they refused to partition
none	none	 regardless of disconsolate protests from the other warriors 
3245-6194-0043	train-other-500	It was eleven o clock when Allenby announced stolidly Supper is served sir Supper said mister Linton How s this Norah I don t know said his daughter
3245-6194-0044	train-other-500	Ask Miss de Lisle They filed in to find a table laden and glittering in the centre a huge cake bearing the greeting Good Luck with a silken Union Jack waving proudly
3245-6194-0045	train-other-500	Norah whispered to her father and then ran away She returned presently dragging the half unwilling cook lady It s against all my rules protested the captive
none	none	 Rules be hanged said Jim cheerfully Just you sit there Miss de Lisle And the cook lady found herself beside Colonel West who paid her great attention regarding her 
3245-6194-0046	train-other-500	against the evidence of his eyes as a Tired Person whom he had not previously chanced to meet My poor neglected babies said missus Hunt tragically as twelve strokes chimed from the grandfather clock in the hall
3245-6194-0047	train-other-500	Wally and Norah crowned with blue and scarlet paper caps the treasure of crackers
none	none	 were performing a weird dance which they called 
3245-6194-0048	train-other-500	with no very good reason a tango It might have been anything but it satisfied the performers The music stopped suddenly and mister Linton wound up the gramophone for the last time
3245-6194-0049	train-other-500	slipping on a new record The notes of Auld Lang Syne stole out They gathered round holding hands while they sang it singing with all their lungs and all their hearts
3245-6194-0050	train-other-500	Norah between Jim and Wally feeling her fingers crushed in each boyish grip Then here s a hand my trusty friend And gie s a hand o thine
none	none	 Over the music her heart listened to the booming of the guns across the Channel But she set her lips and sang on It was morning and they were on the station 
3245-6194-0051	train-other-500	The train came slowly round the corner I ll look after him Nor Wally s voice shook Don t worry too much old girl And yourself too she said
none	none	 Oh I ll keep an eye on him said Jim And Dad s your job And we ll plan all sorts of things for your next leave said David Linton God bless you boys They gripped hands Then Jim put his arms round Norah s shoulder You ll keep smiling kiddie Whatever comes Yes I promise Jimmy The guard was shouting 
3245-6194-0052	train-other-500	All aboard Cheero Norah Wally cried from the window We ll be back in no time Cheero She made the word come somehow
none	none	 The train roared off round the curve CHAPTER XII OF LABOUR AND PROMOTION The months went by quickly enough as David Linton and his daughter settled down to their work at the Home for Tired People As the place became more widely known they had rarely an empty room The boys regiment sent them many a wearied officer too fagged in mind and body to enjoy his leave the hospitals kept up a constant supply of convalescent and maimed patients and there was a steady stream of Australians of all ranks who came homesick for their own land and found a little corner of it planted in the heart of Surrey Gradually as the Lintons realized the full extent of the homesickness of the lads from overseas Homewood became more and more Australian in details Pictures from every State appeared on the walls aboriginal weapons and curiosities woven grass mats from the natives of Queensland Australian books and magazines and papers all were scattered about the house They filled vases with blue gum leaves and golden wattle blossom from the South of France Norah even discovered a flowering boronia in a Kew nurseryman s greenhouse and carried it off in triumph to scent the house with the unforgettable delight of its perfume She never afterwards saw a boronia without recalling the bewilderment of her fellow travellers in the railway carriage at her exquisitely scented burden You should have seen their wondering noses Dad said Norah chuckling No one of course stayed very long at Homewood unless he were hopelessly unfit From ten days to three weeks was the average stay then like ships that pass in the night the Once Tireds drifted away But very few forgot them Little notes came from the Fronts in green Active Service envelopes postcards from Mediterranean ports letters from East and West Africa grateful letters from wives in garrison stations and training camps throughout the British Isles They accumulated an extraordinary collection of photographs in uniform and Norah had an autograph book with scrawled signatures peculiar drawings and an occasional scrap of very bad verse Major Hunt his hand fully recovered returned to the Front in February and his wife prepared to seek another home But the Lintons flatly refused to let her go We couldn t do it said David Linton Doesn t the place agree with the babies Oh you know it does said missus Hunt But we have already kept the cottage far too long there are other people Not for that cottage Norah said It really isn t fair protested their guest Douglas never dreamed of our staying if he had not been sent out in such a hurry at the last he would have moved us himself David Linton looked at her for a moment Go and play with the babies Norah he said I want to talk to this obstinate person Now look missus Hunt he said as Norah went off rather relieved Norah hated arguments You know we run this place for an ideal a dead man s ideal He wanted more than anything in the world to help the war we re merely carrying on for him We can only do it by helping individuals But you have done that for us Look at Douglas strong and fit with one hand as good as the other Think of what he was when he came here He may not always be fit And if you stay here you ease his worries by benefiting his children and saving for their future Then if he has the bad luck to be wounded again his house is all ready for him I know she said And I would stay but that there are others who need it more Well we haven t heard of them Look at it another way I am getting an old man it worries me a good deal to think that Norah has no woman to mother her I used to think he said with a sigh that it was worse for them to lose their own mother when they were wee things now I am not sure that Norah s loss is not just beginning It s no small thing for her to have an influence like yours and Norah loves you missus Hunt flushed Indeed I love her she said Then stay and mother her There are ever so many things you can teach her that I can t that Miss de Lisle can t good soul as she is They re not things I can put into words but you ll understand I know she s clean and wholesome right through but you can help to mould her for womanhood Of course she left school far too early but there seemed no help for it And if if bad news comes to us from the Front for any of us we can all help each other missus Hunt thought deeply If you really think I can be of use I will stay she said I m not going to speak of gratitude I tried to say all that long ago But indeed I will do what I can That s all right I m very glad said David Linton And if you really want her taught more missus Hunt said well I was a governess with fairly high certificates before I was married She could come to me for literature and French I was brought up in Paris Her music too she really should practise with her talent I d like it above all things exclaimed mister Linton Norah s neglected education has been worrying me badly We ll plan it out missus Hunt said Now I feel much happier Norah did not need much persuasion after the first moment of dismay at the idea of renewed lessons she saw the advantages of the plan helped by the fact that she was always a little afraid of failing to come up to Jim s standard A fear which would considerably have amazed Jim had he but guessed it It was easy enough to fit hours of study into her day She rose early to practise before the Tired People were awake and most mornings saw her reading with missus Hunt or chattering French while Eva sang shrilly in the kitchen and the babies slept in their white bunks and Geoffrey followed mister Linton s heels either on Brecon or afoot The big Australian squatter and the little English boy had become great friends there was something in the tiny lad that recalled the Jim of long ago with his well knit figure and steady eyes One man alone out of all Tired People had never left Homewood For a time after his arrival Philip Hardress had gained steadily in strength and energy then a chill had thrown him back and for months he sagged downwards never very ill but always losing vitality The old depression seemed to come back to him tenfold He could see nothing good in life a cripple a useless cripple His parents were dead save for a brother in Salonica he was alone in the world He was always courteous always gentle but a wall of misery seemed to cut him off from the household Then the magnificent physique of the boy asserted itself and gradually he grew stronger and the hacking cough left him Again it became possible to tempt him to try to ride He spent hours in the keen wintry air jogging round the fields and lanes with mister Linton and Geoffrey returning with something of the light in his eyes that had encouraged Norah in his first morning long ago I believe all he wants is to get interested in something Norah said watching him one day as he sat on the stone wall of the terrace looking across the park He was at Oxford before he joined the Army wasn t he Dad mister Linton assented His people arranged when he was little that he should be a barrister But he hated the idea His own wish was to go out to Canada Norah pondered Couldn t you give him a job on the farm Dad I don t know said her father I never thought of it I suppose I might find him something to do Hawkins and I will be busy enough presently He s beginning to worry at being here so long Norah said Of course we couldn t possibly let him go he isn t fit for his own society I think if you could find him some work he would be more content So David Linton after thinking the matter over took Hardress into his plans for the farm which was to be the main source of supply for Homewood He found him a quick and intelligent helper The work was after the boy s own heart he surrounded himself with agricultural books and treaties on fertilizers made a study of soils and took samples of earth from different parts of the farm to the profound disgust of Hawkins War had not done away with all expert agricultural science in England Hardress sent his little packets of soil away and received them back with advice as to treatment which later on resulted in the yield of the land being doubled which Hawkins attributed solely to his own skill as a cultivator But the cure was worked in Philip Hardress The ring of hope came back into his voice the shop leg dragged ever so little as he walked across the park daily to where the ploughs were turning the grass of the farm fields into stretches of brown dotted with white gulls that followed the horses slow plodding up and down The other guests took up a good deal of mister Linton s time he was not sorry to have an overseer since Hawkins while honest and painstaking was not afflicted with any undue allowance of brains Together in the study at night they planned out the farm into little crops Already much of the land was ready for the planting and a model poultry run built near the house was stocked with birds while a flock of sheep grazed in the park and to the tiny herd of cows had been added half a dozen pure bred Jerseys David Linton had taken Hardress with him on the trip to buy the stock and both had enjoyed it thoroughly Meanwhile the boys at the Front sent long and cheery letters almost daily Astonishment had come to them almost as soon as they rejoined in finding themselves promoted they gazed at their second stars in bewilderment which was scarcely lessened by the fact that their friends in the regiment were not at all surprised Why didn t you have a war on your own account in Ireland queried Anstruther You got a Boche submarine sunk and caught half the crew didn t you Well but that was only a lark said Wally You were wounded anyhow young Meadows Of course we know jolly well you don t deserve anything but you can t expect the War Office to have our intimate sources of information He patted Wally on the back painfully Just be jolly thankful you get more screw and don t grumble No one ll ever teach sense to the War Office There was no lack of occupation in their part of the line They saw a good deal of fighting and achieved some reputation as leaders of small raids Jim in particular having a power of seeing and hearing at night that had been developed in long years in the Bush but which seemed to the Englishmen almost uncanny There was reason to believe that the enemy felt even more strongly about it there was seldom rest for the weary Boche in the trenches opposite Jim Linton s section Some of his raids were authorized others were not It is probable that the latter variety was more discouraging to the enemy Behind the fighting line they were in fairly comfortable billets The officers were hardworked the daily programme of drill and parades was heavy and in addition there was the task of keeping the men interested and fit no easy matter in the bitter cold of a North France winter Jim proved a tower of strength to his company commander as he had been to his school He organized football teams and taught them the Australian game he appealed to his father for aid and in prompt response out came cases of boxing gloves hockey and lacrosse sets and footballs enough to keep every man going Norah sent a special gift a big case of indoor games for wet weather with a splendid bagatelle board that made the battalion deeply envied by less fortunate neighbours until a German shell disobligingly burst just above it and reduced it to fragments However Norah s disgust at the news was so deep that the Tired People in residence at Homewood at the moment conspired together and supplied the battalion with a new board in her name and this time it managed to escape destruction The battalion had some stiff fighting towards the end of the winter and earned a pat on the back from high quarters for its work in capturing some enemy trenches But they lost heavily especially in officers Jim s company commander was killed at his side the boy went out at night into No Man s Land and brought his body in single handed in grim defiance of the Boche machine guns Jim had liked Anstruther it was not to be thought of that his body should be dishonoured by the touch of a Hun Next day he had a far harder task for Anstruther had asked him to write to his mother if he failed to come back Jim bit his pen for two hours over that letter and in his own mind stigmatized it as a rotten effort after it was finished But the woman to whom it carried whatever of comfort was left in the world for her saw no fault in it It was worn and frayed with reading when she locked it away with her dead son s letters Jim found himself a company commander after that day s fighting doing captain s work without captain s rank Wally was his subaltern an arrangement rather doubted at first by the Colonel until he saw that the chums played the game strictly and maintained in working hours a discipline as firm as was their friendship The men adored them they knew their officers shirked neither work nor play and that they knew their own limitations neither Jim nor Wally ever deluded themselves with the idea that they knew as much as their hard bitten non commissioned officers But they learned their men by heart knowing each one s nickname and something of his private affairs losing no opportunity of talking to them and gaining their confidence and sizing them up as they talked just as in old days as captains of the team they had learned to size up boys at football If I ve got to go over the top I want to know what Joe Wilkins and Tiny Judd are doing behind me said Jim They had hoped for leave before the spring offensive but it was impossible the battalion was too shorthanded and the enemy was endeavouring to be the four times armed man who gets his fist in fust In that early fighting it became necessary to deal with a nest of machine guns that had got the range of their trenches to a nicety Shells had failed to find them and the list of casualties to their discredit mounted daily higher Jim got the chance He shook hands with Wally a vision of miserable disappointment in the small hours of a starlit night and led a picked body of his men out of the front trench making a long detour and finally working nearer and nearer to the spot he had studied through his periscope for hours during the day Then he planted his men in a shell hole and wriggled forward alone The men lay waiting inwardly chafing at being left Presently their officer came crawling back to them We ve got em cold he whispered Come along and don t fire a shot It was long after daylight before the German guards in the main trenches suspected anything wrong with that particular nest of machine guns and marvelled at its silence For there was no one left to tell them anything of the fierce silent onslaught from the rear of men who dropped as it were from the clouds and fought with clubbed rifles led by a boy who seemed in the starlight as tall as a young pine tree The gun crews were sleeping and most of them never woke again the guards drowsy in the quiet stillness heard nothing until that swift wordless avalanche was upon them In the British trench there was impatience and anxiety The men waiting to go forward if necessary to support the raiders crouched at the fire step muttering Wally sick with suspense peered forward beside the Colonel who had come in person to see the result of the raid I believe they ve missed their way altogether muttered the Colonel angrily There should hove been shots long ago It isn t like Linton Dawn will be here soon and the whole lot will be scuppered He wheeled at a sudden commotion beyond him in the trench Silence there What s that That was Jim Linton and his warriors very muddy but otherwise undamaged They dropped into the trench quietly those who came first turning to receive heavy objects from those yet on top Last of all Jim hopped down Hullo Wal he whispered Got em Got em said the Colonel sternly What Where have you been sir I beg your pardon sir I didn t know you were there Jim said rather horrified It is not given to every subaltern to call his commanding officer Wal when that is not his name I have the guns sir You have what The Boche I mean the enemy machine guns We brought them back sir You brought them back The Colonel leaned against the wall of the trench and began to laugh helplessly And your men All here sir We brought the ammunition too said Jim mildly It seemed a pity to waste it Which things being told in high places brought Jim a mention in despatches and shortly afterwards confirmation of his acting rank It would be difficult to find fitting words to tell of the effect of this matter upon a certain grizzled gentleman and a very young lady who when the information reached them were studying patent manures in a morning room in a house in Surrey He s why gasped Norah incredulously he s actually Captain Linton I suppose he is said her father Doesn t it sound ridiculous I don t think it s ridiculous at all said Norah warmly He deserved it I think it sounds simply beautiful Do you know said her father somewhat embarrassed I really believe I agree with you He laughed Captain Linton Captain Linton reiterated Norah Our old Jimmy She swept the table clear Oh Daddy bother the fertilizers for to night I m going to write to Billabong But it isn t mail day to morrow protested her father mildly No said Norah But I ll explode if I don t tell Brownie And will the Captain be coming ome soon Miss Norah inquired Allenby a little later The household had waxed ecstatic over the news The Captain Norah echoed Oh how nice of you Allenby It does sound jolly Miss de Lisle wishes to know miss The news as induced er to invent a special cake We ll have to send it to the poor Captain I m afraid said Norah dimpling Dear me I haven t told missus Hunt I must fly She dropped her pen and fled to the cottage to find her father there before her I might have known you couldn t wait to tell said Norah laughing And he pretends he isn t proud missus Hunt I ve given up even pretending said her father laughing I found myself shaking hands with Allenby in the most affectionate manner You see missus Hunt this sort of thing hasn t happened in the family before Oh but those boys couldn t help doing well missus Hunt said looking almost as pleased as the two beaming faces before her They re so keen I don t know if I should but shall I read you what Douglas says about them They gathered eagerly together over the curt words of praise Major Hunt had written Quite ordinary boys and not a bit brainy he finished But I wish I had a regiment full of them Out in Australia two months later a huge old woman and a lean Irishman talked over the letter Norah had at length managed to finish And it s a Captin he is said Murty O Toole head stockman A Captain Brownie echoed Don t it seem only yesterday he was tearing about in his first little trousis and the little mistress watching him And riding his first pony She put him over her head and I med sure he was kilt Howld her will ye Murty says he stamping his little fut and blood trickling down his face Give me a leg up again he says till we see who s boss And I put him up and off he went down the paddock digging his little heels into her And he s a Captin Little Masther Jim I don t know why you re surprised said Brownie loftily The only wonder to me is he wasn t one six months ago CHAPTER XIII THE END OF A PERFECT DAY Are you ready Norah Coming Phil half a minute Hardress in riding kit looked into the kitchen where Norah was carrying on a feverish consultation with Miss de Lisle You ll be late he said warningly Your father and Geoffrey have gone on Will I truly said Norah distractedly Yes Miss de Lisle I ll write to the Stores about it to night Now what about the fish Leave the fish to me said Miss de Lisle laughing If I can t manage to worry out a fish course without you I don t deserve to have half my diplomas Run away the house won t go to pieces in a single hunting day Bless you said Norah thankfully dragging on her gloves and casting a wild glance about the kitchen for her hunting crop Oh there it is Good bye You won t forget that Major Arkwright is only allowed white meat Oh run away I won t forget anything Well he only came last night so I thought you mightn t know said the apologetic mistress of the house All right Phil I m truly coming Good bye Miss de Lisle The words floated back as she raced off to the front door where the horses were fretting impatiently held by the groom They jogged down the avenue Hardress on one of the brown cobs Norah on Brunette the black pony her favourite mount It was a perfect hunting morning mild and still with almost a hint of spring warmth in the air The leafless trees bore faint signs of swelling leaf buds Here and there in the grass beside the drive crocus bells peeped out at them purple white and gold We ll have daffodils soon I do believe Norah said Well I love Australia but there isn t anything in the world lovelier than your English spring Ahead of them as they turned into the road they could see mister Linton looking extraordinarily huge on Killaloe beside Geoffrey s little figure on Brecon This is a great day for Geoff Hardress said Yes he has been just longing to go to a meet Of course he has driven a good many times but missus Hunt has been a bit nervous about his riding But he s perfectly safe and it isn t as if Brecon ever got excited No Come along Norah there s a splendid stretch of grass here let s canter They had agreed upon a Christian name footing some time before when it seemed that Hardress was likely to be a permanent member of the household She looked at him now as they cantered along through the dew wet grass at the side of the road No one would have guessed at anything wrong with him he was bronzed and clear eyed and sat as easily in the saddle as though he had never been injured Sometimes said Norah suddenly I find myself wondering which of your legs is the shop one She flushed I suppose I oughtn t to make personal remarks but your leg does seem family property So it is said Hardress grinning Anyhow you couldn t make a nicer personal remark than that one So I forgive you But it s all thanks to you people We couldn t have done anything if you hadn t been determined to get on Norah answered As soon as you made up your mind to that well you got on I don t know how you stood me so long he muttered Then they caught up to the riders ahead and were received by Geoffrey with a joyful shout You were nearly late Norah said mister Linton I dragged her from the kitchen sir Hardress said She and Miss de Lisle were poring over food if we get no dinner to night it will be our fault If you had the responsibility of feeding fourteen hungry people you wouldn t make a joke of it said Norah It s very solemn especially when the fishmonger fails you hopelessly There s always tinned salmon suggested her father Tinned salmon indeed Norah s voice was scornful We haven t come yet to giving the Tired People dinner out of a tin However it s all right Miss de Lisle will work some sort of a miracle I m not going to think of housekeeping for a whole day The meet was four miles away near a marshy hollow thickly covered with osiers and willows A wood fringed the marsh and covered a hill which rose from a little stream beyond it Here and there was a glimpse of the yellow flame of gorse There were rolling fields all round many of them ploughed it had not yet been made compulsory for every landowner to till a portion of his holding but English farmers were beginning to awake to the fact that while the German submarine flourished it would be both prudent and profitable to grow as much food as possible and the plough had been busy The gate into the field overlooking the marsh stood open a few riders were converging towards it from different points The old days of crowded meets and big fields of riders were gone Only a few plucky people struggled to keep the hounds going and to find work for the hunters that had escaped the first requisition of horses for France The hounds came into view as mister Linton s party arrived The Master came first on a big workmanlike grey a tall woman with a weatherbeaten face surmounted by a bowler hat The hounds trotted meekly after her one or another pausing now and then to drink at a wayside puddle before being rebuked for bad manners by a watchful whip missus Ainslie liked the Lintons she greeted them pleasantly Nice morning she said Congratulations I hear the boy is a Captain We can t quite realize it Norah said laughing You see we hardly knew he had grown up Well he grew to a good size said missus Ainslie with a smile Hullo Geoff Are you going to follow to day They won t let me said Geoffrey dolefully I know Brecon and I could but Mother says we re too small Too bad said missus Ainslie Never mind you ll be big pretty soon A tall old man in knickerbockers greeted her Squire Brand who owned a famous property a few miles away and who had the reputation of never missing a meet although he did not ride He knew every inch of the country it was said that he could boast at the end of a season that he had on the whole seen more of the runs than any one else except the Master He was a tireless runner with an extraordinarily long stride which carried him over fields and ditches and gave him the advantage of many a short cut impossible to most people He knew every hound by name some said he knew every fox in the country and he certainly had an amazing knowledge of the direction a fox was likely to take Horses on the other hand bored him hopelessly he consented to drive them in the days when motors were not but merely as a means of getting from place to place A splendid car with a chauffeur much smarter than his master had just dropped him a grant figure in weatherbeaten Harris tweeds grasping a heavy stick We should get a good run to day he said Yes with luck missus Ainslie answered Any news from the Colonel Nothing in particular plenty of hard fighting But he never writes much of that He s much more interested in a run he had with a queer scratch pack near their billets I can t quite gather how it was organized but it comprised two beagles and a greyhound and a fox terrier and a pug He said they had a very sporting time Squire Brand chuckled I don t doubt it he said Did he say what they hunted Anything they could get apparently They began with a hare and then got on to a rabbit in some mysterious fashion They finished up with a brisk run in the outskirts of a village and got a kill it turned out this time to be a cat missus Ainslie s rather grim features relaxed into a smile If any one had told Val two years ago that he would be enthusiastic over a day like that A few other riders had come up two or three officers from a neighbouring town a couple of old men and a sprinkling of girls Philip Hardress was the only young man in plain clothes and strangers who did not suspect anything amiss with his leg looked at him curiously Look at that dear old thing he whispered to Norah indicating a prim maiden lady who had arrived on foot I know she s aching for a chance to ask me why I m not in khaki He grinned delightedly She s rather like the old lady who met me in the train the other day and after looking at me sadly for a few minutes said My dear young man do you not know that your King and Country want you Phil What did you say I said Well they ve got one of my legs and they don t seem to have any use for the remnant I don t think she believed me so I invited her to prod it He chuckled at his grim joke Three months ago he had shrunk from any mention of his injury as from the lash of a whip missus Ainslie never wasted time Two minutes grace for any laggards which gave time for the arrival of a stout lady on a weight carrying cob and then she moved on and in a moment the hounds were among the osiers hidden except that now and then a waving stern caught the eye Occasionally there was a brief whimper and once a young hound gave tongue too soon and was presumably rebuked by his mother and relapsed into hunting in shamed silence The osiers proved blank they drew out and went up the hill into the covert while the field moved along to be as close as possible and the followers on foot dodged about feverishly hoping for luck that would make a fox break their way Too often the weary lot of the foot contingent is to see nothing whatever after the hounds once enter covert since the fox is apt to leave it as unobtrusively as possible at the far side and to take as short a line as he can across country to another refuse To follow the hounds on foot needs a stout heart and patience surpassing that of Job But those on horses know little of the blighting experiences of the foot plodders and when Norah went a hunting everything ceased to exist for her except the white and black and tan hounds and the green fields and Brunette under her as eager as she for the first long drawn out note from the pack They moved restlessly back and forth along the hillside the black pony dancing with impatience at the faintest whimper from an unseen hound Near them Killaloe set an example of steadiness but with watchful eyes and pricked ears Squire Brand came up to them I d advise you to get up near the far end of the covert he said It s almost a certainty that he ll break away there and make a bee line across to Harley Wood I hope he will for there s less plough there than in the other direction He hurried off and Norah permitted Brunette to caper after him A young officer on a big bay followed their example Come along he said to a companion It s a safe thing to follow old Brand s lead if you want to get away well Where the covert ended the hill sloped gently to undulating fields divided by fairly stiff hedges with deep ditches and occasionally by post and rail fences more like the jumps that Norah knew in Australia The going was good and sound and there was no wire that terror of the hunter Norah had always hated wire either plain or barbed She held that it found its true level in being used against Germans Somewhere in a tangle of bracken an old hound spoke sharply A little thrill ran through her She saw her father put his pipe in his pocket and pull his hat more firmly down on his forehead while she held back Brunette who was dancing wildly Then came another note and another and a long drawn burst of music from the hounds and suddenly Norah saw a stealthy russet form with brush sweeping the ground that stole from the covert and slid down the slope and after him a leaping wave of brown and white and black as hounds came bounding from the wood and flung themselves upon the scent with missus Ainslie close behind Some one shouted Gone awa a y in a voice that went ringing in echoes round the hillside Brunette bucked airily over the low fence near the covert and Killaloe took it almost in his stride Then they were racing side by side down the long slope with the green turf like wet velvet underfoot and the next hedge seemed rushing to meet them Over landing lightly in the next field before them only the Master and whip and the racing hounds with burning eyes for the little red speck ahead trailing his brush By Jove Norah said David Linton we re in for a run Norah nodded Speech was beyond her only all her being was singing with the utter joy of the ride Beneath her Brunette was spurning the turf with dainty hooves stretching out in her gallop yet gathering herself cleverly at her fences with alert pricked ears judging her distance and landing with never a peck or stumble The light weight on the pony s back was nothing to her the delicate touch on her mouth was all she needed to steady her at the jumps Near Harley Wood the fox decided regretfully that safety lay elsewhere the enemy running silently and surely were too hot on his track He crept through a hedge and slipped like a shadow down a ditch and hounds jumping out were at fault for a moment The slight check gave the rest of the field time to get up That s a great pony Norah heard the young officer say She patted Brunette s arching neck Then a quick cast of the hounds picked up the scent and again they were off but no longer with the fences to themselves so that it was necessary to be watchful for the cheerful enthusiast who jumps on top of you and the prudent sportsman who wobbles all over the field in his gallop seeking for a gap Killaloe drew away again there was no hunter in the country side to touch him After him went Brunette with no notion of permitting her stable companion to lose her in a run like this A tall hedge faced them with an awkward take off from the bank of a ditch Killaloe crashed through Brunette came like a bird in his tracks Norah s arm across her face to ward off the loose branches She got through with a tear in her coat landing on stiff plough through which missus Ainslie s grey was struggling painfully Brunette s light burden was all in her favour here Norah was first to the gate on the far side opening it just in time for the Master and thrilling with joy at that magnate s brief Thank you as she passed through and galloped away The plough had given the hounds a long lead But ahead were only green fields dotted by clumps of trees racing ground firm and springy The air sang in their ears The fences seemed as nothing the good horses took them in racing style landing with no shock and galloping on needing no touch of whip or spur The old dog fox was tiring as well he might and yet ahead he knew lay sanctuary in an old quarry where the piled rocks hid a hole where he had lain before with angry hounds snuffing helplessly around him He braced his weary limbs for a last effort The cruel eyes and lolling tongues were very close behind him but his muscles were steel and he knew how to save every short cut that gave him so much as a yard He saw the quarry just ahead and snarled his triumph in his untamed heart Brunette s gallop was faltering a little and Norah s heart sank She had never had such a run it was hard if she could not see it out when they had led the field the whole way and while yet Killaloe was going like a galloping machine in front Then she heard a shout from her father and saw him point ahead Water came to her She saw the gleam of water fringed by reeds saw Killaloe rise like a deer at it taking off well on the near side and landing with many feet to spare Oh we can do that Norah thought Brunette likes water She touched the pony with her heel for the first time and spoke to her Brunette responded instantly gathering herself for the jump Again Norah heard a shout and was conscious of the feeling of vague irritation that we all know when some one is trying to tell us something we cannot possibly hear She took the pony at the jump about twenty yards from the place where Killaloe had flown it Nearer and nearer The water gleamed before her very close she felt the pony steady herself for the leap Then the bank gave way under her heels there was a moment s struggle and a stupendous splash Norah s first thought was that the water was extremely cold then that the weight on her left leg was quite uncomfortable Brunette half crouched half lay in the stream too bewildered to move then she sank a little more to one side and Norah had to grip her mane to keep herself from going under the surface It seemed an unpleasantly long time before she saw her father s face Norah are you hurt No I m not hurt she said But I can t get my leg out and Brunette seems to think she wants to stay here I suppose she finds the mud nice and soft She tried to smile at his anxious face but found it not altogether easy We ll get you out said David Linton He tugged at the pony s bridle and missus Ainslie arriving presently came to his assistance while some of the other riders coming up behind encouraged Brunette with shouts and hunting crops Thus urged Brunette decided that some further effort was necessary and made one with a mighty flounder while Norah rolled off into the water Half a dozen hands helped her at the bank You re sure you re not hurt her father asked anxiously I was horribly afraid she d roll on your leg when she moved I m quite all right only disgustingly wet said Norah Oh and I missed the finish did you ever know such bad luck Well you only missed the last fifty yards said missus Ainslie pointing to the quarry from which the whips were dislodging the aggrieved hounds We finished there and that old fox is good for another day yet I d give you the brush if he hadn t decided to keep it himself Oh said Norah blushing while her teeth chattered Wasn t it a beautiful run It was but something has got to be done with you said missus Ainslie firmly There s a farmhouse over there mister Linton I know the people and they ll do anything they can for you Hurry her over and get her wet things off missus Hardy will lend her some clothes And Norah made a draggled and inglorious exit missus Hardy received her with horrified exclamations and offers of all that she had in the house so that presently Norah found herself drinking cup after cup of very hot tea and eating buttered toast with her father attired in a plaid blouse of green and red in large checks and a black velvet skirt that had seen better days with carpet slippers lending a neat finish to a somewhat striking appearance Without farm hands rubbed down Killaloe and Brunette in the stable missus Hardy fluttered in and out bringing more and yet more toast until her guests protested vehemently that exhausted nature forbade them to eat another crumb And wot is toast grumbled missus Hardy and you ridin all day in the cold She had been grievously disappointed at her visitors refusing bacon and eggs The young lady ll catch er death sure s fate Just another cup miss Lor who s that comin in at the gate That proved to be Squire Brand who had appeared at the scene of Norah s disaster just after her retreat being accused by missus Ainslie of employing an aeroplane I came to see if I could be of any use he said His eye fell on Norah in missus Hardy s clothes and he said Dear me suddenly and for a moment lost the thread of his remarks You can t let her ride home Linton my car is here and if your daughter will let me drive her home I m sure mister Hardy will house her pony until to morrow you can send a groom over for it I ve a spare coat in the car Yes thank you missus Hardy I should like a cup of tea very much Now that the excitement of the day was over Norah was beginning to feel tired enough to be glad to escape the long ride home on a jaded horse So with missus Hardy s raiment hidden beneath a gorgeous fur coat she was presently in the Squire s car slipping through the dusk of the lonely country lanes The Squire liked Jim and asked questions about him and to talk of Jim was always the nearest way to Norah s heart She had exhausted his present and was as far back in his past as his triumphs in inter State cricket when they turned in at the Homewood avenue I m afraid I ve talked an awful lot she said blushing You see Jim and I are tremendous chums I often think how lucky I was to have a brother like him as I had only one Possibly Jim thinks the same about his sister said the old man He looked at her kindly there was something very child like in the small face half lost in the great fur collar of his coat At all events Jim has a good champion he said Oh Jim doesn t need a champion Norah answered Every one likes him I think And of course we think there s no one like him The motor stopped and the Squire helped her out It was too late to come in he said he bade her good night and went back to the car Norah looked in the glass in the hall and decided that her appearance was too striking to be kept to herself A very battered felt riding hat surmounted missus Hardy s finery it bore numerous mud splashes some of which had extended to her face No one was in the hall it was late and presumably the Tired People were dressing for dinner She headed for the kitchen meeting on the way Allenby who uttered a choking sound and dived into his pantry Norah chuckled and passed on Miss de Lisle sat near the range knitting her ever present muffler She looked up and caught her breath at the apparition that danced in Norah more like a well dressed scarecrow than anything else with her grey eyes bright among the mud splashes She held up missus Hardy s velvet skirt in each hand and danced solemnly up the long kitchen pointing each foot daintily in the gaudy carpet slippers Oh my goodness ejaculated Miss de Lisle and broke into helpless laughter Norah sat down by the fender and told the story of her day with a cheerful interlude when Katty came in hurriedly failed to see her until close upon her and then collapsed Miss de Lisle listened twinkling Well you must go and dress she said at length It would be only kind to every one if you came down to dinner like that but I suppose it wouldn t do It wouldn t be dignified said Norah looking at the moment as though dignity were the last thing she cared about Well I suppose I must go She gathered up her skirts and danced out again pausing at the door to execute a high kick Then she curtsied demurely to the laughing cook lady and fled to her room by a back staircase She came down a while later tubbed and refreshed in a dainty blue frock with a black ribbon in her shining curls The laughter had not yet died out of her eyes she was humming one of Jim s school songs as she crossed the hall Allenby was just turning from the door A telegram Miss Norah Thanks Allenby She took it still smiling I hope it isn t to say any one is coming to night she said as she carried it to the light Wouldn t it be lovely if it was to tell us they had leave There was no need to specify whom they meant But I m afraid that s too much to hope just yet She tore open the envelope There was a long silence as she stood there with the paper in her hand a silence that grew gradually more terrible while her face turned white Over and over she read the scrawled words as if in the vain hope that the thing they told might yet prove only a hideous dream from which presently she might wake Then as if very far away she heard the butler s shaking voice Miss Norah Is it bad news You can send the boy away she heard herself say as though it were some other person speaking There isn t any answer He has been killed Not mister Jim Allenby s voice was a wail Yes She turned from him and walked into the morning room shutting the door In the grate a fire was burning the leaping light fell on Jim s photograph standing on a table near She stared at it still holding the telegram Surely it was a dream she had so often had it before Surely she would soon wake and laugh at herself The door was flung open and her father came in ruddy and splashed She remembered afterwards the shape of a mud splash on his sleeve It seemed to be curiously important Norah what is wrong She put out her hands to him then shaking Jim had said it was her job to look after him but she could not help him now And no words would come Is it Jim At the agony of his voice she gave a little choking cry catching at him blindly The telegram fluttered to the floor and David Linton picked it up and read it He laid the paper on the table and turned to her holding out his hands silently and she came to him and put her face on his breast trembling His arm tightened round her So they stood while the time dragged on He put her into a chair at last and they looked at each other they had said no word since that first moment Well said David Linton slowly we knew it might come And we know that he died like a man and that he never shirked Thank God we had him Norah And thank God my son died a soldier not a slacker CHAPTER XIV CARRYING ON After that first terrible evening during which no one had looked upon their agony David Linton and his child took up their life again and tried to splice the broken ends as best they might Their guests who came down to breakfast nervously preparing to go away at once found them in the dining room haggard and worn but pleasantly courteous they talked of the morning s news of the frost that seemed commencing of the bulbs that were sending delicate spear heads up through the grass or the bare flower beds There were arrangements for the day to be made for those who cared to ride or drive the trains to be planned for a gunner subaltern whose leave was expiring next day Everything was quite as usual outwardly Pretty ghastly meal what remarked the young gunner to a chum as they went out on the terrace Rather like dancing at a funeral Philip Hardress came into the morning room where mister Linton and Norah were talking I don t need to tell you how horribly sorry I am he faltered No thanks Phil You you haven t any details No Wally will write as soon as he can Norah added Yes of course The others want me to say sir of course they will go away They all understand I can go too just to the hotel I can supervise Hawkins from there I hope none of you will think of doing any such thing David Linton said Our work here is just the same Jim would never have wished us not to carry on But Hardress began There isn t any but Norah and I are not going to sit mourning with our hands in front of us We mean to work a bit harder that s all You see the ghost of a smile flickered across the face that had aged ten years in a night more than ever now whatever we do for a soldier is done for Jim Hardress made a curious little gesture of protest And I m left half of me You have got to help us Phil Norah said We need you badly I can t do much he said But as long as you want me I m here Then I m to tell the others sir Tell them we hope they will help us to carry on as usual said David Linton I ll come across with you presently Phil to look at the new cultivator I hear it arrived last night He looked at Norah as the door closed You re sure it isn t too much for you my girl I will send them away if you would rather we were by ourselves for a while I promised Jim that whatever happened we d keep smiling Norah said He wouldn t want us to make a fuss Jim always did so hate fusses didn t he Dad She was quite calm Even when missus Hunt came hurrying over and put her kind arms about her Norah had no tears I suppose we haven t realized it she said Perhaps we re trying not to I don t want to think of Jim as dead he was so splendidly alive ever since he was a tiny chap Try to think of him as near you missus Hunt whispered Oh he is I know Jim never would go far from us if he could help it I know he s watching somewhere and he will be glad if we keep our heads up and go straight on He would trust us to do that Her face changed Oh missus Hunt but it s hard on Dad He has you still I m only a girl said Norah No girl could make up for a son and such a son as Jim But I ll try There came racing little feet in the hall and Geoffrey burst in It isn t true he shouted Say it isn t true Norah Allenby says the Germans have killed Jim I know they couldn t He tugged at her woollen coat Say it s a lie Norah Jim couldn t be dead Geoff Geoff dear missus Hunt tried to draw him away Don t Norah said She put her arms round the little boy and suddenly her head went down on his shoulder The tears came at last missus Hunt went softly from the room There were plenty of tears in the household The servants had all loved the big cheery lad with the pleasant word for each one They went about their work red eyed and Allenby chafed openly at the age that kept him at home doing a woman s work while boys went out to give their lives laughing for Empire It ain t fair he said to Miss de Lisle who sobbed into the muffler she was knitting It ain t fair Kids they are no more They ain t meant to die Oh if I could only get at that there Kayser Then after a week of waiting came Wally s letter Norah Dear I don t know how to write to you I can t bear to think about you and your father It seems it must be only a bad dream and all the time I know it isn t even though I keep thinking I hear his whistle the one he used for me I had better tell you about it We had orders to attack early one morning Jim was awfully keen he had everything ready and he had been talking to the men until they were all as bucked up as they could be You know he was often pretty grave about his work but I don t think I ever saw him look so happy as he did that morning He looked just like a kid He told me he felt as if he were going out on a good horse at Billabong We were looking over our revolvers and he said That s the only thing that feels wrong it ought to be a stock whip We hadn t much artillery support Our guns were short of shells as usual But we took the first trench and the next Jim was just everywhere He was always first the men would have followed him down a precipice He was laughing all the time We didn t get much time before they counter attacked They came on in waves as if there were millions of them and we had a pretty stiff fight in the trench It was fairly well smashed about I was pretty busy about fifty yards away but I saw Jim up on a broken traverse using his revolver just as calmly as if he were practising in camp and cheering on the men He gave me a Coo ee And then oh I don t know how to tell you Just as I was looking at him a shell burst near him and when the smoke blew over there was nothing traverse and trench and all it was just wiped out I couldn t get near him the Boches were pouring over in fresh masses and we got the signal to retire and I was the only one left to get the men back He couldn t have felt anything that s the only thing I wish it had been me I m nobody s dog and he was just everything to you two and the best friend a fellow ever had It would have been so much more reasonable if it had been me I just feel that I hate myself for being alive I would have saved him for you if I could Norah Wally There were letters too from Jim s Colonel and from Major Hunt and Garrett and every other brother officer whom Jim had sent to Homewood and others that Norah and her father valued almost more highly from men who had served under him Letters that made him glow with pride almost forgetting grief as they read them It seemed so impossible to think that Jim would never come again I can t feel as though he were dead Norah said looking up at her father I know I ve got to get used to knowing he has gone away from us for always But I like to think of him as having only changed work Jim never could be idle in Heaven he always used to say it seemed such a queer idea to sit all day in a white robe and play a harp Jim s Heaven would have to be a very busy one and I know he s gone there Dad David Linton got up and went to the bookcase He came back with Westward Ho in his hand I was reading Kingsley s idea of it last night he said I think it helps Norah Listen The best reward for having wrought well already is to have more to do and he that has been faithful over a few things must find his account in being made ruler over many things That is the true and heroical rest which only is worthy of gentlemen and sons of God Jim was only a boy but he went straight and did his best all his life I think he has just been promoted to some bigger job So they held their heads high as befitted people with just cause for being proud and set themselves to find the rest that comes from hard work There was plenty to do for the house was always full of Tired People Not that the Lintons ever tried to entertain their guests Tired People came to a big quiet house where everything ran smoothly and all that was possible was done for comfort Beyond that they did exactly as they chose There were horses and the motor for those who cared to ride and drive the links for golfers walks with beautiful scenery for energetic folk and dainty rooms with big easy chairs or restful lounges under the trees on the lawn for those who asked from Fate nothing better than to be lazy No one was expected to make conversation or to behave as an ordinary guest Everywhere there was a pleasant feeling of homeliness and welcome shy men became suddenly at their ease nerve racked men strained with long months of the noise and horror of war relaxed in the peace of Homewood and went back to duty with a light step and a clear eye Only there was missing the wild merriment of the first few weeks when Jim and Wally dashed in and out perpetually and kept the house in a simmer of uncertainty and laughter That could never come again But beyond the immediate needs of the Tired People there was much to plan and carry out Conscription in England was an established fact already there were few fit men to be seen out of uniform David Linton looked forward to a time when shortage of labour coupled with the deadly work of the German submarines should mean a shortage of food and he and Norah set themselves to provide against that time of scarcity Miss de Lisle and Philip Hardress entered into every plan lending the help of brains as well as hands The farm was put under intensive culture and the first provision made for the future was that of fertilizers which since most of them came from abroad were certain to be scarce mister Linton and Hardress breathed more freely when they had stored a two years supply The flock of sheep was increased the fowl run doubled in size and put in charge of a disabled soldier a one armed Australian whom Hardress found in London ill and miserable and added to the list of Homewood s patients and cures Young heifers were bought and boarded out at neighbouring farms a populous community of grunting pigs occupied a little field And in the house Norah and Miss de Lisle worked through the spring and summer until the dry and spacious cellars and storerooms showed row upon row of shelves covered with everything that could be preserved or salted or pickled from eggs to runner beans Sometimes the Tired People lent a hand becoming interested in their hosts schemes Norah formed a fast friendship with a cheerful subaltern in the Irish Guards who was with them for a wet fortnight much of which he spent in the kitchen stoning fruit making jam and acting as bottler in chief to the finished product There were many who asked nothing better than to work on the farm digging planting or harvesting indeed in the summer one crop would have been ruined altogether by a fierce storm but for the Tired People who from an elderly Colonel to an Australian signaller flung themselves upon it and helped to finish getting it under cover carrying the last sheaves home just as the rain came down in torrents and returning to Homewood in a soaked but triumphant procession Indeed nearly all the unending stream of guests came under the spell of the place so that Norah used to receive anxious inquiries from various corners of the earth afterwards from Egypt or Salonica would come demands as to the success of a catch crop which the writer had helped to sow or of a brood of Buff Orpingtons which he had watched hatching out in the incubator even from German East Africa came a letter asking after a special litter of pigs Perhaps it was that every one knew that the Lintons were shouldering a burden bravely and tried to help They kept Jim very close to them A stranger hearing the name so often on their lips might have thought that he was still with them Together they talked of him always not sadly but remembering the long happy years that now meant a memory too dear ever to let go Jim had once asked Norah for a promise If I go West he said don t wear any horrible black frocks So she went about in her ordinary dresses especially the blue frocks he had loved with just a narrow black band on her arm There were fresh flowers under his picture every day but she did not put them sadly She would smile at the frank happy face as she arranged leaves and blossoms with a loving hand Later on David Linton fitted up a carpenter s bench and a workshop the days were too full for much thinking but he found the evenings long He enlisted Hardress in his old work of splint making and then found that half his guests used to stray out to the lit workshop after dinner and beg for jobs so that before long the nearest Hospital Supply Depot could count on a steady output of work from Homewood missus Hunt and Norah used to come as polishers Miss de Lisle suddenly discovered that her soul for cooking included a corner for carpentry and became extraordinarily skilful in the use of chisel and plane When the autumn days brought a chill into the air mister Linton put a stove into the workshop and it became a kind of club where the whole household might often be found they extended their activities to the manufacture of crutches bed rests bed tables and half a dozen other aids to comfort for broken men No work had helped David Linton so much In the early summer Wally came back on leave a changed Wally with grim lines where there had once been only merry ones in his lean brown face He did not want to come to Homewood only when begged to come did he master the pitiful shrinking he felt from meeting them I didn t know how to face you he said Norah had gone to meet him and they were walking back from the station Don t Wally you hurt she said It s true though I didn t I feel as if you must hate me for coming back alone Hate you and you were Jim s chum I always came as Jim s chum Wally said heavily From the very first when I was a lonely little nipper at school I sort of belonged to Jim And now well I just can t realize it Norah I can t keep on thinking about him as dead I know he is and one minute I m feeling half insane about it and the next I forget and think I hear him whistling or calling me He clenched his hands It s the minute after that that is the worst of all he said For a time they did not speak They walked on slowly along the pleasant country lane with its blossoming hedges I know Norah said There s not much to choose between you and Dad and me when it comes to missing Jim But as for you well you did come as Jim s chum first and always but you came just as much because you were yourself You know you belonged to Billabong as we all did You can t cut yourself off from us now Wally I he echoed Well if I do I have mighty little left But I felt that you couldn t want to see me I know what it must be like to see me come back without him I m not going to say it doesn t hurt said Norah Only it hurts you as much as it does us And the thing that would be ever so much worse is for you not to come Why you re the only comfort we have left Don t you see you re like a bit of Jim coming back to us Oh Norah Norah he said If I could only have saved him Don t we know you d have died quite happily if you could Norah said Just as happily as he would have died for you He did you know Wally said All the youth and joy had gone out of his voice leaving it flat and toneless Two or three times that morning he kept me out of a specially hot spot and took it himself He was always doing it we nearly punched each other s heads about it the day before I told him he was using his rank unfairly He just grinned and said subalterns couldn t understand necessary strategy in the field He would said Norah laughing Wally stared at her I didn t think I d ever see you laugh again Not laugh Norah echoed Why it wouldn t be fair to Jim if we didn t We keep him as near us as we can talk about him and about all the old happy times We did have such awfully good times together didn t we We re never going to get far away from him The boy gave a great sigh I ve been getting a long way from everything he said Since since it happened I couldn t let myself think it was just as if I were going mad The only thing I ve wanted to do was to fight and I ve had that He looks as if his mind were more tired than his body David Linton said that evening One can see that he has just been torturing himself with all sorts of useless thoughts You ll have to take him in hand Norah Put the other work aside for a while and go out with him ride as much as you can It won t do you any harm either We never thought old Wally would be one of the Tired People Norah said musingly No indeed And I think there has been no one more utterly tired It won t do Norah the boy will be ill if we don t look after him We ve just got to make him feel how much we want him Norah said Yes And we have to teach him to think happily about Jim not to fight it all the time Fighting won t make it any better said David Linton with a sigh But there was no riding for Wally for a while The next day found him too ill to get up and the doctor sent for hastily talked of shock and over strain and ordered bed until his temperature should be pleased to go down which was not for many a weary day Possibly it was the best thing that could have happened to Wally He grew if not reconciled at least accustomed to his loss grew too to thinking himself a coward when he saw the daily struggle waged by the two people he loved best And Norah was wise enough to call in other nurses chief of them the Hunt babies Alison and Michael who rolled on his bed and played with him while Geoffrey sat as close to him as possible and could hardly be lured from the room It was not for weeks after his return that they heard Wally laugh and then it was at some ridiculous speech of Michael s that he suddenly broke into the ghost of his old mirth Norah s heart gave a leap Oh he s better she thought You blessed little Michael And so healing came to the boy s bruised soul Not that the old light hearted Wally came back but he learned to talk of Jim and no longer to hug his sorrow in silence Something became his of the peace that had fallen upon Norah and her father It was all they could hope for to begin with They said good bye to him before they considered him well enough to go back to the trenches But the call for men was insistent and the boy himself was eager to go Come back to us soon Norah said wistfully Oh I m safe to come back Wally said I m nobody s dog you know That s not fair she flashed Say you re sorry for saying it He flushed I m sorry if I hurt you Nor I suppose I was a brute to say that Something of his old quaint fun came into his eyes for a moment Anyhow it s something to be somebody s dog especially if one happens to belong to Billabong in Surrey CHAPTER XV PRISONERS AND CAPTIVES The church was half in ruins Great portions of the roof had been torn away by shell fire and there were gaping holes in the walls through which could be caught glimpses of sentries going backwards and forwards Sometimes a grey battalion swung by sometimes a German officer peered in curiously with a sneer on his lips The drone of aircraft came from above through the holes where the rafters showed black against the sky Ever the guns boomed savagely from beyond There were no longer any seats in the church They had all been broken up for camp fires even the oaken pulpit had gone The great empty space had been roughly cleared of fallen masonry which had been flung in heaps against the wall on the stone floor filthy straw was thinly spread On the straw lay row upon row of wounded men very quiet for the most part they had found that it did not pay to make noise enough to annoy the guards who smoked and played cards in a corner The long day how long only the men on the straw knew was drawing to a close The sun sank behind the western window which the guns had spared and the stained glass turned to a glory of scarlet and gold and blue The shafts of colour lay across the broken altar whence everything had been stripped they bathed the shattered walls in a beauty that was like a cloak over the nakedness of their ruin Slowly they crept over the floor as the sun sank lower touching the straw with rosy fingers falling gently on broken bodies and pain drawn faces and weary eyes looked gratefully up to the window where a figure of Christ with a child in His arms stood glorious in the light and blessed them with the infinite pity of His smile A little Cockney lad with a dirty bandage round his head who had tossed in pain all day on the chancel steps turned to the window to greet the daily miracle of the sunset Worf waiting for all the day that is he muttered The restlessness left him and his eyes closed presently in sleep Slowly the glory died away and as it passed a little figure in a rusty black cassock came in making his way among the men on the straw It was the French priest who had refused to leave his broken church a little fat man not in the least like a hero but with as knightly a soul as was ever found in armour and with lance in rest He passed from man to man speaking in quaint English occasionally dropping gladly into French when he found some one able to answer him in his own language He had nothing to give them but water but that he carried tirelessly many times a day His little store of bandages and ointment had gone long ago but he bathed wounds helped cramped men to change their position and did the best he could to make the evil straw into the semblance of a comfortable bed To the helpless men on the floor of the church his coming meant something akin to Paradise He paused near a little Irishman with a broken leg a man of the Dublin Fusiliers whose pain had not been able to destroy his good temper How are you to night mon garcon Yerra not too bad Father said the Irishman If I could have just a taste of water now He drank deeply as the priest lifted his head and sank back with a word of thanks This feather pillow of mine is apt to slip if I don t watch it he said wriggling the back of his head against the cold stone of the floor from which the straw had worked away I dunno could you gather it up a bit Father He grinned I d ask you to put me boots under me for a pillow but if them thieving guards found them loose they d shweep them from me Ss h my son the priest whispered warningly He shook up a handful of straw and made it as firm as he could under the man s head It is not prudent to speak so loud Remember you cannot see who may be behind you Indeed and I cannot returned Denny Callaghan I ll remember Father That s great He settled his head thankfully on the straw pillow I ll sleep aisier to night for that And Monsieur le Capitaine has he moved yet The priest glanced at a motionless form near them Well indeed he did Father this afternoon He gev a turn an he said something like Tired People I thought there was great sense in that if he was talkin to us so I was cheered up about him but not a word have I got out of him since But it s something that he spoke at all The cure bent over the quiet figure Two dark eyes opened as if with difficulty and met his Norah said Jim Linton Are you there Norah I am a friend my son said the cure Are you in pain The dark eyes looked at him uncomprehendingly Then he murmured Water It is here The little priest held the heavy head and Jim managed to drink a little Something like a shadow of a smile came into his eyes as the priest wiped his lips Then they closed again If they would send us a doctor muttered the cure in his own language longingly Ma joi what a lad He looked down in admiration at the splendid helpless body He won t die Father will he I do not know my son I can find no wound except the one on his head nothing seems broken Perhaps he will be better to morrow He gave the little Irishman his blessing and moved away There were many eager eyes awaiting him Jim was restless during the night Denny Callaghan himself unable to sleep watched him muttering and trying to turn but unable to move I doubt but his back s broken said the little man ruefully Yerra what a pity He tried to soothe the boy with kind words and towards the dawn Jim slept heavily He woke when the sun was shining upon him through a rift in the wall The church was full of smothered sounds stifled groans from helpless men stiffened by lying still and trying to move Jim managed to raise himself a little at which Denny Callaghan gave an exclamation of relief Hurroo Are you better sir Where am I Jim asked thickly Tis in a church you are sir though it s not much like it said the little man The Germans call it a hospital Tis all I wish they may have the like themselves and they wounded Are you better sir I think I m all right Jim said He was trying to regain his scattered faculties So they ve got me He tried to look at Callaghan What s your regiment The Dubs sir Tis hard luck I kem back wounded from Suvla Bay and they sent me out to the battalion here and I d not been with them a week before I got landed again Now tis a German prison ahead and by all one hears they re not rest camps No said Jim He tried to move but failed sinking back with a stifled groan I wish I knew if I was damaged much Are there any doctors here There was two a while back They fixed us up somehow and we haven t seen a hair of them since The guards throw rations of a sort at us twice a day Tis badly off we d be if it weren t for the priest Is he French He is and a saint if there ever was one There he comes now Callaghan crossed himself reverently A hush had come over the church The cure in his vestments had entered going slowly to the altar Jim struggled up on his elbow There was perfect silence in the church men who had been talking ceased suddenly men who moaned in their pain bit back their cries So they lay while the little priest celebrated Mass as he had done every morning since the Germans swept over his village at first alone and since the first few days to a silent congregation of helpless men They were of all creeds and some of no creed at all but they prayed after him as men learn to pray when they are at grips with things too big for them He blessed them at the end with uplifted hand and dim eyes followed him as he went slowly from the church He was back among them presently in the rusty black cassock The guards had brought in the men s breakfast great cans of soup and loaves of hard dark bread They put them down near the door tramping out with complete disregard of the helpless prisoners The priest would see to them aided by the few prisoners who could move about wounded though they were In any case the guard had no order to feed prisoners they were not nurse maids they said Ah my son You are awake Jim smiled up at the cure Have I been asleep long sir Three days They brought you in last Friday night Do you not remember No said Jim I don t remember coming here He drank some soup eagerly but shook his head at the horrible bread The food cleared his head and when the little cure had gone away promising to return as soon as possible he lay quietly piecing matters together in his mind Callaghan helped him the Dublins had been in the line next his own regiment when they had gone over the top on that last morning Oh I remember all that well enough Jim said We took two lines of trench and then they came at us like a wall the ground was grey with them And I was up on a smashed traverse trying to keep the men together when it went up too A shell was it Jim shook his head A shell did burst near us but it wasn t that No the trench was mined and the mine went off a shade too late They delayed somehow it should have gone off if we took the trench before they counter attacked As it was it must have killed as many of their men as ours They told me about it afterwards Afterwards said Callaghan curiously He looked at Jim a little doubtful as to whether he really knew what he was talking about Did ye not come straight here then sir I did not I was buried said Jim grimly The old mine went up right under me and I went up too I came down with what seemed like tons of earth on top of me I was covered right in I tell you only I managed to get some of the earth away in front of my nose and mouth I was lying on my side near the edge of a big heap of dirt with my hands near my face If I d been six inches further back there wouldn t have been the ghost of a chance for me I got some of the earth and mud away and found I could breathe just as I was choking But I was buried for all that All our chaps were fighting on top of me D ye tell me gasped Callaghan incredulously I could feel the boots Jim said I m bruised with them yet What time did we go over that morning nine o clock wasn t it It was sir Well it was twelve or one o clock when they dug me out They re took the trench and started to dig themselves in and they found me I ve a spade cut on my hand My Aunt that was a long three hours Did they treat you decent sir They weren t too bad Jim said I couldn t move I suppose it was the weight on me and the bruising at least I hope so They felt me all over there was a rather decent lieutenant there who gave me some brandy He told me he didn t think there was anything broken But I couldn t stir and it hurt like fury when they touched me And how long were you there sir They had to keep me until night there was no way of sending back prisoners So I lay on a mud heap and the officer boy talked to me he had been to school in England That s where they larned him any decency he had said Callaghan It might be But he wasn t a bad sort He looked after me well enough Then after nightfall they sent a stretcher party over with me The German boy shook hands with me when we were starting and said he was afraid he wouldn t see me again as we were pretty sure to be shelled by the British And were you sir Rather The first thing I knew was a bit of shrapnel through the sleeve of my coat I looked for the hole this morning to see if I was remembering rightly and sure enough here it is He held up his arm and showed a jagged tear in his tunic But that s where I stop remembering anything I suppose I must have caught something else then Why is my head tied up It was all right when they began to carry me over Ye have a lump the size of an egg low down on the back of your head sir said Callaghan And a nasty little cut near your temple H m said Jim I wondered why it ached Well I must have got those from our side on the way across I hope they got a Boche or two as well I dunno Callaghan said The fellas that dumped you down said something in their own haythin tongue I didn t understand it but it sounded as if they were glad to be rid of you Well I wouldn t blame them Jim said I m not exactly a featherweight and it can t be much fun to be killed carrying the enemy about whether you re a Boche or not He lay for a while silently thinking Did they know at home yet he wondered anxiously And then he suddenly realized that his fall must have looked like certain death that if they had heard anything it would be that he had been killed He turned cold at the thought What had they heard his father Norah And Wally what did he think Was Wally himself alive He might even be a prisoner He turned at that thought to Callaghan his sudden move bringing a stifled cry to his lips Did they are there any other officers of my regiment here There are not said Callaghan I got the priest to look at your badges sir the way he could find out if there was anny more of ye But there is not Them that s here is mostly Dublins and Munsters with a sprinkling of Canadians There s not an officer or man of the Blankshires here at all barring yourself Will the Germans let us communicate with our people Communicate is it said the Irishman Yerra they ll not let anyone send so much as a scratch on a post card He dropped his voice Whisht now sir the priest s taking all our addresses and he ll do his best to send word to every one at home But can he depend on getting through Faith he cannot But tis the only chance we ve got The poor man s nothing but a prisoner himself he s watched if he goes tin yards from the church So I dunno at all will he ever manage it with the suspicions they have of him Jim sighed impatiently He could do nothing then nothing to keep the blow from falling on the two dear ones at home He thought of trying to bribe the German guards and felt for his pocket book but it was gone some careful Boche had managed to relieve him of it while he had been unconscious And he was helpless a log while over in England Norah and his father were perhaps already mourning him as dead His thoughts travelled to Billabong where Brownie and Murty O Toole and the others kept the home ready for them all working with the love that makes nothing a toil and planning always for the great day that should bring them all back He pictured the news arriving saw Brownie s dismayed old face and heard her cry of incredulous pain And there was nothing he could do It seemed unbelievable that such things could be in a sane world But then the world was no longer sane it had gone mad nearly two years before and he was only one of the myriad atoms caught into the swirl of its madness The cure came again presently and saw his troubled face You are in pain my son No I m all right if I keep quiet Jim answered But it s my people Callaghan says you will try to let them know Father I am learning you all said the priest names regiments and numbers is it not I dare not put them on paper I have been searched three times already even to my shoes But I hope that my chance will come before long Then I will send them to your War Office He beamed down on Jim so hopefully that it seemed rather likely that he would find a private telegraph office of his own suddenly Now I will learn your name and regiment He repeated them several times nodding his head Yes that is an easy one he said Some of them are very terrible to a Frenchman our friend here he looked quaintly at Callaghan has a name which it twists the tongue to say And now my son I would like to examine you since you are conscious I am the only doctor a poor one I fear But perhaps we will find out together that there is nothing to be uneasy about That indeed was what they did find out after a rather agonizing half hour Jim was quite unable to move his legs being so bruised that there was scarcely a square inch of him that was not green and blue and purple One hip bore the complete impress of a foot livid and angry Yes that chap jumped on me from a good height Jim said when the cure exclaimed at it I thought he had smashed my leg He went near it said the cure Indeed my son you are beaten to a jelly But that will recover itself You can breathe without pain That is well Now we will look at the head He unwrapped the bandages and felt the lump tenderly Ah that is better a little concussion I think mon brave it is that which kept you so quiet when you stayed with us at first And the cut heals well that comes of being young and strong with clean healthy blood He bathed the head and replaced the bandages sighing that he had no clean ones But with you it matters little you will not need them in a few days Then perhaps we will wash these and they will be ready for the next poor boy He smiled at Jim Move those legs as much as you can my son and rub them He trotted away And that same is good advice said Callaghan It will hurt to move sir and you beaten to a pulp first and then stiffening for the three days you re after lying here tis all I wish I could rub you with a good bottle of Elliman s to do it with But if them Huns move you twill hurt a mighty lot more than if you move yourself Themselves is the boys for that they think they ve got a feather in their caps if they get an extra yelp out of annywan So do the best you can sir I will said Jim and did his best for long hours every day It was weary work with each movement torture and for a time very little encouragement came in the shape of improvement then slowly with rubbing and exercise the stiffened muscles began to relax Callaghan cheered him on forgetting his own aching leg in his sympathy for the boy in his silent torment In the intervals of physical jerks Jim talked to his little neighbour whose delight knew no bounds when he heard that Jim knew and cared for his country He himself was a Cork man with a wife and two sons Jim gathered that their equal was not to be found in any town in Ireland Callaghan occasionally lamented the foolishness that had kept him in the Army when he had a right to be home looking after Hughie and Larry Tis not much the Army gives you and you giving it the best years of your life he said I d be better out of it and home with me boys Then you wouldn t let them go to the war if they were old enough Jim asked If they were old enough twould not be asking my liberty they d be rejoined mister Callaghan proudly Is it my sons that ud shtand out of a fight like this He glared at Jim loftily unconscious of any inconsistency in his remarks Well there s plenty of your fellow countrymen that won t go and fight Cally said the man beyond him a big Yorkshireman There s that in all countries said Callaghan calmly They didn t all go in your part of the country did they till they were made Faith I m towld there s a few there yet in odd corners and likely to be till after the war The men round roared joyfully at the expense of the Yorkshireman And tis not in Ireland we have that quare baste the con sci en tious objector went on Callaghan rolling the syllables lovingly on his tongue That s an animal a man wouldn t like to meet now Whatever our objectors are in Ireland they re surely never con sci en tious Jim gave a crack of laughter that brought the roving grey eye squarely upon him Even in Australia that s the Captain s country said the soft Irish voice I ve heard tell there s a boy or two there out of khaki maybe they re holding back for conscription too But wherever the boys are that don t go none of them have a song and dance made about them barring only the Irish What about your Sinn Feiners some one sang out Callaghan s face fell Yerra they have the country destroyed he admitted And nine out of every ten don t know annything about politics or annything else at all only they get talked over and towld that they re patriots if they ll get howld of a gun and do a little drilling at night an where s the country boy that wouldn t give his ears for a gun An the English Gov mint that could stop it all with the stroke of a pen hasn t the pluck to bring in conscription in Ireland You re right there Cally said some one I know well I m right But the thousands and tens of thousands of Irish boys that went to the war and fought till they died they ll be forgotten and the Sinn Fein scum ll be remembered If the Gov mint had the pluck of a mouse they d be all right I tell you boys twill be the Gov mint s own fault if we see the haythin Turks parading the fair fields of Ireland with their long tails held up by the Sinn Feiners Callaghan relapsed into gloomy contemplation of this awful possibility and refused to be drawn further Even when Jim desiring to be tactful mentioned a famous Irish V C who had single handed slain eight Germans he declined to show any enthusiasm Ah what V C he said sourly Sure his owld father wouldn t make a fuss of him Why didn t he do more says he I often laid out twenty men myself with a stick and I coming from Macroom Fair It is a bad trial of Mick that he could kill only eight and he having a rifle and bayonet he says Cock him up with a V C After which Jim ceased to be consoling and began to exercise his worst leg knowing well that the sight of his torments would speedily melt Denny s heart and make him forget the sorrows of Ireland The guards did not trouble them much they kept a strict watch which was not difficult as all the prisoners were partially disabled and then considered their duty discharged by bringing twice a day the invariable meal of soup and bread No one liked to speculate on what had gone to the making of the soup it was a pale greasy liquid with strange lumps in it and tasted as dish water may be supposed to taste Jim learned to eat the sour bread by soaking it in the soup He had no inclination to eat but he forced himself to swallow the disgusting meals so that he might keep up his strength just as he worked his stiff limbs and rubbed them most of the day For there was but one idea in Jim Linton s mind escape Gradually he became able to sit up and then to move a little hobbling painfully on a stick which had been part of a broken pew and endeavouring to take part in looking after the helpless prisoners and in keeping the church clean since the guards laughed at the idea of helping at either Jim had seen something of the treatment given to wounded German soldiers in England and he writhed to think of them tended as though they were our own sick while British prisoners lay and starved in filthy holes But the little cure rebuked him But what would you my son They are canaille without breeding without decency without hearts Are we to put ourselves on that level I suppose not but it s a big difference Father Jim muttered The bigger the difference the more honour on our side said the little priest And things pass Long after you and I and all these poor lads are forgotten it will be remembered that we came out of this war with our heads up But they Suddenly fierce scorn filled his quiet eyes They will be the outcasts of the world Wherefore Jim worked on and tried to take comfort by the cure s philosophy although there were many times when he found it hard to digest It was all very well to be cheerful about the verdict of the future but difficult to forget the insistent present with the heel of the Hun on his neck It was sometimes easier to be philosophic by dreaming of days when the positions should be reversed He was able to walk a little when the order came to move The guards became suddenly busy officers whom the prisoners had not seen before came in and out and one evening the helpless were put roughly into farm carts and taken to the station while those able to move by themselves were marched after them marched quickly with bayonet points ready behind them to prod stragglers It was nearly dark when they were thrust roughly into closed trucks looking back for the last time on the little cure who had marched beside them with an arm for two sick men and now stood on the platform looking wistfully at them He put up his hand solemnly God keep you my sons A German soldier elbowed him roughly aside The doors of the trucks were clashed together leaving them in darkness and presently with straining and rattling and clanging the train moved out of the station Next stop Germany said Denny Callaghan from the corner where he had been put down And not a ticket between the lot of us CHAPTER XVI THROUGH THE DARKNESS I think that s the last load Jim Linton said He had wriggled backwards out of a black hole in the side of a black cupboard and now sat back on his heels gasping His only article of attire was a pair of short trousers From his hair to his heels he was caked with dirt Well praise the pigs for that said a voice from the blackness of the cupboard Some one switched on a tiny electric light Then it could be seen dimly that the cupboard was just large enough to hold four men crouching so closely that they almost touched each other All were dressed or undressed as Jim was all were equally dirty Their blackened faces were set and grim And whether they spoke or moved or merely sat still they were listening listening All four were British officers Marsh and Fullerton were subalterns belonging to a cavalry regiment Desmond was a captain a Dublin Fusilier and Jim Linton completed the quartette and they sat in a hole in the ground under the floor of an officers barrack in a Westphalian prison camp The yawning opening in front of them represented five months ceaseless work night after night It was the mouth of a tunnel I dreamed to day that we crawled in Marsh said in a whisper they had all learned to hear the faintest murmur of speech And we crawled and crawled and crawled for years it seemed And then we saw daylight ahead and we crawled out in Piccadilly Circus That was some tunnel even in a dream Desmond said I feel as if it were some tunnel now remarked Jim still breathing heavily Yes you ve had a long spell Linton We were just beginning to think something was wrong I thought I might as well finish and then another bit of roof fell in and I had to fix it Jim answered Well it won t be gardening that I ll go in for when I get back to Australia I ve dug enough here to last me my life Hear hear said some one And what now Bed I think Desmond said And to morrow night the last crawl down that beastly rabbit run if we ve luck Only this time we won t crawl back He felt within a little hollow in the earth wall and brought out some empty tins and some bottles of water and slowly painstakingly they washed off the dirt that encrusted them It was a long business and at the end of it Desmond inspected them all and was himself inspected to make sure that no tell tale streaks remained Finally he nodded satisfied and then with infinite caution he slid back a panel and peered out into blackness having first extinguished their little light There was no sound He slipped out of the door and returned after a few moments All clear he whispered and vanished One by one they followed him each man gliding noiselessly away They had donned uniform coats and trousers before leaving and closed the entrance to the tunnel with a round screen of rough interlaced twigs which they plastered with earth The tins were buried again with the bottles Ordinarily each man carried away an empty bottle to be brought back next night filled with water but there was no further need of this To morrow night please God there would be no returning no washing crouched in the darkness to escape the eagle eye of the guards no bitter toil in the darkness listening with strained ears all the while Jim was the last to leave He slid the panel into position and placed against it the brooms and mops used in keeping the barrack clean As he handled them one by one a brush slipped and clattered ever so slightly He caught at it desperately and then stood motionless beads of perspiration breaking out upon his forehead But no sound came from without and presently he breathed more freely He stood in a cupboard under the stairs It was Desmond who first realized that there must be space beyond it who had planned a way in and thence to cut a tunnel to freedom They had found or stolen or manufactured tools and had cut the sliding panel so cunningly that none of the Germans who used the broom cupboard had suspected its existence The space on the far side of the wall had given them room to begin their work Gradually it had been filled with earth until there was barely space for them to move then the earth as they dug it out had to be laboriously thrust under the floor of the building which was luckily raised a little above ground They had managed to secrete some wire and having tapped the electric supply which lit the barrack had carried a switch line into their dug out But the tunnel itself had for the most part been done in utter blackness Three times the roof had fallen in badly on the second occasion nearly burying Jim and Fullerton it was considered now that Linton was a difficult man to bury with an unconquerable habit of resurrecting himself A score of times they had narrowly escaped detection For five months they had lived in a daily and nightly agony of fear not of discovery itself or its certain savage punishment but of losing their chance There were eight officers altogether in the syndicate and four others knew of their plan four who were keen to help but too badly disabled from wounds to hope for anything but the end of the war They worked in shifts of four one quartette stealing underground each night as soon as the guards relaxed their vigil while the others remained in the dormitories ready to signal to the working party should any alarm occur and if possible to create a disturbance to hold the attention of the Germans for a little They had succeeded in saving the situation three times when a surprise roll call was made during the night thanks to another wire which carried an electric alarm signal underground from the dormitory Baylis who had been an electrical engineer in time of peace had managed the wiring it was believed among the syndicate that when Baylis needed any electric fitting very badly he simply went and thought about it so hard that it materialized like the gentleman who evolved a camel out of his inner consciousness One of the romances of the Great War might be written about the way in which prisoners bent on escape were able to obtain materials for getting out and necessary supplies when once they were away from the camp Much of how it was done will never be known for the organization was kept profoundly secret and those who were helped by it were often pledged solemnly to reveal nothing Money plenty of money was the only thing necessary given the command of that the prisoner who wished to break out would find mysteriously tools or disguises or whatever else he needed within the camp and after he had escaped the three essentials without which he had very little chance map compass and civilian clothes Then having paid enormous sums for what had probably cost the supply system a few shillings he was at liberty to strike for freedom with a section of German territory a few miles or a few hundred to cross and finally the chance of circumventing the guards on the Dutch frontier It was so desperate an undertaking that the wonder was not that so many failed but that so many succeeded Jim Linton had no money His was one of the many cases among prisoners in which no letters over seemed to reach home no communication to be opened up with England For some time he had not been permitted to write having unfortunately managed to incur the enmity of the camp commandant by failing to salute him with the precise degree of servility which that official considered necessary to his dignity Then when at length he was allowed to send an occasional letter he waited in vain for any reply either from his home or his regiment Possibly the commandant knew why he used to look at Jim with an evil triumph in his eye which made the boy long to take him by his fat throat and ask him whether indeed his letters ever got farther than the office waste paper basket Other officers in the camp would have written about him to their friends so that the information could be passed on to Jim s father but in all probability their letters also would have been suppressed and Jim refused to allow them to take the risk Letters were too precious and went astray too easily it was not fair to add to the chances of their failing to reach those who longed for them at home And then there was always the hope that his own might really have got through even though delayed that some day might come answers telling that at last his father and Norah and Wally were no longer mourning him as dead He clung to the hope though one mail day after another left him bitterly disappointed In a German prison camp there was little to do except hope Jim would have fared badly enough on the miserable food of the camp but for the other officers They received parcels regularly the contents of which were dumped into a common store and Jim and another orphan were made honorary members of the mess with such genuine heartiness that after the first protests they ceased to worry their hosts with objections and merely tried to eat as little as possible Jim thought about them gratefully on this last night as he slipped out of the cupboard and made his way upstairs moving noiselessly as a cat on the bare boards What good chaps they were How they had made him welcome even though his coming meant that they went hungrier They were such a gay laughing little band there was not one of them who did not play the game keeping a cheery front to the world and meeting privation and wretchedness with a joke and a shrug If that was British spirit then Jim decided that to be British was a pretty big thing It was thanks to Desmond and Fullerton that he had been able to join the syndicate They had plenty of money and had insisted on lending him his share of the expenses representing when he had hesitated that they needed his strength for the work of tunnelling after which Jim had laboured far more mightily than they had ever wished or even suspected He was fit and strong again now lean and pinched as were they all but in hard training Hope had keyed him up to a high pitch The last night in this rat hole to morrow A light flashed downstairs and a door flung open just as he reached the landing Jim sprang to his dormitory flinging off his coat as he ran with leaping stealthy strides Feet were tramping up the stairs behind him He dived into his blankets and drew them up under his chin just as he had dived hurriedly into bed a score of times at school when an intrusive master had come upon a midnight spread but with his heart pounding with fear as it had never pounded at school What did they suspect Had they found out anything The guard tramped noisily into the room under a big Feldwebel or sergeant major He flashed his lantern down the long room and uttered a sharp word of command that brought the sleepers to their feet blinking and but half awake Then he called the roll pausing when he came to Jim You sleep in a curious dress Where is your shirt Drying said Jim curtly I washed it I ve only one Enough for an English swine hound said the German contemptuously He passed on to the next man and Jim sighed with relief Presently the guard clanked out and the prisoners returned to their straw mattresses That was near enough whispered Baylis who was next to Jim A good deal too near Jim answered However it ought to be fairly certain that they won t spring another surprise party on us to morrow And a miss is as good as a mile He turned over and in a moment was sleeping like a baby The next day dragged cruelly To the eight conspirators it seemed as long as the weary stretch of months since they had come to the camp For a long while they had avoided each other as far as possible in public knowing that even two men who talked much together were liable to be suspected of plotting on this last day they became afraid even to look at each other and wandered about each endeavouring to put as great a distance as possible between himself and the other seven It became rather like a curious game of hide and seek and by evening they were thoroughly jumpy with their nerves all on edge They had no preparations to make Scarcely any of their few possessions could be taken with them they would find outside if ever they got there food and clothing They had managed to make rough knives that were fairly serviceable weapons beyond these and a few small personal belongings they took nothing except the clothes they wore and they wore as little as possible and those the oldest and shabbiest things to be found So there was nothing to do all that last day but watch the slow hours pass and endeavour to avoid falling foul of any of the guards no easy matter since every German delighted in any chance of making trouble for a prisoner Nothing but to think and plan as they had planned and thought a thousand times before to wonder desperately was all safe still had the door been found in the cupboard under the stairs was the tunnel safe or had it chosen to day of all days to fall in again was the exit in a bed of runner beans already known and watched The Huns were so cunning in their watchfulness it was quite likely that they knew all about their desperate enterprise and were only waiting to pounce upon them in the instant that success should seem within their grasp That was how they loved to catch prisoners The age long afternoon dragged to a close They ate their supper without appetite which was a pity since the meagre store of food in the mess had been recklessly ransacked to give them a good send off Then another hour muttering good byes now and then as they prowled about and finally to bed to lie there for hours of darkness and silence Gradually the noise of the camp died down From the guard room came for a while loud voices and harsh laughter then quiet fell there too and presently the night watch tramped through the barrack on its last visit of inspection flashing lanterns into the faces of the prisoners To night the inspection seemed unusually thorough It set their strained nerves quivering anew Then came an hour of utter stillness and darkness the eight prisoners lying with clenched hands and set teeth listening with terrible intentness Finally when Jim was beginning to feel that he must move or go mad a final signal came from the doorway He heard Baylis say Thank God under his breath as they slipped out of bed in the darkness and felt their way downstairs They were the last to come The others were all crouched in the cupboard waiting for them as they reached its door and just as they did so the outer doorway swung open with a blaze of light and the big Feldwebel strode in Shut the door Jim whispered He launched himself at the German as he spoke with a spring like a panther s His fist caught him between the eyes and he went down headlong the lantern rolling into a corner Jim knew nothing of what followed He was on top of the Feldwebel pounding his head on the floor prepared in his agony of despair to do as much damage as possible before his brief dash for freedom ended Then he felt a hand on his shoulder and heard Desmond s sharp whisper Steady he s unconscious Let me look at him Linton Jim still astride his capture sat back and Desmond flashed the Feldwebel s own lantern into that hero s face H m yes he said Hit his head against something He s stunned anyhow What are we going to do with him Is he the only one Jim asked It seems like it But there may be another at any moment We ve got to go on if he wakes up he ll probably be able to identify you He felt in his pocket and produced a coil of strong cord Come along Linton get off and help me to tie him up They tied up the unconscious Feldwebel securely and lifted him into the cupboard among the brooms gagging him in case he felt inclined for any outcry on coming to his senses The others had gone ahead and were already in the tunnel with them one of the four disabled officers whose job it was to close up the hole at the entrance and dismantle the electric light in the faint hope that the Germans might fail to discover their means of escape and so leave it free for another party to try for freedom He stood by the yawning hole holding one end of a string by which they were to signal from the surface if all went well The wistfulness of his face haunted Jim long afterwards Good bye old man he said cheerily gripping Jim s hand Good luck I wish you were coming Harrison Jim said unhappily No such luck Cheero though the war won t last for ever I ll see you in Blighty They shook hands again and Jim dived into the tunnel He knew every inch of it and wriggled quickly along until the top of his head encountered the boots of the man in front of him after which he went more slowly There seemed a long delay at the end long enough to make him break into a sweat of fear lest something should have gone wrong Such thoughts come easily enough when you are lying full length in black darkness in a hole just large enough to hold a man in air so stifling that the laboured breath can scarcely come with the dank earth just under mouth and nose and overhead a roof that may fall in at any moment The dragging minutes went by Then just as despair seized him the boots ahead moved He wriggled after them finding himself praying desperately as he went A rush of sweet air came to him and then a hand stretching down caught his shoulder and helped him out It was faintly moonlight They stood in a thick plantation of runner beans trained on rough trellis work in a garden beyond the barbed wire fence of the camp The tunnel had turned sharply upwards at the end they had brought with them some boards and other materials for filling it up and now they set to work furiously after giving the signal with the string to Harrison the three sharp tugs that meant All Clear The boards held the earth they shovelled in with their hands they stamped it flat and then scattered loose earth on top with leaves and rubbish working with desperate energy fearing each moment to hear the alarm raised within the barrack Finally all but Desmond gained the beaten earth of the path while he followed trying to remove all trace of footprints on the soft earth He joined them in a moment If they don t worry much about those beans for a few days they may not notice anything he said Come along So often had they studied the way from behind the barbed wire that they did not need even the dim moonlight They hurried through the garden with stealthy strides bending low behind a row of currant bushes and so over a low hedge and out into a field beyond There they ran desperately at first and gradually slackening to a steady trot that carried them across country for a mile and then out upon a highroad where there was no sign of life At a cross roads two miles further on they halted We break up here Desmond said You can find your cache all right you think Baylis Oh yes Baylis nodded It had been thought too dangerous for so many to try to escape together so two hiding places of clothes and food had been arranged Later they would break up again into couples Then we d better hurry Good night you fellows and good luck We ll have the biggest dinner in Blighty together when we all get there Good luck Baylis led his party down a road to the east and Jim Fullerton and Marsh struck south after Desmond who paused now and then to consult a rough map by a pocket lamp On and on by a network of lanes skirting farmhouses where dogs might bark flinging themselves flat in a ditch once when a regiment of Uhlans swept by unconscious of the gasping fugitives a few yards away Jim sat up and looked after their retreating ranks By Jove I wish we could borrow a few of their horses Might buck you off my son said Desmond Come on A little wood showed before them presently and Desmond sighed with relief That s our place I think He looked at the map again We ve got to make for the south west corner and find a big hollow tree They brushed through the close growing firs starting in fear as an owl flew out above them hooting dismally It was not easy to find anything for the moonlight was scarcely able to filter through the branches Jim took the lead and presently they scattered to look for the tree Something big loomed up before Jim presently It should be about here he muttered feeling with his hand for the hollow Then as he encountered a roughly tied bundle he whistled softly and in a moment brought them all to his side There were four rough suits of clothes in the package a big bag of bread meat and chocolate and most precious of all a flat box containing maps compasses and some German money They changed hurriedly thrusting their uniforms deep into the hollow of the tree and covering them with leaves and then divided the food There was a faint hint of dawn in the sky when at length their preparations were complete Well you know your general direction boys Desmond said to Marsh and Fullerton Get as far as you can before light and then hide for the day Hide well remember they ll be looking for us pretty thoroughly to day Good luck They shook hands and hurried away in different directions Desmond and Jim came out into open fields beyond the wood and settled down to steady running over field after field Sometimes they stumbled over ploughed land sometimes made their way between rows of mangolds or turnips where their feet sank deeply into the yielding soil then with a scramble through a ditch or hedge came upon grass land where sheep or cows gazed stolidly at the shadowy racing figures The east brightened with long streaks of pink slowly the darkness died and the yellow circle of the sun came up over the horizon and found them still running casting anxious glances to right and left in search of a hiding place Hang these open fields will they never end Desmond gasped We should be under cover now Behind a little orchard a farm house came into view they were almost upon a cow house It was daylight a window in the house rattled up and a man shouted to a barking dog The fugitives ducked by a sudden impulse and darted into the cow shed It was a long low building divided into stables There was no hiding place visible and despair held them for a moment Then Jim caught sight of a rough ladder leading to an opening in the ceiling and flung his hand towards it he had no speech left They went up it hand over hand and found themselves in a dim loft with pea straw heaped at one end Desmond was almost done Lie down quick Jim pushed him into the straw and covered him over with great bundles of it Then he crawled in himself pulling the rough pea stalks over him until he had left himself only a peep hole commanding the trap door As he did so voices came into the stable They held their breath feeling for their knives Then Desmond smothered a laugh What did they say Jim whispered It would be Bail up Daisy in English Desmond whispered back They re beginning to milk the cows I wish they d milk Daisy up here Jim grinned Man but I m thirsty It was thirsty work lying buried in the dusty pea straw in the close airless loft Hours went by during which they dared not move for when the milking was done and the cows turned out people kept coming and going in the shed They picked up a little information about the war from their talk Jim s German was scanty but Desmond spoke it like a native and in the afternoon a farmer from some distance away who had apparently come to buy pigs let fall the remark that a number of prisoners had escaped from the English camp No one seemed much interested the war was an incident not really mattering so much in their estimation as the sale of the pigs Then every one went away and Jim and his companion fell asleep It was nearly dark when they awoke The sleep had done them good but they were overpoweringly thirsty so thirsty that the thought of food without drink was nauseating The evening milking was going on they could hear the rattle of the streams of milk into the pails in the intervals of harsh voices Then the cows were turned out and heavy feet stamped away They should all be out of the way pretty soon Desmond whispered Then we can make a move We must get to water somehow or He broke off listening Lie still he added quickly Some one is coming up for straw How do you know Tis a young lady and she volunteering to see to bedding for the pigs Desmond answered The ladder creaked and peering out they saw a shock yellow head rise into the trap door The girl who came up was about twenty stoutly built with a broad good humoured face She wore rough clothes and but for her two thick plaits of yellow hair might easily have passed for a man The heavy steps came slowly across the floor while the men lay trying to breath so softly that no unusual movement should stir the loose pea straw Then to their amazement she spoke Where are you she said in English Astonishment as well as fear held them silent She waited a moment and spoke again I saw you come in You need not be afraid Still they made no sign She gave a short laugh Well if you will not answer I must at least get my straw for my pigs She stooped and her great arms sent the loose stalks flying in every direction Desmond and Jim sat up and looked at her in silence You don t seem to want to be killed Desmond said But assuredly you will be if you raise an alarm The girl laughed I could have done that all day if I had wished she said Ever since I saw you run in when I put up my window this morning Well what do you want Money No She shook her head I do not want anything I was brought up in England and I think this is a silly war There is a bucket of milk for you downstairs it will come up if one of you will pull the string you will find tied to the top of the ladder She laughed If I go to get it you will think I am going to call for help Jim was beyond prudence at the moment He took three strides to the ladder found the cord and pulled up a small bucket three parts full of new milk The girl sat down on an empty oil drum and watched them drink So You are thirsty indeed she said Now I have food She unearthed from a huge pocket a package of bread and sausage Now you can eat It is quite safe and you could not leave yet my uncle is still wandering about He is like most men they wander about and are very busy but they never do any work I run the farm and get no wages either But in England I got wages In Clapham That is the place of all others which I prefer Do you indeed Desmond said staring at this amazing female But why did you leave Clapham My father came back to fight He knew all about the war he left England two months before it began I did not wish to leave I desired to remain earning good wages But my father would not permit me And where is he now She shrugged her shoulders I do not know Fighting killed perhaps But my uncle graciously offered me a home and here am I I do the work of three men and I am how did we say it in Clapham bored stiff for England I wish this silly old war would end so that I could return We re trying to return without waiting for it to end said Jim solemnly Only I d like to know how you knew what we were But what else could you be It is so funny how you put on these clothes like the ostrich and think no one will guess who you are If you wore his suit of feathers you would still look like British officers and nothing else You re encouraging said Desmond grimly I hope all your nation won t be as discerning Ach they said the girl They see no farther than their noses I too was like that before I went to Clapham It s a pleasant spot said Desmond I don t wonder you improved there But all the same you are German aren t you I don t quite see why you want to befriend us He took a satisfying mouthful of sausage But I m glad you do In England I am well pretty German said his fair hostess The boys in Clapham they call me Polly Sauer Kraut And I talk of the Fatherland and sing Die Wacht am Rhein Oh yes But when I come back here and work for my so economical uncle on this beastly farm then I remember Clapham and I do not feel German at all I cannot help it But if I said so I would skinned be very quickly So I say Gott Strafe England But that is only eyewash Well we ll think kindly of one German woman anyhow said Desmond The last of your charming sisters I met was a Red Cross nurse at a station where our train pulled up when I was going through wounded I asked her for a glass of water and she brought it to me all right only just as she gave it to me she spat in it I ve been a woman hater ever since until I met you He lifted the bucket and looked at her over its rim Here s your very good health Miss Polly Sauer Kraut and may I meet you in Clapham The girl beamed Oh I will be there she said confidently I have money in the Bank in London I will have a little baker shop and you will get such pastry as the English cannot make Jim laughed And then you will be pretty German again I do not know She shook her head No I think I will just be Swiss They will not know the difference in Clapham And I do not think they will want Germans back Of course the Germans will go but they will call themselves Swiss Poles any old thing Just at first until the English forget the English always forget you know If they forget all they ve got to remember over this business well then they deserve to get the Germans back said Desmond grimly Always excepting yourself Miss Polly You d be an ornament to whichever nation you happened to favour at the moment He finished the last remnant of his sausage That was uncommonly good thank you Now don t you think we could make a move I will see if my uncle is safely in Then I will whistle She ran down the ladder and presently they heard a low call and going down found her awaiting them in the cow shed He is at his supper so all is quite safe she said Now you had better take the third road to the right and keep straight on It is not so direct as the main road but that would lead you through several places where the police are very active and there is a reward for you you know She laughed her white teeth flashing in the dim shed Good bye and when I come back to Clapham you will come and take tea at my little shop We ll come and make you the fashion Miss Polly said Desmond Thank you a thousand times They swung off into the dusk CHAPTER XVII LIGHTS OUT There was two of every single thing in the Ark said Geoffrey firmly The man in Church read it out of the Bible Two Teddy bears asked Alison No Teddies are only toys There was real bears though Meat ones asked his sister hopefully Yes And all the other nanimals Who drived em in Ole Noah and missus Noah Mustn t they have had a time If you tried to drive in our turkeys an sheep and cows together there d be awful trouble and Noah had lions and tigers and snakes too Perhaps he had good sheep dogs Norah suggested She was sewing with missus Hunt under a tree on the lawn while the children played with a Noah s Ark on a short legged table near them He d need them Geoffrey said But would sheep dogs be any good at driving snakes and porklepines Norah Noah s might have been Norah answered prudently They must have been used to it you see And I believe a good sheep dog would get used to anything Funny things ole Noah and his fam ly wore said Geoffrey looking at Japhet with disfavour Like dressing gowns only worse Wouldn t have been much good for looking after nanimals in Why even the Land Army girls wear trousers now Well fashions were different then said missus Hunt Perhaps too they took off the dressing gowns when they got inside the Ark and had trousers underneath Where d they keep all the food for the nanimals anyhow Geoffrey demanded They d want such a lot and it would have to be all different sorts of food Tigers wouldn t eat vegi tubbles like rabbits And efalunts would eat buns said Alison anxiously Did missus Noah make vem buns She couldn t silly unless she had a gas stove said Geoffrey They couldn t carry firewood as well I say Mother don t you think the Ark must have had a supply ship following round like the Navy has It isn t mentioned said missus Hunt I say said Geoffrey struck by a new idea that put aside the question of supply Just fancy if a submarine had torpedoed the Ark Wouldn t it have been exciting Let s do it in the bath said Alison delightedly All right Geoffrey said May we Mother Oh yes if you don t get too wet his mother said resignedly They can all swim that s a comfort We ll muster them said Geoffrey bundling the animals into a heap Hand over that bird Alison I say Mother which came first a fowl or an egg missus Hunt sighed It isn t mentioned she said Which do you think Fowl I specs answered her son I fink it was ve egg said Alison How would it be hatched if it was silly demanded her brother They didn t have ink ink inklebaters then Alison puckered her brows and remained undefeated P raps Adam sat on it she suggested I cannot imagine Adam being broody said missus Hunt Well anyhow he hatched out Eve said Geoffrey No one ventured to combat this statement and the children formed themselves into a stretcher party bearing the Ark and its contents upon a tray in the direction of the bathroom Aren t they darlings Norah said laughing Look at that Michael Michael was toddling behind the stretcher party as fast as his fat legs would permit uttering short and sharp shrieks of anguish lest he should be forgotten Geoffrey gave the order Halt and the Ark and its bearers came to a standstill Come along kid said the commanding officer You can be the band The procession was re formed with Michael in the lead tooting proudly on an imaginary bugle They disappeared within the house They are growing so big and strong said missus Hunt thankfully Michael can t wear any of the things that fitted Geoff at his age as for Alison nothing seems to fit her for more than a month or two then she gracefully bursts out of her garments As for Geoff But he is getting really too independent he went off by himself to the village yesterday and I found him playing football behind one of the cottages with a lot of small boys Oh did you Norah said looking a little worried We heard just before I came over this morning that there is a case of fever in the village some travelling tinker people seem to have brought it Dad said I must tell you we had better not let the children go down there for the present There were some gipsy looking boys among the crowd that Geoff was playing with missus Hunt said anxiously I do hope he hasn t run any risk He is wearing the same clothes too I ll take them off him and have them washed She gathered up her sewing hurriedly But I think Geoff is strong enough now to resist any germ Oh of course he is Norah answered Still it doesn t do any harm to take precautions I ll come and help you missus Hunt Geoffrey congenially employed as a submarine commander about to torpedo the Ark was distinctly annoyed at being reduced to a mere small boy and an unclad one at that I don t see why you want to undress me in the middle of the morning he said wriggling out of his blue jersey And it isn t washing day either and Alison and Michael ll go and sink the Ark without me if you don t hurry I won t let them Geoff Norah reassured him I m an airship commander cruising round over the submarine and she doesn t dare to show so much as the tip of her periscope Of course when her captain comes back he ll know what to do Rather said the Captain wriggling this time in ecstasy I ll just put up my anti aircraft gun and blow the old airship to smithereens Alison uttered a howl Won t have Norah made into smivvereens Don t you worry darling I ll dodge said Norah Michael what are you doing with missus Noah Not want my dear ickle missus Noah dwowned said Michael concealing the lady yet more securely in his tiny pocket She good Michael loves her Oh rubbish Michael put her back in the Ark said Geoffrey wrathfully However can we have a proper submarining if you go and collar half the things Never collared nuffig said Michael unmoved Only tooked my dear ickle missus Noah Never mind Geoff he s only a small boy missus Hunt said Isn t a small boy protested Michael furiously Daddy said I was normous So you are best beloved laughed Norah catching him up Now the submarine commander has on clean clothes and you d better get ready to go on duty Geoffrey dashed back to the bath with a shout of defiance to the airship and the destruction of the Ark proceeded gaily There said missus Hunt putting Geoffrey s garments into a tub It s just as well to have them washed but I really don t think there s any need to worry I don t think you need indeed said Norah laughing as a medley of sound came from the bathroom It was an off day for Norah With Miss de Lisle she had potted and preserved every variety of food that would lend itself to such treatment and now the working season was almost over For the first time the Home for Tired People had not many inmates owing to the fact that leave had been stopped for several men at the Front who had arranged to spend their holiday at Homewood They had with them an elderly colonel and his wife Harry Trevor and another Australian a silent Major who played golf every hour of daylight and read golf literature during the other part of the day and a couple of sappers on final leave after recovering from wounds To day the Colonel and his wife had gone up to London the others with the exception of Major Mackay who as usual might be seen afar upon the links had gone with mister Linton to a sale where he hoped to secure some unusually desirable pigs the sappers happy in ignorance promised themselves much enjoyment in driving them home Left alone therefore Norah had gone for the day to missus Hunt ostensibly to improve her French and needlework but in reality to play with the babies Just how much the Hunt babies had helped her only Norah herself knew I m asked to a festivity the day after to morrow missus Hunt said that afternoon They were having tea in the pleasant sitting room of the cottage sounds from the kitchen indicated that Eva was giving her celebrated performance of a grizzly bear for the benefit of the children The performance always ended with a hunt and with the slaying of the quarry by Geoffrey after which the bear expired with lingering and unpleasant details Douglas s Colonel is in London on leave and he and his wife have asked me to dine and go to a theatre afterwards It would mean staying in London that night of course So of course you ll go I should love to go missus Hunt admitted It would be jolly in itself and then I should hear something about Douglas and all he ever tells me about himself might be put on a field postcard If the babies are quite well Norah do you think you would mind taking charge Norah laughed She had occasionally come to sleep at the cottage during a brief absence on missus Hunt s part and liked nothing better I should love to come she said But you d better not put it that way or Eva will be dreadfully injured I don t to Eva smiled missus Hunt She thinks you come over in case she should need any one to run an errand and therefore permits herself to adore you In fact she told me yesterday that for a young lady you had an uncommon amount of sense Jim would have said that was as good as a diploma Norah said laughing I rather think so myself missus Hunt answered What about Wally Norah Have you heard lately Yesterday Norah replied He decorated his letter with beautiful people using pen wipers so I suppose he is near Ypres He says he s very fit But the fighting seems very stiff I m not happy about Wally Do you think he isn t well I don t think his mind is well said Norah He was better here before he went back but now that he is out again I believe he just can t bear being without Jim He can t think of him happily as we do he only fights his trouble and hates himself for being alive He doesn t say so in words but when you know Wally as well as Dad and I do you can tell form his letters He used to write such cheery funny letters and now he deliberately tries to be funny and it s pretty terrible She paused and suddenly a little sob came missus Hunt stroked her hand saying nothing Do you know Norah said presently I think we have lost Wally more than Jim Jim died but the real Jim is ever close in our hearts and we never let him go and we can talk and laugh about him just as if he was here But the real Wally seems to have died altogether and we ve only the shell left Something in him died when he saw Jim killed missus Hunt do you think he ll ever be better I think he will missus Hunt said He is too fine and plucky to be always like this You have to remember that he is only a boy and that he had the most terrible shock that could come to him It must take time to recover I know Norah said I tried to think like that but it hurts so that one can t help him We would do anything to make him feel better And you will in time Remember you and your father are more to him than any one else in the world Make him feel you want him I think nothing else can help him so much missus Hunt s eyes were full of tears He was such a merry lad it breaks one s heart to think of him as he is He was always the cheerfullest person I ever saw said Norah He just laughed through everything I remember once when he was bitten by a snake and it was hours before we could get a doctor We were nearly mad with anxiety and he was in horrible pain with the tourniquet but he joked through it all in the most ridiculous way And he was always so eager It s the last thing you could call him now All the spring has gone out of him It will come back missus Hunt said Only keep on trying let him see how much he means to you Well he s all we have left said Norah There was silence for a moment and then it was a relief when the children burst into the room They all went to the station two days later to see missus Hunt off for her excursion Michael was not to be depended upon to remain brave when a train actually bore his mother away so they did not wait to see her go there were errands to be done in the village and Norah bundled them all into the governess cart giving Geoffrey the reins to his huge delight He turned his merry face to his mother Good bye darling Take care of yourself in London Town I will said his mother Mind you take care of all the family You re in charge you know Geoff Rather he said I m G O C and they ve got to do what I tell them haven t they And Mother tell the Colonel to send Father home Then you won t be G O C said Norah Don t want to be if Father comes said Geoffrey his eyes dancing You ll tell him won t you Mother Indeed I will she said Now off you go Don t put the cart into the ditch Geoff Isn t you insulting said her son loftily But womens don t understand He elevated his nose and then relented to fling her kisses as the pony trotted off missus Hunt stood at the station entrance to watch him for a moment sitting very straight and stiff holding his whip at the precise angle taught by Jones It was such a heartsome sight that the incoming train took her by surprise and she had barely time to get her ticket and rush for a carriage Norah and her charges found so much to do in the village that when they reached home it was time for Michael s morning sleep Eva brooked no interference with her right of tucking him up for this period of peace but graciously permitted Norah to inspect the process and kiss the rosy cheek peeping from the blankets Then Alison and Geoffrey accompanied her to the house and visited Miss de Lisle in her kitchen finding her by a curious chance just removing from the oven a batch of tiny cakes of bewildering attractions Norah lost them afterwards and going to look for them was guided by sound to Allenby s pantry where that most correct of butlers was found on his hands and knees being fiercely ridden by both his visitors when it was very pleasant to behold Allenby s frantic endeavours to get to his feet before Norah should discover him and yet to avoid upsetting his riders Then they called upon mister Linton in his study but finding him for once inaccessible being submerged beneath accounts and cheque books they fell back upon the billiard room where Harry Trevor and Bob McGrath his chum welcomed them with open arms and romped with them until it was time for Norah to take them home to dinner Awful jolly kids said Harry Why don t you keep them here for lunch Norah Eva would be terribly hurt said Norah She always cooks everything they like best when missus Hunt is away quite regardless of their digestions Well can t they come back afterwards Let s all go for a walk somewhere Oh do pleaded Geoffrey Could we go to the river Norah Yes of course said Norah Will it be too far for Alison though Not it she walked there with Father when he was home last time Do let s Then we must hurry said Norah Come along or Eva will think we have deserted her They found Eva slightly truculent I was wonderin was you stayin over there to dinner she said I know I ain t one of your fine lady cooks with a nime out of the Family Erald but there ain t no arm in that there potato pie for all that It looks beautiful said Norah regarding the brown pie affectionately I m so glad I m here for lunch What does Michael have Eva Michael as fish an e as it out in the kitchen with me said Eva firmly An is own little baby custid puddin No one but me ever cooks anythink for that kid Well of course you send im cakes an things she added grudgingly Oh but they re not nourishment said Norah with tact No said Eva brightening That s wot I says An nourishment is wot counts ain t it Oh rather Norah said And isn t he a credit to you Well come on children I want pie She drew Alison s high chair to the table while Eva departing to the kitchen relieved her feelings with a burst of song They spent a merry afternoon at the river a little stream which went gurgling over pebbly shallows widening now and then into a broad pool or hurrying over miniature rapids where brown trout lurked Harry and Bob like most Australian soldiers in England were themselves only children when they had the chance of playing with babies they romped in the grass with them swung them on low growing boughs or skimmed stones across placid pools until the sun grew low in the west and they came back across the park Norah wheeled Michael in a tiny car Bob carried Alison and presently Geoffrey admitted that his legs were tired and was glad to ride home astride Harry s broad shoulders mister Linton came out to meet them and they all went back to the cottage where Eva had tea ready and was slightly aggrieved because her scones had cooled Now you must all go home Norah told her men folk after tea It s late and I have to bath three people Don t we see you again Harry asked You may come over to night if you like Dad is coming Norah said Geoff you haven t finished have you I don t think I m very hungry Geoffrey said May I go and shut up my guinea pigs Yes of course Alison darling I don t think you ought to have any more cakes I always has free four leven when mother is at home said Alison firmly annexing a chocolate cake and digging her little white teeth into it in the hope of averting any further argument Michael doesn t want more he had Geoff s Geoff s But didn t Geoff eat any Geoff s silly to night said his sister Fancy not bein hungry when there was choc lit cakes I hope he didn t get too tired Norah said to herself anxiously I ll hurry up and get them all to bed She bathed Michael and Alison with Eva in attendance and tucked them up They were very sleepy too sleepy to be troubled that Mother was not there to kiss them good night indeed as Norah bent over Michael he thought she was his mother and murmured Mum mum in the dusk in a little contented voice Norah put her cheek down to the rose leaf one for a moment and then hurried out Geoff Where are you Geoff I m here said Geoffrey from the back doorstep He rose and came towards her slowly Something in his face made her vaguely uneasy Ready for bed old chap she asked Come on are you tired My legs are tired Geoffrey said And my head s queer It keeps turning round He put out a little appealing hand and Norah took it in her own It was burning hot I I wish Mother was home the boy said Norah sat down and took him on her knee He put his head against her You must just let old Norah look after you until Mother comes back she said gently The memory of the fever in the village came to her and she turned sick with fear For a moment she thought desperately of what she must do both for Geoffrey and for the other children I won t bath Master Geoff he is tired she said to Eva She carried the little fellow into his room and slipped off his clothes he turned in the cool sheets thankfully Lie still old man I ll be back in a moment Norah said She went out and called to Eva reflecting with relief that the girl s hard Cockney sense was not likely to fail her Eva she said I m afraid Master Geoff is ill You know there is fever in the village and I think he has it I mustn t go near any one because I ve been looking after him Run over to the house and tell mister Linton I would like him to come over as quickly as possible Don t frighten him Right oh said Eva I won t be arf a tick Her flying feet thudded across the grass as Norah went back to the room where Geoffrey was already sleeping heavily She looked down at the little face flushed and dry in her heart an agony of dread for the Mother away at her party in London Then she went outside to wait for her father He came quickly accompanied by Miss de Lisle and Harry Trevor I telephoned for the doctor directly I got your message he said He ll be up in a few minutes Thank goodness said Norah Of course it may not be the fever But it s something queer The little chap wasn t all right down at the river Harry said Only he kept going he s such a plucky kid But he sat jolly quiet on me coming home I knew he was quiet I just thought he was a bit tired Norah said I say Daddy what about the other children What about you he asked His voice was hard with anxiety Me said Norah staring Why of course I must stay with him Dad He s in my charge Yes I suppose you must said David Linton heavily We ll find out from the doctor what precautions can be taken Oh I ll be all right Norah said But Alison and Michael mustn t stay here No of course not Well they must only come to us But the Tired People Norah asked Miss de Lisle interposed There are hardly any now and two of the boys go away to morrow she said The south wing could be kept entirely for the children couldn t it mister Linton Katty could look after them there they are fond of her That s excellent said mister Linton I really think the risk to the house wouldn t be much Any of the Tired People who were worried would simply have to go away But the children would not come near any of them and please goodness they won t develop fever at all Then I ll go back and have a room prepared Miss de Lisle said and then I ll get you mister Harry to help me bundle them up and carry them over We mustn t leave them in this place a minute longer than we can help That lovely fat Michael murmured Miss de Lisle incoherently She hurried away There was a hum of an approaching motor presently and the doctor s car came up the drive doctor Hall a middle aged and over worked man looked over Geoffrey quickly and nodded to himself as he tucked his thermometer under the boy s arm Geoffrey scarcely stirred in his heavy sleep Fever of course said the doctor presently out in the hall No I can t say yet whether he ll be bad or not Miss Norah We ll do our best not to let him be bad missus Hunt away is she Well I ll send you up a nurse Luckily I ve a good one free and she will bring medicines and will know all I want done He nodded approval of their plans for Alison and Michael mister Linton accompanied him to his car Get your daughter away as soon as you can the doctor said It s a beastly species of fever I d like to hang those tinkers The child in the village died this afternoon You don t say so mister Linton exclaimed Yes very bad case from the first Fine boy too but they didn t call me in time Well this village had forgotten all about fever He jumped into the car I ll be up in the morning he said and whirred off into the darkness Alison and Michael enormously amused at what they took to be a new game were presently bundled up in blankets and carried across to Homewood and soon a cab trundled up with a brisk capable looking nurse who at once took command in Geoffrey s room I don t think you should stay she said to Norah The maid and I can do everything for him and his mother will be home to morrow A good hot bath with some disinfectant in it here then leave all your clothes here that you ve worn near the patient and run home in fresh things No risk for you then I couldn t leave Geoff Norah said Of course I won t interfere with you but his mother left him to me while she was away And he might ask for me Well it s only for your own sake I was advising you said the nurse What do you think mister Linton I think she ought to stay said David Linton shortly with fear tugging at his heart as he spoke Just make her take precautions if there are any but the child comes first he was left in our care He went away soon holding Norah very tightly to him for a moment and then the nurse sent Norah to bed There s nothing for you to do she said I shall have a sleep near the patient But you ll call me if he wants me Yes I promise Now be off with you At the moment Norah did not feel as though she could possibly sleep but very soon her eyes grew heavy and she dozed off to dream as she often dreamed that she and Jim were riding over the Far Plain at Billabong bringing in a mob of wild young bullocks The cattle had never learned to drive and broke back constantly towards the shelter of the timber behind them There was one big red beast in particular that would not go quietly she had half a dozen gallops after him in her dream with Bosun under her swinging and turning with every movement of the bullocks and finally heading him wheeling him and galloping him back to the mob Then another broke away and Jim shouted to her across the paddock Norah Norah She woke with a start A voice was calling her name hoarsely she groped for her dressing gown and slippers and ran to Geoffrey s room The nurse also in her dressing gown was bending over the bed You re quick she said approvingly He only called you once Take this now sonnie Norah She bent down to him taking the hot hand I m here Geoff old man Take your medicine All right said Geoffrey He gulped it down obediently and lay back Will Mother come Very soon now Norah said You know she had to be in London just for one night She ll be back to morrow It s nearly to morrow now the nurse said Not far off morning That s nice the child said Stay with me Norah Of course I will old man Just shut your eyes and go to sleep I won t go away She knelt by his bed patting him gently until his deep breaths told that sleep had come to him again The nurse touched her shoulder and pointed to the door she got up softly and went out looking through her open window at the first streaks of dawn in the east Her dream was still vivid in her mind even over her anxiety for the child in her care came the thought of it and the feeling that Jim was very near now Jim she whispered gazing at the brightening sky In Germany at that moment two hunted men were facing dawn running wildly in dread of the coming daylight But of that Norah knew nothing The Jim she saw was the big clean limbed boy with whom she had ridden so often at Billabong It seemed to her that his laughing face looked at her from the rose and gold of the eastern sky Then Geoffrey turned and called to her and she went to him swiftly It was four days later Mother Geoffrey s voice was only a thread of sound now Will Father come I have sent for him little son He will come if he can That s nice Where s Norah I m here sweetheart Norah took the wasted hand in hers holding it gently Try to go to sleep Don t go away Geoffrey murmured I m awful sleepy He half turned nestling his head into his mother s arm Across the bed the mother s haggard eyes met Norah s But hope had almost died from them If he lives through the night there s a chance the doctor said to David Linton But he s very weak poor little chap An awful pity such a jolly kid too And all through two abominable families of tinkers However there are no fresh cases Can you do nothing more for Geoffrey The doctor shook his head I ve done all that can be done If his strength holds out there is a bare chance Would it be any good to get in another nurse mister Linton asked I m afraid of the mother and Norah breaking down If they do we shall have to get some one else the doctor answered But they wouldn t leave him neither of them has had any sleep to speak of since the boy was taken ill Norah is as bad as missus Hunt the nurse says that even if they are asleep they hear Geoffrey if he whispers I ll come again after a while mister Linton He hurried away and David Linton went softly into the little thatched cottage Dusk was stealing into Geoffrey s room the blind fluttered gently in the evening breeze missus Hunt was standing by the window looking down at the boy who lay sleeping one hand in that of Norah who knelt by the bed She smiled up at her father missus Hunt came softly across the room and drew him out into the passage He may be better if he sleeps she said He has hardly had any real sleep since he was taken ill Poor little man David Linton s voice was very gentle He s putting up a good fight missus Hunt Oh he s so good The mother s eyes filled with tears He does everything we tell him you know he fought us a bit at first and then we told him he was on parade and we were the officers and he has done everything in soldier fashion since I think he even tried to take his medicine smartly until he grew too weak But he never sleeps more than a few moments unless he can feel one of us it doesn t seem to matter whether it s Norah or me Geoffrey stirred and they heard Norah s low voice Go to sleep old chap it s Lights Out you know You mustn t wake up until Reveille Has Last Post gone Geoffrey asked feebly Oh yes All the camp is going to sleep Is Father Yes Now you must go to sleep with him the whole night long Stay close Geoffrey whispered His weak little fingers drew her hand against his face Then no sound came but fitful breathing The dark filled the little room Presently the nurse crept in with a shaded lamp and touched Norah s shoulder You could get up she whispered Norah shook her head pointing to the thin fingers curled in her palm I m all right she murmured back They came and went in the room from time to time the mother holding her breath as she looked down at the quiet face the nurse with her keen professional gaze after a while the doctor stood for a long time behind her not moving Then he bent down to her Sure you re all right Norah nodded Presently he crept out and soon the nurse came and sat down near the window missus Hunt has gone to sleep she whispered as she passed Norah was vaguely thankful for that But nothing was very clear to her except Geoffrey s face neither the slow passing of the hours nor her own cramped position that gradually became pain Geoffrey s face and the light breathing that grew harder and harder to bear Fear came and knelt beside her in the stillness and the night crept on CHAPTER XVIII THE WATCH ON THE RHINE Evening was closing upon a waste of muddy flats Far as the eye could see there was no rise in the land it lay level to the skyline with here and there a glint of still water and further off flat banks between which a wide river flowed sluggishly If you cared to follow the river you came at length to stone blockhouses near which sentries patrolled the banks and would probably have turned you back rudely From the blockhouses a high fence of barbed wire thickly criss crossed stretched north and south until it became a mere thread of grey stretching over the country There was something relentless forbidding in that savage fence It was the German frontier Beyond it lay Holland flat and peaceful But more securely than a mountain range between the two countries that thin grey fence barred the way If you turned back from the sentries and followed the muddy path along the river bank you were scarcely likely to meet any one The guards in the blockhouses were under strict discipline and were not encouraged to allow friends to visit them either from the scattered farms or from the town of Emmerich where lights were beginning to glimmer faintly in the twilight It was not safe for them to disregard regulations since at any moment a patrol motor launch might come shooting down the river or a surprise visit be paid by a detachment from the battalion of infantry quartered for training purposes at Emmerich Penalties for lax discipline were severe the guards were supposed to live on the alert both by day and by night and the Emmerich commandant considered that the fewer distractions permitted to the sentries the more likely they were to make their watch a thorough one There had been too many escapes of prisoners of war across the frontier unpleasant remarks had been made from Berlin and the Commandant was on his mettle Therefore the river bank was purposely lonely and any stray figure on it was likely to attract attention A mile from the northern bank a windmill loomed dark against the horizon a round brick building like a big pepper castor with four great arms looking like crossed combs A rough track led to it from the main road Within the building was divided into several floors lit by narrow windows The heavy sails had plied lazily during the day now they had been secured and two men were coming down the ladder that led from the top On the ground floor they paused looking discontentedly at some barrels that were ranged against the wall loosely covered with sacking Those accursed barrels are leaking again one said in German Look He pointed to a dark stain spreading from below And Rudolf told me he had caulked them thoroughly Rudolf does nothing thoroughly do you not know that answered his companion scornfully If one stands over him well and good if not then all that Master Rudolf cares for is how soon he may get back to his beerhouse Well they must be seen to in the morning it is too late to begin the job to night I am in no hurry said the first man If you would help me I would attend to them now All the stuff may not be wasted Himmel I am not going to begin work again at this hour answered the other with a laugh I am not like Rudolf but I see no enjoyment in working overtime it will be dark as it is before we get to Emmerich Come on my friend You are a lazy fellow Emil rejoined the first man However the loss is not ours after all and we should be paid nothing extra for doing the work to night Have you the key I do not forget it two nights running returned Emil What luck it was that the master did not come to day if he had found the mill open I should certainly have paid dearly Luck for you indeed said his companion They went out shutting and locking the heavy oaken door behind them Then they took the track that led to the main road The sound of their footsteps had scarcely died away when the sacking over one of the barrels became convulsed by an internal disturbance and fell to the floor and Jim Linton s head popped up in the opening like a Jack in the box Come on Desmond they ve gone at last he whispered Desmond s head came up cautiously from another barrel Take care it may be only a blind he warned They may come back at any moment Jim s answer was to wriggle himself out of his narrow prison slowly and painfully He reached the floor and stood stretching himself If they come back I ll meet them with my hands free he said Come on old man we re like rats in a trap if they catch us in those beastly tubs At least out here we ve our knives and our fists Come out and get the stiffness out of your limbs Well I suppose we may as well go under fighting if we have to Desmond agreed Jim helped him out and they stood looking at each other They were a sorry looking pair Their clothes hung in rags about them they were barefoot and hatless and beyond all belief dirty Thin to emaciation their gaunt limbs and hollow cheeks spoke of terrible privations but their sunken eyes burned fiercely and there was grim purpose in their set lips Well we re out of the small traps but it seems to me we re caught pretty securely in a big one Desmond said presently How on earth are we going to get out of this pepper pot We ll explore Jim said Suddenly his eye fell on a package lying on an empty box and he sprang towards it tearing it open with claw like fingers Oh by Jove food he said They fell upon it ravenously coarse food left by one of the men whose beer drinking of the night before had perhaps been too heavy to leave him with much appetite next day But coarse as it was it was life to the two men who devoured it It was nearly six weeks since the night when their tunnel had taken them into the world outside the barbed wire of their prison six weeks during which it had seemed in Desmond s phrase as though they had escaped from a small trap to find themselves caught within a big one They had been weeks of dodging and hiding travelling by night trusting to map and compass and the stars lying by day in woods in ditches under haystacks in any hole or corner that should shelter them in a world that seemed full of cruel eyes looking ceaselessly for them Backwards and forwards they had been driven making a few miles and then forced to retreat for many thrown out of their course often lost hopelessly falling from one danger into another They had never known what it was to sleep peacefully their food had been chiefly turnips stolen from the fields and eaten raw Three times they had reached the frontier only to be seen by the guards fired upon a bullet had clipped Jim s ear and forced to turn back as the only alternative to capture What that turning back had meant no one but the men who endured it could ever know Each time swift pursuit had nearly discovered them they had once saved themselves by lying for a whole day and part of a night in a pond with only their faces above water in a clump of reeds They had long abandoned their original objective the point they had aimed at on the frontier was far too strongly guarded and after two attempts to get through they had given it up as hopeless and had struck towards the Rhine in faint expectation of finding a boat and perhaps being able to slip through the sentries They had reached the river two nights before but only to realize that their hope was vain no boats were to be seen and the frowning blockhouses barred the way relentlessly So they had struck north again trying to pierce the frontier and the night before had encountered sentries not men alone but bloodhounds The guards had contented themselves with firing a few volleys the dogs had pursued them savagely One Jim had succeeded in killing with his knife the other thrown off the trail for a little by a stream down which they had waded had tracked them down until almost exhausted they had dashed in through the open door of the old mill for once careless as to any human beings who might be there The bloodhound had come too and in the mill lit by shafts of moonlight through the narrow windows they had turned to bay The fight had not lasted long they were quick and desperate and the dog had paid the penalty of his sins or of the sins of the human brutes who had trained him Then they had looked for concealment finding none in the mill the floors were bare except for the great barrels half full of a brown liquid that they could not define Well there s nothing for it Jim had said There s not an inch of cover outside and daylight will soon be here We must empty two of these things and get inside And the dog Desmond had asked Oh we ll pickle Ponto Together they had managed it though the barrels taxed all their strength to move The body of the bloodhound had been lowered into the brown liquid two of the others had been gradually emptied upon the earthen floor With the daylight they had crawled in drawing the sacking over them to crouch half stifled through the long day trembling when a step came near clenching their knives with a sick resolve to sell their freedom dearly It seemed incredible that they had not been discovered and now the package of food was the last stroke of good luck Well blessings on Emil or Fritz or Ludwig or whoever he was Jim said eating luxuriously This is the best blow out I ve had since well there isn t any since there never was anything so good before Never agreed Desmond By George I thought we were done when that energetic gentleman wanted to begin overhauling the casks Me too said Jim Emil saved us there good luck to him They finished the last tiny crumb and stood up I m a different man Desmond said If I have to run to night then the man that tries to catch me will have to do it with a bullet That s likely enough Jim said laughing Well come and see how we re going to get out There seemed little enough chance as they searched from floor to floor The great door was strong enough to resist ten men the windows were only slits far too narrow to allow them to pass through even had they dared risk the noise of breaking their thick glass Up and up they went their hearts sinking as their bodies mounted seeing no possible way of leaving their round prison Rats in a trap said Desmond There s nothing for it but those beastly barrels again and to watch our chance of settling Emil and his pal when they come to morrow Let s look out here Jim said They were at the top of the mill in a little circular place barely large enough for them to stand upright A low door opened upon a tiny platform with a railing from which the great sails could be worked they were back now but the wind was rising and they creaked and strained at their mooring rope Far below the silver sheet of the Rhine moved sluggishly gleaming in the moonlight The blockhouses stood out sharply on either bank Wonder if they can see us as plainly as we see them Jim said We ll have callers here presently if they can Desmond said That at least is certain Better come in Jim Jim was looking at the great sails and then at the rope that moored them Wait half a minute he said He dived into the mill and returned almost instantly with a small coil of rope I noticed this when we came up he said It didn t seem long enough to be any use by itself but if we tie it to this mooring rope it might be long enough To reach the ground from here Desmond asked him in astonishment Never You re dreaming Jim Not from here of course Jim said But from the end of the sail The sail Desmond echoed If we tie it to the end of the sail s rope and let the mill go we can swing out one at a time Jim said Bit of a drop at the bottom of course but I don t think it would be too much if we wait till our sail points straight down But Desmond hesitated The sail may not bear any weight neither may the rope itself The ropes seem good enough they re light but strong Jim said As for the sail well it looks pretty tough the framework is iron We can haul on it and test it a bit I d sooner risk it than be caught here old man Well I m going first Desmond said That you re not it s my own little patent idea Jim retorted Just you play fair you old reprobate Look they keep a sort of boathook thing here to catch the rope when the arm is turning very thoughtful and handy You ll easily get it back with that He was knotting the two ropes as he spoke testing them with all his strength There that will hold he said Now we ll let her go He untied the mooring rope and very slowly the great sails began to revolve They tugged violently as the arm bearing the rope mounted and drew it back it creaked and groaned but the rope held and nothing gave way Jim turned his face to Desmond on the narrow platform I m off he said No end of a jolly lark isn t it Hold her till I get on the railing Jim if it s too short Well I ll know all about that in a minute said Jim with a short laugh So long old chap I ll be waiting below to catch you when you bounce He flung his legs over the railing sitting upon it for an instant while he gripped the rope twining his legs round it Then he dropped off sliding quickly down Sick with suspense Desmond leaned over to watch him Down down he went The mill arms rose for a moment and then checked as his weight came on them and slowly slowly the great sail from which he dangled came back until it pointed straight downwards with the clinging figure hanging far below Down until the man above could scarcely see him and then the rope released suddenly sprang into the air and the sails mounted revolving as if to make up for lost time On the grass below a figure capered madly A low triumphant whistle came up Oh thank God said Desmond He clutched the boathook and leaned out finding that his hands trembled so that the sails went round three times before he managed to catch the dangling rope Then it was only a moment before he was on the grass beside Jim They grinned at each other You all right Jim asked Oh yes It was pretty beastly seeing you go though It was only a ten foot drop at the end said Jim casting his eye up at the creaking sails But it certainly was a nasty moment while one wondered if the old affair would hold I don t believe it ever was made in Germany it s too well done Well praise the pigs we haven t got to tackle those barrels again Desmond said Come along we ll try and find a hole in the old fence They came out of the friendly shadow of the mill and trotted northwards bending low as they ran there was no cover on the flats and the moonlight was all too clear although friendly clouds darkened it from time to time It was a windy night with promise of rain before morning Halt Who goes there The sharp German words rang out suddenly Before them three soldiers seemed to have risen from the ground with levelled rifles Jim and Desmond gave a despairing gasp and turned ducking and twisting as they fled Bullets whistled past them Are you hit Jim called No Are you No There s nothing but the river They raced on madly their bare feet making no sound Behind them the pursuit thudded and occasionally a rifle cracked not so much in the hope of hitting the twisting fugitives as to warn the river sentries of their coming The Germans were not hurrying there was no escape they knew Father Rhine and his guardians would take care of their quarry Jim jogged up beside Desmond We ve just a chance he said if we ever get to the river You can swim under water Oh yes Then keep as close to the bank as you can the shots may go over you We ll get as near the blockhouses as we dare before we dive Keep close He was the better runner and he drew ahead Desmond hard at his heels The broad river gleamed in front there were men with rifles silhouetted against its silver Then a merciful cloud bank drifted across the moon and the shots whistled harmlessly in the sudden darkness Jim felt the edge of the bank under his feet Dive he called softly He went in gently and Desmond followed with a splash The sluggish water was like velvet the tide took them gently on while they swam madly below the surface Shouts ran up and down the banks Searchlights from the blockhouses lit the river and the water was churned under a hail of machine gun bullets with every guard letting off his rifle into the stream in the hope of hitting something The bombardment lasted for five minutes and then the officer in command gave the signal to cease fire The pity is he observed that we never get the bodies the current sees to that But the swine will hardly float back to their England He shrugged his shoulders That being settled suppose we return to supper It might have hindered the worthy captain s enjoyment had he been able to see a mud bank fifty yards below the frontier where two dripping men looked at each other and laughed and cried and wrung each other s hands and in general behaved like people bereft of reason Haven t got a scratch have you you old blighter asked Jim ecstatically Not one Rotten machine gun practice wasn t it Sure you re all right Rather Do you realize you re in Holland Do you realize that no beastly Hun can come up out of nowhere and take pot shots at you It s not their pot shots I minded so much said Jim But to go back to a prison camp well shooting would be a joke to that Oh by Jove isn t it gorgeous They pumped hands again Now look here we ve got to be sober Desmond said presently Holland is all very well I ve heard it s a nice place for skating But neither of us has any wish to get interned here Rather not said Jim I want to go home and get into uniform again and go hunting for Huns Same here said Desmond Therefore we will sneak along this river until we find a boat Go steady now young Linton and don t turn hand springs Within the Dutch frontier the Rhine breaks up into a delta of navigable streams on which little brown sailed cargo boats ply perpetually and the skipper of a Dutch cargo boat will do anything for money A couple of hours hard walking brought Jim and Desmond to a village with a little pier near which half a dozen boats were moored A light showed in a port hole and they went softly on deck and found their way below into a tiny and malodorous cabin A stout man sprang to his feet at sight of the dripping scarecrows who invaded his privacy South Africa had taught Desmond sufficient Dutch to enable him to make himself intelligible He explained the position briefly to the mariner and they talked at length Wants a stiff figure he said finally turning to Jim But he says can do He ll get us some clothes and drop down the river with us to Rotterdam and find a skipper who ll get us across to Harwich the German navy permitting of course The German navy said Jim scornfully But they re asleep He yawned hugely I m going to sleep too if I have to camp on the gentleman s table Tell him to call me when it s time to change for Blighty CHAPTER XIX REVEILLE It was not yet dawn when David Linton fully dressed came into the cottage garden The door stood open and he kicked off his shoes and crept into the house Eva sat on the floor of the passage with her head in her hands She looked up with a start as the big man came in and scrambled to her feet a queer dishevelled figure with her tousled head and crumpled cap and apron A wave of dismay swept over mister Linton Is he he whispered and stopped The girl beckoned him into the sitting room E s never stirred all night she whispered I dunno if e isn t dead I never see any one lie so still The nurse wouldn t sit there like a wooden image if e was dead would she sir Surely not said David Linton Where is Miss Norah Kneelin alongside of im same like she was when you was here She ain t never stirred neither An I ll bet a dollar she must be stiff And missus Hunt She s in there wiv em She ad a little sleep not much No one s said one word in this ouse all night Why didn t you go to bed David Linton said looking down at the pinched old face and the stooping shoulders He had never noticed Eva very much now he felt a sudden wave of pity for the little London servant She loved Geoffrey too in her queer way Not me said Eva defiantly And im very near dyin I been boilin the kettle every hour or so but none of em came out for tea Will you ave a cup sir A refusal was on his lips but he changed his mind Thank you he said gently And have one yourself Eva My word I ll be glad of it she said It s bitter cold sittin out there She tip toed off to the kitchen mister Linton stood hesitating for a moment and then went along the passage A screen blocked Geoffrey s doorway and he peeped over it As he did so missus Hunt moved to the end of the bed Geoffrey lay exactly as he had been on the night before so utterly still that it was impossible to say whether he were alive or dead Norah crouched beside him her hand still against his face Then very slowly Geoffrey turned and opened his eyes Mother he said Mother I m so thirsty missus Hunt was beside him as his eyelids had lifted The nurse moving swiftly handed her a little cup Drink this sweetheart The mother raised his head and Geoffrey drank eagerly That s awful nice he said May I have some more They gave him more and put him back on the pillow He looked at Norah who knelt by him silently Wake up old Norah it s Reveille he said She smiled at him and put her face on his but she did not stir Suddenly the nurse saw mister Linton and beckoned to him Carry her she can t move Norah felt her father s arm about her Hold round my neck dear he said The nurse was at her other side They raised her slowly while she clenched her teeth to keep back any sound that should tell of the agony of moving still smiling with her eyes on Geoffrey s sleepy face Then suddenly she grew limp in her father s arm Fainted murmured the nurse And a very good thing She put her arm round her and they carried her out between them and put her on a sofa I must go back to Geoffrey the nurse said Rub her rub her knees hard before she comes to It s going to hurt her poor child She hurried away Geoffrey was lying quietly his mother s head close to him The nurse put her hand on his brow Nice and cool she said You re a very good boy Geoff we ll think about some breakfast for you presently missus Hunt raised her white face and the nurse s professional calmness wavered a little She patted her shoulder There there my dear she said He s going to do very well Don t you worry He ll be teaching me to ride that pony before we know where we are She busied herself about the boy with deft touches Now just keep very quiet put Mother to sleep if you like for she s a tired old mother She hastened back to Norah Is she all right David Linton s voice was sharp with anxiety She has never moved The best thing for her said the nurse putting him aside and beginning to massage this new patient If I can rub some of the stiffness away before she becomes conscious it will save her a lot Run away there s a dear man and tell that poor soul in the kitchen that the child is all right He will live Rather That sleep has taken every trace of the fever away He s weak of course but we can deal with that when there s no temperature Tell Eva to make tea lots of it We all want it Thus it was that presently might have been seen the astounding spectacle of a grizzled Australian squatter and a little Cockney serving maid holding each other s hands in a back kitchen I knew it was orright when I eard you comin down the all said Eva tearfully No one s ad that sort of a step in this ouse since Master Geoff went sick The dear lamb Won t it be evinly to see is muddy boot marks on me clean floor agin An him comin to me kitching window an askin me for grub I ll ave tea in a jiffy sir An please scuse me for ketchin old of you like that but I d ave bust if I adn t eld on to somefink Geoffrey dropped off to sleep again presently and missus Hunt came to Norah who was conscious and extremely stiff but otherwise too happy to care for aches and pains They did not speak at first those two had gone down to the borderland of Death to bring back little wandering feet only they looked at each other and clung together still trembling though only the shadow of fear remained After that Geoffrey mended rapidly and having been saintlike when very ill became just an ordinary little sinner in his convalescence and taxed every one s patience to keep him amused Alison and Michael who were anxiously watched for developing symptoms refused to develop anything at all remaining in the rudest health so that they were presently given the run of all Homewood and assisted greatly in preventing any of the Tired People from feeling dull Norah remained at the cottage which was placed strictly in quarantine and played with Geoffrey through the slow days of weakness that the little fellow found so hard to understand Aids to convalescence came from every quarter Major Hunt unable to leave France sent parcels of such toys and books as could still be bought in half ruined towns Wally who had been given four days leave in Paris which bored him to death sent truly amazing packages and the Tired People vied with David Linton in ransacking London for gifts for the sick room Geoffrey thought them all very kind and would have given everything for one hour on Brecon beside mister Linton You ll be able to ride soon old chap Norah said on his first afternoon out of bed Will I The boy looked scornfully at his thin legs Look at them they re like silly sticks Yes but Brecon won t mind that And they ll get quite fat again Well not fat as Geoffrey showed symptoms of horror but hard and fit like they were before Quite useful I do hope so Geoffrey said I want them to be all right before Father comes and Wally Will Wally come soon do you think I m afraid not you see he has been to Paris There s hardly any leave to England now Praps leave will be open by Christmas Geoffrey suggested hopefully Wouldn t it be a lovely Christmas if Father and Wally both came Wouldn t it just Norah smiled at him but the smile faded in a moment and she walked to the window and stood looking out Christmas had always been such a perfect time in their lives she looked back to years when it had always meant a season of welcoming Jim back when every day for weeks beforehand had been gay with preparations for his return from school Jim would arrive with his trunks bulging with surprises for Christmas morning Wally would be with him both keen and eager for every detail in the life of the homestead just as ready to work as to play All Billabong from the Chinese gardener to mister Linton hummed with the joy of their coming Now for the first time Christmas would bring them nothing of Jim She felt suddenly old and tired and the feeling grew in the weeks that followed while Geoffrey gradually came back to strength and merriment and the cottage after a strenuous period of disinfecting emerged from the ban of quarantine Alison and Michael had a rapturous reunion with their mother and Geoffrey and Homewood grew strangely quiet without the patter of their feet Norah returned to her post as housekeeper to find little to do the house seemed to run on oiled wheels and Miss de Lisle and the servants united in trying to save her trouble I dunno is it the fever she have on her said Katty in the kitchen one evening She s that quiet and pale looking you wouldn t know her for the same gerrl Oh there s no fear of fever now said Miss de Lisle Well she is not right Is it fretting she is after Masther Jim She was that brave at first you d not have said there was any one dead at all I think she s tired out said Miss de Lisle She has been under great strain ever since the news of mister Jim came And she is only a child She can t go through all that and finish up by nursing a fever patient and then avoid paying for it She cannot indeed said Katty Why wouldn t the Masther take her away for a change Indeed it s himself looks bad enough these times as well We ll have the two of them ill on us if they don t take care They might go said Miss de Lisle thoughtfully I ll suggest it to mister Linton David Linton indeed would have done anything to bring back the colour to Norah s cheeks and the light into her eyes But when he suggested going away she shrank from it pitifully Ah no Daddy I m quite well truly Indeed you re not he said Look at the way you never eat anything Oh I ll eat ever so much said Norah eagerly Only don t go away we have work here and we wouldn t know what to do with ourselves anywhere else Perhaps some time when Wally comes home if he cares to go we might think about it But not now Daddy She hesitated Unless of course you want to very much Not unless you do he said Only get well my girl I m quite all right protested Norah It was only Geoff s illness that made me a bit slack And we ve had a busy summer haven t we I think our little war job hasn t turned out too badly Dad Not too badly at all if it hasn t been too much for my housekeeper he said looking at her keenly Remember I won t have her knocked up I won t be Daddy dear I promise Norah said She made a brave effort to keep his mind at ease as the days went on riding and walking with him forcing herself to sing as she went about the house she had her reward in the look in the silent man s eyes when he first heard a song on her lips and entering with a good imitation of her old energy into the plans for the next year on the farm But it was all imitation and in his heart David Linton knew it The old Norah was gone He could only pity her with all his big heart and help her in her struggle knowing well that it was for his sake In his mind he began to plan their return to Australia in the hope that Billabong would prove a tonic to her tired mind and body And yet how could they face Billabong without Jim He came out on the terrace one evening with a letter in his hand Norah he said I ve good news for you Wally is coming home Is he Dad On leave Well he has been wounded but not seriously They have been nursing him in a hospital at Boulogne and he writes that he is better but he is to have a fortnight s leave It will be lovely to have him Norah said May I see the letter Dad Of course He gave it to her Poor old Wally We must give him a good time Norah It s a pity Harry s leave didn t happen at the same time said Norah However Phil will be a mate for him they like each other awfully Yes agreed her father Still I don t think Wally wants any other mate when you are about They were always astonishingly good in the way they overlooked my bad taste in being a girl said Norah with a laugh She was running her eye over the letter Oh hit in the shoulder I do hope it wasn t a very painful wound poor old boy I wonder will he be able to ride Dad He says he s very well But then he would mister Linton said Since we first knew him Wally would never admit so much as a finger ache if he could possibly avoid it I expect he ll ride if it s humanly possible Allenby came out Hawkins would like to see you sir Very well said his master By the way Allenby mister Wally is coming back on leave The butler s face brightened Is he indeed sir That s good news Yes he has been wounded but he s all right Miss de Lisle will certainly invent a new dish in his honour sir said Allenby laughing Is he coming soon This week he says Well I mustn t keep Hawkins waiting He went into the house with Allenby at his heels It was evident that the kitchen would hear the news as quickly as the ex sergeant could get there Norah read the letter over again slowly and folded it up Then she turned from the house and went slowly across the lawn At the sweep of the drive there was a path that made a short cut across the park to a stile and her feet turned into it half unconsciously The dull apathy that had clogged her brain for weeks was suddenly gone She felt no pleasure in the prospect that would once have been so joyful of seeing Wally Instead her whole being was seething with a wild revolt Wally s coming had always meant Jim Now he would come alone and Jim could never come again It isn t fair she said to herself over and over It isn t fair She came to the stile and paused looking over it into a quiet lane All her passionate hunger for Jim rose within her choking her She had kept him close to her at first lately he had slipped away so that she had no longer the dear comfort of his unseen presence that had helped her through the summer And she wanted him wanted him Her tired mind and body cried for him always chum and mate and brother in one She put her head down on the railing with a dry sob A quick step brushed through the crisp leaves carpeting the lane She looked up A man in rough clothes was coming towards her Norah drew back wishing she had brought the dogs with her the place was lonely and the evening was closing in She turned to go and as she did so the man broke into a clear whistle that made her pause catching her breath It was the marching tune of Jim s regiment but beyond the tune itself there was something familiar in the whistle something that brought her back to the stile panting catching at the rail with her hands Was there any one else in the world with that whistle with that long free stride He came nearer and saw her for the first time a white faced girl who stood and stared at him with eyes that dared not believe with lips that tried to speak his name and could not It was Jim who sobbed as he spoke Norah Norah He flung himself over the stile and caught her to him Old mate he said Dear little old mate They clung together like children Presently Norah put up her hand feeling the rough serge of his coat It isn t a dream she said Tell me it isn t Jimmy boy Don t let me wake up Jim s laugh was very tender I m no dream he said All these months have been the dream and you can wake up now She shivered putting her face against him Oh it s been so long Then suddenly she caught his hand Come she said breathlessly Come quickly to Dad They ran across the park hand in hand Near the house Jim paused I say old chap we can t take him by surprise he said I was going to sneak in by the back door and get hold of Miss de Lisle and Allenby to tell you Hadn t you better go and prepare him a bit Yes of course Norah said There s a light in the study he s always there at this time Come in and I ll hide you in Allenby s pantry until I ring They crept in by a side door and immediately ran into the butler How are you Allenby Jim inquired pleasantly Allenby staggered back It s mister Jim he gasped turning white It is said Jim laughing He found the butler s hand and shook it Norah left them and went swiftly to her father s study She opened the door softly David Linton was sitting in a big armchair by the fire bending forward and looking into the red coals The light fell on his face and showed it old and sad with a depth of sadness that even Norah had hardly seen He raised his head as the door opened Hallo my girl he said forcing a smile I was just beginning to wonder where you were I went across the park Norah said nervously Something in her voice made her father look sharply at her Is anything the matter Norah No she said quickly She came close to him and put her hand on his shoulder You look as if you had seen a ghost he said What is it Norah I I thought I had too she stammered But it was better than a ghost Daddy Daddy she broke down clinging to him laughing and crying What is it cried David Linton For God s sake tell me Norah He sprang to his feet shaking He s here she said He isn t dead Suddenly she broke from him and ran to the bell Jim she said Jim has come back to us Daddy The door was flung open and Jim came in with great strides Dad My boy said his father They gripped each other s hands and Norah clung to them both and sobbed and laughed all at once Let me sit down children said David Linton presently and they saw that he was trembling I m getting an old man Jim I didn t know how old I was until we lost you You couldn t get old if you tried said Jim proudly And you can t lose me either can he Norah They drew together again it seemed complete happiness just to touch each other not to speak to be together Afterwards there would be explanations but they seemed the last thing that mattered now They did not hear the hoot of a motor in the drive or a ring at the front door Allenby answered it and admitted a tall subaltern mister Wally Evening Allenby said Wally I believe I m a bit ahead of time I didn t expect to get here so soon Do you think they ll have a corner for me Allenby laughed a rather quavering laugh I think you ll always find your room ready sir he said You I suppose you aven t eard our good news sir I never hear good news said Wally shortly What is it Allenby eyed him doubtfully I don t know as I oughtn t to break it to you a bit sir he said You can t be over strong yet and you wounded and all and never aving rightly got over losing mister Jim and Wally shuddered For Heaven s sake man stop breaking it gently he said What is it In his voice was the crisp tone of the officer and the ex sergeant came to attention smartly It s mister Jim sir he said E s ome For a long moment Wally stared at him You re not mad I suppose he said slowly Or perhaps I am Do you mean Them Uns couldn t kill him sir Allenby s voice rose on a note of triumph Let me take your coat sir e s in the study And you coming just puts the top on everything sir He reached up for Wally s coat But the boy broke from him and ran blindly to the study bursting in upon the group by the fire There he stopped dead and stared at them Old chap said Jim He sprang to him and flung an arm round his shoulders Then he gave a great sigh of utter contentment and echoed Allenby unconsciously Well if that doesn t make everything just perfect he said CHAPTER XX ALL CLEAR Kiddie are you awake Come in Jimmy Norah sat up in bed and felt for the electric switch The room sprang into light as Jim came in I had to come and bring your stocking he said Merry Christmas little chap Merry Christmas Jimmy dear Norah looked at the bulging stocking on her bed and broke into laughter And you a full blown Captain Oh Jimmy are you ever going to grow up I trust not said Jim comfortably if it means getting any bigger than I am But you re not either so it doesn t matter Do you remember all the Christmases at Billabong when I had to bring you your stocking Do I remember echoed Norah scornfully But at Billabong it was daylight at four o clock in the morning and extremely hot probably with a bush fire or two thrown in You ll be frozen to death here Turn on the electric stove and we ll be comfy That s a brain wave said Jim complying I must admit I prefer an open fireplace and three foot logs but in a hurry those little contraptions of stoves are handy Hold on now I ll get you something to put over your shoulders There s a woolly jacket over there Norah said Let me have my property I m excited She possessed herself of the stocking and fished for its contents Chocolates and in war time Aren t you ashamed Not much said Jim calmly extracting a huge chocolate from the box I lived on swede turnips for six weeks so I think the family deserves a few extras Fish some more Norah obeyed and brought to light articles of a varied nature a pair of silk stockings a book on Housekeeping as a Science a large turnip artistically carved a box of French candied fruit a mob cap and a pair of housemaids gloves and lastly the cap of a shell neatly made into a pin tray I did that in camp in Germany said Jim And I swore I d put it into your Christmas stocking Which I have done Bless you said Norah I would rather lose a good many of my possessions than that They smiled at each other and being an undemonstrative pair the smile was a caress Isn t this going to be a Christmas Norah said I ve been lying awake for ever so long trying to realize it You alive again I never was dead said Jim indignantly It was a horribly good imitation And Wally here and even Harry and Major Hunt home and Geoff getting stronger every day And Dad grown twenty years younger And you too I guess judging by what you looked like the night I came home Oh I ve got turned and made up to look like new said Norah She faltered a little Jimmy I ve been saying my prayers hard I ve done that too said Jim There was a long contented silence And somehow now I know you ll be all right both of you Norah said I just feel certain about it Before ever since the war began I was always horribly afraid but now I m not afraid any more It can t last for ever and some day we ll all go back And that will be the best thing in the world said Jim The very best she said Some one tapped at the door May I come in asked Miss de Lisle s voice She entered bearing a little tray You said Norah But you shouldn t Bride and Katty have gone to church so I thought I d bring you some tea and wish you a merry Christmas said Miss de Lisle But I didn t expect to find the Captain here She did not wait for their greetings but vanished with the elephantine swiftness peculiar to her returning in a few moments with a second tray And toast said Jim But where s your own Miss de Lisle Never mind mine I ll have it in the kitchen said the cook lady Indeed you will not Sit down He marched off unheeding her protests When he returned he bore a large kitchen tray with the teapot It seemed simpler he said And I couldn t find anything smaller This cup is large Miss de Lisle but then you won t want it filled so often Have some of my toast I couldn t possibly eat all this Well it s very pleasant here said the cook lady yielding meekly I took some to mister Wally but he merely said Get out Judkins I m not on duty and rolled over So I concluded in Katty s words that his resht was more to him and came away He ll wake up presently and be very pleased to find it it won t matter to him at all if it s stone cold said Jim Queer chap Wal I prefer tea with the chill off it myself Judkins has hard times getting him up in time for early parade Luckily Judkins is an old regular soldier and has a stern calm way with a young officer Who bullies you into getting up may I ask demanded Miss de Lisle I used to be bullied by a gentleman called Wilkes in the grey days when I was a subaltern said Jim sadly Now alas I am a responsible and dignified person and I have to set an example He sighed It s awful to be a captain It s so extraordinary said his sister that I never get used to it But you never had any respect for age said Jim removing her tray and putting a pillow on her head Every one finished then I ll clear away the wreck and go and dress He piled the three trays on top of each other and goose stepped from the room solemnly his long legs in pyjamas under a military great coat ending a curious effect to the spectacle Miss de Lisle and Norah laughed helplessly And a captain said the cook lady wiping her eyes Now I really must run or there will be no breakfast in this house Breakfast was a movable feast in the Home for Tired People who wandered in and out just as they felt inclined Hot dishes sat on a hot water plate and a little aluminium topped table such matters as ham and brawn lurked on a sideboard and Allenby came in from time to time to replenish tea and coffee Norah and her father rarely encountered any one but Phil Hardress at this meal since theirs was generally over long before most of their guests had decided to get up On this morning however every one was equally late and food did not seem to matter the table was snowed under with masses of letters and Christmas parcels and as every one opened these and talked all at once mingling greetings with exclamations over the contents of the packages Miss de Lisle s efforts had been in vain I pitied your post lady said missus Aikman the wife of a wounded colonel She staggered to the door under an enormous mail bag looking as though Christmas were anything but merry However I saw her departing after an interval with quite a sprightly step Allenby had orders to look after her Norah said smiling Poor soul she begins her round at some unearthly hour and she s hungry and tired by the time she gets here One of the remarkable things about this country of yours said mister Linton is the way you have continued to deliver parcels and letters as though there were no war Strange females or gaunt children bring them to one s door but the main point is that they do come In Australia even without a war the post office scorns to deliver a parcel if any one is rash enough to send you one the post office puts it in a cupboard and sends you a cold postcard to tell you to come and take it away If you don t come soon they send you a threatening card And if you don t obey that I never dared to risk a third said mister Linton laughing I am a man of peace But what a horrible system said missus Aikman Doesn t it interfere with business Oh yes greatly said her host But I suppose we shall learn in time I m going over to the cottage Norah whispered to Jim Do come Geoff won t think it s Christmas if you don t They went out into the hall Flying feet came down the stairs and Wally was upon them Merry Christmas Norah He seized both her hands and pranced her down the hall Always begin Christmas with a turkey trot he chanted Begin indeed said Norah with a fine contempt I began mine hours ago Where have you been I have been contemplating said Wally his brown eyes twinkling No one called me There s evidence to the contrary Jim said grinning It has been stated that you called a perfectly blameless lady Judkins and said awful things to her My Aunt said Wally I hope not unless you talk pretty straight to Judkins he doesn t notice you That accounts for the frozen tea and toast I found I thought Father Christmas had put em there Did you eat them Oh yes you should never snub a saint said Wally So now I don t want any breakfast Where are you two going To the cottage Come along but really I do think you should eat a decent breakfast Wally It will be dinner time before we know where we are and I feel that Miss de Lisle s dinner will be no joke said Wally So come along old house mother and don t worry your ancient head about me Each boy seized one of Norah s hands and they raced across the lawn David Linton looking at them from the dining room window laughed a little Bless them they re all babies again he thought The cottage was echoing with strange sounds it might be inferred that the stockings of the young Hunts had contained only bugles trumpets and drums Eva sweeping the porch greeted the newcomers with a friendly grin Merry Christmas Eva The sime to you said Eva Ain t it a real cold morning The frorst s got me fingers a fair treat No one minds frost on Christmas Day it s the proper thing in this queer country said Wally Was Father Christmas good to you Eva Wasn t e Not arf said Eva The children wouldn t ear of anyfink but angin up a stockin for me and I m blowed if it wasn t bang full this mornin And a post card from me young man from the Front it s that saucy I wonder ow it ever passed the sentry Well I do say as ow this place ain t brought us nuffink but luck Geoffrey dashed out equipped with a miniature Sam Brown belt with a sword and waving a bugle Look Father Christmas brought them Merry Christmas everybody He flung himself at Norah with a mighty hug And where s my Michael and that Alison Norah asked Oh Michael darling aren t you the lucky one as he appeared crowned with a paper cap and drawing a wooden engine Where s Alison It s no good ever speaking to Alison Geoffrey said with scorn She got a silly doll in her stocking and all she ll do is to sit on the floor and take off its clothes Girls are stupid all cept you Norah Keep up that belief my son and you ll be spared a heap of trouble said Major Hunt coming out Unfortunately you re bound to change your mind How are you all We ve had an awful morning It began at half past four missus Hunt added At that hour Michael discovered a trumpet and no one has been asleep since They talk of noise at the Front said her husband Possibly I ve got used to artillery preparation anyhow it strikes me as a small thing compared to my trio when they get going with assorted musical instruments How is your small family Miss Norah Not quite so noisy as yours but still you would notice they were there Norah answered laughing They were all at breakfast when I left and it seemed likely that breakfast would run on to dinner unless they remembered that church is at eleven I must run home we just came to wish you all a merry Christmas Dinner at half past one remember We won t forget missus Hunt said Every one was dining at Homewood and dinner for the sake of the children was in the middle of the day The house was full of guests they trooped back from church across the park where the ground rang hard as iron underfoot for it was a frosty Christmas Homewood glowed with colour and life with big fires blazing everywhere and holly and ivy scarlet and green against the dark oaken panelling of the walls And if the Australians sent thoughts overseas to a red homestead Billabong nestling in its green of orchard and garden with scorched yellow paddocks stretching away for miles around it they were not homesick thoughts to day For home was in their hearts and they were together once more The dinner was a simple one Miss de Lisle had reserved her finest inspirations for the evening meal regarding Christmas dinner as a mere affair of turkey and blazing plum pudding which except in the matter of sauces might be managed by any one It needs no soul she said But no one found any fault and at the end Colonel Aikman made a little speech of thanks to their hosts We all know they hate speeches made at them he finished But Homewood is a blessed word to day to fighting men And their wives said missus Aikman Yes to people who came to it tired beyond expression and went back forgetting weariness In their names in the names of all of us we want to say Thank you David Linton stood up looking down the long room and last at his son We who are the most thankful people in the world I think to day he said do not feel that you owe us any gratitude Rather we owe it to all our Tired People who helped us through our own share of what war can mean And apart from that we never feel that the work is ours We carry on for the sake of a dead man a man who loved his country so keenly that to die for it was his highest happiness We are only tools glad of war work so easy and pleasant as our guests make our job But the work is John O Neill s So far as we can we mean to make it live to his memory He paused Norah looking up at him saw him through misty eyes So we know you ll think of us kindly after we have gone back to Australia the deep voice went on There will be a welcome there too for any of you who come to see us But when you remember Homewood please do not think of it as ours If that brave soul can look back as he said he would and as we are sure he does then he is happy over every tired fighter who goes rested from his house His only grief was that he could not fight himself But his work in the war goes on and as for us we simply consider ourselves very lucky to be his instruments Again he paused I don t think this is a day for drinking toasts he said When we have won we can do that but we have not won yet But I will ask you all to drink to a brave man s memory to John O Neill The short afternoon drew quickly to dusk and lights flashed out to be discreetly veiled lest wandering German aircraft should wish to drop bombs as Christmas presents Norah and the boys had disappeared mysteriously after dinner vanishing into the study Presently Geoffrey came flying to his mother with eager eyes Mother Father Christmas is here You don t say so said missus Hunt affecting extreme astonishment Where I saw him run along the hall and go into the study He was real Mother Of course he s real Major Hunt said Do you think he s gone up the study chimney Wally appeared in the doorway Will the ladies and gentlemen kindly walk into the study he said solemnly We have a distinguished guest There I told you said Geoffrey ecstatically He tugged at his father s hand capering In the study a great fir tree towered to the ceiling a Christmas tree of the most beautiful description gay with shining coloured globes and wax lights and paper lanterns laden with mysterious packages in white paper tied with ribbon of red white and blue and with other things about which there was no mystery clockwork toys field guns and ambulance wagons and a big splendid Red Cross nurse difficult to consider a mere doll Never was seen such a laden tree it s branches groaned under the weight they bore And beside it who but Father Christmas bowing and smiling with his eyes twinkling under bushy white eyebrows Walk in ladies and gentleman walk in he said invitingly Wally frowned at him That s not the way to talk he said You aren t a shop walker He inflicted a surreptitious kick upon the elderly saint Hi you blighter that s my shin said Father Christmas wrathfully a remark luckily unheard by the guests in the excitement of the moment All the household was there Miss de Lisle beaming at Wally and very stately and handsome in blue silk the servants led by Allenby with Con and Katty and Bride giggling with astonishment at a tree the like of which did not grow in Donegal All mustered said Father Christmas Right oh I mean that is well As you see I ve had no end of a time labouring in your behalf But I love hard work Interruption from mister Meadows sounding like I don t think Being tired I shall depute to my dear young friend here the task of removing the parcels from the tree He tapped Wally severely on the head with his knuckles and that hapless youth ejaculated Beast You ll get thrown out if you don t watch it said the saint severely Now ladies first He detached the Red Cross nurse from her bough and placed her in Alison s arms and Alison who had glued her eyes to her from the moment of entering the room uttered a gasp sat promptly upon the floor and began an exhaustive examination of her charms unheeding any further gifts Under the onslaught of Wally and Harry the tree speedily became stripped of its burden Father Christmas directing their labours in a voice that plainly had its training on the barrack square Eva watched him admiringly Ain t the Captin a trick she murmured hugging her parcels to her The last package came down and Father Christmas slipped away disappearing behind a screen with a flourish that revealed an immaculate brown leather gaiter under the cotton wool snow bordering his red cloak and presently Jim sauntered out slightly flushed Oh you silly said Geoffrey Where ever have you been You ve missed ole Father Christmas I never did have any luck Jim said dolefully Never mind he s left heaps and heaps of parcels for you I ll
