none	none	I see a child before an empty house Knocking and knocking at the closed door He wakes dull echoes but nor man nor mouse If he stood knocking there for evermore A mother angel see folding each wing Soft walking crosses straight the empty floor And opens to the obstinate praying thing eight Were there but some deep holy spell whereby Always I should remember thee some mode Of feeling the pure heat throb momently Of the spirit fire still uttering this I Lord see thou to it take thou remembrance load Only when I bethink me can I cry Remember thou and prick me with love s goad nine If to myself God sometimes interferes I said my faith at once would be struck blind I see him all in all the lifing mind Or nowhere in the vacant miles and years A love he is that watches and that hears Or but a mist fumed up from minds of men Whose fear and hope reach out beyond their ken

none	none	I thought that I had lost thee but behold Thou comest to me from the horizon low Across the fields outspread of green and gold Fair carpet for thy feet to come and go Whence I know not or how to me thou art come Not less my spirit with calm bliss doth glow Meeting thee only thus in nature vague and dumb

none	none	Doubt swells and surges with swelling doubt behind My soul in storm is but a tattered sail Streaming its ribbons on the torrent gale In calm tis but a limp and flapping thing Oh swell it with thy breath make it a wing To sweep through thee the ocean with thee the wind Nor rest until in thee its haven it shall find

none	none	Thy will is truth tis therefore fate the strong Would that my will did sweep full swing with thine Then harmony with every spheric song And conscious power would give sureness divine Who thinks to thread thy great laws onward throng Is as a fly that creeps his foolish way Athwart an engine s wheels in smooth resistless play twenty one Thou in my heart hast planted gardener divine A scion of the tree of life it grows But not in every wind or weather it blows The leaves fall sometimes from the baby tree And the life power seems melting into pine Yet still the sap keeps struggling to the shine And the unseen root clings cramplike unto thee twenty two Do thou my God my spirit s weather control And as I do not gloom though the day be dun Let me not gloom when earth born vapours roll Across the infinite zenith of my soul Should sudden brain frost through the heart s summer run Cold weary joyless waste of air and sun Thou art my south my summer wind my all my one twenty three O Life why dost thou close me up in death O Health why make me inhabit heaviness I ask yet know the sum of this distress Pang haunted body sore dismayed mind Is but the egg that rounds the winged faith When that its path into the air shall find My heart will follow high above cold rain and wind

none	none	I can no more than lift my weary eyes Therefore I lift my weary eyes no more But my eyes pull my heart and that before Tis well awake knocks where the conscience lies Conscience runs quick to the spirit s hidden door Straightway from every sky ward window cries Up to the Father s listening ears arise twenty five Not in my fancy now I search to find thee Not in its loftiest forms would shape or bind thee I cry to one whom I can never know Filling me with an infinite overflow Not to a shape that dwells within my heart Clothed in perfections love and truth assigned thee But to the God thou knowest that thou art

none	none	Yestereve Death came and knocked at my thin door I from my window looked the thing I saw The shape uncouth I had not seen before I was disturbed with fear in sooth not awe Whereof ashamed I instantly did rouse My will to seek thee only to fear the more Alas I could not find thee in the house

none	none	Come to me Lord I will not speculate how Nor think at which door I would have thee appear Nor put off calling till my floors be swept But cry Come Lord come any way come now Doors windows I throw wide my head I bow And sit like some one who so long has slept That he knows nothing till his life draw near thirty one O Lord I have been talking to the people Thought s wheels have round me whirled a fiery zone And the recoil of my words airy ripple My heart unheedful has puffed up and blown Therefore I cast myself before thee prone Lay cool hands on my burning brain and press From my weak heart the swelling emptiness FEBRUARY one I TO myself have neither power nor worth Patience nor love nor anything right good My soul is a poor land plenteous in dearth Here blades of grass there a small herb for food A nothing that would be something if it could But if obedience Lord in me do grow I shall one day be better than I know two The worst power of an evil mood is this It makes the bastard self seem in the right Self self the end the goal of human bliss But if the Christ self in us be the might Of saving God why should I spend my force With a dark thing to reason of the light Not push it rough aside and hold obedient course three Back still it comes to this there was a man Who said I am the truth the life the way Shall I pass on or shall I stop and hear Come to the Father but by me none can What then is this am I not also one Of those who live in fatherless dismay I stand I look I listen I draw near four My Lord I find that nothing else will do But follow where thou goest sit at thy feet And where I have thee not still run to meet Roses are scentless hopeless are the morns Rest is but weakness laughter crackling thorns If thou the Truth do not make them the true Thou art my life O Christ and nothing else will do five Thou art here in heaven I know but not from here Although thy separate self do not appear If I could part the light from out the day There I should have thee But thou art too near How find thee walking when thou art the way Oh present Christ make my eyes keen as stings To see thee at their heart the glory even of things six That thou art nowhere to be found agree Wise men whose eyes are but for surfaces Men with eyes opened by the second birth To whom the seen husk of the unseen is Descry thee soul of everything on earth Who know thy ends thy means and motions see Eyes made for glory soon discover thee seven Thou near then I draw nearer to thy feet And sitting in thy shadow look out on the shine Ready at thy first word to leave my seat Not thee thou goest too From every clod Into thy footprint flows the indwelling wine And in my daily bread keen eyed I greet Its being s heart the very body of God eight Thou wilt interpret life to me and men Art nature yea my own soul s mysteries Bringing truth out clear joyous to my ken Fair as the morn trampling the dull night Then The lone hill side shall hear exultant cries The joyous see me joy the weeping weep The watching smile as Death breathes on me his cold sleep nine I search my heart I search and find no faith Hidden He may be in its many folds I see him not revealed in all the world Duty s firm shape thins to a misty wraith No good seems likely To and fro I am hurled I have no stay Only obedience holds I haste I rise I do the thing he saith ten Thou wouldst not have thy man crushed back to clay It must be God thou hast a strength to give To him that fain would do what thou dost say Else how shall any soul repentant live Old griefs and new fears hurrying on dismay Let pain be what thou wilt kind and degree Only in pain calm thou my heart with thee eleven I will not shift my ground like Moab s king But from this spot whereon I stand I pray From this same barren rock to thee I say Lord in my commonness in this very thing That haunts my soul with folly through the clay Of this my pitcher see the lamp s dim flake And hear the blow that would the pitcher break twelve Be thou the well by which I lie and rest Be thou my tree of life my garden ground Be thou my home my fire my chamber blest My book of wisdom loved of all the best Oh be my friend each day still newer found As the eternal days and nights go round Nay nay thou art my God in whom all loves are bound thirteen Two things at once thou know saint I cannot think When busy with the work thou givest me I cannot consciously think then of thee Then why when next thou lookest o er the brink Of my horizon should my spirit shrink Reproached and fearful nor to greet thee run Can I be two when I am only one fourteen My soul must unawares have sunk awry Some care poor eagerness ambition of work Some old offence that unforgiving did lurk Or some self gratulation soft and sly Something not thy sweet will not the good part While the home guard looked out stirred up the old murk And so I gloomed away from thee my Heart fifteen Therefore I make provision ere I begin To do the thing thou givest me to do Praying Lord wake me oftener lest I sin Amidst my work open thine eyes on me That I may wake and laugh and know and see Then with healed heart afresh catch up the clue And singing drop into my work anew sixteen If I should slow diverge and listless stray Into some thought feeling or dream unright O Watcher my backsliding soul affray Let me not perish of the ghastly blight Be thou O Life eternal in me light Then merest approach of selfish or impure Shall start me up alive awake secure seventeen Lord I have fallen again a human clod Selfish I was and heedless to offend Stood on my rights Thy own child would not send Away his shreds of nothing for the whole God Wretched to thee who savest low I bend Give me the power to let my rag rights go In the great wind that from thy gulf doth blow eighteen Keep me from wrath let it seem ever so right My wrath will never work thy righteousness Up up the hill to the whiter than snow shine Help me to climb and dwell in pardon s light I must be pure as thou or ever less Than thy design of me therefore incline My heart to take men s wrongs as thou tak saint mine nineteen Lord in thy spirit s hurricane I pray Strip my soul naked dress it then thy way Change for me all my rags to cloth of gold Who would not poverty for riches yield A hovel sell to buy a treasure field Who would a mess of porridge careful hold Against the universe s birthright old twenty Help me to yield my will in labour even Nor toil on toil greedy of doing heap Fretting I cannot more than me is given That with the finest clay my wheel runs slow Nor lets the lovely thing the shapely grow That memory what thought gives it cannot keep And nightly rimes ere morn like cistus petals go twenty one Tis shall thy will be done for me or mine And I be made a thing not after thine My own and dear in paltriest details Shall I be born of God or of mere man Be made like Christ or on some other plan I let all run set thou and trim my sails Home then my course let blow whatever gales twenty two With thee on board each sailor is a king Nor I mere captain of my vessel then But heir of earth and heaven eternal child Daring all truth nor fearing anything Mighty in love the servant of all men Resenting nothing taking rage and blare Into the Godlike silence of a loving care twenty three I cannot see my God a reason why From morn to night I go not gladsome free For if thou art what my soul thinketh thee There is no burden but should lightly lie No duty but a joy at heart must be Love s perfect will can be nor sore nor small For God is light in him no darkness is at all twenty four Tis something thus to think and half to trust But ah my very heart God born should lie Spread to the light clean clear of mire and rust And like a sponge drink the divine sunbeams What resolution then strong swift and high What pure devotion or to live or die And in my sleep what true what perfect dreams twenty five There is a misty twilight of the soul A sickly eclipse low brooding o er a man When the poor brain is as an empty bowl And the thought spirit weariful and wan Turning from that which yet it loves the best Sinks moveless with life poverty opprest Watch then O Lord thy feebly glimmering coal twenty six I cannot think in me is but a void I have felt much and want to feel no more My soul is hungry for some poorer fare Some earthly nectar gold not unalloyed The little child that s happy to the core Will leave his mother s lap run down the stair Play with the servants is his mother annoyed twenty seven I would not have it so Weary and worn Why not to thee run straight and be at rest Motherward with toy new or garment torn The child that late forsook her changeless breast Runs to home s heart the heaven that s heavenliest In joy or sorrow feebleness or might Peace or commotion be thou Father my delight twenty eight The thing I would say still comes forth with doubt And difference is it that thou shap saint my ends Or is it only the necessity Of stubborn words that shift sluggish about Warping my thought as it the sentence bends Have thou a part in it O Lord and I Shall say a truth if not the thing I try twenty nine Gather my broken fragments to a whole As these four quarters make a shining day Into thy basket for my golden bowl Take up the things that I have cast away In vice or indolence or unwise play Let mine be a merry all receiving heart But make it a whole with light in every part MARCH one THE song birds that come to me night and morn Fly oft away and vanish if I sleep

6557-66462-0016	train-other-500	For more than all my prayers my need of thee And thou beyond all need all unknown cares What the heart s dear imagination dares

But keep me waiting watchful for thy will Even while I do it waiting watchful still thirty Thou art the Lord of life the secret thing Thou wilt give endless more than I could find Even if without thee I could go and seek For thou art one Christ with my deepest mind Duty alive self willed in me dost speak And to a deeper purer being sting I come to thee my life my causing kind thirty one Nothing is alien in thy world immense No look of sky or earth or man or beast In the great hand of God I stand and thence Look out on life his endless holy feast To try to feel is but to court despair To dig for a sun within a garden fence Who does thy will O God he lives upon thy air AUGUST one SO shall abundant entrance me be given Into the truth my life s inheritance Lo as the sun shoots straight from out his tomb God floated casting round a lordly glance Into the corners of his endless room So through the rent which thou O Christ hast riven I enter liberty s divine expanse two It will be so ah so it is not now Who seeks thee for a little lazy peace Then like a man all weary of the plough That leaves it standing in the furrow s crease Turns from thy presence for a foolish while Till comes again the rasp of unrest s file From liberty is distant many a mile three Like one that stops and drinks and turns and goes Into a land where never water flows There travels on the dry and thirsty day Until the hot night veils the farther way Then turns and finds again the bubbling pool Here would I build my house take up my stay Nor ever leave my Sychar s margin cool four Keep me Lord with thee I call from out the dark Hear in thy light of which I am a spark I know not what is mine and what is thine Of branch and stem I miss the differing mark But if a mere hair s breadth me separateth That hair s

Father thou art my eternity Not on the clasp Of consciousness on thee My life depends and I can well afford All to forget so thou remember Lord In thee I rest in sleep thou dost me fold In thee I labour still in thee grow old And dying shall I not in thee my Life be bold seven In holy things may be unholy greed Thou giv saint a glimpse of many a lovely thing Not to be stored for use in any mind But only for the present spiritual need The holiest bread if hoarded soon will breed The mammon moth the having pride I find Tis momently thy heart gives out heart quickening eight It is thyself and neither this nor that Nor anything told taught or dreamed of thee That keeps us live The holy maid who sat Low at thy feet choosing the better part Rising bore with her what a memory Yet brooding only on that treasure she Had soon been roused by conscious loss of heart nine I am a fool when I would stop and think And lest I lose my thoughts from duty shrink It is but avarice in another shape Tis as the vine branch were to hoard the grape Nor trust the living root beneath the sod What trouble is that child to thee my God Who sips thy gracious cup and will not drink ten True faithful action only is the life The grapes for which we feel the pruning knife Thoughts are but leaves they fall and feed the ground The holy seasons swift and slow go round The ministering leaves return fresh large and rife But fresher larger more thoughts to the brain Farewell my dove come back hope laden through the rain eleven Well may this body poorer feebler grow It is undressing for its last sweet bed But why should the soul which death shall never know Authority and power and memory shed It is that love with absolute faith would wed God takes the inmost garments off his child To have him in his arms naked and undefiled twelve Thou art my knowledge and my memory No less than my real deeper life my love I will not fool degrade myself to trust In less than that which maketh me say Me In less than that causing itself to be Then art within me behind beneath above I will be thine because I may and must thirteen Thou art the truth the life Thou Lord wilt see To every question that perplexes me I am thy being and my dignity Is written with my name down in thy book Thou wilt care for it Never shall I think Of anything that thou mightst overlook In faith born triumph at thy feet I sink fourteen Thou carest more for that which I call mine In same sort better manner than I could Even if I knew creation s ends divine Rousing in me this vague desire of good Thou art more to me than my desires whole brood Thou art the only person and I cry Unto the father I of this my I fifteen Thou who inspirest prayer then bend saint thine ear It crying with love s grand respect to hear I cannot give myself to thee aright With the triumphant uttermost of gift That cannot be till I am full of light To perfect deed a perfect will must lift Inspire possess compel me first of every might sixteen I do not wonder men can ill believe Who make poor claims upon thee perfect Lord Then most I trust when most I would receive I wonder not that such do pray and grieve The God they think to be God is not fit Then only in thy glory I seem to sit When my heart claims from thine an infinite accord seventeen More life I need ere I myself can be Sometimes when the eternal tide ebbs low A moment weary of my life I grow Weary of my existence self I mean Not of its plodding not its wind and snow Then to thy knee trusting I turn and lean Thou will saint I live and I do will with thee eighteen Dost thou mean sometimes that we should forget thee Dropping the veil of things twixt thee and us Ah not that we should lose thee and regret thee But that we turning from our windows thus The frost fixed God should vanish from the pane Sun melted and a moment Father let thee Look like thyself straight into heart and brain nineteen For sometimes when I am busy among men With heart and brain an open thoroughfare For faces words and thoughts other than mine And a pause comes at length oh sudden then Back throbs the tide with rush exultant rare And for a gentle moment I divine Thy dawning presence flush my tremulous air twenty If I have to forget thee do thou see It be a good not bad forgetfulness That all its mellow truthful air be free From dusty noes and soft with many a yes That as thy breath my life my life may be Man s breath So when thou com saint at hour unknown Thou shalt find nothing in me but thine own twenty one Thou being in me in my deepest me Through all the time I do not think of thee Shall I not grow at last so true within As to forget thee and yet never sin Shall I not walk the loud world s busy way Yet in thy palace porch sit all the day Not conscious think of thee yet never from thee stray twenty two Forget Oh must it be Would it were rather That every sense was so filled with my father That not in anything could I forget him But deepest highest must in all things set him Yet if thou think in me God what great matter Though my poor thought to former break and latter As now my best thoughts break before thee foiled and scatter twenty three Some way there must be of my not forgetting And thither thou art leading me my God The child that weary of his mother s petting Runs out the moment that his feet are shod May see her face in every flower he sees And she although beyond the window sitting Be nearer him than when he sat upon her knees twenty four What if when I at last at the long last Shall see thy face my Lord my life s delight It should not be the face that hath been glassed In poor imagination s mirror slight Will my soul sink and shall I stand aghast Beggared of hope my heart a conscious blight Amazed and lost death s bitterness come and not passed twenty five Ah no for from thy heart the love will press And shining from thy perfect human face Will sink into me like the father s kiss And deepening wide the gulf of consciousness Beyond imagination s lowest abyss Will with the potency of creative grace Lord it throughout the larger thinking place twenty six Thus God possessed new born ah not for long Should I the sight behold beatified Know it creating in me feel the throng Of speechless hopes out throbbing like a tide And my heart rushing borne aloft the flood To offer at his feet its living blood Ere glory hid the other face I spied twenty seven For out imagination is in small And with the making difference that must be Mirror of God s creating mirror all That shows itself therein that formeth he And there is Christ no bodiless vanity Though face to face the mighty perfectness With glory blurs the dim reflected less twenty eight I clasp thy feet O father of the living Thou wilt not let my fluttering hopes be more Or lovelier or greater than thy giving Surely thy ships will bring to my poor shore Of gold and peacocks such a shining store As will laugh all the dreams to holy scorn Of love and sorrow that were ever born twenty nine Sometimes it seems pure natural to trust And trust right largely grandly infinitely Daring the splendour of the giver s part At other times the whole earth is but dust The sky is dust yea dust the human heart Then art thou nowhere there is no room for thee In the great dust heap of eternity thirty But why should it be possible to mistrust Nor possible only but its opposite hard Why should not man believe because he must By sight s compulsion Why should he be scarred With conflict worn with doubting fine and long No man is fit for heaven s musician throng Who has not tuned an instrument all shook and jarred thirty one Therefore O Lord when all things common seem When all is dust and self the centre clod When grandeur is a hopeless foolish dream And anxious care more reasonable than God Out of the ashes I will call to thee In spite of dead distrust call earnestly Oh thou who livest call then answer dying me SEPTEMBER one WE are a shadow and a shining we One moment nothing seems but what we see Nor aught to rule but common circumstance Nought is to seek but praise to shun but chance A moment more and God is all in all And not a sparrow from its nest can fall But from the ground its chirp goes up into his hall two I know at least which is the better mood When on a heap of cares I sit and brood Like Job upon his ashes sorely vext I feel a lower thing than when I stood The world s true heir fearless as on its stalk A lily meeting Jesus in his walk I am not all mood I can judge betwixt three Such differing moods can scarce to one belong Shall the same fountain sweet and bitter yield Shall what bore late the dust mood think and brood Till it bring forth the great believing mood Or that which bore the grand mood bald and peeled Sit down to croon the shabby sensual song To hug itself and sink from wrong to meaner wrong four In the low mood the mere man acts alone Moved by impulses which if from within Yet far outside the centre man begin But in the grand mood every softest tone Comes from the living God at very heart From thee who infinite core of being art Thee who didst call our names ere ever we could sin five There is a coward sparing in the heart Offspring of penury and low born fear Prayer must take heed nor overdo its part Asking too much of him with open ear Sinners must wait not seek the very best Cry out for peace and be of middling cheer False heart thou cheatest God and dost thy life molest six Thou hungerest not thou thirstest not enough Thou art a temporizing thing mean heart Down drawn thou pick saint up straws and wretched stuff Stooping as if the world s floor were the chart Of the long way thy lazy feet must tread Thou dreamest of the crown hung o er thy head But that is safe thou gatherest hairs and fluff seven Man s highest action is to reach up higher Stir up himself to take hold of his sire Then best I love you dearest when I go And cry to love s life I may love you so As to content the yearning making love That perfects strength divine in weakness fire And from the broken pots calls out the silver dove eight Poor am I God knows poor as withered leaf Poorer or richer than I dare not ask To love aright for me were hopeless task Eternities too high to comprehend But shall I tear my heart in hopeless grief Or rise and climb and run and kneel and bend And drink the primal love so love in chief nine Then love shall wake and be its own high life Then shall I know tis I that love indeed Ready without a moment s questioning strife To be forgot like bursting water bead For the high good of the eternal dear All hope all claim resting with spirit clear Upon the living love that every love doth breed ten Ever seem to fail in utterance Sometimes amid the swift melodious dance Of fluttering words as if it had not been The thought has melted vanished into night Sometimes I say a thing I did not mean And lo tis better by thy ordered chance Than what eluded me floating too feathery light eleven If thou wouldst have me speak Lord give me speech So many cries are uttered now a days That scarce a song however clear and true Will thread the jostling tumult safe and reach The ears of men buz filled with poor denays Barb thou my words with light make my song new And men will hear or when I sing or preach twelve Can anything go wrong with me I ask And the same moment at a sudden pain Stand trembling Up from the great river s brim Comes a cold breath the farther bank is dim The heaven is black with clouds and coming rain High soaring faith is grown a heavy task And all is wrong with weary heart and brain thirteen Things do go wrong I know grief pain and fear I see them lord it sore and wide around From her fair twilight answers Truth star crowned Things wrong are needful where wrong things abound Things go not wrong but Pain with dog and spear False faith from human hearts will hunt and hound The earth shall quake neath them that trust the solid ground fourteen Things go not wrong when sudden I fall prone But when I snatch my upheld hand from thine And proud or careless think to walk alone Then things go wrong when I poor silly sheep To shelves and pits from the good pasture creep Not when the shepherd leaves the ninety and nine And to the mountains goes after the foolish one fifteen Lo now thy swift dogs over stone and bush After me straying sheep loud barking rush There s Fear and Shame and Empty heart and Lack And Lost love and a thousand at their back I see thee not but know thou hound saint them on And I am lost indeed escape is none See there they come down streaming on my track sixteen I rise and run staggering double and run But whither whither whither for escape The sea lies all about this long necked cape There come the dogs straight for me every one Me live despair live centre of alarms Ah lo twixt me and all his barking harms The shepherd lo I run fall folded in his arms seventeen There let the dogs yelp let them growl and leap It is no matter I will go to sleep Like a spent cloud pass pain and grief and fear Out from behind it unchanged love shines clear Oh save me Christ I know not what I am I was thy stupid self willed greedy lamb Would be thy honest and obedient sheep eighteen Why is it that so often I return From social converse with a spirit worn A lack a disappointment even a sting Of shame as for some low unworthy thing Because I have not careful first of all Set my door open wide back to the wall Ere I at others doors did knock and call nineteen Yet more and more of me thou dost demand My faith and hope in God alone shall stand The life of law not trust the rain and sun To draw the golden harvest o er the land I must not say This too will pass and die The wind will change Round will the seasons run Law is the body of will of conscious harmony twenty Who trusts a law might worship a god of wood Half his soul slumbers if it be not dead He is a live thing shut in chaos crude Hemmed in with dragons a remorseless head Still hanging over its uplifted eyes No God is all in all and nowhere dies The present heart and thinking will of good twenty one Law is our schoolmaster Our master Christ Lived under all our laws yet always prayed So walked the water when the storm was highest Law is Thy father s thou hast it obeyed And it thereby subject to thee hast made To rule it master for thy brethren s sakes Well may he guide the law by whom law s maker makes twenty two Death haunts our souls with dissolution s strife Soaks them with unrest makes our every breath A throe not action from God s purest gift Wipes off the bloom and on the harp of faith Its fretted strings doth slacken still and shift Life everywhere perfect and always life Is sole redemption from this haunting death twenty three God thou from death dost lift me As I rise Its Lethe from my garment drips and flows Ere long I shall be safe in upper air With thee my life with thee my answered prayer Where thou art God in every wind that blows And self alone and ever softly dies There shall my being blossom and I know it fair twenty four I would dig Master in no field but thine Would build my house only upon thy rock Yet am but a dull day with a sea sheen Why should I wonder then that they should mock Who in the limbo of things heard and seen Hither and thither blowing lose the shine Of every light that hangs in the firmament divine twenty five Lord loosen in me the hold of visible things Help me to walk by faith and not by sight I would through thickest veils and coverings See into the chambers of the living light Lord in the land of things that swell and seem Help me to walk by the other light supreme Which shows thy facts behind man s vaguely hinting dream twenty six I see a little child whose eager hands Search the thick stream that drains the crowded street For possible things hid in its current slow Near by behind him a great palace stands Where kings might welcome nobles to their feet Soft sounds sweet scents fair sights there only go There the child s father lives but the child does not know twenty seven On eager hungry busy seeking child Rise up turn round run in run up the stair Far in a chamber from rude noise exiled Thy father sits pondering how thou dost fare The mighty man will clasp thee to his breast Will kiss thee stroke the tangles of thy hair And lap thee warm in fold on fold of lovely rest twenty eight The prince of this world came and nothing found In thee O master but ah woe is me He cannot pass me on other business bound But spying in me things familiar he Casts over me the shadow of his flight And straight I moan in darkness and the fight Begins afresh betwixt the world and thee twenty nine In my own heart O master in my thought Betwixt the woolly sheep and hairy goat Not clearly I distinguish but I think Thou knowest that I fight upon thy side The how I am ashamed of for I shrink From many a blow am borne on the battle tide When I should rush to the front and take thy foe by the throat thirty The enemy still hath many things in me Yea many an evil nest with open hole Gapes out to him at which he enters free But like the impact of a burning coal His presence mere straight rouses the garrison And all are up in arms and down on knee Fighting and praying till the foe is gone OCTOBER one REMEMBER Lord thou hast not made me good Or if thou didst it was so long ago I have forgotten and never understood I humbly think At best it was a crude A rough hewn goodness that did need this woe This sin these harms of all kinds fierce and rude To shape it out making it live and grow two But thou art making me I thank thee sire What thou hast done and doest thou know saint well And I will help thee gently in thy fire I will lie burning on thy potter s wheel I will whirl patient though my brain should reel Thy grace shall be enough the grief to quell And growing strength perfect through weakness dire three I have not knowledge wisdom insight thought Nor understanding fit to justify Thee in thy work O Perfect Thou hast brought Me up to this and lo what thou hast wrought I cannot call it good But I can cry O enemy the maker hath not done One day thou shalt behold and from the sight wilt run four The faith I will aside is easily bent But of thy love my God one glimpse alone Can make me absolutely confident With faith hope joy in love responsive blent My soul then in the vision mighty grown Its father and its fate securely known Falls on thy bosom with exultant moan five Thou workest perfectly And if it seem Some things are not so well tis but because They are too loving deep too lofty wise For me poor child to understand their laws My highest wisdom half is but a dream My love runs helpless like a falling stream Thy good embraces ill and lo its illness dies six From sleep I wake and wake to think of thee But wherefore not with sudden glorious glee Why burst not gracious on me heaven and earth In all the splendour of a new day birth Why hangs a cloud betwixt my lord and me The moment that my eyes the morning greet My soul should panting rush to clasp thy father feet seven Is it because it is not thou I see But only my poor blotted fancy of thee Oh never till thyself reveal thy face Shall I be flooded with life s vital grace Oh make my mirror heart thy shining place And then my soul awaking with the morn Shall be a waking joy eternally new born eight Lord in my silver is much metal base Else should my being by this time have shown Thee thy own self therein Therefore do I Wake in the furnace I know thou sittest by Refining look keep looking in to try Thy silver master look and see thy face Else here I lie for ever blank as any stone nine But when in the dim silver thou dost look I do behold thy face though blurred and faint Oh joy no flaw in me thy grace will brook But still refine slow shall the silver pass From bright to brighter till sans spot or taint Love well content shall see no speck of brass And I his perfect face shall hold as in a glass ten With every morn my life afresh must break The crust of self gathered about me fresh That thy wind spirit may rush in and shake The darkness out of me and rend the mesh The spider devils spin out of the flesh Eager to net the soul before it wake That it may slumberous lie and listen to the snake eleven Tis that I am not good that is enough I pry no farther that is not the way Here O my potter is thy making stuff Set thy wheel going let it whir and play The chips in me the stones the straws the sand Cast them out with fine separating hand And make a vessel of thy yielding clay twelve What if it take a thousand years to make me So me he leave not angry on the floor Nay thou art never angry that would break me Would I tried never thy dear patience sore But were as good as thou couldst well expect me Whilst thou dost make I mar and thou correct me Then were I now content waiting for something more thirteen Only my God see thou that I content thee Oh take thy own content upon me God Ah never never sure wilt thou repent thee That thou hast called thy Adam from the clod Yet must I mourn that thou shouldst ever find me One moment sluggish needing more of the rod Than thou didst think when thy desire designed me fourteen My God it troubles me I am not better More help I pray still more Thy perfect debtor I shall be when thy perfect child I am grown My Father help me am I not thine own Lo other lords have had dominion o er me But now thy will alone I set before me Thy own heart s life Lord thou wilt not abhor me fifteen In youth when once again I had set out To find thee Lord my life my liberty A window now and then clouds all about Would open into heaven my heart forlorn First all would tremble with a solemn glee Then whelmed in peace rest like a man outworn That sees the dawn slow part the closed lids of the morn sixteen Now I grow old and the soft gathered years Have calmed yea dulled the heart s swift fluttering beat But a quiet hope that keeps its household seat Is better than recurrent glories fleet To know thee Lord is worth a many tears And when this mildew age has dried away My heart will beat again as young and strong and gay seventeen Stronger and gayer tenfold but O friends Not for itself nor any hoarded bliss I see but vaguely whither my being tends All vaguely spy a glory shadow blent Vaguely desire the individual kiss But when I think of God a large content Fills the dull air of my gray cloudy tent eighteen Father of me thou art my bliss secure Make of me maker whatsoe er thou wilt Let fancy s wings hang moulting hope grow poor And doubt steam up from where a joy was spilt I lose no time to reason it plain and clear But fly to thee my life s perfection dear Not what I think but what thou art makes sure nineteen This utterance of spirit through still thought This forming of heart stuff in moulds of brain Is helpful to the soul by which tis wrought The shape reacting on the heart again But when I am quite old and words are slow Like dying things that keep their holes for woe And memory s withering tendrils clasp with effort vain twenty Thou then as now no less wilt be my life And I shall know it better than before Praying and trusting hoping claiming more From effort vain sick foil and bootless strife I shall with childness fresh look up to thee Thou seeing thy child with age encumbered sore Wilt round him bend thine arm more carefully twenty one And when grim Death doth take me by the throat Thou wilt have pity on thy handiwork Thou wilt not let him on my suffering gloat But draw my soul out gladder than man or boy When thy saved creatures from the narrow ark Rushed out and leaped and laughed and cried for joy And the great rainbow strode across the dark twenty two Against my fears my doubts my ignorance I trust in thee O father of my Lord The world went on in this same broken dance When worn and mocked he trusted and adored I too will trust and gather my poor best To face the truth faced false So in his nest I shall awake at length a little scarred and scored twenty three Things cannot look all right so long as I Am not all right who see therefore not right Can see The lamp within sends out the light Which shows the things and if its rays go wry Or are not white they must part show a lie The man half cured did men not trees conclude Because he moving saw what else had seemed a wood twenty four Give me take from me as thou wilt I learn Slowly and stubbornly I learn to yield With a strange hopefulness As from the field Of hard fought battle won the victor chief Turns thankfully although his heart do yearn So from my old things to thy new I turn With sad thee trusting heart and not in grief twenty five If with my father I did wander free Floating o er hill and field where er we would And lighting on the sward before the door Strange faces through the window panes should see And strange feet standing where the loved had stood The dear old place theirs all as ours before Should I be sorrowful father having thee twenty six So Lord if thou tak saint from me all the rest Thyself with each resumption drawing nigher It shall but hurt me as the thorn of the briar When I reach to the pale flower in its breast To have thee Lord is to have all thy best Holding it by its very life divine To let my friend s hand go and take his heart in mine twenty seven Take from me leisure all familiar places Take all the lovely things of earth and air Take from me books take all my precious faces Take words melodious and their songful linking Take scents and sounds and all thy outsides fair Draw nearer taking and to my sober thinking Thou bring saint them nearer all and ready to my prayer twenty eight No place on earth henceforth I shall count strange For every place belongeth to my Christ I will go calm where er thou bid saint me range Whoe er my neighbour thou art still my nighest Oh my heart s life my owner will of my being Into my soul thou every moment diest In thee my life thus evermore decreeing twenty nine What though things change and pass nor come again Thou the life heart of all things changest never The sun shines on the fair clouds turn to rain And glad the earth with many a spring and river The hearts that answer change with chill and shiver That mourn the past sad sick with hopeless pain They know not thee our changeless heart and brain thirty My halting words will some day turn to song Some far off day in holy other times The melody now prisoned in my rimes Will one day break aloft and from the throng Of wrestling thoughts and words spring up the air As from the flower its colour s sweet despair Issues in odour and the sky s low levels climbs thirty one My surgent thought shoots lark like up to thee Thou like the heaven art all about the lark Whatever I surmise or know in me Idea or but symbol on the dark Is living working thought creating power In thee the timeless father of the hour I am thy book thy song thy child would be NOVEMBER one THOU art of this world Christ Thou know saint it all Thou know saint our evens our morns our red and gray How moons and hearts and seasons rise and fall How we grow weary plodding on the way Of future joy how present pain bereaves Rounding us with a dark of mere decay Tossed with a drift Of summer fallen leaves two Thou knowest all our weeping fainting striving Thou know saint how very hard it is to be How hard to rouse faint will not yet reviving To do the pure thing trusting all to thee To hold thou art there for all no face we see How hard to think through cold and dark and dearth That thou art nearer now than when eye seen on earth three Have pity on us for the look of things When blank denial stares us in the face Although the serpent mask have lied before It fascinates the bird that darkling sings And numbs the little prayer bird s beating wings For how believe thee somewhere in blank space If through the darkness come no knocking to our door four 
6518_66470_000008_000000	train-clean-360	If we might sit until the darkness go Possess our souls in patience perhaps we might But there is always something to be done And no heart left to do it

6518_66470_000010_000001	train-clean-360	Stumbling through the night To my dim lattice O calling Christ 
none	none	I go And out into the dark look for thy star crowned head six There are who come to me and write and send Whom I would love giving good things to all But friend that name I cannot on them spend Tis from the centre of self love they call For cherishing for which they first must know How to be still and take the seat that s low When Lord shall I be fit when wilt thou call me friend seven

none	none	A very prodigal I stagger into thy presence Lord of me One look my Christ and at thy feet I fall twelve Why should I still hang back like one in a dream Who vainly strives to clothe himself aright That in great presence he may seemly seem Why call up feeling dress me in the faint Worn faded cast off nimbus of some saint Why of old mood bring back a ghostly gleam While there He waits love s heart and loss s blight thirteen Son of the Father elder brother mine See thy poor brother s plight See how he stands Defiled and feeble hanging down his hands Make me clean brother with thy burning shine From thy rich treasures householder divine Bring forth fair garments old and new I pray And like thy brother dress me in the old home bred way fourteen My prayer bird was cold would not away Although I set it on the edge of the nest Then I bethought me of the story old Love fact or loving fable thou know saint best How when the children had made sparrows of clay Thou mad saint them birds with wings to flutter and fold Take Lord my prayer in thy hand and make it pray fifteen My poor clay sparrow seems turned to a stone And from my heart will neither fly nor run I cannot feel as thou and I both would But Father I am willing make me good What art thou father for but to help thy son Look deep yet deeper in my heart and there Beyond where I can feel read thou the prayer sixteen Oh what it were to be right sure of thee Sure that thou art and the same as thy son Jesus Oh faith is deeper wider than the sea Yea than the blue of heaven that ever flees us Yet simple as the cry of sore hurt child Or as his shout with sudden gladness wild When home from school he runs till morn set free seventeen If I were sure thou Father verily art True father of the Nazarene as true Sure as I am of my wife s shielding heart Sure as of sunrise in the watching blue Sure as I am that I do eat and drink And have a heart to love and laugh and think Meseems in flame the joy might from my body start eighteen But I must know thee in a deeper way Than any of these ways or know thee not My heart at peace far loftier proof must lay Than if the wind thou me the wave didst roll Than if I lay before thee a sunny spot Or knew thee as the body knows its soul Or even as the part doth know its perfect whole nineteen There is no word to tell how I must know thee No wind clasped ever a low meadow flower So close that as to nearness it could show thee No rainbow so makes one the sun and shower A something with thee I am a nothing fro thee Because I am not save as I am in thee My soul is ever setting out to win thee twenty I know not how for that I first must know thee I know I know thee not as I would know thee For my heart burns like theirs that did not know him Till he broke bread and therein they must know him I know thee knowing that I do not know thee Nor ever shall till one with me I know thee Even as thy son the eternal man doth know thee twenty one Creation under me in and above Slopes upward from the base a pyramid On whose point I shall stand at last and love From the first rush of vapour at thy will To the last poet word that darkness chid Thou hast been sending up creation s hill To lift thy souls aloft in faithful Godhead free twenty two I think my thought and fancy I think thee Lord wake me up rend swift my coffin planks I pray thee let me live alive and free My soul will break forth in melodious thanks Aware at last what thou wouldst have it be When thy life shall be light in me and when My life to thine is answer and amen twenty three How oft I say the same things in these lines Even as a man buried in during dark Turns ever where the edge of twilight shines Prays ever towards the vague eternal mark Or as the sleeper having dreamed he drinks Back straightway into thirstful dreaming sinks So turns my will to thee for thee still longs still pines twenty four The mortal man all careful wise and troubled The eternal child in the nursery doth keep To morrow on to day the man heaps doubled The child laughs hopeful even in his sleep The man rebukes the child for foolish trust The child replies Thy care is for poor dust Be still and let me wake that thou mayst sleep twenty five Till I am one with oneness manifold I must breed contradiction strife and doubt Things tread Thy court look real take proving hold My Christ is not yet grown to cast them out Alas to me false judging twixt the twain The Unseen oft fancy seems while all about The Seen doth lord it with a mighty train twenty six But when the Will hath learned obedience royal He straight will set the child upon the throne To whom the seen things all grown instant loyal Will gather to his feet in homage prone The child their master they have ever known Then shall the visible fabric plainly lean On a Reality that never can be seen twenty seven Thy ways are wonderful maker of men Thou gavest me a child and I have fed And clothed and loved her many a growing year Lo now a friend of months draws gently near And claims her future all beyond his ken There he hath never loved her nor hath led She weeps and moans but turns and leaves her home so dear twenty eight 
6518_66470_000056_000000	train-clean-360	She leaves but not forsakes 
none	none	Oft in the night Oft at mid day when all is still around Sudden will rise in dim pathetic light Some childish memory of household bliss Or sorrow by love s service robed and crowned Rich in his love she yet will sometimes miss The mother s folding arms the mother s sealing kiss twenty nine Then first I think our eldest born although Loving devoted tender watchful dear The innermost of home bred love shall know Yea when at last the janitor draws near A still pale joy will through the darkness go At thought of lying in those arms again Which once were heaven enough for any pain thirty By love doth love grow mighty in its love Once thou shalt love us child as we love thee Father of loves is it not thy decree That by our long far wandering remove From thee our life our home our being blest We learn at last to love thee true and best And rush with all our loves back to thy infinite rest DECEMBER one I AM a little weary of my life Not thy life blessed Father Or the blood Too slowly laves the coral shores of thought Or I am weary of weariness and strife Open my soul gates to thy living flood I ask not larger heart throbs vigour fraught I pray thy presence with strong patience rife two I will what thou will saint only keep me sure That thou art willing call to me now and then So ceasing to enjoy I shall endure With perfect patience willing beyond my ken Beyond my love beyond my thinking scope Willing to be because thy will is pure Willing thy will beyond all bounds of hope three This weariness of mine may it not come From something that doth need no setting right Shall fruit be blamed if it hang wearily A day before it perfected drop plumb To the sad earth from off its nursing tree Ripeness must always come with loss of might The weary evening fall before the resting night four Hither if I have come through earth and air Through fire and water I am not of them Born in the darkness what fair flashing gem Would to the earth go back and nestle there Not of this world this world my life doth hem What if I weary then and look to the door Because my unknown life is swelling at the core five All winged things came from the waters first Airward still many a one from the water springs In dens and caves wind loving things are nursed I lie like unhatched bird upfolded dumb While all the air is trembling with the hum Of songs and beating hearts and whirring wings That call my slumbering life to wake to happy things six I lay last night and knew not why I was sad Tis well with God I said and he is the truth Let that content me Tis not strength nor youth Nor buoyant health nor a heart merry mad That makes the fact of things wherein men live He is the life and doth my life outgive In him there is no gloom but all is solemn glad seven I said to myself Lo I lie in a dream Of separation where there comes no sign My waking life is hid with Christ in God Where all is true and potent fact divine I will not heed the thing that doth but seem I will be quiet as lark upon the sod God s will the seed shall rest in me the pod eight And when that will shall blossom then my God There will be jubilation in a world The glad lark soaring heavenward from the sod Up the swift spiral of its own song whirled Never such jubilation wild out poured As from my soul will break at thy feet Lord Like a great tide from sea heart shoreward hurled nine For then thou wilt be able then at last To glad me as thou hungerest to do Then shall thy life my heart all open find A thoroughfare to thy great spirit wind Then shall I rest within thy holy vast One with the bliss of the eternal mind And all creation rise in me created new ten What makes thy being a bliss shall then make mind For I shall love as thou and love in thee Then shall I have whatever I desire My every faintest wish being all divine Power thou wilt give me to work mightily Even as my Lord leading thy low men nigher With dance and song to cast their best upon thy fire eleven Then shall I live such an essential life That a mere flower will then to me unfold More bliss than now grandest orchestral strife By love made and obedience humble bold I shall straight through its window God behold God I shall feed on thee thy creature blest With very being work at one with sweetest rest twelve Give me a world to part for praise and sunder The brooks be bells the winds in caverns dumb Wake fife and flute and flageolet and voice The fire shook earth itself be the great drum And let the air the region s bass out thunder The firs be violins the reeds hautboys Rivers seas icebergs fill the great score up and under thirteen But rather dost thou hear the blundered words Of breathing creatures the music lowing herds Of thy great cattle thy soft bleating sheep O erhovered by the trebles of thy birds Whose Christ praised carelessness song fills the deep Still rather a child s talk who apart doth hide him And make a tent for God to come and sit beside him fourteen This is not life this being is not enough But thou art life and thou hast life for me Thou mad saint the worm to cast the wormy slough And fly abroad a glory flit and flee Thou hast me statue like hewn in the rough Meaning at last to shape me perfectly Lord thou hast called me fourth I turn and call on thee fifteen Tis thine to make mine to rejoice in thine As hungering for his mother s face and eyes The child throws wide the door back to the wall I run to thee the refuge from poor lies Lean dogs behind me whimper yelp and whine Life lieth ever sick Death s writhing thrall In slavery endless hopeless and supine sixteen The life that hath not willed itself to be Must clasp the life that willed and be at peace Or like a leaf wind blown through chaos flee A life husk into which the demons go And work their will and drive it to and fro A thing that neither is nor yet can cease Which uncreation can alone release seventeen But when I turn and grasp the making hand And will the making will with confidence I ride the crest of the creation wave Helpless no more no more existence slave In the heart of love s creating fire I stand And love possessed in heart and soul and sense Take up the making share the making Master gave eighteen That man alone who does the Father s works Can be the Father s son yea only he Who sonlike can create can ever be Who with God wills not is no son not free O Father send the demon doubt that lurks Behind the hope out into the abyss Who trusts in knowledge all its good shall miss nineteen Thy beasts are sinless and do live before thee Thy child is sinful and must run to thee Thy angels sin not and in peace adore thee But I must will or never more be free I from thy heart came how can I ignore thee Back to my home I hurry haste and flee There I shall dwell love praising evermore thee twenty My holy self thy pure ideal lies Calm in thy bosom which it cannot leave My self unholy no ideal hies Hither and thither gathering store to grieve Not now O Father now it mounts it flies To join the true self in thy heart that waits And one with it be one with all the heavenly mates twenty one Trusting thee Christ I kneel and clasp thy knee Cast myself down and kiss thy brother feet One self thou and the Father s thought of thee Ideal son thou hast left the perfect home Ideal brother to seek thy brothers come Thou know saint our angels all God s children sweet And of each two wilt make one holy child complete twenty two To a slow end I draw these daily words Nor think such words often to write again Rather as light the power to me affords Christ s new and old would to my friends unbind Through words he spoke help to his thought behind Unveil the heart with which he drew his men Set forth his rule o er devils animals corn and wind twenty three I do remember how one time I thought God must be lonely oh so lonely lone I will be very good to him ah nought Can reach the heart of his great loneliness My whole heart I will bring him with a moan That I may not come nearer I will lie prone Before the awful loveliness in loneliness excess twenty four A God must have a God for company And lo thou hast the Son God to thy friend Thou honour saint his obedience he thy law Into thy secret life will he doth see Thou fold saint him round in live love perfectly One two without beginning without end In love life strength and truth perfect without a flaw twenty five Thou hast not made or taught me Lord to care For times and seasons but this one glad day Is the blue sapphire clasping all the lights That flash in the girdle of the year so fair When thou wast born a man because alway Thou wast and art a man through all the flights Of thought and time and thousandfold creation s play twenty six We all are lonely Maker each a soul Shut in by itself a sundered atom of thee No two yet loved themselves into a whole Even when we weep together we are two Of two to make one which yet two shall be Is thy creation s problem deep and true To which thou only hold saint the happy hurting clue twenty seven No less than thou O Father do we need A God to friend each lonely one of us As touch not in the sack two grains of seed Touch no two hearts in great worlds populous Outside the making God we cannot meet Him he has made our brother homeward thus To find our kin we first must turn our wandering feet twenty eight It must be possible that the soul made Should absolutely meet the soul that makes Then in that bearing soul meet every other There also born each sister and each brother Lord till I meet thee thus life is delayed I am not I until that morning breaks Not I until my consciousness eternal wakes twenty nine Again I shall behold thee daughter true The hour will come when I shall hold thee fast In God s name loving thee all through and through Somewhere in his grand thought this waits for us Then shall I see a smile not like thy last For that great thing which came when all was past Was not a smile but God s peace glorious thirty Twilight of the transfiguration joy Gleam faced pure eyed strong willed high hearted boy Hardly thy life clear forth of heaven was sent Ere it broke out into a smile and went So swift thy growth so true thy goalward bent Thou child and sage inextricably blent Wilt one day teach thy father in some heavenly tent thirty one Go my beloved children live your life Wounded faint bleeding never yield the strife Stunned fallen awake arise and fight again Before you victory stands with shining train Of hopes not credible until they are Beyond morass and mountain swells the
