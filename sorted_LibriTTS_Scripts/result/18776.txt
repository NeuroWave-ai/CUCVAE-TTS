coat it was shockingly worn And the rust had invested his vest His breeches had suffered a breach His linen and worsted were worse He had scarce a whole crown in his hat And not half a crown in his purse And thus as he wandered along A cheerless and comfortless elf He sought for relief in a song Or complainingly talked to himself Unfortunate man that I am I ve never a client but grief The case is I ve no case at all And in brief I ve ne er had a brief I ve waited and waited in vain Expecting an opening to find Where an honest young lawyer might gain Some reward for toil of his mind Tis not that I m wanting in law Or lack an intelligent face That others have cases to plead While I have to plead for a case O how can a modest young man E er hope for the smallest progression The profession s already so full Of lawyers so full of profession While thus he was strolling around His eye accidentally fell On a very deep hole in the ground And he sighed to himself It is well To curb his emotions he sat On the curbstone the space of a minute Then cried Here s an opening at last And in less than a jiffy was in it Next morning twelve citizens came Twas the coroner bade them attend To the end that it might be determined How the man had determined his end The man was a lawyer I hear Quoth the foreman who sat on the corse A lawyer Alas said another Undoubtedly died of remorse A third said He knew the deceased An attorney well versed in the laws And as to the cause of his death Twas no doubt for the want of a cause The jury decided at length After solemnly weighing the matter That the lawyer was drown d ed because He could not keep his head above water THE TWO HUSBANDS BY CAROLYN WELLS Once on a Time there were Two Men each of whom married the Woman of his Choice One Man devoted all his Energies to Getting Rich He was so absorbed in Acquiring Wealth that he Worked Night and Day to Accomplish his End By this Means he lost his Health he became a Nervous Wreck and was so Irritable and Irascible that his Wife Ceased to live with him and Returned to her Parents House The Other Man made no Efforts to Earn Money and after he had Spent his own and his Wife s Fortunes Poverty Stared them in the Face Although his Wife had loved him Fondly she could not Continue her affection toward One who could not Support her so she left him and Returned to her Childhood s Home MORALS This Fable teaches that the Love of Money is the Root of All Evil and that When Poverty Comes In At the Door Loves Flies Out Of the Window THE STORY OF THE TWO FRIARS BY EUGENE FIELD It befell in the year sixteen sixty two in which same year were many witchcrafts and sorceries such as never before had been seen and the like of which will never again by grace of Heaven afflict mankind in this year it befell that the devil came upon earth to tempt an holy friar named Friar Gonsol being strictly minded to win that righteous vessel of piety unto his evil pleasance Now wit you well that this friar had grievously offended the devil for of all men then on earth there was none more holier than he nor none surer to speak and to do sweet charity unto all his fellows in every place Therefore it was that the devil was sore wroth at the Friar Gonsol being mightily plagued not only by his teachings and his preachings but also by the pious works which he continually did do Right truly the devil knew that by no common temptations was this friar to be moved for the which reason did the devil seek in dark and troublous cogitations to bethink him of some new instrument wherewith he might bedazzle the eyes and ensnare the understanding of the holy man On a sudden it came unto the fiend that by no corporeal allurement would he be able to achieve his miserable end for that by reason of an abstemious life and a frugal diet the Friar Gonsol had weaned his body from those frailties and lusts to which human flesh is by nature of the old Adam within it disposed and by long continued vigils and by earnest devotion and by godly contemplations and by divers proper studies had fixed his mind and his soul with exceeding steadfastness upon things unto his eternal spiritual welfare appertaining Therefore it beliked the devil to devise and to compound a certain little booke of mighty curious craft wherewith he might be like to please the Friar Gonsol and in the end to ensnare him in his impious toils Now this was the way of the devil s thinking to wit This friar shall suspect no evil in the booke since never before hath the devil tempted mankind with such an instrument the common things wherewith the devil tempteth man being as all histories show and all theologies teach fruit and women and other like things pleasing to the gross and perishable senses Therefore argueth the devil when I shall tempt this friar with a booke he shall be taken off his guard and shall not know it to be a temptation And thereat was the devil exceeding merry and he did laugh full merrily Now presently came this thing of evil unto the friar in the guise of another friar and made a proper low obeisance unto the same But the Friar Gonsol was not blinded to the craft of the devil for from under the cloak and hood that he wore there did issue the smell of sulphur and of brimstone which alone the devil hath Beshrew me quoth the Friar Gonsol if the odour in my nostrils be spikenard and not the fumes of the bottomless pit Nay sweet friar spake the devil full courteously the fragrance thou perceivest is of frankincense and myrrh for I am of holy orders and I have brought thee a righteous booke delectable to look upon and profitable unto the reading Then were the eyes of that Friar Gonsol full of bright sparklings and his heart rejoiced with exceeding joy for he did set most store next to his spiritual welfare by bookes wherein was food to his beneficial devouring I do require thee quoth the friar to shew me that booke that I may know the name thereof and discover whereof it treateth Then shewed the devil the booke unto the friar and the friar saw it was an uncut unique of incalculable value the height of it was half a cubit and the breadth of it the fourth part of a cubit and the thickness of it five barleycorns lacking the space of three horsehairs This booke contained within its divers picturings symbols and similitudes wrought with incomparable craft the same being such as in human vanity are called proof before letters and imprinted upon India paper also the booke contained written upon its pages divers names of them that had possessed it all these having in their time been mighty and illustrious personages but what seemed most delectable unto the friar was an autographic writing wherein twas shewn that the booke sometime had been given by Venus di Medici to Apollos at Rhodes When therefore the Friar Gonsol saw the booke how that it was intituled and imprinted and adorned and bounden he knew it to be of vast worth and he was mightily moved to possess it therefore he required of the other that was the devil that he give unto him an option upon the same for the space of seven days hence or until such a time as he could inquire concerning the booke in Lowndes and other such like authorities But the devil smiling quoth The booke shall be yours without price provided only you shall bind yourself to do me a service as I shall hereafter specify and direct Now when the Friar Gonsol heard this compact he knew for a verity that the devil was indeed the devil and but that he sorely wanted the booke he would have driven that impious fiend straightway from his presence Howbeit the devil promising to visit him again that night departed leaving the friar exceeding heavy in spirit for he was both assotted upon the booke to comprehend it and assotted upon the devil to do violence unto him It befell that in his doubtings he came unto the Friar Francis another holy man that by continual fastings and devotions had made himself an ensample of piety unto all men and to this sanctified brother did the Friar Gonsol straightway unfold the story of his temptation and speak fully of the wondrous booke and of its divers many richnesses When that he had heard this narration the Friar Francis made answer in this wise Of great subtility surely is the devil that he hath set this snare for thy feet Have a care my brother that thou fallest not into the pit which he hath digged for thee Happy art thou to have come to me with this thing elsewise a great mischief might have befallen thee Now listen to my words and do as I counsel thee Have no more to do with this devil send him to me or appoint with him another meeting and I will go in thy stead Nay nay cried the Friar Gonsol the saints forefend from thee the evil temptation provided for my especial proving I should have been reckoned a weak and coward vessel were I to send thee in my stead to bear the mortifications designed for the trying of my virtues But thou art a younger brother than I reasoned the Friar Francis softly and firm though thy resolution may be now thou art more like than I to be wheedled and bedazzled by these diabolical wiles and artifices So let me know where this devil abideth with the booke I burn to meet him and to wrest his treasure from his impious possession But the Friar Gonsol shook his head and would not hear unto this vicarious sacrifice whereon the good Friar Francis had set his heart Ah I see that thou hast little faith in my strength to combat the fiend quoth the Friar Francis reproachfully Thy trust in me should be greater for I have done thee full many a kindly office or now I do bethink me thou art assorted on the booke Unhappy brother can it be that thou dost covet this vain toy this frivolous bauble that thou wouldst seek the devil s companionship anon to compound with Beelzelub I charge thee Brother Gonsol open thine eyes and see in what a slippery place thou standest Now by these argumentations was the Friar Gonsol mightily confounded and he knew not what to do Come now hesitate no longer quoth the Friar Francis but tell me where that devil may be found I burn to see and to comprehend the booke not that I care for the booke but that I am grievously tormented to do that devil a sore despight Odds boddikins quoth the other friar me seemeth that the booke inciteth thee more than the devil Thou speakest wrongly cried the Friar Francis Thou mistakest pious zeal for sinful selfishness Full wroth am I to hear how that this devil walketh to and fro using a sweet and precious booke for the temptation of holy men Shall so righteous an instrument be employed by the prince of heretics to so unrighteous an end Thou sayest wisely quoth the Friar Gonsol and thy words convince me that a battaile must be made with this devil for that booke So now I shall go to encounter the fiend Then by the saints I shall go with thee cried the Friar Francis and he gathered his gown about his loins right briskly But when the Friar Gonsol saw this he made great haste to go alone and he ran out of the door full swiftly and fared him where the devil had appointed an appointment with him Now wit you well that the Friar Francis did follow close upon his heels for though his legs were not so long he was a mighty runner and he was right sound of wind Therefore was it a pleasant sight to see these holy men vying with one another to do battle with the devil and much it repenteth me that there be some ribald heretics that maintain full enviously that these two saintly friars did so run not for the devil that they might belabor him but for the booke that they might possess it It fortuned that the devil was already come to the place where he had appointed the appointment and in his hand he had the booke aforesaid Much marveled he when that he beheld the two friars faring thence I adjure thee thou devil said the Friar Gonsol from afar off I adjure thee give me that booke else I will take thee by thy horns and hoofs and drub thy ribs together Heed him not thou devil said the Friar Francis for it is I that am coming to wrestle with thee and to overcome thee for that booke With such words and many more the two holy friars bore down upon the devil but the devil thinking verily that he was about to be beset by the whole church militant stayed not for their coming but presently departed out of sight and bore the book with him Now many people at that time saw the devil fleeing before the two friars so that esteeming it to be a sign of special grace these people did ever thereafter acknowledge the friars to be saints and unto this day you shall hear of saint Gonsol and saint Francis Unto this day too doth the devil with that same booke wherewith he tempted the friar of old beset and ensnare men of every age and in all places Against which devil may Heaven fortify us to do battle speedily and with successful issuance THE GRECO TROJAN GAME BY CHARLES F JOHNSON First on the ground appeared the god like Trojan Eleven Shining in purple and black with tight and well fitting sweaters Woven by Andromache in the well ordered palace of Priam After them came in goodly array the players of Hellas Skilled in kicking and blocking and tackling and fooling the umpire All advanced on the field marked off with white alabaster Level and square and true at the ends two goal posts erected Richly adorned with silver and gold and carved at the corners Bearing a legend which read Don t talk back at the umpire Rule first given by Zeus for the guidance of voluble mortals All the rules of the game were deeply cut in the crossbars So that the players might know exactly how to evade them On one side of the field were ranged the Trojan spectators Yelling in composite language their ancient Phrygian war cry Ho hay toe Tou tais ton Ton tain to Boomerah Boomerah Trojans And on the other the Greeks fair haired and ready to halloo If occasion should offer and Zeus should grant them a touch down Breck ek kek kek koax Anax andron Agamemnon First they agreed on an umpire the silver tongued Nestor Long years ago he played end rush on the Argive eleven He was admitted by all to be an excellent umpire Save for the habit he had of making public addresses Tedious long winded and dull and full of minute explanations How they used to play in the days when Cadmus was half back Or how Hermes could dodge and Ares and Phoebus could tackle Couched in rhythmical language but not one whit to the purpose On his white hair they carefully placed the sacred tiara Worn by the foot ball umpires of old as a badge of their office Also to save their heads in case the players should slug them Then they gave him a spear wherewith to enforce his decisions And to stick in the ground to mark the place to line up to He advanced to the thirty yard line and began an oration Listen Trojans and Greeks For thirty five seasons I played foot ball in Greece with Peleus for half back and captain Those were the days of old when men played the game as they d orter Once I remember AEacus the god like son of Poseidon Kicked the ball from a drop clean over the city of Argos That was the game when Peleus our captain lost all his front teeth Little we cared for teeth or eyes when once we were warmed up Why I remember that AEacus ran so that no one could see him There was just a long hole in the air and a man at the end on t Hercules umpired that game and I noticed there wasn t much back talk Him interrupting sternly addressed the King Agamemnon Cease old man come off your antediluvian boasting Doubtless our grandpas could all play the game as well as they knew how They are all dead and have long lined up in the fields of elysium If they were here we would wipe up the ground with the rusty old duffers You call the game and keep your eye fixed on the helmeted Hector He ll play off side all the while if he thinks the umpire don t see him Then the old man threw the lots but sore was his heart in his bosom Troy has the kick off he said the ball is yours noble Hector Then he gave him the ball a prolate spheroid of leather Much like the world in its shape if the world were lengthened not flattened Covered with well sewed leather the well seasoned hide of a bison Killed by Lakon the hunter ere bisons were exterminated On it was painted a battle a market a piece of the ocean Horses and cows and nymphs and things too many to mention Then the heroes peeled off their sweaters and put on their nose guards Also the fiendish expressions the great occasion demanded Ajax stood on the right in the center the great Agamemnon Diomed crouched on the left the god like rusher and tackler Crouched as a panther crouches if sculptors do justice to panthers Crafty Ulysses played back for none of the Trojans could pass him All the best Greeks were in line but Podas Okus Achilleus Who though an excellent kicker stayed all day in his section Hector dribbled the ball then seized it and putting his head down And as a lion carries a lamb and jumps over fences Dodging this way and that the shepherds who wish to remonstrate So did the son of Priam carry the ball through the rush line Till he was tackled fair by the full back the crafty Ulysses Even then he carried the ball and the son of Laertes Full five yards till they fell to the ground with a deep indentation Where one might hide three men so that no man could see them Men of the present day degenerate sons of the heroes Now when Pallas Athene discovered the Greeks would be beaten She slid down from the steep of Olympus upon a toboggan Sudden she came before crafty Ulysses in guise like a maiden Not that she thought to fool him but since Olympian fashion Made the form of a woman good form for a goddess assumption She then spoke to him quickly and said O son of Laertes Seize thou the ball I will pass it to thee and trip up the Trojan Her replying slowly re worded the son of Laertes That will I do O goddess divine for he can outrun me Then when the ball was in play she cast thick darkness around it Also around Ulysses she poured invisible darkness Under this cover taking the ball he passed down the middle Silent and swift unseen unnoticed unblocked and untackled Meanwhile she piled the Greeks and the Trojans in conglomeration Much like a tangle of pine trees where lightning has frequently fallen Or like a basket of lobsters and crabs which the provident housewife Dumps on the kitchen floor and vainly endeavors to count them So seemed the legs and the arms and the heads of the twenty one players Sudden a shout arose for under the crossbar Ulysses Visible sat on the ball quietly making a touch down On the tip of his nose were his thumb and fingers extended Curved and vibrating slow in the sign of the blameless Egyptians Violent language came to the lips of the helmeted Hector Under his breath he murmured a few familiar quotations Scraps of Phrygian folk lore about the kingdom of Hades Then he called loud as a trumpet I claim foul mister Umpire Touch down for Greece said Hector twixt you and me and the goal post I lost sight of the ball in a very singular manner Then they carried the sphere back to the twenty five yard line Prone on the ground lay a Greek the leather was poised in his fingers Thrice Agamemnon adjusted the sphere with deliberation Then he drew back as a ram draws back for deadly encounter Then he tripped lightly ahead and brought his sandal in contact Right at the point straight flew the ball right over the crossbar While like the cries of pygmies and cranes the race yell resounded Breck ek kek kek koax Anax andron Agamemnon THE ECONOMICAL PAIR BY CAROLYN WELLS Once on a Time there was a Man and his Wife who had Different Ideas concerning Family Expenditures The Man said I am Exceedingly Economical although I spend Small Sums here and there for Cigars Wines Theater Tickets and Little Dinners yet I do not buy me a Yacht or a Villa at Newport But even with these Praiseworthy Principles it soon Came About that the Man was Bankrupt Whereupon he Reproached his Wife who Answered his Accusations with Surprise Me My dear she exclaimed Why I am Exceedingly Economical True I Occasionally buy me a Set of Sables or a Diamond Tiara but I am Scrupulously Careful about Small Sums I Diligently unknot all Strings that come around Parcels and Save Them and I use the Backs of old Envelopes for Scribbling Paper Yet somehow my Bank Account is also Exhausted MORALS This Fable teaches to Takes Care of the Pence and the Pounds will Take Care of Themselves and that we Should Not Be Penny Wise and Pound Foolish THE TWO PEDESTRIANS BY CAROLYN WELLS Once on a time there were two Men one of whom was a Good Man and the other a Rogue The Good Man one day saw a Wretched Drunkard endeavoring to find his way Home Being most kind hearted the Good Man assisted the Wretched Drunkard to his feet and accompanied him along the Highway toward his Home The Good Man held fast the arm of the Wretched Drunkard and the result of this was that when the Wretched Drunkard lurched giddily the Good Man perforce lurched too Whereupon as the Passing Populace saw the pair they said Aha Another good man gone wrong and they Wisely Wagged their Heads Now the Bad Man of this tale being withal of a shrewd and canny Nature stood often on a street corner and engaged in grave conversation with the Magnates of the town To be sure the Magnates shook him as soon as possible but in no wise discouraged he cheerfully sauntered up to another Magnate Thus did he gain a Reputation of being a friend of the Great MORALS This Fable teaches us that A Man is known by the Company he Keeps and that We Must not Judge by Appearances A COMPLAINT OF FRIENDS BY GAIL HAMILTON If things would not run into each other so it would be a thousand times easier and a million times pleasanter to get on in the world Let the sheepiness be set on one side and the goatiness on the other and immediately you know where you are It is not necessary to ask that there be any increase of the one or any diminution of the other but only that each shall preempt its own territory and stay there Milk is good and water is good but don t set the milk pail under the pump Pleasure softens pain but pain embitters pleasure and who would not rather have his happiness concentrated into one memorable day that shall gleam and glow through a lifetime than have it spread out over a dozen comfortable commonplace humdrum forenoons and afternoons each one as like the others as two peas in a pod Since the law of compensation obtains I suppose it is the best law for us but if it had been left with me I should have made the clever people rich and handsome and left poverty and ugliness to the stupid people because don t you see the stupid people won t know they are ugly and won t care if they are poor but the clever people will be hampered and tortured I would have given the good wives to the good husbands and made drunken men marry drunken women Then there would have been one family exquisitely happy instead of two struggling against misery I would have made the rose stem downy and put all the thorns on the thistles I would have gouged out the jewel from the toad s head and given the peacock the nightingale s voice and not set everything so at half and half But that is the way it is We find the world made to our hand The wise men marry the foolish virgins and the splendid virgins marry dolts and matters in general are so mixed up that the choice lies between nice things about spoiled and vile things that are not so bad after all and it is hard to tell sometimes which you like the best or which you loathe least I expect to lose every friend I have in the world by the publication of this paper except the dunces who are impaled in it They will never read it and if they do will never suspect I mean them while the sensible and true friends who do me good and not evil all the days of their lives will think I am driving at their noble hearts and will at once fall off and leave me inconsolable Still I am going to write it You must open the safety valve once in a while even if the steam does whiz and shriek or there will be an explosion which is fatal while the whizzing and shrieking are only disagreeable Doubtless friendship has its advantages and its pleasures doubtless hostility has its isolations and its revenges still if called upon to choose once for all between friends and foes I think on the whole I should cast my vote for the foes Twenty enemies will not do you the mischief of one friend Enemies you always know where to find They are in fair and square perpetual hostility and you keep your armor on and your sentinels posted but with friends you are inveigled into a false security and before you know it your honor your modesty your delicacy are scudding before the gales Moreover with your friend you can never make reprisals If your enemy attacks you you can always strike back and hit hard You are expected to defend yourself against him to the top of your bent He is your legal opponent in honorable warfare You can pour hot shot into him with murderous vigor and the more he writhes the better you feel In fact it is rather refreshing to measure swords once in a while with such a one You like to exert your power and keep yourself in practice You do not rejoice so much in overcoming your enemy as in overcoming If a marble statue could show fight you would just as soon fight it but as it can not you take something that can and something besides that has had the temerity to attack you and so has made a lawful target of itself But against your friend your hands are tied He has injured you He has disgusted you He has infuriated you But it was most Christianly done You can not hurl a thunderbolt or pull a trigger or lisp a syllable against those amiable monsters who with tenderest fingers are sticking pins all over you So you shut fast the doors of your lips and inwardly sigh for a good stout brawny malignant foe who under any and every circumstance will design you harm and on whom you can lavish your lusty blows with a hearty will and a clear conscience Your enemy keeps clear of you He neither grants nor claims favors He awards you your rights no more no less and demands the same from you Consequently there is no friction Your friend on the contrary is continually getting himself tangled up with you because he is your friend I have heard that Shelley was never better pleased than when his associates made free with his coats boots and hats for their own use and that he appropriated their property in the same way Shelley was a poet and perhaps idealized his friends He saw them probably in a state of pure intellect I am not a poet I look at people in the concrete The most obvious thing about my friends is their avoirdupois and I prefer that they should wear their own cloaks and suffer me to wear mine There is no neck in the world that I want my collar to span except my own It is very exasperating to me to go to my bookcase and miss a book of which I am in immediate and pressing need because an intimate friend has carried it off without asking leave on the score of his intimacy I have not and do not wish to have any alliance that shall abrogate the eighth commandment A great mistake is lying round loose hereabouts a mistake fatal to many friendships that did run well The common fallacy is that intimacy dispenses with the necessity of politeness The truth is just the opposite of this The more points of contact there are the more danger of friction there is and the more carefully should people guard against it If you see a man only once a month it is not of so vital importance that you do not trench on his rights tastes or whims He can bear to be crossed or annoyed occasionally If he does not have a very high regard for you it is comparatively unimportant because your paths are generally so diverse But you and the man with whom you dine every day have it in your power to make each other exceedingly uncomfortable A very little dropping will wear away rock if it only keep at it The thing that you would not think of if it occurred only twice a year becomes an intolerable burden when it happens twice a day This is where husbands and wives run aground They take too much for granted If they would but see that they have something to gain something to save as well as something to enjoy it would be better for them but they proceed on the assumption that their love is an inexhaustible tank and not a fountain depending for its supply on the stream that trickles into it So for every little annoying habit or weakness or fault they draw on the tank without being careful to keep the supply open till they awake one morning to find the pump dry and instead of love at best nothing but a cold habit of complacence On the contrary the more intimate friends become whether married or unmarried the more scrupulously should they strive to repress in themselves everything annoying and to cherish both in themselves and each other everything pleasing While each should draw on his love to neutralize the faults of his friend it is suicidal to draw on his friend s love to neutralize his own faults Love should be cumulative since it can not be stationary If it does not increase it decreases Love like confidence is a plant of slow growth and of most exotic fragility It must be constantly and tenderly cherished Every noxious and foreign element must be carefully removed from it All sunshine and sweet airs and morning dews and evening showers must breathe upon it perpetual fragrance or it dies into a hideous and repulsive deformity fit only to be cast out and trodden under foot of men while properly cultivated it is a Tree of Life Your enemy keeps clear of you not only in business but in society If circumstances thrust him into contact with you he is curt and centrifugal But your friend breaks in upon your saintly solitude with perfect equanimity He never for a moment harbors a suspicion that he can intrude because he is your friend So he drops in on his way to the office to chat half an hour over the latest news The half hour isn t much in itself If it were after dinner you wouldn t mind it but after breakfast every moment runs itself in golden sands and the break in your time crashes a worse break in your temper Are you busy asks the considerate wretch adding insult to injury What can you do Say yes and wound his self love forever But he has a wife and family You respect their feelings smile and smile and are villain enough to be civil with your lips and hide the poison of asps under your tongue till you have a chance to relieve your o ercharged heart by shaking your fist in impotent wrath at his retreating form You will receive the reward of your hypocrisy as you richly deserve for ten to one he will drop in again when he comes back from his office and arrest you wandering in Dreamland in the beautiful twilight Delighted to find that you are neither reading nor writing the absurd dolt as if a man weren t at work unless he be wielding a sledge hammer he will preach out and prose out and twaddle out another hour of your golden eventide because he is your friend You don t care whether he is judge or jury whether he talks sense or nonsense you don t want him to talk at all You don t want him there anyway You want to be alone If you don t why are you sitting there in the deepening twilight If you wanted him couldn t you send for him Why don t you go out into the drawing room where are music and lights and gay people What right have I to suppose that because you are not using your eyes you are not using your brain What right have I to set myself up as a judge of the value of your time and so rob you of perhaps the most delicious hour in all your day on pretense that it is of no use to you take a pound of flesh clean out of your heart and trip on my smiling way as if I had not earned the gallows And what in Heaven s name is the good of all this ceaseless talk To what purpose are you wearied exhausted dragged out and out to the very extreme of tenuity A sprightly badinage a running fire of nonsense for half an hour a tramp over unfamiliar ground with a familiar guide a discussion of something with somebody who knows all about it or who not knowing wants to learn from you a pleasant interchange of commonplaces with a circle of friends around the fire at such hours as you give to society all this is not only tolerable but agreeable often positively delightful but to have an indifferent person on no score but that of friendship break into your sacred presence and suck your blood through indefinite cycles of time is an abomination If he clatters on an indifferent subject you can do well enough for fifteen minutes buoyed up by the hope that he will presently have a fit or be sent for or come to some kind of an end But when you gradually open to the conviction that vis inertiae rules the hour and the thing which has been is that which shall be you wax listless your chariot wheels drive heavily your end of the pole drags in the mud and you speedily wallow in unmitigated disgust If he broaches a subject on which you have a real and deep living interest you shrink from unbosoming yourself to him You feel that it would be sacrilege He feels nothing of the sort He treads over your heart strings in his cowhide brogans and does not see that they are not whip cords He pokes his gold headed cane in among your treasures blind to the fact that you are clutching both arms around them that no gleam of flashing gold may reveal their whereabouts to him You draw yourself up in your shell projecting a monosyllabic claw occasionally as a sign of continued vitality but the pachyderm does not withdraw and you gradually lower into an indignation smothered fierce intense Why why WHY will people inundate their unfortunate victims with such weak washy everlasting floods Why will they haul everything out into the open day Why will they make the Holy of Holies common and unclean Why will they be so ineffably stupid as not to see that there is that which speech profanes Why will they lower their drag nets into the unfathomable waters in the vain attempt to bring up your pearls and gems whose luster would pale to ashes in the garish light whose only sparkle is in the deep sea soundings Procul O procul este profani O the matchless power of silence There are words that concentrate in themselves the glory of a lifetime but there is a silence that is more precious than they Speech ripples over the surface of life but silence sinks into its depths Airy pleasantnesses bubble up in airy pleasant words Weak sorrows quaver out their shallow being and are not When the heart is cleft to its core there is no speech nor language Do not now Messrs Bores think to retrieve your character by coming into my house and sitting mute for two hours Heaven forbid that your blood should be found on my skirts but I believe I shall kill you if you do The only reason why I have not laid violent hands on you heretofore is that your vapid talk has operated as a wire to conduct my electricity to the receptive and kindly earth but if you intrude upon my magnetisms without any such life preserver your future in this world is not worth a crossed sixpence Your silence would break the reed that your talk but bruised The only people with whom it is a joy to sit silent are the people with whom it is a joy to talk Clear out Friendship plays the mischief in the false ideas of constancy which are generated and cherished in its name if not by its agency Your enemies are intense but temporary Time wears off the edge of hostility It is the alembic in which offenses are dissolved into thin air and a calm indifference reigns in their stead But your friends are expected to be a permanent arrangement They are not only a sore evil but of long continuance Adhesiveness seems to be the head and front the bones and the blood of their creed It is not the direction of the quality but the quality itself which they swear by Only stick it is no matter what you stick to Fall out with a man and you can kiss and be friends as soon as you like the recording angel will set it down on the credit side of his books Fall in and you are expected to stay in ad infinitum ad nauseam No matter what combination of laws got you there there you are and there you must stay for better for worse till merciful death you do part or you are fickle You find a man entertaining for an hour a week a concert a journey and presto you are saddled with him forever What preposterous absurdity Do but look at it calmly You are thrown into contact with a person and as in duty bound you proceed to fathom him for every man is a possible revelation In the deeps of his soul there may lie unknown worlds for you Consequently you proceed at once to experiment on him It takes a little while to get your tackle in order Then the line begins to run off rapidly and your eager soul cries out Ah what depth What perpetual calmness must be down below What rest is here for all my tumult What a grand vast nature is this Surely surely you are on the high seas Surely you will not float serenely down the eternities But by and by there is a kink You find that though the line runs off so fast it does not go down it only floats out A current has caught it and bears it on horizontally It does not sink plumb You have been deceived Your grand Pacific Ocean is nothing but a shallow little brook that you can ford all the year round if it does not utterly dry up in the summer heats when you want it most or at best it is a fussy little tormenting river that won t and can t sail a sloop What are you going to do about it You are going to wind up your lead and line shoulder your birch canoe as the old sea kings used and thrid the deep forests and scale the purple hills till you come to water again when you will unroll your lead and line for another essay Is that fickleness What else can you do Must you launch your bark on the unquiet stream against whose pebbly bottom the keel continually grates and rasps your nerves simply that your reputation suffer no detriment Fickleness There is no fickleness about it You were trying an experiment which you had every right to try As soon as you were satisfied you stopped If you had stopped sooner you would have been unsatisfied If you had stopped later you would have been dissatisfied It is a criminal contempt of the magnificent possibilities of life not to lay hold of God s occasions floating by It is an equally criminal perversion of them to cling tenaciously to what was only the simulacrum of an occasion A man will toil many days and nights among the mountains to find an ingot of gold which found he bears home with infinite pains and just rejoicing but he would be a fool who should lade his mules with iron pyrites to justify his labors however severe Fickleness what is it that we make such an ado about it And what is constancy that it commands such usurious interest The one is a foible only in its relations The other is only thus a virtue Fickle as the winds is our death seal upon a man but should we like our winds unfickle Would a perpetual northeaster lay us open to perpetual gratitude or is a soft south gale to be orisoned and vespered forevermore I am tired of this eternal prating of devotion and constancy It is senseless in itself and harmful in its tendencies The dictate of reason is to treat men and women as we do oranges Suck all the juice out and then let them go Where is the good of keeping the peel and pulp cells till they get old dry and mouldy Let them go and they will help feed the earth worms and bugs and beetles who can hardly find existence a continued banquet and fertilize the earth which will have you give before you receive Thus they will ultimately spring up in new and beautiful shapes Clung to with constancy they stain your knife and napkin impart a bad odor to your dining room and degenerate into something that is neither pleasant to the eye nor good for food I believe in a rotation of crops morally and socially as well as agriculturally When you have taken the measure of a man when you have sounded him and know that you can not wade in him more than ankle deep when you have got out of him all that he has to yield for your soul s sustenance and strength what is the next thing to be done Obviously pass him on and turn you to fresh woods and pastures new Do you work him an injury By no means Friends that are simply glued on and don t grow out of are little worth He has nothing more for you nor you for him but he may be rich in juices wherewithal to nourish the heart of another man and their two lives set together may have an endosmose and exosmose whose result shall be richness of soil grandeur of growth beauty of foliage and perfectness of fruit while you and he would only have languished into aridity and a stunted crab tree For my part I desire to sweep off my old friends with the old year and begin the new with a clean record It is a measure absolutely necessary The snake does not put on his new skin over the old one He sloughs off the first before he dons the second He would be a very clumsy serpent if he did not One can not have successive layers of friendships any more than the snake has successive layers of skins One must adopt some system to guard against a congestion of the heart from plethora of loves I go in for the much abused fair weather skin deep April shower friends the friends who will drop off if let alone who must be kept awake to be kept at all who will talk and laugh with you as long as it suits your respective humors and you are prosperous and happy the blessed butterfly race who flutter about your June mornings and when the clouds lower and the drops patter and the rains descend and the winds blow will spread their gay wings and float gracefully away to sunny southern lands where the skies are yet blue and the breezes violet scented They are not only agreeable but deeply wise So long as a man keeps his streamer flying his sails set and his hull above water it is pleasant to paddle alongside but when the sails split the yards crack and the keel goes staggering down by all means paddle off Why should you be submerged in his whirlpool Will he drown any more easily because you are drowning with him Lung is lung He dies from want of air not from want of sympathy When a poor fellow sits down among the ashes the best thing his friends can do is to stand afar off Job bore the loss of property children health with equanimity Satan himself found his match there and for all his buffeting Job sinned not nor charged God foolishly But Job s three friends must needs make an appointment together to come and mourn with him and to comfort him and after this Job opened his mouth and cursed his day and no wonder Your friends have an intimate knowledge of you that is astonishing to contemplate It is not that they know your affairs which he who runs may read but they know you From a bit of bone Cuvier could predicate a whole animal even to the hide and hair Such moral naturalists are your dear five hundred friends It seems to yourself that you are immeasurably reticent You know of a certainty that you project only the smallest possible fragment of yourself You yield your universality to the bond of common brotherhood but your individualism what it is that makes you you withdraws itself naturally involuntarily inevitably into the background the dim distance which their eyes can not penetrate But from the fraction which you do project they construct another you call it by your name and pass it around for the real the actual you You bristle with jest and laughter and wild whims to keep them at a distance and they fancy this to be your every day equipment They think your life holds constant carnival It is astonishing what ideas spring up in the heads of sensible people There are those who assume that a person can never have had any grief unless somebody has died or he has been disappointed in love not knowing that every avenue of joy lies open to the tramp of pain They see the flashing coronet on the queen s brow and they infer a diamond woman not recking of the human heart that throbs wildly out of sight They see the foam crest on the wave and picture an Atlantic Ocean of froth and not the solemn sea that stands below in eternal equipoise You turn to them the luminous crescent of your life and they call it the whole round globe and so they love you with a love that is agate not pearl because what they love in you is something infinitely below the highest They love you level they have never scaled your heights nor fathomed your depths And when they talk of you as familiarly as if they had taken out your auricles and ventricles and turned them inside out and wrung them and shaken them when they prate of your transparency and openness the abandonment with which you draw aside the curtain and reveal the inmost thoughts of your heart you who are to yourself a miracle and a mystery you smile inwardly and are content They are on the wrong scent and you may pursue your plans in peace They are indiscriminate and satisfied They do not know the relation of what appears to what is If they chance to skirt along the coasts of your Purple Island it will be only chance and they will not know it You may close your port holes lower your drawbridge and make merry for they will never come within gunshot of the round tower of your heart There is no such thing as knowing a man intimately Every soul is for the greater part of its mortal life isolated from every other Whether it dwell in the Garden of Eden or the Desert of Sahara it dwells alone Not only do we jostle against the street crowd unknowing and unknown but we go out and come in we lie down and rise up with strangers Jupiter and Neptune sweep the heavens not more unfamiliar to us than the worlds that circle our own hearthstone Day after day and year after year a person moves by your side he sits at the same table he reads the same books he kneels in the same church You know every hair of his head every trick of his lips every tone of his voice you can tell him far off by his gait Without seeing him you recognize his step his knock his laugh Know him Yes I have known him these twenty years No you don t know him You know his gait and hair and voice You know what preacher he hears what ticket he voted and what were his last year s expenses but you don t know him He sits quietly in his chair but he is in the temple You speak to him his soul comes out into the vestibule to answer you and returns and the gates are shut therein you can not enter You were discussing the state of the country but when you ceased he opened a postern gate went down a bank and launched on a sea over whose waters you have no boat to sail no star to guide You have loved and reverenced him He has been your concrete of truth and nobleness Unwittingly you touch a secret spring and a Blue Beard chamber stands revealed You give no sign you meet and part as usual but a Dead Sea rolls between you two forevermore It must be so Not even to the nearest and dearest can one unveil the secret place where his soul abideth so that there shall be no more any winding ways or hidden chambers but to your indifferent neighbor what blind alleys and deep caverns and inaccessible mountains To him who touches the electric chain wherewith you re darkly bound your soul sends back an answering thrill One little window is opened and there is short parley Your ships speak each other now and then in welcome though imperfect communication but immediately you strike out again into the great shoreless sea over which you must sail forever alone You may shrink from the far reaching solitudes of your heart but no other foot than yours can tread them save those That eighteen hundred years ago were nailed For our advantage to the bitter cross Be thankful that it is so that only His eye sees whose hand formed If we could look in we should be appalled at the vision The worlds that glide around us are mysteries too high for us We can not attain to them The naked soul is a sight too awful for man to look at and live There are individuals whose topography we would like to know a little better and there is danger that we crash against each other while roaming around in the dark but for all that would we not have the constitution broken up Somebody says In Heaven there will be no secrets which it seems to me would be intolerable If that were a revelation from the King of Heaven of course I would not speak flippantly of it but though towards Heaven we look with reverence and humble hope I do not know that Tom Dick and Harry s notions of it have any special claim to our respect Such publicity would destroy all individuality and undermine the foundations of society Clairvoyance if there be any such thing always seemed to me a stupid impertinence When people pay visits to me I wish them to come to the front door and ring the bell and send up their names I don t wish them to climb in at the window or creep through the pantry or worst of all float through the key hole and catch me in undress So I believe that in all worlds thoughts will be the subjects of volition more accurately expressed when expression is desired but just as entirely suppressed when we will suppression After all perhaps the chief trouble arises from a prevalent confusion of ideas as to what constitutes a man your friend Friendship may stand for that peaceful complacence which you feel towards all well behaved people who wear clean collars and use tolerable grammar This is a very good meaning if everybody will subscribe to it But sundry of these well behaved people will mistake your civility and complacence for a recognition of special affinity and proceed at once to frame an alliance offensive and defensive while the sun and the moon shall endure O the barnacles that cling to your keel in such waters The inevitable result is that they win your intense rancor You would feel a genial kindliness toward them if they would be satisfied with that but they lay out to be your specialty They infer your innocent little inch to be the standard bearer of twenty ells and goad you to frenzy I mean you you desperate little horror who nearly dethroned my reason six years ago I always meant to have my revenge and here I impale you before the public For three months you fastened yourself upon me and I could not shake you off What availed it me that you were an honest and excellent man Did I not twenty times a day wish you had been a villain who had insulted me and I a Kentucky giant that I might have the unspeakable satisfaction of knocking you down But you added to your crimes virtue Villainy had no part or lot in you You were a member of a church in good and regular standing you had graduated with all the honors worth mentioning you had not a sin a vice or a fault that I knew of and you were so thoroughly good and repulsive that you were a great grief to me Do you think you dear disinterested wretch that I have forgotten how you were continually putting yourself to horrible inconveniences on my account Do you think I am not now filled with remorse for the aversion that rooted itself ineradicably in my soul and which now gloats over you as you stand in the pillory where my own hands have fastened you But can nature be crushed forever Did I not ruin my nerves and seriously injure my temper by the overpowering pressure I laid upon them to keep them quiet when you were by Could I not by the sense of coming ill through all my quivering frame presage your advent as exactly as the barometer heralds the approaching storm Those three months of agony are little atoned for by this late vengeance but go in peace Mysterious are the ways of friendship It is not a matter of reason or of choice but of magnetisms You can not always give the premises nor the argument but the conclusion is a palpable and stubborn fact Abana and Pharpar may be broad and deep and blue and grand but only in Jordan shall your soul wash and be clean A thousand brooks are born of the sunshine and the mountains very very few are they whose flow can mingle with yours and not disturb but only deepen and broaden the current Your friend Who shall describe him or worthily paint what he is to you No merchant nor lawyer nor farmer nor statesman claims your suffrage but a kingly soul He comes to you from God a prophet a seer a revealer He has a clear vision His love is reverence He goes into the penetralia of your life not presumptuously but with uncovered head unsandaled feet and pours libations at the innermost shrine His incense is grateful For him the sunlight brightens the skies grow rosy and all the days are Junes Wrapped in his love you float in a delicious rest rocked in the bosom of purple scented waves Nameless melodies sing themselves through your heart A golden glow suffices your atmosphere A vague fine ecstasy thrills to the sources of life and earth lays hold on Heaven Such friendship is worship It elevates the most trifling services into rites The humblest offices are sanctified All things are baptized into a new name Duty is lost in joy Care veils itself in caresses Drudgery becomes delight There is no longer anything menial small or servile All is transformed Into something rich and strange The homely household ways lead through beds of spices and orchards of pomegranates The daily toil among your parsnips and carrots is plucking May violets with the dew upon them to meet the eyes you love upon their first awaking In the burden and heat of the day you hear the rustling of summer showers and the whispering of summer winds Everything is lifted up from the plane of labor to the plane of love and a glory spans your life With your friend speech and silence are one for a communion mysterious and intangible reaches across from heart to heart The many dig and delve in your nature with fruitless toil to find the spring of living water he only raises his wand and obedient to the hidden power it bends at once to your secret Your friendship though independent of language gives to it life and light The mystic spirit stirs even in commonplaces and the merest question is an endearment You are quiet because your heart is over full You talk because it is pleasant not because you have anything to say You weary of terms that are already love laden and you go out into the highways and hedges and gather up the rough wild wilful words heavy with the hatreds of men and fill them to the brim with honey dew All things great and small grand or humble you press into your service force them to do soldier s duty and your banner over them is love With such a friendship presence alone is happiness nor is absence wholly void for memories and hopes and pleasing fancies sparkle through the hours and you know the sunshine will come back For such friendship one is grateful No matter that it comes unsought and comes not for the seeking You do not discuss the reasonableness of your gratitude You only know that your whole being bows with humility and utter thankfulness to him who thus crowns you monarch of all realms And the kingdom is everlasting A weak love dies weakly with the occasion that gave it birth but such friendship is born of the gods and immortal Clouds and darkness may sweep around it but within the cloud the glory lives undimmed Death has no power over it Time can not diminish nor even dishonor annul it Its direction may have been earthly but itself is divine You go back into your solitudes all is silent as aforetime but you can not forget that a Voice once resounded there A Presence filled the valleys and gilded the mountain tops breathed upon the plains and they sprang up in lilies and roses flashed upon the waters and they flowed to spheral melody swept through the forests and they too trembled into song And though now the warmth has faded out though the ruddy tints and amber clearness have paled to ashen hues though the murmuring melodies are dead and forest vale and hill look hard and angular in the sharp air you know that it is not death The fire is unquenched beneath You go your way not disconsolate There needs but the Victorious Voice At the touch of the prince s lips life shall rise again and be perfected forevermore PONCHUS PILUT BY JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY

her friend that it would have been at once and most truthfully surmised that the getting of Hiram had been a more than slight labor missus Lathrop was waiting by the fence impatience written with a wandering reflection all over the serenity of her every day expression Susan only waited to lay aside her bonnet and mitts and then hastened to the fence herself missus Lathrop you never saw nor heard the like of this weddin day in all your own days to be or to come and I don t suppose there ever will be anything like it again for Lucy Dill didn t cut no figger in her own weddin a tall the whole thing was Gran ma Mullins first last and forever hereafter I tell you it looked once or twice as if it wouldn t be a earthly possibility to marry Hiram away from his mother and now that it s all over people can t do anything but say as after all Lucy ought to consider herself very lucky as things turned out for if things hadn t turned out as they did turn out I don t believe anything on earth could have unhooked that son and I m willin to swear that anywhere to any one Do you know missus Lathrop that Gran ma Mullins was so bad off last night as they had to put a mustard plaster onto her while Hiram went to see Lucy for the last time an missus Macy says as she never hear the beat o her memory for she says she ll take her Bible oath as Gran ma Mullins told her what Hiram said and done every minute o his life while he was gone to see Lucy Dill And she cried too and took on the whole time she was talkin an said Heaven help her for nobody else could an she just knowed Lucy d get tired o Hiram s story an he can t be happy a whole day without he tells it an she s most sure Lucy won t like his singin Marchin Through Georgia after the first month or two an it s the only tune as Hiram has ever really took to missus Macy says she soon found she couldn t do nothin to stem the tide except to drink tea an listen so she drank an listened till Hiram come home about eleven Oh my but she says they had the time then Gran ma Mullins let him in herself and just as soon as he was in she bu saint into floods of tears an wouldn t let him loose under no consideration She says Hiram managed to get his back to the wall for a brace cause Gran ma Mullins nigh to upset him every fresh time as Lucy come over her an missus Macy says she couldn t but wonder what the end was goin to be when toward midnight Hiram just lost patience and dodged out under her arm and run up the ladder to the roof room an they couldn t get him to come down again She says when Gran ma Mullins realized as he wouldn t come down she most went mad over the notion of her only son s spendin the Christmas Eve to his own weddin sleepin on the floor o the attic and she wanted to poke the cot up to him but missus Macy says she drew the line at cot pokin when the cot was all she d have to sleep on herself and in the end they poked quilts up an pillows an doughnuts an cider an blankets an Hiram made a bed on the floor an they all got to sleep about three o clock Well missus Lathrop what do you think What do you think They was so awful tired that none of em woke till missus Sperrit come at eleven next day to take em to the weddin missus Macy says she hopes she ll be put forward all her back slidin s if she ever gets such a start again She says when she peeked out between the blinds an see missus Sperrit s Sunday bonnet an realized her own state she nearly had a fit missus Sperrit had to come in an be explained to an the worst of it was as Hiram couldn t be woke nohow He d pulled the ladder up after him an put the lid on the hole so s to feel safe an there he was snug as a bug in a rug an where no human bein could get at him They hollered an banged doors an sharpened the carvin knife an poured grease on the stove an did anything they could think of but he never budged missus Macy says she never was so close beside herself in all her life before for Gran ma Mullins cried worse n ever each minute an Hiram seemed like the very dead couldn t wake him They was all hoppin around half crazy when mister Sperrit come along on his way to the weddin an his wife run out an told him what was the matter an he come right in an looked up at the matter It didn t take long for him to unsettle Hiram missus Macy says He got a sulphur candle an tied it to a stick an h isted the lid with another stick an in less n two minutes they could all hear Hiram sneezin an comin to An missus Macy says when they hollered what time it was she wishes the whole town might have been there to see Hiram Mullins come down to earth mister Sperrit didn t hardly have time to get out o the way an he didn t give his mother no show for one single grab he just bounced into his room and you could have heard him gettin dressed on the far side o the far bridge O course us at Lucy s didn t know anythin a tall about missus Macy s troubles We had our own Heaven help us an they was enough for the very first thing of all mister Dill caught his pocket on the corner of missus Dill an come within a ace of pullin her off her easel That would have been a pretty beginnin to Lucy s weddin day if her father had smashed her mother to bits I guess but it couldn t have made Lucy any worse for I will say missus Lathrop as I never see no one in all my born life act foolisher than Lucy Dill this day First she d laugh an then she d cry an then she d lose suthin as we d got to have to work with An when it come to dressin her well if she d known as Hiram was sleepin a sleep as next to knowed no wakin she couldn t have put on more things wrong side out an hind side before She wasn t dressed till most every one was there an I was gettin pretty anxious for Hiram wasn t there neither an the more fidgety people got the more they caught their corners on missus Dill I just saved her from mister Kimball an Amelia saw her goin as a result o Judge Fitch an hardly had time for a jump The minister himself was beginnin to cough when all of a sudden some one cried as the Sperrits was there Well we all squeezed to the window an such a sight you never saw They was gettin Gran ma Mullins out an Hiram was tryin to keep her from runnin the color of his cravat all down his shirt while she was sobbin Hi i i i ram Hi i i i i ram in a voice as would wring your very heart dry They got her out an got her in an got her upstairs an we all sat down an begin to get ready while Amelia played Lead Kindly Light and The Joyous Farmer alternate cause she d mislaid her Weddin March Well missus Lathrop you never knowed nothin like it we waited an we waited an we waited an the minister most coughed himself into consumption an missus Dill got caught on so often that mister Kimball told Ed to stand back of her an hold her to the easel every minute Amelia was just beginning over again for the seventeenth time when at last we heard em bumpin along downstairs Seems as all the delay come from Lucy s idea o wantin to walk with her father an have a weddin procession instid o her an Hiram comin in together like Christians an lettin mister Dill hold Gran ma Mullins up anywhere Polly says she never see such a time as they had of it she says fightin wolves was layin lambs beside the way they talked Hiram said frank an open as the reason he didn t want to walk in with his mother was he was sure she wouldn t let him out to get married but Lucy was dead set on the procession idea So in the end they done it so an Gran ma Mullins s sobs fairly shook the house as they come through the dinin room door Lucy was first with her father an they both had their heads turned backward lookin at Hiram an his mother Well missus Lathrop it was certainly a sight worth seem The way that Gran ma Mullins was glued on All I can say is as octopuses has got their backs turned in comparison to the way that Hiram seemed to be all wrapped up in her It looked like wild horses not to speak of Lucy Dill wouldn t never be able to get him loose enough to marry him The minister was scared we was all scared I never see a worse situation to be in They come along through the back parlor Lucy lookin back mister Dill white as a sheet an Hiram walkin like a snow plough as isn t sure how long it can keep on makin it It seemed like a month as they was under way before they finally got stopped in front o the minister An then come the time Hiram had to step beside Lucy an take her hand an he couldn t We all just gasped There was Hiram tryin to get loose and mister Dill tryin to help him Gran ma Mullins s tears dripped till you could hear em but she hung on to Hiram like he d paid for it They worked like Trojan beavers but as fast as they d get one side of him uncovered she d take a fresh wind round I tell you we all just held our breath and I bet Lucy was sorry she persisted in havin a procession when she see the perspiration runnin off her father an Hiram Finally Polly got frightened and begun to cry an at that the deacon put his arm around her an give her a hug an Gran ma Mullins looked up just in time to see the arm an the hug It seemed like it was the last hay in the donkey for she give a weak screech an went right over on mister Dill She had such a grip on Hiram that if it hadn t been for Lucy he d have gone over too but Lucy just hung on herself that time an Hiram was rescued without nothin worse than his hair mussed an one sleeve a little tore mister Sperrit an mister Jilkins carried Gran ma Mullins into the dinin room an I said to just leave her fainted till after we d got Hiram well an truly married so they did I never see the minister rattle nothin through like that marriage service Every one was on whole papers of pins an needles an the minute it was over every one just felt like sittin right straight down missus Macy an me went up an watered Gran ma Mullins till we brought her to and when she learned as it was all done she picked up wonderful and felt as hungry as any one an come downstairs an kissed Lucy an caught a corner on missus Dill just like she d never been no trouble to no one from first to last I never seen such a sudden change in all my life it was like some miracle had come out all over her and there wasn t no one there as wasn t rejoiced to death over the change We all went out in the dinin room and the sun shone in and every one laughed over nothin a tall missus Sperrit pinned Hiram up from inside so his tear didn t show and Lucy and he set side by side and looked like no one was ever goin to ever be married again Polly an the deacon set opposite and the minister an his wife an mister Dill an Gran ma Mullins made up the table The rest stood around and we was all as lively as words can tell The cake was one o the handsomest as I ever see two pigeons peckin a bell on top and Hiram an Lucy runnin around below in pink There was a dime inside an a ring an I got the dime an they must have forgot to put in the ring for no one got it Susan paused and panted It was commented missus Lathrop thoughtfully Nice that I got the dime yes I should say There certainly wasn t no one there as needed it worse an although I d never be one to call a dime a fortune still it is a dime an no one can t deny it the honor no matter how they feel But missus Lathrop what you d ought to have seen was Hiram and Lucy ready to go off I bet no one knows they re brides I bet no one knows what they are you never saw the like in all your worst dreams Hiram wore spectacles an carpet slippers an that old umbrella as mister Shores keeps at the store to keep from bein stole and Lucy wore clothes she d found in trunks an her hair in curl papers an her cold cream gloves They certainly was a sight an Gran ma Mullins laughed as hard as any one over them mister Sperrit drove em to the train an Hiram says he s goin to spend two dollars a day right along till he comes back so I guess Lucy ll have a good time for once in her life An Gran ma Mullins walked back with me an not one word o Hiram did she speak She was all Polly an the deacon She said it wa n t in reason as Polly could imagine him with hair an she said she was thinkin very seriously o givin her a piece o his hair as she s got for a weddin present She said Polly d never know what he was like the night he give her that hair She said the moon was shinin an the frogs were croakin an she kind o choked she says she can t smell a marsh to this day without seein the deacon givin her that piece of hair I cheered her up all I could I told her anyhow he couldn t give Polly a piece of his hair if he died for it She smiled a weak smile an went on up to missus Brown s missus Brown asked her to stay with her a day or two missus Brown has her faults but nobody can t deny as she s got a good heart in fact sometimes I think missus Brown s good heart is about the worst fault she s got I ve knowed it lead her to do very foolish things time an again things as I thank my star I d never think o doin not in this world missus Lathrop shifted her elbows a little Susan withdrew at once from the fence I must go in she said to morrow is goin to be a more n full day There s Polly s weddin an then in the evenin mister Weskin is comin up You needn t look surprised missus Lathrop because I ve thought the subject over up an down an hind end foremost an there ain t nothin left for me to do I can t sell nothin else an I ve got to have money so I m goin to let go of one of those bonds as father left me There ain t no way out of it I told mister Weskin I d expect him at sharp eight on sharp business an he ll come An I must go as a consequence Good night Polly Allen s wedding took place the next day and missus Lathrop came out on her front piazza about half past five to wait for her share in the event The sight of missus Brown going by with her head bound up in a white cloth accompanied by Gran ma Mullins with both hands similarly treated was the first inkling the stay at home had that strange doings had been lately done Susan came next and Susan was a sight Not only did her ears stand up with a size and conspicuousness never inherited from either her father or her mother but also her right eye was completely closed and she walked lame The Lord have mercy cried missus Lathrop when the full force of her friend s affliction effected its complete entrance into her brain Why Susan what missus Lathrop said Miss Clegg all I can say is I come out better than the most of em an if you could see Sam Duruy or mister Kimball or the minister you d know I spoke the truth The deacon an Polly is both in bed an can t see how each other looks an them as has a eye is goin to tend them as can t see at all an God help em all if young doctor Brown an the mud run dry with which pious ejaculation Susan painfully mounted the steps and sat down with exceeding gentleness upon a chair missus Lathrop stared at her in dumb and wholly bewildered amazement After a while Miss Clegg continued It was all the deacon s fault Him an Polly was so dead set on bein fashionable an bein a contrast to Hiram an Lucy an I hope to night as they lay there all puffed up as they ll reflect on their folly an think a little on how the rest of us as didn t care rhyme or reason for folly is got no choice but to puff up too missus Jilkins is awful mad she says mister Jilkins wanted to wear his straw hat anyhow and she says she always has hated his silk hat cause it reminds her o when she was young and foolish enough to be willin to go and marry into a family as was foolish enough to marry into Deacon White missus Jilkins is extra hot because she got one in the neck but my own idea is as Polly Allen s weddin was the silliest doin s as I ever see from the beginnin an the end wan t no more than might o been expected all things considered When I got to the church what do you think was the first thing as I see missus Lathrop Well you d never guess till kingdom come so I may as well tell you It was Ed an Sam Duruy an Henry Ward Beecher an Johnny standin there waitin to show us to our pews like we didn t know our own pews after sittin in em for all our life times I just shook my head an walked to my pew an there if it wasn t looped shut with a daisy chain Well missus Lathrop I wish you could have been there to have felt for me for I may remark as a cyclone is a caterpillar wove up in hisself beside my face when I see myself daisy chained out o my own pew by Polly Allen Ed was behind me an he whispered That s reserved for the family I give him one look an I will state missus Lathrop as he wilted It didn t take me long to break that daisy chain an sit down in that pew an I can assure you as no one asked me to get up again missus Jilkins s cousins from Meadville come an looked at me sittin there but I give them jus one look back an they went an sat with missus Macy themselves A good many other folks was as surprised as me over where they had to sit but we soon had other surprises as took the taste o the first clean out o our mouths Just as missus Davison begin to play the organ Ed an Johnny come down with two clothes lines wound round with clematis an tied us all in where we sat Then they went back an we all stayed still an couldn t but wonder what under the sun was to be done to us next But we didn t have long to wait an I will say as anythin to beat Polly s ideas I never see no nor no one else neither Long down the aisle two an two an hand in hand like they thought they was suthin pretty to look at come Ed an Johnny an Henry Ward Beecher an Sam Duruy an I vow an declare missus Lathrop I never was so nigh to laughin in church in all my life They knowed they was funny too an their mouths an eyes was tight set sober but some one in the back just had to giggle an when we heard it we knew as things as wasn t much any other day would use us up this day sure They stopped in front an lined up two on a side an then for all the world like it was a machine play the little door opened an out come the minister an solemnly walked down to between them I must say we was all more than a little disappointed at its only bein the minister an he must have felt our feelin s for he began to cough an clear up his throat an his little desk all at once Then missus Davison jerked out the loud stop an began to play for all she was worth an the door behind banged an every one turned aroun to see Well missus Lathrop we saw an I will in truth remark as such a sawin we ll never probably get a chance to do again missus Sweet says they practised it over four times at the church so they can t deny as they meant it all an you might lay me crossways an cut me into chipped beef an still I would declare as I wouldn t have the face to own to havin had any hand in plannin any such weddin First come Liza Em ly an Rachel Rebecca hand in hand carryin daisies of all things in the world to take to a weddin an then come Brunhilde Susan with a daisy chain around her neck an her belt stuck full o daisies an you can believe me or not jus as you please missus Lathrop an still it won t help matters any an a daisy stuck in every button down her back an daisies tangled up in her hair an a bunch o daisies under one arm Well we was nigh to overcome by Brunhilde Susan but we drawed some fresh breath an kept on lookin an next come Polly an mister Allen I will say for mister Allen as he seemed to feel the ridiculousness of it all for a redder man I never see nor one as looked more uncomfortable He was daisied too had three in his button hole but what took us all was the way him an Polly walked I bet no people gettin married ever zig zagged like that before an missus Sweet says they practised it by countin two an then swingin out to one side an then countin two an swingin out to the other she watched em out of her attic window down through the broke blind to the church Well all I can say is that to my order o thinkin countin an swingin is a pretty frame o mind to get a husband in but so it was an we was all starin our eyes off to beat the band when the little door opened an to crown everythin else out come the deacon an mister Jilkins each with a daisy an a silk hat an I will remark missus Lathrop as new born kittens is blood red murderers compared to how innocent that hat o mister Jilkins looked Any one could see as it wasn t new but he wasn t new either as far as that goes an that was what struck me in particular about the whole thing nothin an nobody wasn t any different only for Polly s foolishness and the daisies Well they sorted out an begun to get married an us all sittin lookin on an no more guessin what was comin next than a ant looks for a mornin paper The minister was gettin most through an the deacon was gettin out the ring an we was lookin to get up an out pretty quick when my heavens alive missus Lathrop I never will forget that minute when mister Jilkins poor man he s sufferin enough for it Lord knows when mister Jilkins dropped his hat That very next second him an Ed an Brunhilde Susan all hopped an yelled at once an the next thing we see was the minister droppin his book an grabbin his arm an the deacon tryin madly to do hisself up in Polly s veil We would a all been glum petrified at such goin s on any other day only by that time the last one of us was feelin to hop and grab an yell on his own account Gran ma Mullins was tryin to slap herself with the seat cushion an the way the daisies flew as folks went over an under that clematis rope was a caution I got out as quick as I But what interrupted missus Lathrop her eyes fairly marble like in their redundant curiosity It was wasps said Susan it was a young wasps nest in mister Jilkins s hat Seems they carried their hats to church in their hands cause Polly didn t want no red rings around em an so he never suspected nothin till he dropped it An oh poor little Brunhilde Susan in them short skirts of hers she might as well have wore a bee hive as to be like she is now I got off easy an you can look at me an figure on what them as got it hard has got on them Young doctor Brown went right to work with mud an Polly s veil an plastered em over as fast as they could get into missus Sweet s missus Sweet was mighty obligin an turned two flower beds inside out an let every one scoop with her kitchen spoons besides runnin aroun herself like she was a slave gettin paid They took the deacon an Polly right to their own house They can t see one another anyhow an they was most all married anyway so it didn t seem worth while to wait till the minister gets the use of his upper lip again Why interrogated missus Lathrop Young doctor Brown wanted to said Susan he wanted to fill my ears with mud an my eye too but I didn t feel to have it done You can t die o wasps bills an you can o young doctor Brown s leastways when you ain t got no money to pay em like I ain t got just at present It s said missus Lathrop Yes said Susan it struck me that way too This seems to be a very unlucky town Anything as comes seems to catch us all in a bunch The cow most lamed the whole community an the automobile most broke its back time ll tell what ll be the result o these wasps but there won t be no church Sunday for one thing I know An it ain t the least o my woes missus Lathrop to think as I ve got to sit an smile on mister Weskin to night from between two such ears as I ve got for a man is a man an it can t be denied as a woman as is mainly ears ain t beguilin Besides I may in confidence state to you missus Lathrop as the one as buzzed aroun my head wan t really no wasp a tall in comparison to the one as got under my skirts missus Lathrop s eyes were full of sincere condolence she did not even imagine a smile as she gazed upon her afflicted friend I must go said the latter rising with a groan seems like I never will reach the bottom o my troubles this year I keep thinkin there s nothin left an then I get a wasp at each end at once Well I ll come over when mister Weskin goes if I have strength Then she limped home It was about nine that night that she returned and pounded vigorously on her friend s window pane missus Lathrop woke from her rocker nap went to the window and opened it Susan stood below and the moon illuminated her smile and her ears with its most silvery beams He s just gone she announced Yes said missus Lathrop rubbing her eyes He s gone I come over to tell you What said missus Lathrop I wouldn t care if my ears was as big as a elephant s now Why asked missus Lathrop missus Lathrop you know as I took them bonds straight after father died an locked em up an I ain t never unlocked em since missus Lathrop assented with a single rapt nod Well when I explained to mister Weskin as I d got to have money an how was the best way to sell a bond he just looked at me an what do you think he said what do you think he said missus Lathrop missus Lathrop hung far out over the window sill her gaze was the gaze of the ever earnest and interested Susan stood below Her face was aglow with the joy of the affluent her very voice might have been for once entitled as silvery He said missus Lathrop he said Miss Clegg why don t you go down to the bank and cut your coupons THE TWO PRISONERS BY CAROLYN WELLS Once upon a time there were two Prisoners at the bar who endeavored to plead for themselves with Tact and Wisdom One concealed certain Facts prejudicial to his Cause upon which the Judge said If you had Confessed the Truth it would have Biased me in your Favor as it is I Condemn you to Punishment The other stated his Case

And I came down the bank and called to you Waved you my hand and asked to come aboard And threw you kisses there what would you do Would there be such a crowd of other girls Pleading and pale and lonely as the sea You d growl in your old beard and shake your curls And say there was no room for little me Would you remember each of them in turn Put all your faded fancies in the bow And all the rest before you in the stern And row them out with panic on your brow If I came down and offered you my fare And more beside could you refuse me there HE If I were ferryman in Charon s place And ran that crazy scow with perilous skill I should be so worn out with keeping trace Of gibbering ghosts and bidding them sit still If you should come with daisies in your hands Strewing their petals on the

smiling bride was led She didn t come a wink too soon Nor make too long a stay But now I often wish her folks Had kept the girl away I remember I remember Her dresses red and white Her bonnets and her caps and cloaks They cost an awful sight The corner lot on which I built And where my brother met At first my wife one washing day That man is single yet I remember I remember Where I was used to court And thought that all of married life Was just such pleasant sport My spirit flew in feathers then No care was on my brow I scarce could wait to shut the gate I m not so anxious now I remember I

in serving his country as a soldier and going to visit Reuben on the morning of his return home they hide the bonds under the carpet of the sitting room and leave the house in charge of Taddy another adopted son mister Ducklow had scarcely turned the corner of the street when looking anxiously in the direction of his homestead he saw a column of smoke It was directly over the spot where he knew his house to be situated He guessed at a glance what had happened The frightful catastrophe he foreboded had befallen Taddy had set the house afire Them bonds them bonds he exclaimed distractedly He did not think so much of the house house and furniture were insured if they were burned the inconvenience would be great indeed and at any other time the thought of such an event would have been a sufficient cause for trepidation but now his chief his only anxiety was the bonds They were not insured They would be a dead loss And what added sharpness to his pangs they would be a loss which he must keep a secret as he had kept their existence a secret a loss which he could not confess and of which he could not complain Had he not just given his neighbors to understand that he had no such property And his wife was she not at that very moment if not serving up a lie upon the subject at least paring the truth very thin indeed A man would think observed Ferring that Ducklow had some o them bonds on his hands and got scaret he took such a sudden start He has hasn t he missus Ducklow Has what said missus Ducklow pretending ignorance Some o them cowpon bonds I rather guess he s got some You mean Gov ment bonds Ducklow got some Tain t at all likely he d spec late in them without saying something to me about it No he couldn t have any without my knowing it I m sure How demure how innocent she looked plying her knitting needle and stopping to take up a stitch How little at that moment she knew of Ducklow s trouble and its terrible cause Ducklow s first impulse was to drive on and endeavor at all hazards to snatch the bonds from the flames His next was to return and alarm his neighbors and obtain their assistance But a minute s delay might be fatal so he drove on screaming Fire fire at the top of his voice But the old mare was a slow footed animal and Ducklow had no whip He reached forward and struck her with the reins Git up git up Fire fire screamed Ducklow Oh them bonds them bonds Why didn t I give the money to Reuben Fire fire fire By dint of screaming and slapping he urged her from a trot into a gallop which was scarcely an improvement as to speed and certainly not as to grace It was like the gallop of an old cow Why don t ye go long he cried despairingly Slap slap He knocked his own hat off with the loose end of the reins It fell under the wheels He cast one look behind to satisfy himself that it had been very thoroughly run over and crushed into the dirt and left it to its fate Slap slap Fire fire Canter canter canter Neighbors looked out of their windows and recognizing Ducklow s wagon and old mare in such an astonishing plight and Ducklow himself without his hat rising from his seat and reaching forward in wild attitudes brandishing the reins and at the same time rending the azure with yells thought he must be insane He drove to the top of the hill and looking beyond in expectation of seeing his house wrapped in flames discovered that the smoke proceeded from a brush heap which his neighbor Atkins was burning in a field near by The revulsion of feeling that ensued was almost too much for the excitable Ducklow His strength went out of him For a little while there seemed to be nothing left of him but tremor and cold sweat Difficult as it had been to get the old mare in motion it was now even more difficult to stop her Why what has got into Ducklow s old mare She s running away with him Who ever heard of such a thing And Atkins watching the ludicrous spectacle from his field became almost as weak from laughter as Ducklow was from the effects of fear At length Ducklow succeeded in checking the old mare s speed and in turning her about It was necessary to drive back for his hat By this time he could hear a chorus of shouts Fire fire fire over the hill He had aroused the neighbors as he passed and now they were flocking to extinguish the flames A false alarm a false alarm said Ducklow looking marvelously sheepish as he met them Nothing but Atkins s brush heap Seems to me you ought to have found that out fore you raised all creation with your yells said one hyperbolical fellow You looked like the Flying Dutchman This your hat I thought twas a dead cat in the road No fire no fire turning back to his comrades only one of Ducklow s jokes Nevertheless two or three boys there were who would not be convinced but continued to leap up swing their caps and scream Fire against all remonstrance Ducklow did not wait to enter his explanations but turning the old mare about again drove home amid the laughter of the by standers and the screams of the misguided youngsters As he approached the house he met Taddy rushing wildly up the street Thaddeus Thaddeus Where ye goin Thaddeus Goin to the fire cried Taddy There isn t any fire boy Yes there is Didn t ye hear em They ve been yellin like fury It s nothin but Atkins s brush That all And Taddy appeared very much disappointed I thought there was goin to be some fun I wonder who was such a fool as to yell fire just for a darned old brush heap Ducklow did not inform him I ve got to drive over to town and get Reuben s trunk You stand by the mare while I step in and brush my hat Instead of applying himself at once to the restoration of his beaver he hastened to the sitting room to see that the bonds were safe Heavens and arth said Ducklow The chair which had been carefully planted in the spot where they were concealed had been removed Three or four tacks had been taken out and the carpet pushed from the wall There was straw scattered about Evidently Taddy had been interrupted in the midst of his ransacking by the alarm of fire Indeed he was even now creeping into the house to see what notice Ducklow would take of these evidences of his mischief In great trepidation the farmer thrust in his hand here and there and groped until he found the envelope precisely where it had been placed the night before with the tape tied around it which his wife had put on to prevent its contents from slipping out and losing themselves Great was the joy of Ducklow Great also was the wrath of him when he turned and discovered Taddy Didn t I tell you to stand by the old mare She won t stir said Taddy shrinking away again Come here And Ducklow grasped him by the collar What have you been doin Look at that Twan t me beginning to whimper and ram his fists into his eyes Don t tell me twan t you Ducklow shook him till his teeth chattered What was you pullin up the carpet for Lost a marble sniveled Taddy Lost a marble Ye didn t lose it under the carpet did ye Look at all that straw pulled out shaking him again Didn t know but it might a got under the carpet marbles roll so explained Taddy as soon as he could get his breath Wal sir Ducklow administered a resounding box on his ear don t you do such a thing again if you lose a million marbles Hain t got a million Taddy wept rubbing his cheek Hain t got but four Won t ye buy me some to day Go to that mare and don t you leave her again till I come or I ll marble ye in a way you won t like Understanding by this somewhat equivocal form of expression that flagellation was threatened Taddy obeyed still feeling his smarting and burning ear Ducklow was in trouble What should he do with the bonds The floor was no place for them after what had happened and he remembered too well the experience of yesterday to think for a moment of carrying them about his person With unreasonable impatience his mind reverted to missus Ducklow Why ain t she to home These women are forever a gaddin I wish Reuben s trunk was in Jericho Thinking of the trunk reminded him of one in the garret filled with old papers of all sorts newspapers letters bills of sale children s writing books accumulations of the past quarter of a century Neither fire nor burglar nor ransacking youngster had ever molested those ancient records during all those five and twenty years A bright thought struck him I ll slip the bonds down into that worthless heap o rubbish where no one ull ever think o lookin for em and resk em Having assured himself that Taddy was standing by the wagon he paid a hasty visit to the trunk in the garret and concealed the envelope still bound in its band of tape among the papers He then drove away giving Taddy a final charge to beware of setting anything afire He had driven about half a mile when he met a peddler There was nothing unusual or alarming in such a circumstance surely but as Ducklow kept on it troubled him He ll stop to the house now most likely and want to trade Findin nobody but Taddy there s no knowin what he ll be tempted to do But I ain t a goin to worry I ll defy anybody to find them bonds Besides she may be home by this time I guess she ll hear of the fire alarm and hurry home it ll be jest like her She ll be there and trade with the peddler thought Ducklow uneasily Then a frightful fancy possessed him She has threatened two or three times to sell that old trunkful of papers He ll offer a big price for em and ten to one she ll let him have em Why didn t I think on t What a stupid blunderbuss I be As Ducklow thought of it he felt almost certain that missus Ducklow had returned home and that she was bargaining with the peddler at that moment He fancied her smilingly receiving bright tin ware for the old papers and he could see the tape tied envelope going into the bag with the rest The result was that he turned about and whipped his old mare home again in terrific haste to catch the departing peddler Arriving he found the house as he had left it and Taddy occupied in making a kite frame Did that peddler stop here I hain t seen no peddler And hain t yer Ma Ducklow been home nuther No And with a guilty look Taddy put the kite frame behind him Ducklow considered The peddler had turned up a cross street he would probably turn down again and stop at the house after all missus Ducklow might by that time be at home then the sale of old papers would be very likely to take place Ducklow thought of leaving word that he did not wish any old papers in the house to be sold but feared lest the request might excite Taddy s suspicions I don t see no way but for me to take the bonds with me thought he with an inward groan He accordingly went to the garret took the envelope out of the trunk and placed it in the breast pocket of his overcoat to which he pinned it to prevent it by any chance from getting out He used six large strong pins for the purpose and was afterwards sorry he did not use seven There s suthin losin out o yer pocket bawled Taddy as he was once more mounting the wagon Quick as lightning Ducklow clapped his hand to his breast In doing so he loosed his hold of the wagon box and fell raking his shin badly on the wheel Yer side pocket It s one o yer mittens said Taddy You rascal How you scared me Seating himself in the wagon Ducklow gently pulled up his trousers leg to look at the bruised part Got anything in your boot leg to day Pa Ducklow asked Taddy innocently Yes a barked shin all on your account too Go and put that straw back and fix the carpet and don t ye let me hear ye speak of my boot leg again or I ll boot leg ye So saying Ducklow departed Instead of repairing the mischief he had done in the sitting room Taddy devoted his time and talents to the more interesting occupation of constructing his kite frame He worked at that until mister Grantly the minister driving by stopped to inquire how the folks were Ain t to home may I ride cried Taddy all in a breath mister Grantly was an indulgent old gentleman fond of children so he said Jump in and in a minute Taddy had scrambled to a seat by his side And now occurred a circumstance which Ducklow had foreseen The alarm of fire had reached Reuben s and although the report of its falseness followed immediately missus Ducklow s inflammable fancy was so kindled by it that she could find no comfort in prolonging her visit mister Ducklow ll be going for the trunk and I must go home and see to things Taddy s such a fellow for mischief I can foot it I shan t mind it And off she started walking herself out of breath in anxiety She reached the brow of the hill just in time to see a chaise drive away from her own door Who can that be I wonder if Taddy s ther to guard the house If anything should happen to them bonds Out of breath as she was she quickened her pace and trudged on flushed perspiring panting until she reached the house Thaddeus she called No Taddy answered She went in The house was deserted And lo the carpet torn up and the bonds abstracted mister Ducklow never would have made such work removing the bonds Then somebody else must have taken them she reasoned The man in the chaise she exclaimed or rather made an effort to exclaim succeeding only in bringing forth a hoarse gasping sound Fear dried up articulation Vox faucibus haesit And Taddy He had disappeared been murdered perhaps or gagged and carried away by the man in the chaise missus Ducklow flew hither and thither to use a favorite phrase of her own like a hen with her head cut off then rushed out of the house and up the street screaming after the chaise Murder murder Stop thief stop thief She waved her hands aloft in the air frantically If she had trudged before now she trotted now she cantered but if the cantering of the old mare was fitly likened to that of a cow to what thing to what manner of motion under the sun shall we liken the cantering of missus Ducklow It was original it was unique it was prodigious Now with her frantically waving hands and all her undulating and flapping skirts she seemed a species of huge unwieldy bird attempting to fly Then she sank down into a heavy dragging walk breath and strength all gone no voice left even to scream murder Then the awful realization of the loss of the bonds once more rushing over her she started up again Half running half flying what progress she made Then Atkins s dog saw her and naturally mistaking her for a prodigy came out at her bristling up and bounding and barking terrifically Come here cried Atkins following the dog What s the matter What s to pay missus Ducklow Attempting to speak the good woman could only pant and wheeze Robbed she at last managed to whisper amid the yelpings of the cur that refused to be silenced Robbed How Who The chaise Ketch it Her gestures expressed more than her words and Atkins s horse and wagon with which he had been drawing out brush being in the yard near by he ran to them leaped to the seat drove into the road took missus Ducklow aboard and set out in vigorous pursuit of the slow two wheeled vehicle Stop you sir Stop you sir shrieked missus Ducklow having recovered her breath by the time they came up with the chaise It stopped and mister Grantly the minister put out his good natured surprised face You ve robbed my house You ve took missus Ducklow was going on in wild accusatory accents when she recognized the benign countenance What do you say I have robbed you he exclaimed very much astonished No no not you You wouldn t do such a thing she stammered forth while Atkins who had laughed himself weak at mister Ducklow s plight earlier in the morning now laughed himself into a side ache at missus Ducklow s ludicrous mistake But did you did you stop at my house Have you seen our Thaddeus Here I be Ma Ducklow piped a small voice and Taddy who had till then remained hidden fearing punishment peeped out of the chaise from behind the broad back of the minister Taddy Taddy how came the carpet I pulled it up huntin for a marble said Taddy as she paused overmastered by her emotions And the the thing tied up in a brown wrapper Pa Ducklow took it Ye sure Yes I seen him Oh dear said missus Ducklow I never was so beat mister Grantly I hope excuse me I didn t know what I was about Taddy you notty boy what did you leave the house for Be ye quite sure yer Pa Ducklow Taddy replied that he was quite sure as he climbed from the chaise into Atkins s wagon The minister smilingly remarked that he hoped she would find no robbery had been committed and went his way Atkins driving back and setting her and Taddy down at the Ducklow gate answered her embarrassed Much obleeged to ye with a sincere Not at all considering the fun he had had a sufficient compensation for his trouble And thus ended the morning adventures with the exception of an unimportant episode in which Taddy missus Ducklow and missus Ducklow s rattan were the principal actors THE SHOOTING MATCH BY A B LONGSTREET Shooting matches are probably nearly coeval with the colonization of Georgia 
5883_59268_000002_000001	train-clean-360	They are still common throughout the Southern States though they are not as common as they were twenty five or thirty years ago Chance led me to one about a year ago 
none	none	I was traveling in one of the northeastern counties when I overtook a swarthy bright eyed smirky little fellow riding a small pony and bearing on his shoulder a long heavy rifle which judging from its looks I should say had done service in Morgan s corps Good morning sir said I reining up my horse as I came beside him
5883_59268_000004_000000	train-clean-360	 How goes it stranger said he with a tone of independence and self confidence that awakened my curiosity to know a little of his character 
5883_59268_000005_000000	train-clean-360	 Going driving inquired I 
none	none	Not exactly replied he surveying my horse with a quizzical smile I haven t been a driving by myself for a year or two and my nose has got so bad lately I can t carry a cold trail without hounds to help me Alone and without hounds as he was the question was rather a silly one but it answered the purpose for which it was put which was only to draw him into conversation and I proceeded to make as decent a retreat as I could I didn t know said I but that you were going to meet the huntsmen or going to your stand Ah sure enough rejoined he that mout be a bee as the old woman said when she killed a wasp 
5883_59268_000009_000001	train-clean-360	It seems to me I ought to know you 
none	none	Well if you ought why don t you What mout your name be It might be anything said I with a borrowed wit for I knew my man and knew what kind of conversation would please him most Well what is it then It is Hall said I but you know it might as well have been anything else
5883_59268_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 Pretty digging said he 
5883_59268_000015_000001	train-clean-360	 I find you re not the fool I took you to be so here s to a better acquaintance with you 
5883_59268_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 With all my heart returned I but you must be as clever as I ve been and give me your name 
5883_59268_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 To be sure I will my old coon take it take it and welcome 
5883_59268_000017_000001	train-clean-360	Anything else about me you d like to have 
none	none	No said I there s nothing else about you worth having
5883_59268_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh yes there is stranger 
none	none	Do you see this holding up his ponderous rifle with an ease that astonished me If you will go with me to the shooting match and see me knock out the bull s eye with her a few times you ll agree the old Soap stick s worth something when Billy Curlew puts his shoulder to her This short sentence was replete with information to me It taught me that my companion was Billy Curlew that he was going to a shooting match that he called his rifle the Soap stick and that he was very confident of winning beef with her or which is nearly but not quite the same thing driving the cross with her
5883_59268_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 Well said I if the shooting match is not too far out of my way I ll go to it with pleasure 
5883_59268_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 Unless your way lies through the woods from here said Billy it ll not be much out of your way for it s only a mile ahead of us and there is no other road for you to take till you get there and as that thing you re riding in ain t well suited to fast traveling among brushy knobs I reckon you won t lose much by going by 
5883_59268_000022_000001	train-clean-360	I reckon you hardly ever was at a shooting match stranger from the cut of your coat 
5883_59268_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh yes returned I many a time 
none	none	I won beef at one when I was hardly old enough to hold a shot gun off hand Children don t go to shooting matches about here said he with a smile of incredulity I never heard of but one that did and he was a little swinge cat 
5883_59268_000024_000002	train-clean-360	He was born a shooting and killed squirrels before he was weaned 
none	none	Nor did I ever hear of but one replied I and that one was myself And where did you win beef so young stranger At Berry Adams s
5883_59268_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 Why stop stranger let me look at you good 
none	none	Is your name Lyman Hall The very same said I Well dang my buttons if you ain t the very boy my daddy used to tell me about 
5883_59268_000030_000001	train-clean-360	I was too young to recollect you myself but I ve heard daddy talk about you many a time 
none	none	I believe mammy s got a neck handkerchief now that daddy won on your shooting at Collen Reid s store when you were hardly knee high 
5883_59268_000030_000003	train-clean-360	Come along Lyman and I ll go my death upon you at the shooting match with the old Soap stick at your shoulder 
none	none	Ah Billy said I the old Soap stick will do much better at your own shoulder It was my mother s notion that sent me to the shooting match at Berry Adams s and to tell the honest truth it was altogether a chance shot that made me win beef but that wasn t generally known and most everybody believed that I was carried there on account of my skill in shooting and my fame was spread far and wide I well remember I remember too perfectly well your father s bet on me at the store He was at the shooting match and nothing could make him believe but that I was a great shot with a rifle as well as a shot gun Bet he would on me in spite of all I could say though I assured him that I had never shot a rifle in my life It so happened too that there were but two bullets or rather a bullet and a half and so confident was your father in my skill that he made me shoot the half bullet and strange to tell by another chance shot I like to have drove the cross and won his bet
5883_59268_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 Now I know you re the very chap for I heard daddy tell that very thing about the half bullet 
none	none	Don t say anything about it Lyman and darn my old shoes if I don t tare the lint off the boys with you at the shooting match They ll never spect such a looking man as you are of knowing anything about a rifle I ll risk your chance shots I soon discovered that the father had eaten sour grapes and the son s teeth were on edge for Billy was just as incorrigibly obstinate in his belief of my dexterity with a rifle as his father had been before him 
5883_59268_000034_000000	train-clean-360	We soon reached the place appointed for the shooting match 
none	none	It went by the name of Sims s Cross Roads because here two roads intersected each other and because from the time that the first had been laid out Archibald Sims had resided there 
5883_59268_000034_000002	train-clean-360	Archibald had been a justice of the peace in his day and where is the man of his age in Georgia who has not consequently he was called Squire Sims 
5883_59268_000034_000003	train-clean-360	It is the custom in this state when a man has once acquired a title civil or military to force it upon him as long as he lives hence the countless number of titled personages who are introduced in these sketches 
5883_59268_000035_000000	train-clean-360	We stopped at the squire s door 
none	none	Billy hastily dismounted gave me the shake of the hand which he had been reluctantly reserving for a mile back and leading me up to the squire thus introduced me Uncle Archy this is Lyman Hall and for all you see him in these fine clothes he s a swinge cat a darn sight cleverer fellow than he looks to be Wait till you see him lift the old Soap stick and draw a bead upon the bull s eye You gwine to see fun here to day 
5883_59268_000035_000004	train-clean-360	Don t say nothing about it 
5883_59268_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 Well mister Swinge cat said the squire here s to a better acquaintance with you offering me his hand 
5883_59268_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 How goes it Uncle Archy said I taking his hand warmly for I am always free and easy with those who are so with me and in this course I rarely fail to please 
none	none	How s the old woman Egad said the squire chuckling there you re too hard for me for she died two and twenty years ago and I haven t heard a word from her since What and you never married again Never as God s my judge a solemn asseveration truly upon so light a subject
5883_59268_000041_000000	train-clean-360	 Well that s not my fault 
none	none	No nor it s not mine ni ther said the squire Here we were interrupted by the cry of another Rancey Sniffle Hello here All you as wish to put in for the shoot n match come on here for the putt n in s riddy to begin About sixty persons including mere spectators had collected the most of whom were more or less obedient to the call of Mealy Whitecotton for that was the name of the self constituted commander in chief Some hastened and some loitered as they desired to be first or last on the list for they shoot in the order in which their names are entered 
5883_59268_000045_000000	train-clean-360	The beef was not present nor is it ever upon such occasions but several of the company had seen it who all concurred in the opinion that it was a good beef and well worth the price that was set upon it eleven dollars 
5883_59268_000045_000001	train-clean-360	A general inquiry ran around in order to form some opinion as to the number of shots that would be taken for of course the price of a shot is cheapened in proportion to the increase of that number 
5883_59268_000045_000002	train-clean-360	It was soon ascertained that not more than twenty persons would take chances but these twenty agreed to take the number of shots at twenty five cents each 
none	none	The competitors now began to give in their names some for one some for two three and a few for as many as four shots Billy Curlew hung back to the last and when the list was offered him five shots remained undisposed of
5883_59268_000048_000000	train-clean-360	 How many shots left inquired Billy 
5883_59268_000049_000000	train-clean-360	 Five was the reply 
none	none	Well I take em all 
5883_59268_000050_000001	train-clean-360	Put down four shots to me and one to Lyman Hall paid for by William Curlew 
5883_59268_000051_000000	train-clean-360	I was thunder struck not at his proposition to pay for my shot because I knew that Billy meant it as a token of friendship and he would have been hurt if I had refused to let him do me this favor but at the unexpected announcement of my name as a competitor for beef at least one hundred miles from the place of my residence 
none	none	I was prepared for a challenge from Billy to some of his neighbors for a private match upon me but not for this 
5883_59268_000052_000000	train-clean-360	I therefore protested against his putting in for me and urged every reason to dissuade him from it that I could without wounding his feelings 
5883_59268_000053_000000	train-clean-360	 Put it down said Billy with the authority of an emperor and with a look that spoke volumes intelligible to every by stander 
5883_59268_000053_000001	train-clean-360	 Reckon I don t know what I m about Then wheeling off and muttering in an under self confident tone Dang old Roper continued he if he don t knock that cross to the north corner of creation and back again before a cat can lick her foot 
none	none	Had I been king of the cat tribe they could not have regarded me with more curious attention than did the whole company from this moment Every inch of me was examined with the nicest scrutiny and some plainly expressed by their looks that they never would have taken me for such a bite I saw no alternative but to throw myself upon a third chance shot for though by the rules of the sport I would have been allowed to shoot by proxy by all the rules of good breeding I was bound to shoot in person It would have been unpardonable to disappoint the expectations which had been raised on me Unfortunately too for me the match differed in one respect from those which I had been in the habit of attending in my younger days In olden times the contest was carried on chiefly with shot guns a generic term which in those days embraced three descriptions of firearms Indian traders a long cheap but sometimes excellent kind of gun that mother Britain used to send hither for traffic with the Indians the large musket and the shot gun properly so called Rifles were however always permitted to compete with them under equitable restrictions 
5883_59268_000054_000006	train-clean-360	These were that they should be fired off hand while the shot guns were allowed a rest the distance being equal or that the distance should be one hundred yards for a rifle to sixty for the shot gun the mode of firing being equal 
none	none	But this was a match of rifles exclusively and these are by far the most common at this time Most of the competitors fire at the same target which is usually a board from nine inches to a foot wide charred on one side as black as it can be made by fire without impairing materially the uniformity of its surface on the darkened side of which is pegged a square piece of white paper which is larger or smaller according to the distance at which it is to be placed from the marksmen This is almost invariably sixty yards and for it the paper is reduced to about two and a half inches square Out of the center of it is cut a rhombus of about the width of an inch measured diagonally this is the bull s eye or diamond as the marksmen choose to call it in the center of this is the cross But every man is permitted to fix his target to his own taste and accordingly some remove one fourth of the paper cutting from the center of the square to the two lower corners so as to leave a large angle opening from the center downward while others reduce the angle more or less but it is rarely the case that all are not satisfied with one of these figures The beef is divided into five prizes or as they are commonly termed five quarters the hide and tallow counting as one For several years after the revolutionary war a sixth was added the lead which was shot in the match This was the prize of the sixth best shot and it used to be carefully extracted from the board or tree in which it was lodged and afterward remoulded But this grew out of the exigency of the times and has I believe been long since abandoned everywhere The three master shots and rivals were Moses Firmby Larkin Spivey and Billy Curlew to whom was added upon this occasion by common consent and with awful forebodings your humble servant The target was fixed at an elevation of about three feet from the ground and the judges Captain Turner and Squire Porter took their stands by it joined by about half the spectators The first name on the catalogue was Mealy Whitecotton 
5883_59268_000060_000001	train-clean-360	Mealy stepped out rifle in hand and toed the mark 
none	none	His rifle was about three inches longer than himself and near enough his own thickness to make the remark of Darby Chislom as he stepped out tolerably appropriate Here comes the corn stalk and the sucker said Darby
5883_59268_000061_000000	train-clean-360	 Kiss my foot said Mealy 
5883_59268_000061_000001	train-clean-360	 The way I ll creep into that bull s eye s a fact 
none	none	You d better creep into your hind sight said Darby Mealy raised and fired
5883_59268_000063_000000	train-clean-360	 A pretty good shot Mealy said one 
none	none	Yes a blamed good shot said a second Well done Meal said a third 
5883_59268_000066_000000	train-clean-360	I was rejoiced when one of the company inquired Where is it for I could hardly believe they were founding these remarks upon the evidence of their senses 
none	none	Just on the right hand side of the bull s eye was the reply 
5883_59268_000068_000000	train-clean-360	I looked with all the power of my eyes but was unable to discover the least change in the surface of the paper 
5883_59268_000068_000001	train-clean-360	Their report however was true so much keener is the vision of a practiced than an unpracticed eye 
none	none	The next in order was Hiram Baugh Hiram was like some race horses which I have seen he was too good not to contend for every prize and too good for nothing ever to win one Gentlemen said he as he came to the mark I don t say that I ll win beef but if my piece don t blow I ll eat the paper or be mighty apt to do it if you ll b lieve my racket My powder are not good powder gentlemen I bought it thum from Zeb Daggett and gin him three quarters of a dollar a pound for it but it are not what I call good powder gentlemen but if old Buck killer burns it clear the boy you call Hiram Baugh eat s paper or comes mighty near it Well blaze away said Mealy and be d d to you and Zeb Daggett and your powder and Buck killer and your powder horn and shot pouch to boot How long you gwine stand thar talking fore you shoot Never mind said Hiram I can talk a little and shoot a little too but that s nothin 
5883_59268_000072_000001	train-clean-360	Here goes 
none	none	Hiram assumed the figure of a note of interrogation took a long sight and fired
5883_59268_000074_000000	train-clean-360	 I ve eat paper said he at the crack of the gun without looking or seeming to look toward the target 
5883_59268_000074_000001	train-clean-360	 Buck killer made a clear racket Where am I gentlemen 
none	none	You re just between Mealy and the diamond was the reply
5883_59268_000076_000000	train-clean-360	 I said I d eat paper and I ve done it haven t I gentlemen 
none	none	And spose you have said Mealy what do that mount to You ll not win beef and never did Be that as it mout be I ve beat Meal Cotton mighty easy and the boy you call Hiram Baugh are able to do it And what do that mount to Who the devil an t able to beat Meal Cotton I don t make no pretense of bein nothin great no how but you always makes out as if you were gwine to keep em makin crosses for you constant and then do nothin but eat paper at last and that s a long way from eatin beef cordin to Meal Cotton s notions as you call him 
5883_59268_000080_000000	train-clean-360	Simon Stow was now called on 
5883_59268_000081_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh Lord exclaimed two or three now we have it 
none	none	It ll take him as long to shoot as it would take Squire Dobbins to run round a track o land Good by boys said Bob Martin
5883_59268_000083_000000	train-clean-360	 Where are you going Bob 
none	none	Going to gather in my crop I ll be back again though by the time Sime Stow shoots Simon was used to all this and therefore it did not disconcert him in the least He went off and brought his own target and set it up with his own hand He then wiped out his rifle rubbed the pan with his hat drew a piece of tow through the touch hole with his wiper filled his charger with great care poured the powder into the rifle with equal caution shoved in with his finger the two or three vagrant grains that lodged round the mouth of his piece took out a handful of bullets looked them all over carefully selected one without flaw or wrinkle drew out his patching found the most even part of it sprung open the grease box in the breech of his rifle took up just so much grease distributed it with great equality over the chosen part of his patching laid it over the muzzle of his rifle grease side down placed his ball upon it pressed it a little then took it up and turned the neck a little more perpendicularly downward placed his knife handle on it just buried it in the mouth of the rifle cut off the redundant patching just above the bullet looked at it and shook his head in token that he had cut off too much or too little no one knew which sent down the ball measured the contents of his gun with his first and second fingers on the protruding part of the ramrod shook his head again to signify there was too much or too little powder primed carefully placed an arched piece of tin over the hind sight to shade it took his place got a friend to hold his hat over the foresight to shade it took a very long sight fired and didn t even eat the paper My piece was badly loadned said Simon when he learned the place of his ball Oh you didn t take time said Mealy No man can shoot that s in such a hurry as you is I d hardly got to sleep fore I heard the crack o the gun 
5883_59268_000089_000000	train-clean-360	The next was Moses Firmby 
none	none	He was a tall slim man of rather sallow complexion and it is a singular fact that though probably no part of the world is more healthy than the mountainous parts of Georgia the mountaineers have not generally robust frames or fine complexions they are however almost inexhaustible by toil 
5883_59268_000090_000000	train-clean-360	Moses kept us not long in suspense 
none	none	His rifle was already charged and he fixed it upon the target with a steadiness of nerve and aim that was astonishing to me and alarming to all the rest A few seconds and the report of his rifle broke the deathlike silence which prevailed
5883_59268_000091_000000	train-clean-360	 No great harm done yet said Spivey manifestly relieved from anxiety by an event which seemed to me better calculated to produce despair Firmby s ball had cut out the lower angle of the diamond directly on a right line with the cross 
5883_59268_000092_000000	train-clean-360	Three or four followed him without bettering his shot all of whom however with one exception eat the paper 
5883_59268_000093_000000	train-clean-360	It now came to Spivey s turn 
5883_59268_000093_000001	train-clean-360	There was nothing remarkable in his person or manner 
5883_59268_000093_000002	train-clean-360	He took his place lowered his rifle slowly from a perpendicular until it came on a line with the mark held it there like a vice for a moment and fired 
none	none	Pretty sevigrous but nothing killing yet said Billy Curlew as he learned the place of Spivey s ball Spivey s ball had just broken the upper angle of the diamond beating Firmby about half its width A few more shots in which there was nothing remarkable brought us to Billy Curlew Billy stepped out with much confidence and brought the Soap stick to an order while he deliberately rolled up his shirt sleeves 
5883_59268_000096_000001	train-clean-360	Had I judged Billy s chance of success from the looks of his gun I should have said it was hopeless 
none	none	The stock of Soap stick seemed to have been made with a case knife and had it been the tool would have been but a poor apology for its clumsy appearance 
5883_59268_000096_000003	train-clean-360	An auger hole in the breech served for a grease box a cotton string assisted a single screw in holding on the lock and the thimbles were made one of brass one of iron and one of tin 
5883_59268_000097_000000	train-clean-360	 Where s Lark Spivey s bullet called out Billy to the judges as he finished rolling up his sleeves 
5883_59268_000098_000000	train-clean-360	 About three quarters of an inch from the cross was the reply 
5883_59268_000099_000000	train-clean-360	 Well clear the way the Soap stick s coming and she ll be along in there among em presently 
none	none	Billy now planted himself astraddle like an inverted V shot forward his left hip drew his body back to an angle of about forty five degrees with the plane of the horizon brought his cheek down close to the breech of old Soap stick and fixed her upon the mark with untrembling hand His sight was long and the swelling muscles of his left arm led me to believe that he was lessening his chance of success with every half second that he kept it burdened with his ponderous rifle but it neither flagged nor wavered until Soap stick made her report
5883_59268_000101_000000	train-clean-360	 Where am I said Billy as the smoke rose from before his eye 
none	none	You ve jist touched the cross on the lower side was the reply of one of the judges I was afraid I was drawing my bead a leetle too fine said Billy Now Lyman you see what the Soap stick can do 
5883_59268_000103_000001	train-clean-360	Take her and show the boys how you used to do when you was a baby 
none	none	I begged to reserve my shot to the last pleading rather sophistically that it was in point of fact one of the Billy s shots My plea was rather indulged than sustained and the marksmen who had taken more than one shot commenced the second round 
5883_59268_000104_000001	train-clean-360	This round was a manifest improvement upon the first 
none	none	The cross was driven three times once by Spivey once by Firmby and once by no less a personage than Mealy Whitecotton whom chance seemed to favor for this time merely that he might retaliate upon Hiram Baugh and the bull s eye was disfigured out of all shape 
5883_59268_000105_000000	train-clean-360	The third and fourth rounds were shot 
5883_59268_000105_000001	train-clean-360	Billy discharged his last shot which left the rights of parties thus Billy Curlew first and fourth choice Spivey second Firmby third and Whitecotton fifth 
none	none	Some of my readers may perhaps be curious to learn how a distinction comes to be made between several all of whom drive the cross 
5883_59268_000105_000003	train-clean-360	The distinction is perfectly natural and equitable 
none	none	Threads are stretched from the uneffaced parts of the once intersecting lines by means of which the original position of the cross is precisely ascertained Each bullet hole being nicely pegged up as it is made it is easy to ascertain its circumference To this I believe they usually if not invariably measure where none of the balls touch the cross but if the cross be driven they measure from it to the center of the bullet hole To make a draw shot therefore between two who drive the cross it is necessary that the center of both balls should pass directly through the cross a thing that very rarely happens The Bite alone remained to shoot 
5883_59268_000106_000001	train-clean-360	Billy wiped out his rifle carefully loaded her to the top of his skill and handed her to me 
5883_59268_000106_000002	train-clean-360	 Now said he Lyman draw a fine bead but not too fine for Soap stick bears up her ball well 
5883_59268_000106_000003	train-clean-360	Take care and don t touch the trigger until you ve got your bead for she s spring trigger d and goes mighty easy but you hold her to the place you want her and if she don t go there dang old Roper 
5883_59268_000107_000000	train-clean-360	I took hold of Soap stick and lapsed immediately into the most hopeless despair 
none	none	I am sure I never handled as heavy a gun in all my life
5883_59268_000107_000002	train-clean-360	 Why Billy said I you little mortal you what do you use such a gun as this for 
none	none	Look at the bull s eye yonder said he True said I but I can t shoot her it is impossible
5883_59268_000110_000000	train-clean-360	 Go long you old coon said Billy I see what you re at intimating that all this was merely to make the coming shot the more remarkable Daddy s little boy don t shoot anything but the old Soap stick here to day I know 
none	none	The judges I knew were becoming impatient and withal my situation was growing more embarrassing every second so I e en resolved to try the Soap stick without further parley I stepped out and the most intense interest was excited all around me and it flashed like electricity around the target as I judged from the anxious gaze of all in that direction Policy dictated that I should fire with a falling rifle and I adopted this mode determining to fire as soon as the sights came on a line with the diamond bead or no bead Accordingly I commenced lowering old Soap stick but in spite of all my muscular powers she was strictly obedient to the laws of gravitation and came down with a uniformly accelerated velocity Before I could arrest her downward flight she had not only passed the target but was making rapid encroachments on my own toes Why he s the weakest man in the arms I ever seed said one in a half whisper It s only his fun said Billy I know him
5883_59268_000116_000000	train-clean-360	 It may be fun said the other but it looks mightily like yearnest to a man up a tree 
none	none	I now of course determined to reverse the mode of firing and put forth all my physical energies to raise Soap stick to the mark The effort silenced Billy and gave tongue to all his companions 
5883_59268_000117_000002	train-clean-360	I had just strength enough to master Soap stick s obstinate proclivity and consequently my nerves began to exhibit palpable signs of distress with her first imperceptible movement upward 
none	none	A trembling commenced in my arms increased and extended rapidly to my body and lower extremities so that by the time that I had brought Soap stick up to the mark I was shaking from head to foot exactly like a man under the continued action of a strong galvanic battery In the meantime my friends gave vent to their feelings freely
5883_59268_000118_000000	train-clean-360	 I swear poin blank said one that man can t shoot 
5883_59268_000119_000000	train-clean-360	 He used to shoot well said another but can t now nor never could

5883_59268_000121_000000	train-clean-360	 The stranger s got the peedoddles said a fourth with humorous gravity

5883_59268_000123_000000	train-clean-360	As soon as I found that Soap stick was high enough for I made no farther use of the sights than to ascertain this fact I pulled trigger and off she went 
none	none	I have always found that the most creditable way of relieving myself of derision was to heighten it myself as much as possible It is a good plan in all circles but by far the best which can be adopted among the plain rough farmers of the country Accordingly I brought old Soap stick to an order with an air of triumph tipped Billy a wink and observed Now Billy s your time to make your fortune 
5883_59268_000123_000003	train-clean-360	Bet em two to one that I ve knocked out the cross 
none	none	No I ll be dod blamed if I do said Billy but I ll bet you two to one that you hain t hit the plank Ah Billy said I I was joking about betting for I never bet nor would I have you to bet indeed I do not feel exactly right in shooting for beef for it is a species of gaming at last but I ll say this much if that cross isn t knocked out I ll never shoot for beef again as long as I live By dod said Mealy Whitecotton you ll lose no great things at that Well said I I reckon I know a little about wabbling Is it possible Billy a man who shoots as well as you do never practiced shooting with the double wabble It s the greatest take in the world when you learn to drive the cross with it 
5883_59268_000127_000003	train-clean-360	Another sort for getting bets upon to the drop sight with a single wabble 
5883_59268_000127_000004	train-clean-360	And the Soap stick s the very yarn for it 
none	none	Tell you what stranger said one you re too hard for us all here We never hearn o that sort o shoot n in these parts
5883_59268_000129_000000	train-clean-360	 Well returned I you ve seen it now and I m the boy that can do it 
none	none	The judges were now approaching with the target and a singular combination of circumstances had kept all my party in utter ignorance of the result of my shot Those about the target had been prepared by Billy Curlew for a great shot from me their expectations had received assurance from the courtesy which had been extended to me and nothing had happened to disappoint them but the single caution to them against the dry gripes which was as likely to have been given in irony as in earnest for my agonies under the weight of the Soap stick were either imperceptible to them at the distance of sixty yards or being visible were taken as the flourishes of an expert who wished to astonish the natives The other party did not think the direction of my ball worth the trouble of a question or if they did my airs and harangue had put the thought to flight before it was delivered 
5883_59268_000130_000002	train-clean-360	Consequently they were all transfixed with astonishment when the judges presented the target to them and gravely observed It s only second best after all the fuss 
none	none	Second best exclaimed I with uncontrollable transports The whole of my party rushed to the target to have the evidence of their senses before they would believe the report but most marvelous fortune decreed that it should be true Their incredulity and astonishment were most fortunate for me for they blinded my hearers to the real feelings with which the exclamation was uttered and allowed me sufficient time to prepare myself for making the best use of what I had said before with a very different object
5883_59268_000133_000000	train-clean-360	 Second best reiterated I with an air of despondency as the company turned from the target to me 
5883_59268_000133_000001	train-clean-360	 Second best only 
5883_59268_000133_000002	train-clean-360	Here Billy my son take the old Soap stick she s a good piece but I m getting too old and dim sighted to shoot a rifle especially with the drop sight and double wabbles 
none	none	Why good Lord a mighty said Billy with a look that baffles all description an t you driv the cross Oh driv the cross rejoined I carelessly
5883_59268_000135_000001	train-clean-360	 What s that 
none	none	Just look where my ball is I do believe in my soul its center is a full quarter of an inch from the cross I wanted to lay the center of the bullet upon the cross just as if you d put it there with your fingers 
5883_59268_000136_000000	train-clean-360	Several received this palaver with a contemptuous but very appropriate curl of the nose and Mealy Whitecotton offered to bet a half pint that I couldn t do the like again with no sort o wabbles he didn t care what But I had already fortified myself on this quarter of my morality 
none	none	A decided majority however were clearly of opinion that I was serious and they regarded me as one of the wonders of the world Billy increased the majority by now coming out fully with my history as he had received it from his father to which I listened with quite as much astonishment as any other one of his hearers He begged me to go home with him for the night or as he expressed it to go home with him and swap lies that night and it shouldn t cost me a cent the true reading of which is that if I would go home with him and give him the pleasure of an evening s chat about old times his house should be as free to me as my own 
5883_59268_000136_000003	train-clean-360	But I could not accept his hospitality without retracing five or six miles of the road which I had already passed and therefore I declined it 
none	none	Well if you won t go what must I tell the old woman for you for she ll be mighty glad to hear from the boy that won the silk handkerchief for her and I expect she ll lick me for not bringing you home with me
5883_59268_000138_000000	train-clean-360	 Tell her said I that I send her a quarter of beef which I won as I did the handkerchief by nothing in the world but mere good luck 
none	none	Hold your jaw Lyman said Billy I an t a gwine to tell the old woman any such lies for she s a reg lar built Meth dist As I turned to depart Stop a minute stranger said one then lowering his voice to a confidential but distinctly audible tone What you offering for continued he I assured him I was not a candidate for anything that I had accidentally fallen in with Billy Curlew who begged me to come with him to the shooting match and as it lay right on my road I had stopped Oh said he with a conciliatory nod if you re up for anything you needn t be mealy mouthed about it fore us boys for we ll all go in for you here up to the handle
5883_59268_000141_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes said Billy dang old Roper if we don t go our death for you no matter who offers

the smoking room I hadn t gone three feet till some woman held me up and began telling me how she adored Grand Opera I didn t even reply I fled madly and remained hidden in the tall grasses of the smoking room until it was time to go home Jim should any one ever tell you that Grand Opera is all right he is either trying to even up or he is not a true friend I was over in New York with the family last winter and they made me go with them to Die Walkure at the Metropolitan Opera House When I got the tickets I asked the man s advice as to the best location He said that all true lovers of music occupied the dress circle and balconies and that he had some good center dress circle seats at three bones per Here s a tip Jim If the box man ever hands you that true lover game just reach in through the little hole and soak him in the solar for me It s coming to him I ll give you my word of honor we were a quarter of a mile from the stage We went up in an elevator were shown to our seats and who was right behind us but my old pal Bud Hathaway from Chicago Bud had his two sisters with him and he gave me one sad look which said plainer than words So you re up against it too eh We introduced all hands around and about nine o clock the curtain went up After we had waited fully ten minutes out came a big fat greasy looking Dago with nothing on but a bear robe He went over to the side of the stage and sat down on a bum rock It was plainly to be seen even from my true lovers seat that his bearlets was sorer than a dog about something Presently in came a woman and none of the true lovers seemed to know who she was Some said it was Melba others Nordica Bud and I decided that it was May Irwin We were mistaken though as Irwin has this woman lashed to the mast at any time or place As soon as Mike the Dago espied the dame it was all off He rushed and drove a straight arm jab which had it reached would have given him the purse But shifty Sadie wasn t there She ducked side stepped and landed a clever half arm hook which seemed to stun the big fellow They clinched and swayed back and forth growling continually while the orchestra played this trembly Eliza crossing the ice music Jim I m not swelling this a bit On the level it happened just as I write it All of a sudden some one seemed to win They broke away and ran wildly to the front of the stage with their arms outstretched yelling to beat three of a kind The band cut loose something fierce The leader tore out about nine dollars worth of hair and acted generally as though he had bats in his belfry I thought sure the place would be pinched It reminded me of Thirsty Thornton s dance hall out in Merrill Wisconsin when the Silent Swede used to start a general survival of the fittest every time Mamie the Mink danced twice in succession with the young fellow from Albany whose father owned the big mill up Rough River Of course this audience was perfectly orderly and showed no intention whatever of cutting in and there were no chairs or glasses in the air but I am forced to admit that the opera had Thornton s faded for noise I asked Bud what the trouble was and he answered that I could search him The audience apparently went wild Everybody said Simply sublime Isn t it grand Perfectly superb Bravo et cetera not because they really enjoyed it but merely because they thought it was the proper thing to do After that for three solid hours Rough House Mike and Shifty Sadie seemed to be apologizing to the audience for their disgraceful street brawl which was honestly the only good thing in the show Along about twelve o clock I thought I would talk over old times with Bud but when I turned his way I found my tired and trusty comrade Asleep at the Switch At the finish the woman next to me who seemed to be on said that the main lady was dying After it was too late Mike seemed kind of sorry He must have give her the knife or the drops because there wasn t a minute that he could look in on her according to the rules He laid her out on the bum rock they set off a lot of red fire for some unknown reason and the curtain dropped at twelve twenty five Never again for my money Far be it from me knocking but any time I want noise I ll take to a boiler shop or a Union Station where I can understand what s coming off I m for a good mother show Do you remember The White Slave Jim Well that s me Wasn t it immense where the main lady spurned the leering villain s gold and exclaimed with flashing eye Rags are royal raiment when worn for virtue s sake Great The White Slave had Die Walkure beaten to a pulp and they don t get to you for three cases gate money either IN A STATE OF SIN three BY OWEN WISTER Judge and missus Henry Molly Wood and two strangers a lady and a gentleman were the party which had been driving in the large three seated wagon They had seemed a merry party But as I came within hearing of their talk it was a fragment of the minister s sonority which reached me first more opportunity for them to have the benefit of hearing frequent sermons was the sentence I heard him bring to completion Yes to be sure sir Judge Henry gave me it almost seemed additional warmth of welcome for arriving to break up the present discourse Let me introduce you to the reverend doctor Alexander MacBride Doctor another guest we have been hoping for about this time was my host s cordial explanation to him of me There remained the gentleman with his wife from New York and to these I made my final bows But I had not broken up the discourse We may be said to have met already doctor MacBride had fixed upon me his full mastering eye and it occurred to me that if they had policemen in heaven he would be at least a centurion in the force But he did not mean to be unpleasant it was only that in a mind full of matters less worldly pleasure was left out I observed your friend was a skilful horseman he continued I was saying to Judge Henry that I could wish such skilful horsemen might ride to a church upon the Sabbath A church that is of right doctrine where they would have opportunity to hear frequent sermons Yes said Judge Henry yes It would be a good thing missus Henry with some murmur about the kitchen here went into the house I was informed doctor MacBride held the rest of us before undertaking my journey that I should find a desolate and mainly godless country But nobody gave me to understand that from Medicine Bow I was to drive three hundred miles and pass no church of any faith The Judge explained that there had been a few a long way to the right and left of him Still he conceded you are quite right But don t forget that this is the newest part of a new world Judge said his wife coming to the door how can you keep them standing in the dust with your talking This most efficiently did break up the discourse As our little party with the smiles and the polite holdings back of new acquaintanceship moved into the house the Judge detained me behind all of them long enough to whisper dolorously He s going to stay a whole week I had hopes that he would not stay a whole week when I presently learned of the crowded arrangements which our hosts with many hospitable apologies disclosed to us They were delighted to have us but they hadn t foreseen that we should all be simultaneous The foreman s house had been prepared for two of us and did we mind The two of us were doctor MacBride and myself and I expected him to mind But I wronged him grossly It would be much better he assured missus Henry than straw in a stable which he had tried several times and was quite ready for So I saw that though he kept his vigorous body clean when he could he cared nothing for it in the face of his mission How the foreman and his wife relished being turned out during a week for a missionary and myself was not my concern although while he and I made ready for supper over there it struck me as hard on them The room with its two cots and furniture was as nice as possible and we closed the door upon the adjoining room which however seemed also untenanted missus Henry gave us a meal so good that I have remembered it and her husband the Judge strove his best that we should eat it in merriment He poured out his anecdotes like wine and we should have quickly warmed to them but doctor MacBride sat among us giving occasional heavy ha ha s which produced as Miss Molly Wood whispered to me a dreadfully cavernous effect Was it his sermon we wondered that he was thinking over I told her of the copious sheaf of them I had seen him pull from his wallet over at the foreman s Goodness said she Then are we to hear one every evening This I doubted he had probably been picking one out suitable for the occasion Putting his best foot foremost was her comment I suppose they have best feet like the rest of us Then she grew delightfully sharp Do you know when I first heard him I thought his voice was hearty But if you listen you ll find it s merely militant He never really meets you with it He s off on his hill watching the battle field the whole time He will find a hardened pagan here Judge Henry Oh no The wild man you re taming He s brought you Kenilworth safe back She was smooth Oh as for taming him But don t you find him intelligent Suddenly I somehow knew that she didn t want to tame him But what did she want to do The thought of her had made him blush this afternoon No thought of him made her blush this evening A great laugh from the rest of the company made me aware that the Judge had consummated his tale of the Sole Survivor And so he finished they all went off as mad as hops because it hadn t been a massacre mister and missus Ogden they were the New Yorkers gave this story much applause and doctor MacBride half a minute later laid his ha ha like a heavy stone upon the gaiety I ll never be able to stand seven sermons said Miss Wood to me Do you often have these visitations Ogden inquired of Judge Henry Our host was giving us whisky in his office and doctor MacBride while we smoked apart from the ladies had repaired to his quarters in the foreman s house previous to the service which he was shortly to hold The Judge laughed They come now and then through the year I like the bishop to come And the men always like it But I fear our friend will scarcely please them so well You don t mean they ll Oh no They ll keep quiet The fact is they have a good deal better manners than he has if he only knew it They ll be able to bear him But as for any good he ll do I doubt if he knows a word of science said I musing about the Doctor Science He doesn t know what Christianity is yet I ve entertained many guests but none The whole secret broke off Judge Henry lies in the way you treat people As soon as you treat men as your brothers they are ready to acknowledge you if you deserve it as their superior That s the whole bottom of Christianity and that s what our missionary will never know Thunder sat imminent upon the missionary s brow Many were to be at his mercy soon But for us he had sunshine still I am truly sorry to be turning you upside down he said importantly But it seems the best place for my service He spoke of the table pushed back and the chairs gathered in the hall where the storm would presently break upon the congregation Eight thirty he inquired This was the hour appointed and it was only twenty minutes off We threw the unsmoked fractions of our cigars away and returned to offer our services to the ladies This amused the ladies They had done without us All was ready in the hall We got the cook to help us missus Ogden told me so as not to disturb your cigars In spite of the cow boys I still recognize my own country In the cook I rather densely asked Oh no I don t have a Chinaman It s in the length of after dinner cigars Had you been smoking I returned you would have found them short this evening You make it worse said the lady we have had nothing but doctor MacBride We ll share him with you now I exclaimed Has he announced his text I ve got one for him said Molly Wood joining us She stood on tiptoe and spoke it comically in our ears I said in my haste All men are liars This made us merry as we stood among the chairs in the congested hall I left the ladies and sought the bunk house I had heard the cheers but I was curious also to see the men and how they were taking it There was but little for the eye There was much noise in the room They were getting ready to come to church brushing their hair shaving and making themselves clean amid talk occasionally profane and continuously diverting Well I m a Christian anyway one declared I m a Mormon I guess said another I belong to the Knights of Pythias said a third I m a Mohammedist said a fourth I hope I ain t goin to hear nothin to shock me What with my feelings at Scipio s discretion and my human curiosity I was not in that mood which best profits from a sermon Yet even though my expectations had been cruelly left quivering in mid air I was not sure how much I really wanted to keep around You will therefore understand how doctor MacBride was able to make a prayer and to read Scripture without my being conscious of a word that he had uttered It was when I saw him opening the manuscript of his sermon that I suddenly remembered I was sitting so to speak in church and began once more to think of the preacher and his congregation Our chairs were in the front line of course but being next the wall I could easily see the cow boys behind me They were perfectly decorous If missus Ogden had looked for pistols dare devil attitudes and so forth she must have been greatly disappointed Except for their weather beaten cheeks and eyes they were simply American young men with mustaches and without and might have been sitting say in Danbury Connecticut Even Trampas merged quietly with the general placidity The Virginian did not to be sure look like Danbury and his frame and his features showed out of the mass but his eyes were upon doctor MacBride with a creamlike propriety Our missionary did not choose Miss Wood s text He made his selection from another of the Psalms and when it came I did not dare to look at anybody I was much nearer unseemly conduct than the cow boys doctor MacBride gave us his text sonorously They are altogether become filthy There is none of them that doeth good no not one His eye showed us plainly that present company was not excepted from this He repeated the text once more then launching upon his discourse gave none of us a ray of hope I had heard it all often before but preached to cow boys it took on a new glare of untimeliness of grotesque obsoleteness as if some one should say Let me persuade you to admire woman and forthwith hold out her bleached bones to you The cow boys were told that not only they could do no good but that if they did contrive to it would not help them Nay more not only honest deeds availed them nothing but even if they accepted this especial creed which was being explained to them as necessary for salvation still it might not save them Their sin was indeed the cause of their damnation yet keeping from sin they might nevertheless be lost It had all been settled for them not only before they were born but before Adam was shaped Having told them this he invited them to glorify the Creator of the scheme Even if damned they must praise the person who had made them expressly for damnation That is what I heard him prove by logic to these cow boys Stone upon stone he built the black cellar of his theology leaving out its beautiful park and the sunshine of its garden He did not tell them the splendor of its past the noble fortress for good that it had been how its tonic had strengthened generations of their fathers No wrath he spoke of and never once of love It was the bishop s way I knew well to hold cow boys by homely talk of their special hardships and temptations And when they fell he spoke to them of forgiveness and brought them encouragement But doctor MacBride never thought once of the lives of these waifs Like himself like all mankind they were invisible dots in creation like him they were to feel as nothing to be swept up in the potent heat of his faith So he thrust out to them none of the sweet but all the bitter of his creed naked and stern as iron Dogma was his all in all and poor humanity was nothing but flesh for its canons Thus to kill what chance he had for being of use seemed to me more deplorable than it did evidently to them Their attention merely wandered Three hundred years ago they would have been frightened but not in this electric day I saw Scipio stifling a smile when it came to the doctrine of original sin We know of its truth said doctor MacBride from the severe troubles and distresses to which infants are liable and from death passing upon them before they are capable of sinning Yet I knew he was a good man and I also knew that if a missionary is to be tactless he might almost as well be bad I said their attention wandered but I forgot the Virginian At first his attitude might have been mere propriety One can look respectfully at a preacher and be internally breaking all the commandments But even with the text I saw real attention light in the Virginian s eye And keeping track of the concentration that grew on him with each minute made the sermon short for me He missed nothing Before the end his gaze at the preacher had become swerveless Was he convert or critic Convert was incredible Thus was an hour passed before I had thought of time When it was over we took it variously The preacher was genial and spoke of having now broken ground for the lessons that he hoped to instil He discoursed for a while about trout fishing and about the rumored uneasiness of the Indians northward where he was going It was plain that his personal safety never gave him a thought He soon bade us good night The Ogdens shrugged their shoulders and were amused That was their way of taking it doctor MacBride sat too heavily on the Judge s shoulders for him to shrug them As a leading citizen in the Territory he kept open house for all comers Policy and good nature made him bid welcome a wide variety of travelers The cow boy out of employment found bed and a meal for himself and his horse and missionaries had before now been well received at Sunk Creek Ranch I suppose I ll have to take him fishing said the Judge ruefully Yes my dear said his wife you will And I shall have to make his tea for six days Otherwise Ogden suggested it might be reported that you were enemies of religion That s about it said the Judge I can get on with most people But elephants depress me So we named the Doctor Jumbo and I departed to my quarters At the bunk house the comments were similar but more highly salted The men were going to bed In spite of their outward decorum at the service they had not liked to be told that they were altogether become filthy It was easy to call names they could do that themselves And they appealed to me several speaking at once like a concerted piece at the opera Say do you believe babies go to hell Ah of course he don t There ain t no hereafter anyway Ain t there Who told y u Same man as told the preacher we were all a sifted set of sons of guns Well I m going to stay a Mormon Well I m going to quit fleeing from temptation That s so Better get it in the neck after a good time than a poor one And so forth Their wit was not extreme yet I should like doctor MacBride to have heard it One fellow put his natural soul pretty well into words If I happened to learn what they had predestinated me to do I d do the other thing just to show em And Trampas And the Virginian They were out of it The Virginian had gone straight to his new abode Trampas lay in his bed not asleep and sullen as ever He ain t got religion this trip said Scipio to me Did his new foreman get it I asked Huh It would spoil him You keep around that s all Keep around Scipio was not to be probed and I went still baffled to my repose No light burned in the cabin as I approached its door The Virginian s room was quiet and dark and that doctor MacBride slumbered was plainly audible to me even before I entered Go fishing with him I thought as I undressed And I selfishly decided that the Judge might have this privilege entirely to himself Sleep came to me fairly soon in spite of the Doctor I was wakened from it by my bed s being jolted not a pleasant thing that night I must have started And it was the quiet voice of the Virginian that told me he was sorry to have accidentally disturbed me This disturbed me a good deal more But his steps did not go to the bunk house as my sensational mind had suggested He was not wearing much and in the dimness he seemed taller than common I next made out that he was bending over doctor MacBride The divine at last sprang upright I am armed he said Take care Who are you You can lay down your gun seh I feel like my spirit was going to bear witness I feel like I might get an enlightening He was using some of the missionary s own language The baffling I had been treated to by Scipio melted to nothing in this Did living men petrify I should have changed to mineral between the sheets The Doctor got out of bed lighted his lamp and found a book and the two retired into the Virginian s room where I could hear the exhortations as I lay amazed In time the Doctor returned blew out his lamp and settled himself I had been very much awake but was nearly gone to sleep again when the door creaked and the Virginian stood by the Doctor s side Are you awake seh What What s that What is it Excuse me seh The enemy is winning on me I m feeling less inward opposition to sin The lamp was lighted and I listened to some further exhortations They must have taken half an hour When the Doctor was in bed again I thought that I heard him sigh This upset my composure in the dark but I lay face downward in the pillow and the Doctor was soon again snoring I envied him for a while his faculty of easy sleep But I must have dropped off myself for it was the lamp in my eyes that now waked me as he came back for the third time from the Virginian s room Before blowing the light out he looked at his watch and thereupon I inquired the hour of him Three said he I could not sleep any more now and I lay watching the darkness I m afeard to be alone said the Virginian s voice presently in the next room I m afeard There was a short pause and then he shouted very loud I m losin my desire afteh the sincere milk of the Word What What s that What The Doctor s cot gave a great crack as he started up listening and I put my face deep in the pillow I m afeard I m afeard Sin has quit being bitter in my belly Courage my good man The Doctor was out of bed with his lamp again and the door shut behind him Between them they made it long this time I saw the window become gray then the corners of the furniture grow visible and outside the dry chorus of the blackbirds began to fill the dawn To these the sounds of chickens and impatient hoofs in the stable were added and some cow wandered by loudly calling for her calf Next some one whistling passed near and grew distant But although the cold hue that I lay staring at through the window warmed and changed the Doctor continued working hard over his patient in the next room Only a word here and there was distinct but it was plain from the Virginian s fewer remarks that the sin in his belly was alarming him less Yes they made this time long But it proved indeed the last one And though some sort of catastrophe was bound to fall upon us it was myself who precipitated the thing that did happen Day was wholly come I looked at my own watch and it was six I had been about seven hours in my bed and the Doctor had been about seven hours out of his The door opened and he came in with his book and lamp He seemed to be shivering a little and I saw him cast a longing eye at his couch But the Virginian followed him even as he blew out the now quite superfluous light They made a noticeable couple in their underclothes the Virginian with his lean racehorse shanks running to a point at his ankle and the Doctor with his stomach and his fat sedentary calves You ll be going to breakfast and the ladies seh pretty soon said the Virginian with a chastened voice But I ll worry through the day somehow without y u And to night you can turn your wolf loose on me again Once more it was no use My face was deep in the pillow but I made sounds as of a hen who has laid an egg It broke on the Doctor with a total instantaneous smash quite like an egg He tried to speak calmly This is a disgrace An infamous disgrace Never in my life have I Words forsook him and his face grew redder Never in my life He stopped again because at the sight of him being dignified in his red drawers I was making the noise of a dozen hens It was suddenly too much for the Virginian He hastened into his room and there sank on the floor with his head in his hands The Doctor immediately slammed the door upon him and this rendered me easily fit for a lunatic asylum I cried into my pillow and wondered if the Doctor would come and kill me But he took no notice of me whatever I could hear the Virginian s convulsions through the door and also the Doctor furiously making his toilet within three feet of my head and I lay quite still with my face the other way for I was really afraid to look at him When I heard him walk to the door in his boots I ventured to peep and there he was going out with his bag in his hand As I still continued to lie weak and sore and with a mind that had ceased all operation the Virginian s door opened He was clean and dressed and decent but the devil still sported in his eye I have never seen a creature more irresistibly handsome Then my mind worked again You ve gone and done it said I He s packed his valise He ll not sleep here The Virginian looked quickly out of the door Why he s leavin us he exclaimed Drivin away right now in his little old buggy He turned to me and our eyes met solemnly over this large fact I thought that I perceived the faintest tincture of dismay in the features of Judge Henry s new responsible trusty foreman This was the first act of his administration Once again he looked out at the departing missionary Well he vindictively stated I cert nly ain t goin to run afteh him And he looked at me again Do you suppose the Judge knows I inquired He shook his head The windo shades is all down still oveh yondeh He paused I don t care he stated quite as if he had been ten years old Then he grinned guiltily I was mighty respectful to him all night Oh yes respectful Especially when you invited him to turn his wolf loose The Virginian gave a joyous gulp He now came and sat down on the edge of my bed I spoke awful good English to him most of the time said he I can y u know when I cinch my attention tight on to it Yes I cert nly spoke a lot o good English I didn t understand some of it myself He was now growing frankly pleased with his exploit He had builded so much better than he knew He got up and looked out across the crystal world of light The Doctor is at one mile crossing he said He ll get breakfast at the N lazy Y Then he returned and sat again on my bed and began to give me his real heart I never set up for being better than others Not even to myself My thoughts ain t apt to travel around making comparisons And I shouldn t wonder if my memory took as much notice of the meannesses I have done as of as of the other actions But to have to sit like a dumb lamb and let a stranger tell y u for an hour that yu re a hawg and a swine just after you have acted in a way which them that know the facts would call pretty near white Footnote three Reprinted from mister Owen Wister s The Virginian Copyright nineteen oh

horse As I had obtained some skill in the manege during my younger days it was a matter of consideration to have a saddle horse It surprised me to find good saddle horses very abundant soon after my consultation with the stage proprietor upon this topic There were strange saddle horses to sell almost every day One man was very candid about his horse he told me if his horse had a blemish he wouldn t wait to be asked about it he would tell it right out and if a man didn t want him then he needn t take him He also proposed to put him on trial for sixty days giving his note for the amount paid him for the horse to be taken up in case the animal were returned I asked him what were the principal defects of the horse He said he d been fired once because they thought he was spavined but there was no more spavin to him than there was to a fresh laid egg he was as sound as a dollar I asked him if he would just state what were the defects of the horse He answered that he once had the pink eye and added now that s honest I thought so but proceeded to question him closely I asked him if he had the bots He said not a bot I asked him if he would go He said he would go till he dropped down dead just touch him with a whip and he ll jump out of his hide I inquired how old he was He answered just eight years exactly some men he said wanted to make their horses younger than they be he was willing to speak right out and own up he was eight years I asked him if there were any other objections He said no except that he was inclined to be a little gay but he added he is so kind a child can drive him with a thread I asked him if he was a good family horse He replied that no lady that ever drew rein over him would be willing to part with him Then I asked him his price He answered that no man could have bought him for one hundred dollars a month ago but now he was willing to sell him for seventy five on account of having a note to pay This seemed such a very low price I was about saying I would take him when missus Sparrowgrass whispered that I had better see the horse first I confess I was a little afraid of losing my bargain by it but out of deference to missus S I did ask to see the horse before I bought him He said he would fetch him down No man he added ought to buy a horse unless he s saw him When the horse came down it struck me that whatever his qualities might be his personal appearance was against him One of his fore legs was shaped like the handle of our punch ladle and the remaining three legs about the fetlock were slightly bunchy Besides he had no tail to brag of and his back had a very hollow sweep from his high haunches to his low shoulder blades I was much pleased however with the fondness and pride manifested by his owner as he held up by both sides of the bridle the rather longish head of his horse surmounting a neck shaped like a pea pod and said in a sort of triumphant voice three quarters blood missus Sparrowgrass flushed up a little when she asked me if I intended to purchase that horse and added that if I did she would never want to ride So I told the man he would not suit me He answered by suddenly throwing himself upon his stomach across the backbone of his horse and then by turning round as on a pivot got up a straddle of him then he gave his horse a kick in the ribs that caused him to jump out with all his legs like a frog and then off went the spoon legged animal with a gait that was not a trot nor yet precisely pacing He rode around our grass plot twice and then pulled his horse s head up like the cock of a musket That said he is time I replied that he did seem to go pretty fast Pretty fast said his owner Well do you know mister mentioning one of the richest men in our village I replied that I was acquainted with him Well said he you know his horse I replied that I had no personal acquaintance with him Well said he he s the fastest horse in the county jist so I m willin to admit it But do you know I offered to put my horse agin his to trot I had no money to put up or rayther to spare but I offered to trot him horse agin horse and the winner to take both horses and I tell you he wouldn t do it missus Sparrowgrass got a little nervous and twitched me by the skirt of the coat Dear said she let him go I assured her that I would not buy the horse and told the man firmly I would not buy him He said very well if he didn t suit twas no use to keep a talkin but he added he d be down agin with another horse next morning that belonged to his brother and if he didn t suit me then I didn t want a horse With this remark he rode off It rains very hard said missus Sparrowgrass looking out of the window next morning Sure enough the rain was sweeping broadcast over the country and the four Sparrowgrassii were flattening a quartet of noses against the window panes believing most faithfully the man would bring the horse that belonged to his brother in spite of the elements It was hoping against hope no man having a horse to sell will trot him out in a rainstorm unless he intend to sell him at a bargain but childhood is so credulous The succeeding morning was bright however and down came the horse He had been very cleverly groomed and looked pleasant under the saddle The man led him back and forth before the door There squire s as good a hos as ever stood on iron missus Sparrowgrass asked me what he meant by that I replied it was a figurative way of expressing in horse talk that he was as good a horse as ever stood in shoe leather He s a handsome hos squire said the man I replied that he did seem to be a good looking animal but said I he does not quite come up to the description of a horse I have read Whose hos was it said he I replied it was the horse of Adonis He said he didn t know him but he added there is so many hosses stolen that the descriptions are stuck up now pretty common To put him at his ease for he seemed to think I suspected him of having stolen the horse I told him the description I meant had been written some hundreds of years ago by Shakespeare and repeated it Round hooft short joynted fetlocks shag and long Broad breast full eyes small head and nostrils wide High crest short ears straight legs and passing strong Thin mane thick tail broad buttock tender hide Squire said he that will do for a song but it ain t no p ints of a good hos Trotters nowadays go in all shapes big heads and little heads big eyes and little eyes short ears or long ears thick tail and no tail so as they have sound legs good l in good barrel and good stifle and wind squire and speed well they ll fetch a price Now this animal is what I call a hos squire he s got the p ints he s stylish he s close ribbed a free goer kind in harness single or double a good feeder I asked him if being a good feeder was a desirable quality He replied it was of course said he if your hos is off his feed he ain t good for nothin But what s the use he added of me tellin you the p ints of a good hos You re a hos man squire you know It seems to me said I there is something the matter with that left eye No sir said he and with that he pulled down the horse s head and rapidly crooking his forefinger at the suspected organ said see thar don t wink a bit But he should wink I replied Not onless his eye are weak he said To satisfy myself I asked the man to let me take the bridle He did so and as soon as I took hold of it the horse started off in a remarkable retrograde movement dragging me with him into my best bed of hybrid roses Finding we were trampling down all the best plants that had cost at auction from three and sixpence to seven shillings apiece and that the more I pulled the more he backed I finally let him have his own way and jammed him stern foremost into our largest climbing rose that had been all summer prickling itself in order to look as much like a vegetable porcupine as possible This unexpected bit of satire in his rear changed his retrograde movement to a sidelong bound by which he flirted off half the pots on the balusters upsetting my gladioluses and tuberoses in the pod and leaving great splashes of mould geraniums and red pottery in the gravel walk By this time his owner had managed to give him two pretty severe cuts with the whip which made him unmanageable so I let him go We had a pleasant time catching him again when he got among the Lima bean poles but his owner led him back with a very self satisfied expression Playful ain t he squire I replied that I thought he was and asked him if it was usual for his horse to play such pranks He said it was not You see squire he feels his oats and hain t been out of the stable for a month Use him and he s as kind as a kitten With that he put his foot in the stirrup and mounted The animal really looked very well as he moved around the grass plot and as missus Sparrowgrass seemed to fancy him I took a written guarantee that he was sound and bought him What I gave for him is a secret I have not even told missus Sparrowgrass We had passed Chicken Island and the famous house with the stone gable and the one stone chimney in which General Washington slept as he made it a point to sleep in every old stone house in Westchester County and had gone pretty far on the road past the cemetery when missus Sparrowgrass said suddenly Dear what is the matter with your horse As I had been telling the children all the stories about the river on the way I managed to get my head pretty well inside of the carriage and at the time she spoke was keeping a lookout in front with my back The remark of missus Sparrowgrass induced me to turn about and I found the new horse behaving in a most unaccountable manner He was going down hill with his nose almost to the ground running the wagon first on this side and then on the other I thought of the remark made by the man and turning again to missus Sparrowgrass said Playful isn t he The next moment I heard something breaking away in front and then the rockaway gave a lurch and stood still Upon examination I found the new horse had tumbled down broken one shaft gotten the other through the check rein so as to bring his head up with a round turn and besides had managed to put one of the traces in a single hitch around his off hind leg So soon as I had taken all the young ones and missus Sparrowgrass out of the rockaway I set to work to liberate the horse who was choking very fast with the check rein It is unpleasant to get your fishing line in a tangle when you are in a hurry for bites but I never saw fishing line in such a tangle as that harness However I set to work with a pen knife and cut him out in such a way as to make getting home by our conveyance impossible When he got up he was the sleepiest looking horse I ever saw missus Sparrowgrass said I won t you stay here with the children until I go to the nearest farm house missus Sparrowgrass replied that she would Then I took the horse with me to get him out of the way of the children and went in search of assistance The first thing the new horse did when he got about a quarter of a mile from the scene of the accident was to tumble down a bank Fortunately the bank was not over four feet high but as I went with him my trousers were rent in a grievous place While I was getting the new horse on his feet again I saw a colored person approaching who came to my assistance The first thing he did was to pull out a large jack knife and the next thing he did was to open the new horse s mouth and run the blade two or three times inside the new horse s gums Then the new horse commenced bleeding Dah sah said the man shutting up his jack knife ef t hadn t been for dat yer your hos would a bin a goner What was the matter with him said I Oh he s only jis got de blind staggers das all Say said he before I was half indignant enough at the man who had sold me such an animal say ain t your name Sparrowgrass I replied that my name was Sparrowgrass Oh said he I knows you I brung some fowls once down to you place I heerd about you and your hos Dats de hos dats got de heaves so bad heh heh You better sell dat hoss I determined to take his advice and employed him to lead my purchase to the nearest place where he would be cared for Then I went back to the rockaway but met missus Sparrowgrass and the children on the road coming to meet me She had left a man in charge of the rockaway When we got to the rockaway we found the man missing also the whip and one cushion We got another person to take charge of the rockaway and had a pleasant walk home by moonlight I think a moonlight night delicious upon the Hudson Does any person want a horse at a low price A good stylish looking animal close ribbed good loin and good stifle sound legs with only the heaves and blind staggers and a slight defect in one of his eyes If at any time he slips his bridle and gets away you can always approach him by getting on his left side I will also engage to give a written guarantee that he is sound and kind signed by the brother of his former owner SONNET OF THE LOVABLE LASS AND THE PLETHORIC DAD six BY J W FOLEY

I love you still tho you And I were wed scarce one short happy year Agone How well do I remember dear The day you put your hand in mine and through Life s good and ill tho skies were gray or blue We plighted faith that should not know a fear That was the day I kissed away the tear That trembled on your cheek like morning dew Of course I love you still You re at your best Your perihelion when you re silentest I d love you as I did dear heart of yore And still a little more nor ever tire Why I would love you like a house afire If you were only still a little more SOUL TO SOUL I think I loved you first when in your eyes I saw the glad rapt answer to the spell Of Paderewski when we heard him tell Life s gentler meaning Love s sweet sacrifice The master caught the rhythm of your sighs And then inspired the story rose and fell And sang of moonlight in a leafy dell Of souls Arcadias and dreaming skies Of hearts and hopes and purposes that blend Your bosom heaved beneath the witcheries That seemed to set a halo on his brow And then the message sobbed on to its end That s fine you murmured chewing faster please Ask him if he won t play Bedelia now YOU SAID THAT YOU WOULD DIE FOR ME You said that you would die for me if e er That price would buy me happiness I dreamed Not of devotion like to that that seemed To joy in sacrifice that tenderer Than selfish Life s small immolations were Made Love an altar whereupon it deemed It naught to offer all a shrine that gleamed With utter loyalty s red drops I ne er Believed that you were just quite in your head In saying death would prove Fidelity But when I saw the packages of white and red Your druggist showed me he s my chum you see I knew you meant dear heart just what you said When you declared that you would dye for me I CAN NOT BEAR YOUR SIGHS Your smiles dear one have all the glad surprise The sunshine hath for roses what the day Brings to the waiting lark When you are gay My spirit sings in tune and sorrow flies Away But dear I can not bear your sighs When on my knees you nestle and you lay Your tear wet face upon my shoulder Nay I can not help the pain that fills mine eyes So love whatever cup of Life you drain I ll stand for Send the cashier s check to me Smile all you want to smile and smile again But as you weigh two hundred pounds you see Why when you cuddle down upon my knee It is your size dear heart that gives me pain A HAND I HELD The heartless years have many hopes dispelled But they have left me one dear night in June They ve left the still white splendor of the moon They ve left the mem ry of a hand I held While up thro all my soul the rapture welled Of victory I hear again the croon Of twilight time the lullaby that soon To all the day s glad music shall have swelled I hold a hand I never held before A hand like which I ll never hold some more It was the first time I had ever called Twas at the club as we began to leave I held five aces but the dealer balled The ones that he had planted up his sleeve YOUR CHEEK To feel your hands stray shyly to my head And flutter down like birds that find their nest To see the gentle rise and fall of your dear breast To hear again some tender word you said To watch the little feet whose dainty tread Fell light as flowers upon the way they pressed To touch again the lips I have caressed All these are precious But your cheek of red Outlives the mem ry of all other things I d known you scarce a month or maybe two I had not yet made up my mind to speak You trots out Tifny s catalogue of rings Says No six two hundred yen will do So I remember best of all your cheek WITH ALL YOUR FAULTS You would not stop this side the farthest line Of Truth you said nor hide one little falsity From my sweet faith that was too kind to see You said a keener vision would divine All failings later bare each hid design Each poor disguise of loving s treachery That screened its weaknesses from even me How oft you said those cherry lips were mine Alone The cherries came in little jars I learned Those auburn locks I found with pain Cost forty plunks according to the bill I saw Those pearly teeth were porcelain But I forgive you for each fault that mars With all your faults dear heart I love you still HOW WE BOUGHT A SEWIN MACHINE AND ORGAN BY JOSIAH ALLEN S WIFE We done dretful well last year The crops come in first rate and Josiah had five or six heads of cattle to turn off at a big price He felt well and he proposed to me that I should have a sewin machine That man though he don t coo at me so frequent as he probable would if he had more encouragement in it is attached to me with a devotedness that is firm and almost cast iron and says he almost tenderly Samantha I will get you a sewin machine Says I Josiah I have got a couple of sewin machines by me that have run pretty well for upwards of well it haint necessary to go into particulars but they have run for considerable of a spell anyway says I I can git along without another one though no doubt it would be handy to have round But Josiah hung onto that machine And then he up and said he was goin to buy a organ Thomas Jefferson wanted one too They both seemed sot onto that organ Tirzah Ann took hern with her of course when she was married and Josiah said it seemed so awful lonesome without any Tirzah Ann or any music that it seemed almost as if two girls had married out of the family instead of one He said money couldn t buy us another Tirzah Ann but it would buy us a new organ and he was determined to have one He said it would be so handy for her to play on when she came home and for other company And then Thomas J can play quite well he can play any tune almost with one hand and he sings first rate too He and Tirzah Ann used to sing together a sight he sings bearatone and she sulfireno that is what they call it They git up so many new fangled names nowadays that I think it is most a wonder that I don t make a slip once in a while and git things wrong I should if I hadn t got a mind like a ox for strength But as I said Josiah was fairly sot on that machine and organ and I thought I d let him have his way So it got out that we was goin to buy a sewin machine and a organ Well we made up our minds on Friday pretty late in the afternoon and on Monday forenoon I was a washin when I heard a knock at the front door and I wrung my hands out of the water and went and opened it A slick lookin feller stood there and I invited him in and sot him a chair I hear you are talkin about buyin a musical instrument says he No says I we are goin to buy a organ Well says he I want to advise you not that I have any interest in it at all only I don t want to see you so imposed upon It fairly makes me mad to see a Methodist imposed upon I lean towards that perswasion myself Organs are liable to fall to pieces any minute There haint no dependence on em at all the insides of em are liable to break out at any time If you have any regard for your own welfare and safety you will buy a piano Not that I have any interest in advising you only my devotion to the cause of Right pianos never wear out Where should we git one says I for I didn t want Josiah to throw away his property Well says he as it happens I guess I have got one out here in the wagon I believe I threw one into the bottom of the wagon this mornin as I was a comin down by here on business I am glad now I did for it always makes me feel ugly to see a Methodist imposed upon Josiah came into the house in a few minutes and I told him about it and says I How lucky it is Josiah that we found out about organs before it was too late But Josiah asked the price and said he wasn t goin to pay out no three hundred dollars for he wasn t able But the man asked if we was willin to have it brought into the house for a spell we could do as we was a mind to about buyin it and of course we couldn t refuse so Josiah most broke his back a liftin it in and they set it up in the parlor and after dinner the man went away Josiah bathed his back with linement for he had strained it bad a liftin that piano and I had jest got back to my washin again I had had to put it away to git dinner when I heerd a knockin again to the front door and I pulled down my dress sleeves and went and opened it and there stood a tall slim feller and the kitchen bein all cluttered up I opened the parlor door and asked him in there and the minute he catched sight of that piano he jest lifted up both hands and says he You haint got one of them here He looked so horrified that it skairt me and says I in almost tremblin tones What is the matter with em And I added in a cheerful tone we haint bought it He looked more cheerful too as I said it and says he You may be thankful enough that you haint There haint no music in em at all hear that says he goin up and strikin the very top note It did sound flat enough Says I There must be more music in it than that though I haint no judge at all Well hear that then and he went and struck the very bottom note You see just what it is from top to bottom But it haint its total lack of music that makes me despise pianos so it is because they are so dangerous Dangerous says I Yes in thunder storms you see says he liftin up the cover here it is all wire enough for fifty lightnin rods draw the lightnin right into the room Awful dangerous No money would tempt me to have one in my house with my wife and daughter I shouldn t sleep a wink thinkin I had exposed em to such danger Good land says I I never thought on it before Well now you have thought of it you see plainly that a organ is jest what you need They are full of music safe healthy and don t cost half so much Says I A organ was what we had sot our minds on at first Well I have got one out here and I will bring it in What is the price says I One hundred and ninety dollars says he There won t be no need of bringin it in at that price says I for I have heerd Josiah say that he wouldn t give a cent over a hundred dollars Well says the feller I ll tell you what I ll do Your countenance looks so kinder natural to me and I like the looks of the country round here so well that if your mind is made up on the price you want to pay I won t let a trifle of ninety dollars part us You can have it for one hundred Well the end on t was he brung it in and sot it up the other end of the parlor and drove off And when Josiah come in from his work and Thomas J come home from Jonesville they liked it first rate But the very next day a new agent come and he looked awful skairt when he katched sight of that organ and real mad and indignant too That villain haint been a tryin to get one of them organs off onto you has he says he What is the trouble with em says I in a awestruck tone for he looked bad Why says he there is a heavy mortgage on every one of his organs If you bought one of him and paid for it it would be liable to be took away from you any minute when you was right in the middle of a tune leavin you a settin on the stool and you would lose every cent of your money Good gracious says I for it skairt me to think what a narrow chance we had run Well finally he brung in one of hisen and sot it up in the kitchen the parlor bein full on em And the fellers kep a comin and a goin at all hours For a spell at first Josiah would come in and talk with em but after a while he got tired out and when he would see one a comin he would start on a run for the barn and hide and I would have to stand the brunt of it alone One feller see Josiah a runnin for the barn and he follered him in and Josiah dove under the barn as I found out afterwards I happened to see him a crawlin out after the feller drove off Josiah come in a shakin himself for he was all covered with straw and feathers and says he Samantha there has got to be a change How is there goin to be a change says I I ll tell you says he in a whisper for fear some on em was prowlin round the house yet we will git up before light to morrow mornin and go to Jonesville and buy a organ right out I fell in with the idee and we started for Jonesville the next mornin We got there jest after the break of day and bought it of the man to the breakfast table Says Josiah to me afterwards as we was goin down into the village Let s keep dark about buyin one and see how many of the creeters will be a besettin on us to day So we kep still and there was half a dozen fellers follerin us round all the time a most into stores and groceries and the manty makers and they would stop us on the sidewalk and argue with us about their organs and pianos One feller a tall slim chap never let Josiah out of his sight a minute and he follered him when he went after his horse and walked by the side of the wagon clear down to the store where I was a arguin all the way about his piano Josiah had bought a number of things and left em to the store and when we got there there stood the organ man by the side of the things jest like a watch dog He knew Josiah would come and git em and he could git the last word with him Amongst other things Josiah had bought a barrel of salt and the piano feller that had stuck to Josiah so tight that day offered to help him on with it And the organ man not goin to be outdone by the other he offered too Josiah kinder winked to me and then he held the old mare and let em lift They wasn t used to such kind of work and it fell back on em once or twice and most squashed em but they nipped to and lifted again and finally got it on but they was completely tuckered out And then Josiah got in and thanked em for the liftin and the organ man a wipin the sweat offen his face that had started out in his hard labor said he should be down to morrow mornin and the piano man a pantin for breath told Josiah not to make up his mind till he came he should be down that night if he got rested enough And then Josiah told em that he should be glad to see em down a visitin any time but he had jest bought a organ I don t know but what they would have laid holt of Josiah if they hadn t been so tuckered out but as it was they was too beat out to look anything but sneakin and so we drove off The manty maker had told me that day that there was two or three new agents with new kinds of sewin machines jest come to Jonesville and I was tellin Josiah on it when we met a middle aged man and he looked at us pretty close and finally he asked us as he passed by if we could tell him where Josiah Allen lived Says Josiah I m livin at present in a Democrat Says I In this one horse wagon you know Says he You are thinkin of buyin a sewin machine haint you Says Josiah I am a turnin my mind that way At that the man turned his horse round and follered us and I see he had a sewin machine in front of his wagon We had the old mare and the colt and seein a strange horse come up so close behind us the colt started off full run towards Jonesville and then run down a cross road and into a lot Says the man behind us I am a little younger than you be mister Allen if you will hold my horse I will go after the colt with pleasure Josiah was glad enough and so he got into the feller s wagon but before he started off the man says he You can look at that machine in front of you while I am gone I tell you frankly that there haint another machine equal to it in America it requires no strength at all infants can run it for days at a time or idiots if anybody knows enough to set and whistle they can run this machine and it s especially adapted to the blind blind people can run it jest as well as them that can see A blind woman last year in one day made forty three dollars a makin leather aprons stitched them all round the age two rows She made two dozen of em and then she made four dozen gauze veils the same day without changin the needle That is one of the beauties of the machine its goin from leather to lace and back again without changin the needle It is so tryin for wimmen every time they want to go from leather to gauze and book muslin to have to change the needle but you can see for yourself that it haint got its equal in North America He heerd the colt whinner and Josiah stood up in the wagon and looked after it So he started off down the cross road And we sot there feelin considerable like a procession Josiah holdin the stranger s horse and I the old mare and as we sot there up driv another slick lookin chap and I bein ahead he spoke to me and says he Can you direct me mom to Josiah Allen s house It is about a mile from here and I added in a friendly tone Josiah is my husband Is he says he in a genteel tone Yes says I we have been to Jonesville and our colt run down that cross road and I see says he interruptin of me I see how it is And then he went on in a lower tone If you think of buyin a sewin machine don t git one of that feller in the wagon behind you I know him well he is one of the most worthless shacks in the country as you can plainly see by the looks of his countenance If I ever see a face in which knave and villain is wrote down it is on hisen Any one with half an eye can see that he would cheat his grandmother out of her snuff handkerchief if he got a chance He talked so fast that I couldn t git a chance to put in a word age ways for Josiah His sewin machines are utterly worthless he haint never sold one yet he cant His character has got out folks know him There was a lady tellin me the other day that her machine she bought of him all fell to pieces in less than twenty four hours after she bought it fell onto her infant a sweet little babe and crippled it for life I see your husband is havin a hard time of it with that colt I will jest hitch my horse here to the fence and go down and help him I want to have a little talk with him before he comes back here So he started off on the run I told Josiah what he said about him for it madded me but Josiah took it cool He seemed to love to set there and see them two men run I never did see a colt act as that one did they didn t have time to pass a word with each other to find out their mistake it kep em so on a keen run They would git it headed towards us and then it would kick up its heels and run into some lot and canter round in a circle with its head up in the air and then bring up short ag inst the fence and then they would leap over the fence The first one had white pantaloons on but he didn t mind em over he would go right into sikuta or elderbushes and they would wave their hats at it and holler and whistle and bark like dogs and the colt would whinner and start off again right the wrong way and them two men would go a pantin after it They had been a runnin nigh onto half an hour when a good lookin young feller come along and seein me a settin still and holdin the old mare he up and says Are you in any trouble that I can assist you Says I We are goin home from Jonesville Josiah and me and our colt got away and But Josiah interrupted me and says he And them two fools a caperin after it are sewin machine agents The good lookin chap see all through it in a minute and he broke out into a laugh it would have done your soul good to hear it was so clear and hearty and honest But he didn t say a word he drove out to go by us and we see then that he had a sewin machine in the buggy Are you a agent says Josiah Yes says he What sort of a machine is this here says Josiah liftin up the cloth from the machine in front of him A pretty good one says the feller lookin at the name on it Is yours as good says Josiah I think it is better says he And then he started up his horse Hello stop says Josiah The feller stopped Why don t you run down other fellers machines and beset us to buy yourn Because I don t make a practice of stoppin people on the street Do you haunt folks day and night foller em up ladders through trap doors down sullers and under barns No says the young chap I show people how my machine works if they want it I sell it and if they don t I leave How much is your machine says Josiah seventy five dollars Can t you says Josiah because I look so much like your old father or because I am a Methodist or because my wife s mother used to live neighbor to your grandmother let me have it for twenty five dollars The feller got up on his wagon and turned his machine round so we could see it plain it was a beauty and says he You see this machine sir I think it is the best one made although there is no great difference between this and the one over there but I think what difference there is is in this one s favor You can have it for seventy five dollars if you want it if not I will drive on How do you like the looks on it Samantha Says I It is the kind I wanted to git Josiah took out his wallet and counted out seventy five dollars and says he Put that machine into that wagon where Samantha is The good lookin feller was jest liftin of it in and countin over his money when the two fellers come up with the colt It seemed that they had had a explanation as they was comin back I see they had as quick as I catched sight on em for they was a walkin one on one side of the road and the other on the other most tight up to the fence They was most dead the colt had run em so and it did seem as if their faces couldn t look no redder nor more madder than they did as we catched sight on em and Josiah thanked em for drivin back the colt but when they see that the other feller had sold us a machine their faces did look redder and madder But I didn t care a mite we drove off tickled enough that we had got through with our sufferin s with agents And the colt had got so beat out a runnin and racin that he drove home first rate walkin along by the old mare as stiddy as a deacon CHEER FOR THE

A DESPERATE RACE BY J F KELLEY Some years ago I was one of a convivial party that met in the principal hotel in the town of Columbus Ohio the seat of government of the Buckeye state It was a winter s evening when all without was bleak and stormy and all within were blithe and gay when song and story made the circuit of the festive board filling up the chasms of life with mirth and laughter We had met for the express purpose of making a night of it and the pious intention was duly and most religiously carried out The Legislature was in session in that town and not a few of the worthy legislators were present upon this occasion One of these worthies I will name as he not only took a big swath in the evening s entertainment but he was a man more generally known than our worthy President James K Polk That man was the famous Captain Riley whose Narrative of suffering and adventures is pretty generally known all over the civilized world Captain Riley was a fine fat good humored joker who at the period of my story was the representative of the Dayton district and lived near that little city when at home Well Captain Riley had amused the company with many of his far famed and singular adventures which being mostly told before and read by millions of people that have seen his book I will not attempt to repeat Many were the stories and adventures told by the company when it came to the turn of a well known gentleman who represented the Cincinnati district As mister is yet among the living and perhaps not disposed to be the subject of joke or story I do not feel at liberty to give his name mister was a slow believer of other men s adventures and at the same time much disposed to magnify himself into a marvellous hero whenever the opportunity offered As Captain Riley wound up one of his truthful though really marvellous adventures mister coolly remarked that the captain s story was all very well but it did not begin to compare with an adventure that he had once upon a time on the Ohio below the present city of Cincinnati Let s have it Let s have it resounded from all hands Well gentlemen said the Senator clearing his voice for action and knocking the ashes from his cigar against the arm of his chair gentlemen I am not in the habit of spinning yarns of marvellous or fictitious matters and therefore it is scarcely necessary to affirm upon the responsibility of my reputation gentlemen that what I am about to tell you I most solemnly proclaim to be truth and Oh never mind that go on mister chimed the party Well gentlemen in eighteen I came down the Ohio River and settled at Losanti now called Cincinnati It was at that time but a little settlement of some twenty or thirty log and frame cabins and where now stand the Broadway Hotel and blocks of stores and dwelling houses was the cottage and corn patch of old mister the tailor who by the bye bought that land for the making of a coat for one of the settlers Well I put up my cabin with the aid of my neighbors and put in a patch of corn and potatoes about where the Fly Market now stands and set about improving my lot house et cetera Occasionally I took up my rifle and started off with my dog down the river to look up a little deer or bar meat then very plenty along the river The blasted red skins were lurking about and hovering around the settlement and every once in a while picked off some of our neighbors or stole our cattle or horses I hated the red demons and made no bones of peppering the blasted sarpents whenever I got a sight of them In fact the red rascals had a dread of me and had laid a good many traps to get my scalp but I wasn t to be catched napping No no gentlemen I was too well up to em for that Well I started off one morning pretty early to take a hunt and traveled a long way down the river over the bottoms and hills but couldn t find no bar nor deer About four o clock in the afternoon I made tracks for the settlement again By and by I sees a buck just ahead of me walking leisurely down the river I slipped up with my faithful old dog close in my rear to within clever shooting distance and just as the buck stuck his nose in the drink I drew a bead upon his top knot and over he tumbled and splurged and bounded a while when I came up and relieved him by cutting his wizen Well but what has that to do with an adventure said Riley Hold on a bit if you please gentlemen by Jove it had a great deal to do with it For while I was busy skinning the hind quarters of the buck and stowing away the kidney fat in my hunting shirt I heard a noise like the breaking of brush under a moccasin up the bottom My dog heard it and started up to reconnoiter and I lost no time in reloading my rifle I had hardly got my priming out before my dog raised a howl and broke through the brush toward me with his tail down as he was not used to doing unless there were wolves painters panthers or Injins about I picked up my knife and took up my line of march in a skulking trot up the river The frequent gullies on the lower bank made it tedious traveling there so I scrabbled up to the upper bank which was pretty well covered with buckeye and sycamore and very little underbrush One peep below discovered to me three as big and strapping red rascals gentlemen as you ever clapped your eyes on Yes there they came not above six hundred yards in my rear shouting and yelling like hounds and coming after me like all possessed Well said an old woodsman sitting at the table you took a tree of course Did I No gentlemen I took no tree just then but I took to my heels like sixty and it was just as much as my old dog could do to keep up with me I run until the whoops of my red skins grew fainter and fainter behind me and clean out of wind I ventured to look behind me and there came one single red whelp puffing and blowing not three hundred yards in my rear He had got on to a piece of bottom where the trees were small and scarce Now thinks I old fellow I ll have you So I trotted off at a pace sufficient to let my follower gain on me and when he had got just about near enough I wheeled and fired and down I brought him dead as a door nail at a hundred and twenty yards Then you skelp d scalped him immediately said the backwoodsman Very clear of it gentlemen for by the time I got my rifle loaded here came the other two red skins shouting and whooping close on me and away I broke again like a quarter horse I was now about five miles from the settlement and it was getting toward sunset I ran till my wind began to be pretty short when I took a look back and there they came snorting like mad buffaloes one about two or three hundred yards ahead of the other so I acted possum again until the foremost Injin got pretty well up and I wheeled and fired at the very moment he was drawing a bead on me he fell head over stomach into the dirt and up came the last one So you laid for him and gasped several No continued the member I didn t lay for him I hadn t time to load so I laid my legs to ground and started again I heard every bound he made after me I ran and ran until the fire flew out of my eyes and the old dog s tongue hung out of his mouth a quarter of a yard long Phe e e e w whistled somebody Fact gentlemen Well what I was to do I didn t know rifle empty no big trees about and a murdering red Indian not three hundred yards in my rear and what was worse just then it occurred to me that I was not a great ways from a big creek now called Mill Creek and there I should be pinned at last Just at this juncture I struck my toe against a root and down I tumbled and my old dog over me Before I could scrabble up The Indian fired gasped the old woodsman He did gentlemen and I felt the ball strike me under the shoulder but that didn t seem to put any embargo upon my locomotion for as soon as I got up I took off again quite freshened by my fall I heard the red skin close behind me coming booming on and every minute I expected to have his tomahawk dashed into my head or shoulders Something kind of cool began to trickle down my legs into my boots Blood eh for the shot the varmint gin you said the old woodsman in a great state of excitement I thought so said the Senator but what do you think it was Not being blood we were all puzzled to know what the blazes it could be when Riley observed I suppose you had Melted the deer fat which I had stuck in the breast of my hunting shirt and the grease was running down my leg until my feet got so greasy that my heavy boots flew off and one hitting the dog nearly knocked his brains out We all grinned which the member noticing observed I hope gentlemen no man here will presume to think I m exaggerating Oh certainly not Go on mister we all chimed in Well the ground under my feet was soft and being relieved of my heavy boots I put off with double quick time and seeing the creek about half a mile off I ventured to look over my shoulder to see what kind of chance there was to hold up and load The red skin was coming jogging along pretty well blowed out about five hundred yards in the rear Thinks I Here goes to load anyhow So at it I went in went the powder and putting on my patch down went the ball about half way and off snapped my ramrod Thunder and lightning shouted the old woodsman who was worked up to the top notch in the member s story Good gracious wasn t I in a pickle There was the red whelp within two hundred yards of me pacing along and loading up his rifle as he came I jerked out the broken ramrod dashed it away and started on priming up as I cantered off determined to turn and give the red skin a blast anyhow as soon as I reached the creek I was now within a hundred yards of the creek could see the smoke from the settlement chimneys A few more jumps and I was by the creek The Indian was close upon me he gave a whoop and I raised my rifle on he came knowing that I had broken my ramrod and my load not down another whoop whoop and he was within fifty yards of me I pulled trigger and And killed him chuckled Riley No sir I missed fire And the red skin shouted the old woodsman in a frenzy of excitement Fired and killed me The screams and shouts that followed this finale brought landlord Noble servants and hostlers running up stairs to see if the house was on fire AS GOOD AS A PLAY BY HORACE E SCUDDER 
5906-59283-0000	train-other-500	There was quite a row of them on the mantel piece They were all facing front and it looked as if they had come out of the wall behind and were on their little stage facing the audience
5906-59283-0001	train-other-500	There was the bronze monk reading a book by the light of a candle who had a private opening under his girdle so that sometimes his head was thrown violently back
5906-59283-0002	train-other-500	and one looked down into him and found him full of brimstone matches Then the little boy leaning against a greyhound he was made of Parian
none	none	 very fine Parian too 
5906-59283-0003	train-other-500	so that one would expect to find a glass cover over him but no the glass cover stood over a cat and a cat made of worsted too still it was a very old cat
5906-59283-0004	train-other-500	fifty years old in fact There was another young person there young like the boy leaning on a greyhound and she too was of Parian she was very fair in front but behind ah
5906-59283-0005	train-other-500	that is a secret which is not quite time yet to tell One other stood there at least she seemed to stand but nobody could see her feet for her dress was so very wide and so finely flounced
5906-59283-0006	train-other-500	She was the china girl that rose out of a pen wiper The fire in the grate below was of soft coal and flashed up and down
none	none	 throwing little jets of flame up 
5906-59283-0007	train-other-500	that made very pretty foot lights So here was a stage and here were the actors but where was the audience Oh the Audience was in the arm chair in front He had a special seat he was a critic
5906-59283-0008	train-other-500	and could get up when he wanted to when the play became tiresome and go out It is painful to say such things out loud said the Boy leaning against a greyhound with a trembling voice
5906-59283-0009	train-other-500	but we have been together so long and these people round us never will go away Dear girl will you you know It was the Parian girl that he spoke to but he did not look at her he could not

5906-59283-0014	train-other-500	your head flies back How the blood must run down And then you re full of brimstone matches He he
none	none	 and the Cat made of worsted grinned out loud The Boy leaning against a greyhound spoke again 
5906-59283-0015	train-other-500	and sighed I am of Parian you know and there is no one else here of Parian except yourself And the greyhound said the Parian girl Yes and the greyhound said he eagerly
5906-59283-0016	train-other-500	He belongs to me Come a glass case is nothing to it We could roam oh we could roam I don t like roaming Then we could stay at home and lean against the greyhound No

5906-59283-0024	train-other-500	said the bronze Monk reading a book That is not congratulation that is advice

5906-59283-0030	train-other-500	and the China girl rising out of a pen wiper
none	none	 Be happy said he Happy said the Cat made of worsted Happy Still they were happy THE AUTOCRAT OF THE BREAKFAST TABLE BY OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES It is not easy at the best for two persons talking together to make the most of each other s thoughts there are so many of them The company looked as if they wanted an explanation When John and Thomas for instance are talking together it is natural enough that among the six there should be more or less confusion and misapprehension Our landlady turned pale no doubt she thought there was a screw loose in my intellects and that involved the probable loss of a boarder A severe looking person who wears a Spanish cloak and a sad cheek fluted by the passions of the melodrama whom I understand to be the professional ruffian of the neighboring theater alluded with a certain lifting of the brow drawing down of the corners of the mouth and somewhat rasping voce di petti to Falstaff s nine men in buckram Everybody looked up I believe the old gentleman opposite was afraid I should seize the carving knife at any rate he slid it to one side as it were carelessly I think I said I can make it plain to Benjamin Franklin here that there are at least six personalities distinctly to be recognized as taking part in that dialogue between John and Thomas one The real John known only to his Maker two John s ideal John never the real one and often Three Johns very unlike him three Thomas s ideal John never the real John nor John s John but often very unlike either one The real Thomas Three Thomases two Thomas s ideal Thomas three John s ideal Thomas Only one of the three Johns is taxed only one can be weighed on a platform balance but the other two are just as important in the conversation Let us suppose the real John to be old dull and ill looking But as the Higher Powers have not conferred on men the gift of seeing themselves in the true light John very possibly conceives himself to be youthful witty and fascinating and talks from the point of view of this ideal Thomas again believes him to be an artful rogue we will say therefore he is so far as Thomas s attitude in the conversation is concerned an artful rogue though really simple and stupid The same conditions apply to the three Thomases It follows that until a man can be found who knows himself as his Maker knows him or who sees himself as others see him there must be at least six persons engaged in every dialogue between two Of these the least important philosophically speaking is the one that we have called the real person No wonder two disputants often get angry when there are six of them talking and listening all at the same time A very unphilosophical application of the above remarks was made by a young fellow answering to the name of John who sits near me at table A certain basket of peaches a rare vegetable little known to boarding houses was on its way to me via this unlettered Johannes He appropriated the three that remained in the basket remarking that there was just one apiece for him I convinced him that his practical inference was hasty and illogical but in the mean time he had eaten the peaches OUR SUMATRA CORRESPONDENCE This island is now the property of the Stamford family having been won it is said in a raffle by Sir Stamford during the stock gambling mania of the South Sea Scheme The history of this gentleman may be found in an interesting series of questions unfortunately not yet answered contained in the Notes and Queries This island is entirely surrounded by the ocean which here contains a large amount of saline substance crystallizing in cubes remarkable for their symmetry and frequently displays on its surface during calm weather the rainbow tints of the celebrated South Sea bubbles The summers are oppressively hot and the winters very probably cold but this fact can not be ascertained precisely as for some peculiar reason the mercury in these latitudes never shrinks as in more northern regions and thus the thermometer is rendered useless in winter The principal vegetable productions of the island are the pepper tree and the bread fruit tree Pepper being very abundantly produced a benevolent society was organized in London during the last century for supplying the natives with vinegar and oysters as an addition to that delightful condiment Note received from doctor D P It is said however that as the oysters were of the kind called natives in England the natives of Sumatra in obedience to a natural instinct refused to touch them and confined themselves entirely to the crew of the vessel in which they were brought over This information was received from one of the oldest inhabitants a native himself and exceedingly fond of missionaries He is said also to be very skilful in the cuisine peculiar to the island During the season of gathering the pepper the persons employed are subject to various incommodities the chief of which is violent and long continued sternutation or sneezing Such is the vehemence of these attacks that the unfortunate subjects of them are often driven backward for great distances at immense speed on the well known principle of the aeolipile Not being able to see where they are going these poor creatures dash themselves to pieces against the rocks or are precipitated over the cliffs and thus many valuable lives are lost annually As during the whole pepper harvest they feed exclusively on this stimulant they become exceedingly irritable The smallest injury is resented with ungovernable rage A young man suffering from the pepper fever as it is called cudgeled another most severely for appropriating a superannuated relative of trifling value and was only pacified by having a present made him of a pig of that peculiar species of swine called the Peccavi by the Catholic Jews who it is well known abstain from swine s flesh in imitation of the Mahometan Buddhists The bread tree grows abundantly Its branches are well known to Europe and America under the familiar name of macaroni The smaller twigs are called vermicelli They have a decided animal flavor as may be observed in the soups containing them Macaroni being tubular is the favorite habitat of a very dangerous insect which is rendered peculiarly ferocious by being boiled The government of the island therefore never allows a stick of it to be exported without being accompanied by a piston with which its cavity may at any time be thoroughly swept out These are commonly lost or stolen before the macaroni arrives among us It therefore always contains many of these insects which however generally die of old age in the shops so that accidents from this source are comparatively rare The fruit of the bread tree consists principally of hot rolls The buttered muffin variety is supposed to be a hybrid with a cocoanut palm the cream found on the milk of the cocoanut exuding from the hybrid in the shape of butter just as the ripe fruit is splitting so as to fit it for the tea table where it is commonly served up with cold There I don t want to read any more of it You see that many of these statements are highly improbable No I shall not mention the paper No neither of them wrote it though it reminds me of the style of these popular writers I think the fellow that wrote it must have been reading some of their stories and got them mixed up with his history and geography I don t suppose he lies he sells it to the editor who knows how many squares off Sumatra is The editor who sells it to the public by the way the papers have been very civil haven t they to the the what d ye call it Northern Magazine isn t it got up by some of these Come outers down East as an organ for their local peculiarities It is a very dangerous thing for a literary man to indulge his love for the ridiculous People laugh with him just so long as he amuses them but if he attempts to be serious they must still have their laugh and so they laugh at him There is in addition however a deeper reason for this than would at first appear Do you know that you feel a little superior to every man who makes you laugh whether by making faces or verses Are you aware that you have a pleasant sense of patronizing him when you condescend so far as to let him turn somersets literal or literary for your royal delight Now if a man can only be allowed to stand on a dais or raised platform and look down on his neighbor who is exerting his talent for him oh it is all right first rate performance and all the rest of the fine phrases But if all at once the performer asks the gentleman to come upon the floor and stepping upon the platform begins to talk down at him ah that wasn t in the program I have never forgotten what happened when Sydney Smith who as everybody knows was an exceedingly sensible man and a gentleman every inch of him ventured to preach a sermon on the Duties of Royalty The Quarterly so savage and tartly came down upon him in the most contemptuous style as a joker of jokes a diner out of the first water in one of his own phrases sneering at him insulting him as nothing but a toady of a court sneaking behind the anonymous would ever have been mean enough to do to a man of his position and genius or to any decent person even If I were giving advice to a young fellow of talent with two or three facets to his mind I would tell him by all means to keep his wit in the background until after he had made a reputation by his more solid qualities And so to an actor Hamlet first and Bob Logic afterward if you like but don t think as they say poor Liston used to that people will be ready to allow that you can do anything great with Macbeth s dagger after flourishing about with Paul Pry s umbrella Do you know too that the majority of men look upon all who challenge their attention for a while at least as beggars and nuisances They always try to get off as cheaply as they can and the cheapest of all things they can give a literary man pardon the forlorn pleasantry is the funny bone That is all very well so far as it goes but satisfies no man and makes a good many angry as I told you on a former occasion Oh indeed no I am not ashamed to make you laugh occasionally I think I could read you something I have in my desk that would probably make you smile Perhaps I will read it one of these days if you are patient with me when I am sentimental and reflective not just now The ludicrous has its place in the universe it is not a human invention but one of the Divine ideas illustrated in the practical jokes as kittens and monkeys long before Aristophanes or Shakespeare How curious it is that we always consider solemnity and the absence of all gay surprises and encounter of wits as essential to the idea of the future life of those whom we thus deprive of half their faculties and then called blessed There are not a few who even in this life seem to be preparing themselves for that smileless eternity to which they look forward by banishing all gaiety from their hearts and all joyousness from their countenances I meet one such in the street not unfrequently a person of intelligence and education but who gives me and all that he passes such a rayless and chilling look of recognition something as if he were one of Heaven s assessors come down to doom every acquaintance he met that I have sometimes begun to sneeze on the spot and gone home with a violent cold dating from that instant I don t doubt he would cut his kitten s tail off if he caught her playing with it Please tell me who taught her to play with it CAESAR S QUIET LUNCH WITH CICERO BY JAMES T FIELDS Have you read how Julius Caesar Made a call on Cicero In his modest Formian villa Many and many a year ago I shall pass your way wrote Caesar On the Saturnalia Third And I ll just drop in my Tullius For a quiet friendly word Don t make a stranger of me Marc Nor be at all put out A snack of anything you have Will serve my need no doubt I wish to show my confidence The invitation s mine I come to share your simple food And taste your honest wine Up rose M Tullius Cicero And seized a Roman punch Then mused upon the god like soul Was coming round to lunch By Hercules he murmured low Unto his lordly self There are not many dainties left Upon my pantry shelf But what I have shall Julius share What ho he proudly cried Great Caesar comes this way anon To sit my chair beside A dish of lampreys quickly stew And cook them with a turn For that s his favorite pabulum From Mamurra I learn His slaves obey their lord s command The table soon is laid For two distinguished gentlemen One rather bald tis said When lo a messenger appears To sound approach and then Brave Caesar comes to greet his friend With twice a thousand men His cohorts rend the air with shouts That is their dust you see The trumpeters announce him near Said Marcus Woe is me Fly Cassius fly assign a guard Borrow what tents you can Encamp his soldiers round the field Or I m a ruined man Get sheep and oxen by the score Buy corn at any price O Jupiter befriend me now And give me your advice It turned out better than he feared Things proved enough and good And Caesar made himself at home And much enjoyed his food But Marcus had an awful fright That can not be denied I m glad tis over when it was The host sat down and sighed And when he wrote to Atticus And all the story told He ended his epistle thus J C s a warrior bold A vastly entertaining man In Learning quite immense So full of literary skill And most uncommon sense But frankly I should never say No trouble sir at all And when you pass this way again Give us another call COMIN HOME THANKSGIVIN BY JAMES BALL NAYLOR I ve clean fergot my rheumatiz Hain t nary limp n r hobble I m feelin like a

of our Southern States a class the individuals of which are connected by a general similarity of position and circumstance but present a field to the student of man infinite in variety rich in originality 
5189_59288_000004_000000	train-clean-360	As the isolated oak that spreads his umbrageous top in the meadow surpasses his spindling congener of the forest so does the country gentleman alone in the midst of his broad estate outgrow the man of crowds and conventionalities in our cities 
5189_59288_000004_000001	train-clean-360	The oak may have the advantage in the comparison as his locality and consequent superiority are permanent 
5189_59288_000004_000002	train-clean-360	The Squire out of his own district we ignore 
5189_59288_000004_000003	train-clean-360	Whether intrinsically or simply in default of comparison at home he is invariably a great man 
5189_59288_000004_000004	train-clean-360	Such at least was Squire Hardy 
none	none	Sour and cynical in speech yet overflowing with human kindness contemning luxury and expense in dress and equipage but princely in his hospitality praising the olden time to the disparagement of the present the mortal foe of progressionists and fast people in every department above all a philosopher of his own school he judged by the law of Procrustes and permitted no appeals opinionated and arbitrary as the Czar he was sauced by his negroes respected and loved by his neighbors led by the nose by his wife and daughters and the abject slave of his grandchildren His house was as big as a barn and as his sons and daughters married they brought their mates home to the old mansion
5189_59288_000005_000001	train-clean-360	 It will be time enough for them to hive quoth the Squire when the old box is full 
5189_59288_000006_000000	train-clean-360	Notwithstanding his contempt for fast men nowadays he is rather pleased with any allusion to his own youthful reputation in that line and not unfrequently tells a good story on himself 
none	none	We can not omit one told by a neighbor as being characteristic of the times and manners forty years ago 
5189_59288_000007_000000	train-clean-360	At Culpepper Court house or some court house thereabout Dick Hardy then a good humored gay young bachelor and the prime favorite of both sexes was called upon to carve the pig at the court dinner 
5189_59288_000007_000001	train-clean-360	The district judge was at the table the lawyers justices and everybody else that felt disposed to dine 
none	none	At Dick s right elbow sat a militia colonel who was tricked out in all the pomp and circumstance admitted by his rank 
5189_59288_000007_000003	train-clean-360	He had probably been engaged on some court martial imposing fifty cent fines on absentees from the last general muster Howbeit Dick in thrusting his fork into the back of the pig bespattered the officer s regimentals with some of the superfluous gravy 
5189_59288_000007_000004	train-clean-360	 Beg your pardon said Dick as he went on with his carving 
5189_59288_000007_000005	train-clean-360	Now these were times when the war spirit was high and chivalry at a premium 
5189_59288_000007_000006	train-clean-360	 Beg your pardon might serve as a napkin to wipe the stain from one s honor but did not touch the question of the greased and spotted regimentals 
5189_59288_000008_000000	train-clean-360	The colonel swelling with wrath seized a spoon and deliberately dipping it into the gravy dashed it over Dick s prominent shirt frill 
5189_59288_000009_000000	train-clean-360	All saw the act and with open eyes and mouth sat in astonished silence waiting to see what would be done next 
5189_59288_000009_000001	train-clean-360	The outraged citizen calmly laid down his knife and fork and looked at his frill the officer and the pig one after another 
5189_59288_000009_000002	train-clean-360	The colonel unmindful of the pallid countenance and significant glances of the burning eye leaned back in his chair with arms akimbo regarding the young farmer with cool disdain 
5189_59288_000009_000003	train-clean-360	A murmur of surprise and indignation arose from the congregated guests 
none	none	Dick s face turned red as a turkey gobbler s 
5189_59288_000009_000005	train-clean-360	He deliberately took the pig by the hind legs and with a sudden whirl brought it down upon the head of the unlucky officer 
5189_59288_000009_000006	train-clean-360	Stunned by the squashing blow astounded and blinded with streams of gravy and wads of stuffing he attempted to rise but blow after blow from the fat pig fell upon his bewildered head 
5189_59288_000009_000007	train-clean-360	He seized a carving knife and attempted to defend himself with blind but ineffectual fury and at length with a desperate effort rose and took to his heels 
5189_59288_000009_000008	train-clean-360	Dick Hardy whose wrath waxed hotter and hotter followed belaboring him unmercifully at every step around the table through the hall and into the street the crowd shouting and applauding 
none	none	We are sorry to learn that among this crowd were lawyers sheriffs magistrates and constables and that even his honor the judge forgetting his dignity and position shouted in a loud voice Give it to him Dick Hardy 
5189_59288_000010_000001	train-clean-360	There s no law in Christendom against basting a man with a roast pig Dick s weapon failed before his anger and when at length the battered colonel escaped into the door of a friendly dwelling the victor had nothing in his hands but the hind legs of the roaster 
none	none	He re entered the dining room flourishing these over his head and venting his still unappeased wrath in great oaths 
5189_59288_000011_000000	train-clean-360	The company reassembled and finished their dinner as best they might In reply to a toast Hardy made a speech wherein he apologized for sacrificing the principal dinner dish and as he expressed it for putting public property to private uses 
5189_59288_000011_000001	train-clean-360	In reply to this speech a treat was ordered 
none	none	In those good old days folks were not so virtuous but that a man might have cakes and ale without being damned for it and it is presumable the day wound up with a spree 
5189_59288_000012_000000	train-clean-360	After the squire got older and a family grew up around him he was not always victorious in his contests 
none	none	For example a question lately arose about the refurnishing of the house 
5189_59288_000012_000002	train-clean-360	On their return from a visit to Richmond the ladies took it into their heads that the parlors looked bare and old fashioned and it was decided by them in secret conclave that a change was necessary 
5189_59288_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 What said he in a towering passion isn t it enough that you spend your time and money in vinegar to sour sweet peaches and your sugar to sweeten crab apples that you must turn the house you were born in topsy turvy 
5189_59288_000013_000001	train-clean-360	God help us 
5189_59288_000013_000002	train-clean-360	we ve a house with windows to let the light in and you want curtains to keep it out we ve plastered the walls to make them white and now you want to paste blue paper over them we ve waxed floors to walk on and we must pay two dollars a yard for a carpet to save the oak plank 
5189_59288_000013_000003	train-clean-360	Begone with your nonsense ye demented jades 
5189_59288_000014_000000	train-clean-360	The squire smote the oak floor with his heavy cane and the rosy petitioners fled from his presence laughing 
5189_59288_000014_000001	train-clean-360	In due time however the parlors were furnished with carpets curtains paper and all the fixtures of modern luxury 
5189_59288_000014_000002	train-clean-360	The ladies were of course greatly delighted and while professing great aversion and contempt for the tawdry lumber it was plain to see that the worthy man enjoyed their pleasure as much as they did the new furniture 
none	none	On another occasion too did the doughty squire suffer defeat under circumstances far more humiliating and from an adversary far less worthy 
5189_59288_000016_000000	train-clean-360	The western horizon was blushing rosy red at the coming of the sun whose descending chariot was hidden by the thick Indian summer haze that covered lowland and mountain as it were with a violet tinted veil 
none	none	This was the condition of things we were going to say when Squire Hardy sallied forth charged with a small bag of salt for the purpose of looking after his farm generally and particularly of salting his sheep It was an interesting sight to see the old gentleman with his dignified portly figure marching at the head of a long procession of improved breeds the universally received emblems of innocence and patience 
5189_59288_000016_000002	train-clean-360	Barring his modern costume he might have suggested to the artist s mind a picture of one of the Patriarchs 
none	none	Having come to a convenient place or having tired himself crying co nan co nan at the top of his voice the squire halted 
5189_59288_000017_000001	train-clean-360	The black ram halted and the long procession of ewes and well grown lambs moved up in a dense semicircle and also halted expressing their pleasure at the expected treat by gentle bleatings 
5189_59288_000017_000002	train-clean-360	The squire stooped to spread the salt 
5189_59288_000017_000003	train-clean-360	The black ram either from most uncivil impatience or mistaking the movement of the proprietor s coat tail for a challenge pitched into him incontinently 
none	none	Plenum sed as the Oxonions say 
5189_59288_000017_000005	train-clean-360	An attack from behind so sudden and unexpected threw the squire sprawling on his face into a stone pile 
5189_59288_000018_000000	train-clean-360	Oh never was the thunder s jar The red tornado s wasting wing Or all the elemental war 
5189_59288_000019_000000	train-clean-360	like the fury of Squire Hardy on that occasion 
none	none	He recovered his feet with the agility of a boy his nose bleeding and a stone in each hand 
5189_59288_000020_000001	train-clean-360	The timid flock looked all aghast while the audacious offender so far from having shown any disposition to skulk stood shaking his head and threatening as if he had a mind to follow up the dastardly attack 
5189_59288_000020_000002	train-clean-360	The squire let fly one stone which grazed the villain s head and killed a lamb 
5189_59288_000020_000003	train-clean-360	With the other he crippled a favorite ewe 
none	none	The ram still showed fight and the vengeful proprietor would probably have soon decimated his flock had not Porte Crayon who had been squirrel shooting made his appearance in time to save them
5189_59288_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 Quick quick young man your gun let me shoot the cursed brute on the spot 
none	none	The squire was frantic with rage the cause of which our hero having seen something of the affray easily divined He was unwilling however to trust his hair triggered piece in the hands of his excited host
5189_59288_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 By your leave Squire and by your orders I ll do the shooting myself Which of them was it 
none	none	The ram the d d black ram kill him shoot don t let him live a minute 
5189_59288_000025_000000	train-clean-360	Crayon leveled his piece and fired 
5189_59288_000025_000001	train-clean-360	The offender made a bound and fell dead the black blood spouting from his forehead in a stream as thick as your thumb 
5189_59288_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 There now exclaimed the squire with infinite satisfaction you ve got it you ungrateful brute 
5189_59288_000026_000001	train-clean-360	You ve found something harder than your own head at last you cursed reptile 
5189_59288_000026_000002	train-clean-360	Friend Crayon that s a capital gun of yours and you shot well 
5189_59288_000027_000000	train-clean-360	The squire dropped the stones which he had in his hands and looking back at the dead body of the belligerent sheep observed with a thoughtful air He was a fine animal mister Crayon a fine animal and this will teach him a good lesson 
none	none	In all likelihood replied Crayon dryly it will break him of this trick of butting 
5189_59288_000029_000000	train-clean-360	Not long after this occurrence Squire Hardy went to hear an itinerant phrenologist who lectured in the village 
5189_59288_000029_000001	train-clean-360	In the progress of his discourse the lecturer for purposes of illustration introduced the skulls of several animals mapped off in the most correct and scientific manner 
5189_59288_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 Observe ladies and gentlemen the head of the wolf combativeness enormously developed alimentiveness large while conscientiousness is entirely wanting 
none	none	On the other hand look at this cranium 
5189_59288_000030_000002	train-clean-360	Here combativeness is a nullity absolutely wanting while the fullness of the sentimental organs indicate at once the mild and peaceful disposition of the sheep 
5189_59288_000031_000000	train-clean-360	The squire who had listened with great attention up to this point hastily rose to his feet 
5189_59288_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 A sheep he exclaimed did you call a sheep a peaceful animal 
none	none	I tell you sir it is the most ferocious and unruly beast in existence 
5189_59288_000032_000002	train-clean-360	Sir I had a ram once 
5189_59288_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 My dear sir cried the astonished lecturer on the authority of our most distinguished writers the sheep is an emblem of peace and innocence 
5189_59288_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 An emblem of the devil interrupted the squire boiling over 
5189_59288_000034_000001	train-clean-360	 You are an ignorant impostor and your science a humbug 
none	none	I had a ram once that would have taught you more in five seconds than you ve learned from books in all your lifetime And so Squire Hardy put on his hat and walked out leaving the lecturer to rectify his blunder as best he might DE STOVE PIPE HOLE seven BY WILLIAM HENRY DRUMMOND Dat s very cole an stormy night on Village saint Mathieu W en ev ry wan he s go couche an dog was quiet too

William Henry Drummond Copyright eighteen ninety seven by G P Putnam s Sons THE GIRL FROM MERCURY AN INTERPLANETARY LOVE STORY Being the Interpretation of Certain Phonic Vibragraphs Recorded by the Long s Peak Wireless Installation Now for the First Time Made Public Through the Courtesy of Professor Caducious Ph D Sometime Secretary of the Boulder Branch of the Association for the Advancement of Interplanetary Communication BY HERMAN KNICKERBOCKER VIELE It is evident that the following logograms form part of a correspondence between a young lady formerly of Mercury and her confidential friend still resident upon the inferior planet The translator has thought it best to preserve as far as possible the spirit of the original by the employment of mundane colloquialisms the result in spite of many regrettable trivialities will it is believed be of interest to students of Cosmic Sociology THE FIRST RECORD Yes dear it s me I m down here on the Earth and in our Settlement House safe and sound I meant to have called you up before but really this is the first moment I have had to myself all day Yes of course I said all day You know very well they have days and nights here because this restless little planet spins or something of the sort I haven t the least idea why it does so and I don t care I did not come here to make intelligent observations like a dowdy Seeing Saturn tourist So don t be Uranian Try to exercise intuitive perception if I say anything you can t understand What is that Please concentrate a little harder Oh Yes I have seen a lot of human beings already and would you believe it some of them seem almost possible especially one But I will come to that one later I ve got so much to tell you all at once I scarcely know where to begin Yes dear the One happens to be a man You would not have me discriminate would you when our object is to bring whatever happiness we can to those less fortunate than ourselves You know success in slumming depends first of all upon getting yourself admired for then the others will want to be like you and once thoroughly dissatisfied with themselves they are almost certain to reform Of course I am only a visitor here and shall not stay long enough to take up serious work so Ooma says I may as well proceed along the line of least resistance If you remember Ooma s enthusiasm when she ran the Board of Missions to Inferior Planets you can fancy her now that she has an opportunity to carry out all her theories Oh she s great My transmigration was disappointing as an experience It was nothing more than going to sleep and dreaming about circles orange circles yellow circles with a thousand others of graduated shades between and so on through the spectrum till you pass absolute green and get a tone or two toward blue and strike the Earth color note Then with me everything got jumbled together and seemed about to take new shapes and I woke up in the most commonplace manner and opened my eyes to find myself externalized in our Earth Settlement House with Ooma laughing at me Don t stir she cried Don t lift a finger till we are sure your specific gravity is all right And then she pinched me to see if I was dense enough because the atmosphere is heavier or lighter or something here than with us I reminded her that matter everywhere must maintain an absolute equilibrium with its environment but she protested That s well enough in theory you must understand that the Earth is awfully out of tune at present and sometimes it requires time to readjust ourselves to its conditions I did not say so but I fancy Ooma may have been undergoing readjustment My dear she has grown as pudgy as a Jupitan and her clothes but then she always did look more like a spiral nebula than anything else The record here becomes unintelligible by reason of the passage of a thunderstorm above the summit of Long s Peak There must be star dust in the ether I never had to concentrate so hard before That s all about the Settlement House and don t accuse me again of slighting details I m sure you know the place now as well as Ooma herself so I can go on to tell what little I have learned about human beings It seems I am never to admit that I was not born on Earth for like all provincials the humans pride themselves on disbelieving everything beyond their own experience and if they understood they would be certain to resent intrusions from another planet I m sure I don t blame them altogether when I recall those patronizing Jupitans And I m told they are awfully jealous and distrustful even of one another herding together for protection and governed by so many funny little tribal codes that what is right on one side of an imaginary boundary may be wrong on the other Ooma considers this survival of the group soul most interesting and intends to make it the subject of a paper I mention it only to explain why we call our Settlement a Boarding House A Boarding House you must know is fundamentally a hunting pack which one can affiliate with or separate from at will Rather a pale yellow idea isn t it Ooma thinks it necessary to conform to it in order to be considered respectable which is the one thing on Earth most desired What dear Oh I don t know what it means to be respectable any more than you do One thing more You ll have to draw on your imagination Ooma is called here missus Bloomer Her own name was just a little too unearthly missus signifies that a woman is married What Oh no no no nothing of the sort But I shall have to leave that for another time I m not at all sure how it is myself By the way if any one should ask you where I am just say I ve left the planet and you don t know when I shall be back Yes you know who I mean And dear perhaps you might drop a hint that I detest all foreigners especially Jupitans Please don t laugh so hard you ll get the atmospheric molecules all woozy Indeed there s not the slightest danger here Just fancy if you please beings who don t know when they are hungry without consulting a wretched little mechanism and who measure their radius of conception by the length of their own feet Of course I shall be on hand for the Solstice I wouldn t miss that for an asteroid Oh did I really promise that Well I ll tell you about hi m another time THE SECOND RECORD THOUGH PROBABLY THIRD COMMUNICATION I really must not waste so much gray matter dear over unimportant details But I simply had to tell you all about my struggles with the clothes When Ooma came back just as I had mastered them with the aid of her diagrams the dear thing was so much pleased she actually hugged me and I must confess the effect made me forget my discomfort Really an Earth girl is not so much to be pitied if she has becoming dresses to wear As you may be sure I was anxious to compare myself with others I was glad enough to hear Ooma suggest going out Come on she said executively I have only a half hour to devote to your first walk Keep close beside me and remember on no account to either dance or sing But if I see others dancing may I not join them I inquired You won t see anybody dancing on Broadway she replied a trifle snubbily but I resolved to escape from her as soon as possible and find out for myself I shall never forget my shock on discovering the sky blue instead of the color it should be but soon my eyes became accustomed to the change In fact I have not since that first moment been able to conceive of the sky as anything but blue And the city Oh my dear my dear I never expected to encounter anything so much out of key with the essential euphonies Of course I have not traveled very much but I should say there is nothing in the universe like a street they call Broadway unless it be upon the lesser satellite of Mars where the poor people are so awfully cramped for space When I suggested this to Ooma she laughed and called me clever for it seems there is a tradition that a mob of meddling Martians once stopped on Earth long enough to give the foolish humans false ideas about architecture and many other matters But I soon forgot everything in my interest in the people Such a poor puzzle headed lot they are One s heart goes out to them at once as they push and jostle one another this way and that with no conceivable object other than to get anywhere but where they are in the shortest time possible One longs to help them to call a halt upon their senseless struggles to reason with them and explain how all the psychic force they waste might if exerted in constructive thought bring everything they wish to pass missus Bloomer assures me they only ridicule those who venture to interfere and it will take at least a Saturn century to so much as start them in the right direction Our settlement is their only hope she says and even we can help them only indirectly Not long ago it appears they had to choose a King or Mayor or whatever the creature is called who executes their silly laws and our people so manipulated the election that the choice fell on one of us I thought this a really good idea and supposed of course we must at once have set about demonstrating how a planet should be managed But no that was not our system if you please Instead of making proper laws our agent misbehaved himself in every way the committee could suggest until at last the humans rose against him and put one of themselves in his place and after that things went just a little better than before This is the only way in which they can be taught But dear me isn t it tedious Of course I soon grew anxious for an exchange of thought with almost any one but it was a long while before I discovered a single person who was not in a violent hurry At last however we came upon a human drawn apart a little from the throng who stood with folded arms engaged apparently in lofty meditation His countenance was amiable although a little red Saying nothing to Ooma of my purpose I slipped away from her and looking up into the creature s eyes inquired mentally the subject of his thoughts also how he came to be so inordinately stout and why he wore bright metal buttons on his garment But my only answer was a stupid blink for his mentality seemed absolutely incapable of receiving suggestions not expressed in sounds I observed farther that his aura inclined too much toward violet for perfect equipoise G wan out of this and quit yer foolin he remarked missing my meaning altogether Of course I spoke then using the human speech quite glibly for a first attempt and hastened to assure him that though I had no idea of fooling I should not go on until my curiosity had been satisfied But just then Ooma found me My friend is a stranger she explained to the brass buttoned man Then why don t you put a string to her he asked I learned later that I had been addressing one of the public jesters employed by the community to keep Broadway from becoming intolerably dull But you must not speak to people in the street said Ooma not even to policemen Then how am I to brighten others lives I asked more than a little disappointed for several humans hurrying past had turned upon me looks indicating moods receptive of all the brightening I could give I might have amused myself indefinitely studying the rapid succession of varying faces had not Bloomer cautioned me not to stare She said people would think me from the country which is considered discreditable and as this reminded me that I had as yet seen nothing growing I asked to be shown the gardens and groves There is one she said indicating an open space not far away where sure enough there stood some wretched looking trees which I had not recognized before forgetting that of course leaves here must be green I saw no flowers growing but presently we came upon some in a sort of crystal bower guarded by a powerful black person I wanted so to ask him how he came to be black but the memory of my last attempt at information deterred me Instead I inquired if I might have some roses Walk in Miss he replied most civilly and in I walked through the door past the sweetest little embryonic who wore the vesture of a young policeman Boy I said have you begun to realize your soul Nope he replied I ain t in fractions yet Some stage of earthly progress I suppose though I did not like a certain movement of his eyelid and one never can tell you know how hard embryonics are really striving So I made haste to gather all the roses I could carry and was about to hurry after Ooma when a person barred my way Hold on he cried Ain t you forgetting something Why don t you take the whole lot Because I have all I want for the present I answered rather frightened perceiving that his aura had grown livid and I don t know how I could have soothed him had not Ooma once more come to my relief I could see that she was annoyed with me but she controlled herself and placed some token in the being s hand which acted on his agitation like a charm As I told you Bloomer had given me with the other things a crown of artificial roses which now that I had real flowers to wear I wanted to throw away but this she would not permit insisting that such a proceeding would make the humans laugh at me though to look into their serious faces one would not believe this possible The thoughts of those about me as I divined them seemed anything but jocular They came to me incoherent and inconsecutive a jumble of conditional premises leading to approximate conclusions expressed in symbols having no intrinsic meaning Of course it is unfair to judge too soon but I have already begun to doubt the existence of direct perception among them What did you say dear Bother direct perception Well I wonder how we should like to apprehend nothing that could not be put into words You I m sure would have the most confused ideas about Earthly conditions if you depended entirely upon my remarks Now concentrate and you shall hear something really interesting No not the One yet He comes later We had not gone far I carrying my roses and Bloomer not too well pleased as I fancied because so many people turned to look at us Bloomer has retrograded physically until she is at times almost Uranian probably as the result of wearing black which appears to be the chromatic equivalent of respectability when suddenly I became sensible of a familiar influence which was quite startling because so unexpected Looking everywhere I caught sight of who do you suppose Our old friend Tuk mister Tuck T u c k here if you please He was about to enter a a means of transportation and though his back was towards me I recognized that drab aura of his at once and projected a reactionary impulse which was most effective In his surprise he was for the moment in danger of being trampled upon by a rapidly moving animal Yes dear I said animal I don t know and I don t consider it at all important I do not pretend to be familiar with mundane zooelogy Tuck declared himself delighted to see me and so I believe he was though he controlled his radiations in the supercilious way he always had But upon one point he did not leave me long in doubt Externally at least my Earthly Ego is a NOTE The word which signifies a species of peach or nectarine peculiar to the planet Mercury is doubtless used here in a symbolic sense I caught on to that most interesting fact the moment his eyes rested on me By all that s fair to look upon he cried jumping about in a manner human people think eccentric are you astral or actualized See for yourself I said holding out my hand which it took him rather longer than necessary to make sure of Well what on Earth brings you here Come down to paint another planet red he rattled on believing himself amusing Now haven t I as much right to light on Earth as on any other bit of cosmic dust I asked laughing and forgetting how much snubbing he requires in the delight of seeing any one I knew Then he insisted that I had a date with him A date as I discovered later means something nice to eat and hinted very broadly that Bloomer need not wait if she had more important matters to attend to I must confess she did not seem at all sorry to have me taken off her hands for after cautioning me to beware of a number of things I did not so much as know by name she shot off like a respectable old aerolite with a black trail streaming out behind If she remains here much longer she will be coming back upon a mission to reform us As for Tuck he became insufferably patronizing at once Well how do you like the Only Planet and how do you like the Only Town and how do you like the Only Street he began waving his hands and looking about him as though there were anything here that one of us could admire But of course I refused to gratify him with my crude impressions I simply said You appear very well pleased with them yourself And so will you be he replied when you have realized their possibilities Remark that elderly entity across the street I have to but exert my will that he shall sneeze and drop his eyeglasses and behold there they go Yes my dear eyeglasses They are worn on the nose by people who imagine they can not see very well I consider such actions cruel and unkind I said at the same time willing an embryonic girl to pick the glasses up and though the child was rather beyond my normal circle I was delighted to see her obey But I have an idea Tuck regretted an experiment which taught me something I might not have found out at least for a while I had now been on Earth several hours and change of atmosphere gives one a ravenous appetite You see I had forgotten to ask Ooma how and how often humans ate so when Tuck suggested breakfast as a form of entertainment I put myself in sympathy with the idea at once Besides it is most important to know just where to find the things you want and you may be sure I made a lot of mental notes when we came as presently we did to a tower called Astoria I understand that the upper portions of the edifice are used for study of the Stars but we were made welcome on the lower story by a stately being who conducted us to honorable seats in an inner court There were small trees growing here green of course but rather pretty for all that the people gathered under their shade in little groups were much more cheerful and sustaining than any I had seen so far and an elemental intelligence detailed to minister to our wants seemed well trained and docile Here you have a glimpse of High Life announced Tuck when he had written something on a paper The Higher Life I inquired eagerly and I did not like the flippant tone in which he answered No not quite just high enough I was beginning to be so bored by his conceit and self complacency that I cast my eyes about and smiled at several pleasant looking persons who returned the smile and nodded in a friendly fashion till I could perceive Tuck s aura bristle and turn greenish brown You can t possibly see any one you know here he protested crossly All the better reason why I should reach out in search of affinities I retorted But after that though I was careful to keep my eyes lowered most of the time I resolved to come some day to the Astoria alone and smile at every one I liked I don t believe I should ever know a human if Tuck could have his way Presently the elemental brought us delicious things and while we ate them Tuck talked about himself It appears he has produced an opera here which is a success People throng to hear it and consider him a great composer At all of which you may believe I was astonished just fancy our Tuk posing as a genius but presently when he became elated by the theme and hummed a bar or two I understood The wretch had simply actualized a few essential harmonies and done it very badly I see now why he likes so much being here and understand why his associates are almost altogether human I don t remember ever meeting with such deceit and effrontery before I was so indignant that I could feel my astral fingers tremble I could not bear to look at him and as by that time I had eaten all I could I rose and walked directly from the court without another word I am sure he would have pursued me had not the elemental divining my wish to escape detained him forcibly Once in the street again I immediately hypnotized an old lady willing her to go direct to Bloomer s Boarding House while I followed behind It may not have been convenient for her I am afraid but I knew of no other way to get back Dear me the light is growing dim and I must be dressing for the evening Good by By the way I forgot to tell you something else that happened remind me of it next time THE THIRD RECORD Yes I remember and you shall hear all about it before I describe an evening at the Settlement but it don t amount to much I told you how cross and over bearing Tuck was at the Astoria tower and of the mean way in which he restricted my observations Well of all the people in the grove that day there was only one whom I could see without being criticized and he sat all alone and facing me just behind Tuck s back Some green leaves hung between us and whenever I moved my head to note what he was doing he moved his too to look at me He seemed so lonely that I was sorry for him but his atmosphere showed him to be neither sullen nor Uranian and I could not help it if I was just a little bit responsive Besides Tuck once on the subject of his opera grew so self engrossed and dominant that one had either to assert one s own mentality or become subjective No dear that is not the only reason There may be such a thing as an isolated reason but I have never met one they always go in packs I confess to a feeling of interest in the stranger Nobody can look at you with round blue eyes for half an hour steadily without exercising some attraction either positive or negative and I felt too that he was trying to tell me something which would have been a great deal more interesting than Tuck s opera and I believe had I remained a little longer we could have understood each other between the trees just as you and I can understand each other across the intervals of space But then it is so easy to be mistaken I had to pass quite close to him in going out and I am not sure I did not drop a rose There may be just a weenie little bit more about the Astorian but that will come in its proper place Now I must get on to the evening It was not much of an occasion merely the usual gathering of our crowd or rather of those of us who have no special assignment for the time in the large Council Room I have described to you The President of the Board of Control at present is Marlow Marlow the Great as he is called the painter whose pictures did so much to elevate the Patagonians No dear I never heard of Patagonia before but I m almost sure it s not a planet With Marlow came a missus Mopes who is engaged in creating schools of fiction by writing stories under different names and then reviewing them in her own seven magazines Next taking the guests at random was Baxter a deadly person in his human incarnation whose business it is to make stocks fly up or tumble down I don t know what stocks are but they must be something very easily frightened Then there was a mister Waller nicknamed the Reverend whom the Council allows to speak the truth occasionally while the rest of the time he tells people anything they want to hear to win their confidence And the two Miss Dooleys who sing so badly that thousands who can not sing at all leave off singing altogether when they once hear them And mister Flick who misbehaves at funerals to distract mourners from their grief and a mister O Brien whose duty it is to fly into violent passions in public places just to show how unbecoming temper is There were many others so many I can not begin to enumerate them Some had written books and were known all over the planet and some who were not known at all had done things because there was nobody else to do them And some were singers and some were actors and some were rich and some were poor to the outside world but in the Council Room they met and laughed and matched experiences and made jokes from the one who had built a battle ship so terrible that all the other ships were burnt on condition that his should be also to the ordinary helpers who applaud stupid plays till intelligent human beings become thoroughly disgusted with bad art In the world of course they are all serious enough and often know each other only by secret signs while every day and night and minute our poor earth brothers come a little nearer the light pushed toward it pulled toward it wheedled and trickled and bullied and coaxed and thinking all the while how immensely clever they are and what a wonderful progressive glorious age they have brought about for themselves At all events this is the rather vague composite impression I have received of the plans and purposes of the Board of Directors and doubtless it is wrong I suppose with a little trouble I might have recognized nearly every one but the fancy took me to suspend intuition just to see how Earth girls feel and you know when one is hearing a lot of pleasant things one does not much care who happens to be saying them I fancy Marlow thought less of me when I confessed that I am here only for the lark and really do not care a meteor whether the planet is ever elevated or not But he is a charming old fellow all the same and the only one of the lot who has not grown the least bit smudgy Marlow announced that the evening would be spent in harmony with the vibrations of Orion and set us all at work to get in touch I love Orion light myself for none other suits my aura quite so well and I was glad to find they had not taken up the Vega fad The light here My dear it is not even filtered Some of us no doubt for want of practice were rather slow about perfecting but finally we all caught on and when O Brien no longer fat and florid and the elder Miss Dooley no longer scrawny moved out to start the dance there was only one who had not assumed an astral personality Poor fellow though I pitied him I did admire his spunk in holding back It seems that as an editor he took to telling falsehoods on his own account so often that the Syndicate is packing him off as Special Correspondent to a tailless comet Tuck never came at all either he realizes how honest people must regard him and his opera or else the elementals at the Astoria are still detaining him We had a lovely dance and while we rested Marlow called on some of us for specialties missus Mopes did a paragraph by a man named Henry James translated into action which seemed quite difficult and then a person called Parker externalized a violin and gave the Laocoon in terms of sound To me his rendering of marble resembled terra cotta until I learned that the copy of the statue here is awfully weatherstained After this three pretty girls gave the Aurora Borealis by telepathic suggestion rather well and then I sang Love Lives Everywhere just plain so I know this must all sound dreadfully flat to you quite like Pastimes for the Rainy Season in Neptune but Bloomer says she doesn t know what would happen if we should ever give a really characteristic jolly party We wound up with an Earth dance called the Virginia Reel the quickest means you ever saw for descending to a lower psychic plane That s all I have to tell and quite enough I m sure you ll think What The Astorian I have not seen him since But there is a little more a very little if you are not tired This morning I received a gift of roses just like the one I dropped yesterday brought me by the same small embryonic I had seen in the flower shop I asked the child in whose intelligence the impulse had originated and he replied A blue eyed feller with a mustache but he gave me a plunk not to tell I understood a plunk to be a token of confidence and I at once expressed displeasure at the boy s betrayal of his trust I told him such an act would make dark lines upon his aura which might not fade for several days Say ain t you got some message to send back he asked Boy said I don t forget your little aura All right he answered I ll tell him Don t forget your little aura I ll bet he coughs up another plunk I don t know what he meant but I am very much afraid there may be some mistake Oh yes I am quite sure to be back in time for the Solstice Or at least for the Eclipse THE FOURTH RECORD NOTE Between this logogram and the last the Long s Peak Receptive Pulsator was unfortunately not in operation for the space of a fortnight as the electrician who took the instrument apart for adjustment found it necessary to return to Denver for oil Yes dear it s me though if I did not know personality to be indestructible I should begin to have my doubts I have not made any more mistakes that is not any bad ones since I went to the Astoria alone for lunch and the elementals were so very disagreeable just because I had no money I know all about money now except exactly how you get it and Tuck assures me that is really of no importance I never told Ooma how the blue eyed Astorian paid my bill for me and her perceptive faculties have grown too dull to apprehend a thing she is not told Fresh roses still come regularly every day and of course I can do no less than express my gratitude now and then Oh I don t know how often I don t remember But it is ever so much pleasanter to have some one you like to show you the way about than to depend on hypnotizing strangers who may have something else to do I told you last week about the picnic did I not The day I mean when Bloomer took me into the country and Tuck so far forgave my rudeness to him as to come with us to carry the basket Oh yes indeed I am becoming thoroughly domesticated on Earth And my dear these humans are docility itself when you once acquire the knack of making them do exactly as you wish which is as easy as falling off a log A log is the external evidence of a pre existent tree cylindrical in form and though often sticky not sufficiently so to be adhesive That picnic was so pleasant or would have been but for Bloomer s anxiety that I should behave myself and Tuck s anxiety that I should not that I determined to have another all by myself and I have had it I traveled to the same little dell I described before and I put my feet in the water just as I wasn t allowed to do the other day And I built a fire and almost cooked an egg and ate cake an egg is the bud of a bird and cake is edible poetry sitting on a fence Fences grow horizontally and have no leaves Don t ask so many questions After a while however I became tired of being alone so I started off across some beautiful green meadows toward a hillside where I had observed a human walking about and waving a forked wand He proved the strangest looking being I have met with yet more like those wild and woolly space dwellers who tumbled out when that tramp comet bumped against our second moon But he was a considerate person for when he saw me coming and divined that I should be tired he piled up a quantity of delicious scented herbage for me to sit on Good morning mister I said plumping myself down upon the mound he had made and he being much more impressionable than you would suppose from his Uranian appearance replied I swan I like your cheek It s a pleasant day I said because one is always expected to announce some result of observation of the atmosphere It shows at once whether or not one is an idiot I call it pretty danged hot he returned intelligently Then why don t you get out of the sun I suggested more to keep the conversation fluid than because I cared a bit I m a goin to he answered just as soon as that goll darned wagon comes A goll darned wagon is I think a wagon without springs What are you going to do then I asked beginning to fear I should be left alone again after all my trouble Goin home to dinner he replied and I at once said I would go with him You see I had placed a little too much reliance on the egg I dunno about that but I guess it will be all right he urged hospitably and presently the goll darned wagon arrived with another man who turned out to be the first one s son and who looked as though he bit Together the two threw all the herbage into the wagon till it was heaped far above their heads How am I ever to get up I asked for I had no idea of walking any farther and I could see the man s white house ever so far away Who said you was goin to get up at all inquired the biter disagreeably but the other answered for me I said it that s who you consarned jay he announced reprovingly When I had made them both climb up first and give me each a hand I had no difficulty at all in mounting but I was very careful not to thank the Jay which seemed to make him more morose than ever Then they slid down again and off we started Once when we came to some lovely blue flowers growing in water near the roadside I told the Jay to stop and wade in and pick them for me I ll be dogged if I do he answered so I said I don t know what being dogged means but if it is a reward for being nice and kind and polite I hope you will be Whereupon he bit at me once and waded in while the other man whose name it seems was Pop sat down upon a stone and laughed Gosh If this don t beat the cats he said slapping his knee which was his way of making himself laugh harder I put the flowers in my hair and in my belt and wherever I could stick them But there was still a lot left over and whenever we met people I threw them some which appeared to please Pop but made the Jay still more bite y Presently we came to a very narrow place and there as luck would have it we met an automobile Thank goodness I need not explain automobile And who should be at the lever all alone but the Astorian I recognized him instantly and he recognized me which was I suppose his reason for forgetting to stop till he had nearly run us down In a moment we were in the wildest tangle though nothing need have happened had not the Jay completely lost his temper Hang your picture he called out savagely What do you want The Earth And with that he struck the animals the wagon was not self propelling a violent blow and they sprang forward with a lurch which made the hay begin to slip I tried to save myself but there was nothing to catch hold of so off I slid and oh my dear my dear just fancy it I landed directly in his lap No not the Jay s Of course I stayed there as short a time as possible for he was very nice about moving up to make room for me on the seat but I am afraid it did seem frightfully informal just at first It was all the fault of that consarned Jay I explained as soon as I had recovered my composure and I shall never ride in his goll darned wagon again I sincerely hope you will not replied Astoria looking at me with the most curious expression It would be much better to let me take you wherever you wish to go That s awfully kind of you I said but I don t care to go anywhere in particular this afternoon except as far as possible from that objectionable young man The Astorian did not speak again till he had turned something in the machine to make it back and jerk and once free from the upset hay go on again Say Sissy I thought you was comin to take dinner Pop called out from under the wagon where he had crawled for safety and when I replied as nicely as I could No thank you not to day he said again quite sadly as I thought Gosh blim me if that don t beat the cats and also several other things I could not hear because we were moving away so rapidly When we had gone about a hundred miles or yards or inches whichever it was the Astorian who had been sitting very straight inquired if those gentlemen meaning Pop and Jay were near relatives I showed him plainly that I thought his question Uranian and explained that I had not a relative on Earth Then I told him exactly how I had come to be with them and about my picnic and the egg I am afraid I did not take great pains to make the story very clear for it was such fun to perplex him He is not at all like the Venus people who have become so superlatively clever that they are always bored to death Were you surprised to see me flying through the air I asked Oh no he said I have always thought of you as coming to Earth in some such way from some far distant planet Oh then you know I gasped The Astorian laughed I know you are the one perfect being in the world and that is quite enough he said and I saw at once that whatever he had guessed about me he knew nothing at all of the Settlement Miss Aura he went on he has called me that ever since that little embryonic made his stupid blunder and I have not corrected him here it is almost necessary to have some sort of a name Miss Aura don t you think we have been mere acquaintances long enough I m only human Yes of course I interrupted but then that is not your fault I m glad you look upon my misfortune so
