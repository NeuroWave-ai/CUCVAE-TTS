PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE PAYING GUEST Produced by Charles Aldarondo HTML version by Al Haines The Paying Guest by George Gissing CHAPTER I It was Mumford who saw the advertisement and made the suggestion His wife gave him a startled look But you don t mean that it s necessary Have we been extrav No no Nothing of the kind It just occurred to me that some such arrangement might be pleasant for you You must feel lonely now and then during the day and as we have plenty of room Emmeline took the matter seriously but being a young woman of some discretion did not voice all her thoughts The rent was heavy so was the cost of Clarence s season ticket Against this they had set the advantage of the fine air of Sutton so good for the child and for the mother both vastly better in health since they quitted London Moreover the remoteness of their friends favoured economy they could easily decline invitations and need not often issue them They had a valid excuse for avoiding public entertainments an expense so often imposed by mere fashion The house was roomy the garden delightful Clarence good fellow might be sincere in his wish for her to have companionship at the same time this advertisement had probably appealed to him in another way A YOUNG LADY desires to find a home with respectable well connected family in a suburb of London or not more than fifteen miles from Charing Cross Can give excellent references Terms not so much a consideration as comfort and pleasant society No boarding house Address Louise Messrs Higgins company Fenchurch saint E C She read it again and again It wouldn t be nice if people said that we were taking lodgers No fear of that This is evidently some well to do person It s a very common arrangement nowadays you know they are called paying guests Of course I shouldn t dream of having anyone you didn t thoroughly like the look of Do you think asked Emmeline doubtfully that we should quite do Well connected family My dear girl Surely we have nothing to be ashamed of Of course not Clarence But and pleasant society What about that Your society is pleasant enough I hope answered Mumford gracefully And the Fentimans This was the only family with whom they were intimate at Sutton Nice people a trifle sober perhaps and not in conspicuously flourishing circumstances but perfectly presentable I m afraid murmured Emmeline and stopped short As you say she added presently this is someone very well off Terms not so much a consideration Well I tell you what there can be no harm in dropping a note The kind of note that commits one to nothing you know Shall I write it or will you They concocted it together and the rough draft was copied by Emmeline She wrote a very pretty hand and had no difficulty whatever about punctuation A careful letter calculated for the eye of refinement it supplied only the indispensable details of the writer s position and left terms for future adjustment It s so easy to explain to people said Mumford with an air of satisfaction when he came back from the post that you wanted a companion As I m quite sure you do A friend coming to stay with you for a time that s how I should put it A week passed and there came no reply Mumford pretended not to care much but Emmeline imagined a new anxiety in his look Do be frank with me dear she urged one evening Are we living too He answered her with entire truthfulness Ground for serious uneasiness there was none whatever he could more than make ends meet and had every reason to hope it would always be so but it would relieve his mind if the end of the year saw a rather larger surplus He was now five and thirty getting on in life A man ought to make provision beyond the mere life assurance and so on Shall I look out for other advertisements asked Emmeline Oh dear no It was just that particular one that caught my eye Next morning arrived a letter signed Louise E Derrick The writer said she had been waiting to compare and think over some two hundred answers to her advertisement It s really too absurd How can I remember them all But I liked yours as soon as I read it and I am writing to you first of all Will you let me come and see you I can tell you about myself much better than writing Would tomorrow do in the afternoon Please telegraph yes or no to Coburg Lodge Emilia Road Tulse Hill To think over this letter Mumford missed his ordinary train It was not exactly the kind of letter he had expected and Emmeline shared his doubts The handwriting seemed just passable there was no orthographic error but refinement This young person wrote too with such singular nonchalance And she said absolutely nothing about her domestic circumstances Coburg Lodge Tulse Hill A decent enough locality doubtless but There s no harm in seeing her said Emmeline at length Send a telegram Clarence Do you know I think she may be the right kind of girl I was thinking of someone awfully grand and it s rather a relief After all you see you you are in business To be sure And this girl seems to belong to a business family I only wish she wrote in a more ladylike way Emmeline set her house in order filled the drawing room with flowers made the spare bedroom as inviting as possible and after luncheon spent a good deal of time in adorning her person She was a slight pretty woman of something less than thirty with a good but pale complexion hair tending to auburn sincere eyes Her little vanities had no roots of ill nature she could admire without envy and loved an orderly domestic life Her husband s desire to increase his income had rather unsettled her she exaggerated the importance of to day s interview and resolved with nervous energy to bring it to a successful issue if Miss Derrick should prove a possible companion About four o clock sounded the visitor s ring From her bedroom window Emmeline had seen Miss Derrick s approach As the distance from the station was only five minutes walk the stranger naturally came on foot A dark girl and of tolerably good features rather dressy with a carriage corresponding to the tone of her letter an easy swing head well up and shoulders squared Oh how I hope she isn t vulgar said Emmeline to herself I don t like the hat I don t And that sunshade with the immense handle From the top of the stairs she heard a clear unaffected voice missus Mumford at home Yes the aspirate was sounded thank goodness It surprised her on entering the room to find that Miss Derrick looked no less nervous than she was herself The girl s cheeks were flushed and she half choked over her How do you do I hope you had no difficulty in finding the house I would have met you at the station if you had mentioned the train Oh but how silly I shouldn t have known you Miss Derrick laughed and seemed of a sudden much more at ease Oh I like you for that she exclaimed mirthfully It s just the kind of thing I say myself sometimes And I m so glad to see that you are you mustn t be offended I mean you re not the kind of person to be afraid of They laughed together Emmeline could not subdue her delight when she found that the girl really might be accepted as a lady There were faults of costume undeniably money had been misspent in several directions but no glaring vulgarity hurt the eye And her speech though not strictly speaking refined was free from the faults that betray low origin Then she seemed good natured though there was something about her mouth not altogether charming Do you know Sutton at all Emmeline inquired Never was here before But I like the look of it I like this house too I suppose you know a lot of people here missus Mumford Well no There s only one family we know at all well Our friends live in London Of course they often come out here I don t know whether you are acquainted with any of them The Kirby Simpsons of West Kensington and missus Hollings of Highgate Miss Derrick cast down her eyes and seemed to reflect Then she spoke abruptly I don t know any people to speak of I ought to tell you that my mother has come down with me She s waiting at the station till I go back then she ll come and see you You re surprised Well I had better tell you that I m leaving home because I can t get on with my people Mother and I have always quarrelled but it has been worse than ever lately I must explain that she has married a second time and mister Higgins I m glad to say that isn t my name has a daughter of his own by a first marriage and we can t bear each other Miss Higgins I mean Some day if I come to live here I daresay I shall tell you more mister Higgins is rich and I can t say he s unkind to me he ll give me as much as I want but I m sure he ll be very glad to get me out of the house I have no money of my own worse luck Well we thought it best for me to come alone first and see just to see you know whether we were likely to suit each other Then mother will come and tell you all she has to say about me Of course I know what it ll be They all say I ve a horrible temper I don t think so myself and I m sure I don t think I should quarrel with you you look so nice But I can t get on at home and it s better for all that we should part I m just two and twenty do I look older I haven t learnt to do anything and I suppose I shall never need to Do you wish to see much society inquired missus Mumford who was thinking rapidly or should you prefer a few really nice people I m afraid I don t quite understand yet whether you want society of the pleasure seeking kind or She left the alternative vague Miss Derrick again reflected for a moment before abruptly declaring herself I feel sure that your friends are the kind I want to know At all events I should like to try The great thing is to get away from home and see how things look They laughed together Emmeline after a little more talk offered to take her visitor over the house and Miss Derrick had loud praise for everything she saw What I like about you she exclaimed of a sudden as they stood looking from a bedroom window on to the garden is that you don t put on any you know what I mean People seem to me to be generally either low and ignorant or so high and mighty there s no getting on with them at all You re just what I wanted to find Now I must go and send mother to see you Emmeline protested against this awkward proceeding Why should not both come together and have a cup of tea If it were desired Miss Derrick could step into the garden whilst her mother said whatever she wished to say The girl assented and in excellent spirits betook herself to the railway station Emmeline waited something less than a quarter of an hour then a hansom drove up and missus Higgins after a deliberate surveyal of the house front followed her daughter up the pathway The first sight of the portly lady made the situation clearer to missus Mumford Louise Derrick represented a certain stage of civilisation a degree of conscious striving for better things missus Higgins was prosperous and self satisfied vulgarity Of a complexion much lighter than the girl s she still possessed a coarse comeliness which pointed back to the dairymaid type of damsel Her features revealed at the same time a kindly nature and an irascible tendency Monstrously overdressed and weighted with costly gewgaws she came forward panting and perspiring and before paying any heed to her hostess closely surveyed the room missus Mumford said the girl this is my mother Mother this is missus Mumford And now please let me go somewhere while you have your talk Yes that ll be best that ll be best exclaimed missus Higgins Dear ow ot it is Run out into the garden Louise Nice little ouse missus Mumford And Louise seems quite taken with you She doesn t take to people very easy either Of course you can give satisfactory references I like to do things in a business like way I understand your usband is in the City shouldn t wonder if he knows some of mister Iggins s friends Yes I will take a cup if you please I ve just had one at the station but it s such thirsty weather And what do you think of Louise Because I d very much rather you said plainly if you don t think you could get on But indeed I fancy we could missus Higgins Well I m sure I m very glad of it It isn t everybody can get on with Louise I dessay she s told you a good deal about me and her stepfather I don t think she s any reason to complain of the treatment She said you were both very kind to her interposed the hostess I m sure we try to be and mister Iggins he doesn t mind what he gives her A five pound note if you ll believe me is no more than a sixpence to him when he gives her presents You see missus Rumford no Mumford isn t it I was first married very young scarcely eighteen I was and mister Derrick died on our wedding day two years after Then came mister Iggins Of course I waited a proper time And one thing I can say that no woman was ever appier with two usbands than I ve been I ve two sons growing up hearty boys as ever you saw If it wasn t for this trouble with Louise She stopped to wipe her face I dessay she s told you that mister Iggins who was a widower when I met him has a daughter of his first marriage her poor mother died at the birth and she s older than Louise I don t mind telling you missus Mumford she s close upon six and twenty and nothing like so good looking as Louise neither mister Iggins he s kindness itself but when it comes to differences between his daughter and my daughter well it isn t in nature he shouldn t favour his own There s more be ind but I dessay you can guess and I won t trouble you with things that don t concern you And that s how it stands you see By a rapid calculation Emmeline discovered with surprise that missus Higgins could not be much more than forty years of age It must have been a life of gross self indulgence that had made the woman look at least ten years older This very undesirable parentage naturally affected Emmeline s opinion of Louise whose faults began to show in a more pronounced light One thing was clear but for the fact that Louise aimed at a separation from her relatives it would be barely possible to think of receiving her If missus Higgins thought of coming down to Sutton at unexpected moments no that was too dreadful Should you wish missus Higgins to entrust your daughter to me entirely My dear missus Rumford it s very little that my wishes has to do with it She s made up her mind to leave ome and all I can do is to see she gets with respectable people which I feel sure you are and of course I shall have your references Emmeline turned pale at the suggestion She all but decided that the matter must go no further And what might your terms be inclusive missus Higgins proceeded to inquire At this moment a servant entered with tea and Emmeline sorely flurried talked rapidly of the advantages of Sutton as a residence She did not allow her visitor to put in a word till the door closed again Then with an air of decision she announced her terms they would be three guineas a week It was half a guinea more than she and Clarence had decided to ask She expected she hoped missus Higgins would look grave But nothing of the kind Louise s mother seemed to think the suggestion very reasonable Thereupon Emmeline added that of course the young lady would discharge her own laundress s bill To this also missus Higgins readily assented A hundred and sixty pounds per annum Emmeline kept repeating to herself And alas it looked as if she might have asked much more The reference difficulty might be minimised by naming her own married sister who lived at Blackheath and Clarence s most intimate friend mister Tarling who held a good position in a City house and had a most respectable address at West Kensington But her heart misgave her She dreaded her husband s return home The conversation was prolonged for half an hour Emmeline gave her references and in return requested the like from missus Higgins This astonished the good woman Why her husband was Messrs Iggins of Fenchurch Street Oh a mere formality Emmeline hastened to add for mister Mumford s satisfaction So missus Higgins very pompously named two City firms and negotiations for the present were at an end Louise summoned to the drawing room looked rather tired of waiting When can you have me missus Mumford she asked I ve quite made up my mind to come I m afraid a day or two must pass Miss Derrick The references my dear began missus Higgins Oh nonsense It s all right anyone can see There you go Always cutting short the words in my mouth I can t endure such behaviour and I wonder what missus Rumford thinks of it I ve given missus Rumford fair warning They wrangled for a few minutes Emmeline feeling too depressed and anxious to interpose with polite commonplaces When at length they took their leave she saw the last of them with a sigh of thanksgiving It had happened most fortunately that no one called this afternoon Clarence it s quite out of the question Thus she greeted her husband The girl herself I could endure but oh her odious mother Three guineas a week I could cry over the thought By the first post in the morning came a letter from Louise She wrote appealingly touchingly I know you couldn t stand my mother but do please have me I like Sutton and I like your house and I like you I promise faithfully nobody from home shall ever come to see me so don t be afraid Of course if you won t have me somebody else will I ve got two hundred to choose from but I d rather come to you Do write and say I may come I m so sorry I quarrelled with mother before you I promise never to quarrel with you I m very good tempered when I get what I want With much more to the same effect We will have her declared Mumford Why not if the old people keep away You are quite sure she sounds her h s Oh quite She has been to pretty good schools I think And I dare say I could persuade her to get other dresses and hats Of course you could Really it seems almost a duty to take her doesn t it So the matter was settled and Mumford ran off gaily to catch his train Three days later Miss Derrick arrived bringing with her something like half a ton of luggage She bounded up the doorsteps and meeting missus Mumford in the hall kissed her fervently I ve got such heaps to tell you mister Higgins has given me twenty pounds to go on with for myself I mean of course he ll pay everything else How delighted I am to be here Please pay the cabman I ve got no change A few hours before this there had come a letter from missus Higgins better written and spelt than would have seemed likely Dear missus Mumford it ran L is coming to morrow morning and I hope you won t repent There s just one thing I meant to have said to you but forgot so I ll say it now If it should happen that any gentleman of your acquaintance takes a fancy to L and if it should come to anything I m sure both mister H and me would be most thankful and mister H would behave handsome to her And what s more I m sure he would be only too glad to show in a handsome way the thanks he would owe to you and mister M Very truly yours Susan H Higgins CHAPTER II Runnymede so the Mumfords house was named stood on its own little plot of ground in one of the tree shadowed roads which persuade the inhabitants of Sutton that they live in the country It was of red brick and double fronted with a porch of wood and stucco bay windows on one side of the entrance and flat on the other made a contrast pleasing to the suburban eye The little front garden had a close fence of unpainted lath a characteristic of the neighbourhood At the back of the house lay a long narrow lawn bordered with flower beds and shaded at the far end by a fine horse chestnut Emmeline talked much of the delightful proximity of the Downs one would have imagined her taking long walks over the breezy uplands to Banstead or Epsom or yet further afield The fact was she saw no more of the country than if she had lived at Brixton Her windows looked only upon the surrounding houses and their garden foliage Occasionally she walked along the asphalte pavement of the Brighton Road a nursemaids promenade as far as the stone which marks twelve miles from Westminster Bridge Here indeed she breathed the air of the hills but villas on either hand obstructed the view and brought London much nearer than the measured distance Like her friends and neighbours Emmeline enjoyed Sutton because it was a most respectable little portion of the great town set in a purer atmosphere The country would have depressed her In this respect Miss Derrick proved a congenial companion Louise made no pretence of rural inclinations but had a great liking for tree shadowed asphalte for the results of elaborate horticulture for the repose and the quiet of villadom I should like to have a house just like this she declared on her first evening at Runnymede talking with her host and hostess out in the garden It s quite big enough unless of course you have a very large family which must be rather a bore She laughed ingenuously And one gets to town so easily What do you pay for your season ticket mister Mumford Oh well that isn t much I almost think I shall get one Do you wish to go up very often then asked Emmeline reflecting on her new responsibilities Oh not every day of course But a season ticket saves the bother each time and you have a sort of feeling you know that you can be in town whenever you like It had not hitherto been the Mumfords wont to dress for dinner but this evening they did so and obviously to Miss Derrick s gratification She herself appeared in a dress which altogether outshone that of her hostess Afterwards in private she drew Emmeline s attention to this garb and frankly asked her opinion of it Very nice indeed murmured the married lady with a good natured smile Perhaps a little There I know what you re going to say You think it s too showy Now I want you to tell me just what you think about everything everything I shan t be offended I m not so silly You know I ve come here to learn all sorts of things To morrow you shall go over all my dresses with me and those you don t like I ll get rid of I ve never had anyone to tell me what s nice and what isn t I want to be oh well you know what I mean But my dear said Emmeline there s something I don t quite understand You say I m to speak plainly and so I will How is it that you haven t made friends long ago with the sort of people you wish to know It isn t as if you were in poor circumstances How could I make friends with nice people when I was ashamed to have them at home The best I know are quite poor girls I went to school with They re much better educated than I am but they make their own living and so I can t see very much of them and I m not sure they want to see much of me I wish I knew what people think of me they call me vulgar I believe the kind I m speaking of Now do tell me missus Mumford am I vulgar My dear Miss Derrick Emmeline began in protest but was at once interrupted Oh that isn t what I want You must call me Louise or Lou if you like and just say what you really think Yes I see I am rather vulgar and what can you expect Look at mother and if you saw mister Higgins oh The mistake I made was to leave school so soon I got sick of it and left at sixteen and of course the idiots at home I mean the foolish people let me have my own way I m not clever you know and I didn t get on well at school They used to say I could do much better if I liked and perhaps it was more laziness than stupidity though I don t care for books I wish I did I ve had lots of friends but I never keep them for very long I don t know whether it s their fault or mine My oldest friends are Amy Barker and Muriel Featherstone they were both at the school at Clapham and now Amy does type writing in the City and Muriel is at a photographer s They re awfully nice girls and I like them so much but then you see they haven t enough money to live in what I call a nice way and you know I should never think of asking them to advise me about my dresses or anything of that kind A friend of mine once began to say something and I didn t like it after that we had nothing to do with each other Emmeline could not hide her amusement Well that s just it went on the other frankly I have rather a sharp temper and I suppose I don t get on well with most people I used to quarrel dreadfully with some of the girls at school the uppish sort And yet all the time I wanted to be friends with them But of course I could never have taken them home missus Mumford began to read the girl s character and to understand how its complexity had shaped her life She was still uneasy as to the impression this guest would make upon their friends but on the whole it seemed probable that Louise would conscientiously submit herself to instruction and do her very best to be nice Clarence s opinion was still favourable he pronounced Miss Derrick very amusing and less of a savage than his wife s description had led him to expect Having the assistance of two servants and a nurse girl Emmeline was not overburdened with domestic work She soon found it fortunate that her child a girl of two years old needed no great share of her attention for Miss Derrick though at first she affected an extravagant interest in the baby very soon had enough of that plaything and showed a decided preference for Emmeline s society out of sight and hearing of nursery affairs On the afternoon of the second day they went together to call upon missus Fentiman who lived at a distance of a quarter of an hour s walk in a house called Hazeldene a semi detached house considerably smaller than Runnymede and neither without nor within so pleasant to look upon missus Fentiman a tall hard featured but amiable lady had two young children who occupied most of her time at present one of them was ailing and the mother could talk of nothing else but this distressing circumstance The call lasted only for ten minutes and Emmeline felt that her companion was disappointed Children are a great trouble Louise remarked when they had left the house People ought never to marry unless they can keep a lot of servants Not long ago I was rather fond of somebody but I wouldn t have him because he had no money Don t you think I was quite right I have no doubt you were And now pursued the girl poking the ground with her sunshade as she walked there s somebody else And that s one of the things I want to tell you about He has about three hundred a year It isn t much of course but I suppose mister Higgins would give me something And yet I m sure it won t come to anything Let s go home and have a good talk shall we missus Higgins s letter had caused Emmeline and her husband no little amusement but at the same time it led them to reflect Certainly they numbered among their acquaintances one or two marriageable young men who might perchance be attracted by Miss Derrick especially if they learnt that mister Higgins was disposed to behave handsomely to his stepdaughter but the Mumfords had no desire to see Louise speedily married To the bribe with which the letter ended they could give no serious thought Having secured their paying guest they hoped she would remain with them for a year or two at least But already Louise had dropped hints such as Emmeline could not fail to understand and her avowal of serious interest in a lover came rather as an annoyance than a surprise to missus Mumford It was a hot afternoon and they had tea brought out into the garden under the rustling leaves of the chestnut You don t know anyone else at Sutton except missus Fentiman said Louise as she leaned back in the wicker chair Not intimately But some of our friends from London will be coming on Sunday I ve asked four people to lunch How jolly Of course you ll tell me all about them before then But I want to talk about mister Cobb Please two lumps of sugar I ve known him for about a year and a half We seem quite old friends and he writes to me I don t answer the letters unless there s something to say To tell the truth I don t like him How can that be if you seem old friends Well he likes me and there s no harm in that so long as he understands I m sure you wouldn t like him He s a rough coarse sort of man and has a dreadful temper Good gracious What is his position Oh he s connected with the what d ye call it Electric Lighting Company He travels about a good deal I shouldn t mind that it must be rather nice not to have one s husband always at home Just now I believe he s in Ireland I shall be having a letter from him very soon no doubt He doesn t know I ve left home and it ll make him wild Yes that s the kind of man he is Fearfully jealous and such a temper If I married him I m quite sure he would beat me some day Oh Emmeline exclaimed How can you have anything to do with such a man He s very nice sometimes answered Louise thoughtfully But do you really mean that he is rough and coarse Yes I do You couldn t call him a gentleman I ve never seen his people they live somewhere a long way off and I shouldn t wonder if they are a horrid lot His last letter was quite insulting He said let me see what was it Yes You have neither heart nor brains and I shall do my best not to waste another thought on you What do you think of that It seems very extraordinary my dear How can he write to you in that way if you never gave him any encouragement Well but I suppose I have done We ve met on the Common now and then and and that kind of thing I m afraid you re shocked missus Mumford I know it isn t the way that nice people behave and I m going to give it up Does your mother know him Oh yes there s no secret about it Mother rather likes him Of course he behaves himself when he s at the house I ve a good mind to ask him to call here so that you could see him Yes I should like you to sea him You wouldn t mind Not if you really wish it Louise But I can t help thinking you exaggerate his faults Not a bit He s a regular brute when he gets angry My dear Emmeline interposed softly that isn t quite a ladylike expression No it isn t Thank you missus Mumford I meant to say he is horrid very disagreeable Then there s something else I want to tell you about Cissy Higgins that s mister Higgins s daughter you know is half engaged to a man called Bowling an awful idiot I don t think I would use that word dear Thank you missus Mumford I mean to say he s a regular silly But he s in a very good position a partner in Jannaway Brothers of Woolwich though he isn t thirty yet Well now what do you think mister Bowling doesn t seem to know his own mind and just lately he s been paying so much attention to me that Cissy has got quite frantic about it This was really and truly the reason why I left home I see murmured the listener with a look of genuine interest Yes They wanted to get me out of the way There wasn t the slightest fear that I should try to cut Cissy Higgins out but it was getting very awkward for her I admit Now that s the kind of thing that doesn t go on among nice people isn t it But what do you mean Louise when you say that Miss Higgins and mister mister Bowling are half engaged Oh I mean she has refused him once just for form s sake but he knows very well she means to have him People of your kind don t do that sort of thing do they I hardly know Emmeline replied colouring a little at certain private reminiscences And am I to understand that you wouldn t on any account listen to mister Bowling Louise laughed Oh there s no knowing what I might do to spite Cissy We hate each other of course But I can t fancy myself marrying him He has a long nose and talks through it And he says think you for thank you and he sings oh to hear him sing I can t bear the man The matter of this conversation Emmeline reported to her husband at night and they agreed in the hope that neither mister Cobb nor mister Bowling would make an appearance at Runnymede Mumford opined that these individuals were cads Small wonder he said that the girl wished to enter a new social sphere His wife on the other hand had a suspicion that Miss Derrick would not be content to see the last of mister Cobb He the electrical engineer or whatever he was could hardly be such a ruffian as the girl depicted His words You have neither heart nor brains seemed to indicate anything but a coarse mind But what a bad tempered lot they are Mumford observed I suppose people of that sort quarrel and abuse each other merely to pass the time They seem to be just one degree above the roughs who come to blows and get into the police court You must really do your best to get the girl out of it I m sure she is worthy of better things She is in one way answered his wife judicially But her education stopped too soon I doubt if it s possible to change her very much And I really should like after all to see mister Cobb Mumford broke into a laugh There you go The eternal feminine You ll have her married in six months Don t be vulgar Clarence And we ve talked enough of Louise for the present Miss Derrick s presentiment that a letter from mister Cobb would soon reach her was justified the next day it arrived in the afternoon readdressed from Tulse Hill Emmeline observed the eagerness with which this epistle was pounced upon and carried off for private perusal She saw too that in half an hour s time Louise left the house doubtless to post a reply But to her surprise not a word of the matter escaped Miss Derrick during the whole evening In her school days Louise had learned to play the piano but caring little or nothing for music she had hardly touched a key for several years Now the idea possessed her that she must resume her practising and to day she had spent hours at the piano with painful effect upon missus Mumford s nerves After dinner she offered to play to Mumford and he good natured fellow stood by her to turn over the leaves Emmeline with fancy work in her hands watched the two She was not one of the most foolish of her sex but it relieved her when Clarence moved away The next morning Louise was an hour late for breakfast She came down when Mumford had left the house and Emmeline saw with surprise that she was dressed for going out Just a cup of coffee please I ve no appetite this morning and I want to catch a train for Victoria as soon as possible When will you be back Oh I don t quite know To tea I think The girl had all at once grown reticent and her lips showed the less amiable possibilities of their contour CHAPTER III At dinner time she had not returned It being Saturday Mumford was back early in the afternoon and Miss Derrick s absence caused no grief Emmeline could play with baby in the garden whilst her husband smoked his pipe and looked on in the old comfortable way They already felt that domestic life was not quite the same with a stranger to share it Doubtless they would get used to the new restraints but Miss Derrick must not expect them to disorganise their mealtimes on her account Promptly at half past seven they sat down to dine and had just risen from the table when Louise appeared She was in excellent spirits without a trace of the morning s ill humour No apologies If she didn t feel quite free to come and go without putting people out there would be no comfort in life A slice of the joint that was all she wanted and she would have done in a few minutes I ve taken tickets for Toole s Theatre on Monday night You must both come You can can t you Mumford and his wife glanced at each other Yes they could go it was very kind of Miss Derrick but That s all right it ll be jolly The idea struck me in the train as I was going up so I took a cab from Victoria and booked the places first thing Third row from the front dress circle the best I could do Please let me have my dinner alone missus Mumford I want to tell you something afterwards Clarence went round to see his friend Fentiman with whom he usually had a chat on Saturday evening Emmeline was soon joined by the guest in the drawing room There you may read that said Louise holding out a letter It s from mister Cobb came yesterday but I didn t care to talk about it then Yes please read it I want you to Reluctantly but with curiosity Emmeline glanced over the sheet mister Cobb wrote in ignorance of Miss Derrick s having left home It was a plain formal letter giving a brief account of his doings in Ireland and making a request that Louise would meet him if possible on Streatham Common at three o clock on Saturday afternoon And he signed himself Very sincerely yours I made up my mind at once said the girl that I wouldn t meet him That kind of thing will have to stop I m not going to think any more of him and it s better to make him understand it at once isn t it Emmeline heartily concurred Still pursued the other with an air of great satisfaction I thought I had better go home for this afternoon Because when he didn t see me on the Common he was pretty sure to call at the house and I didn t want mother or Cissy to be talking about me to him before he had heard my own explanation Didn t you answer the letter asked Emmeline No I just sent a line to mother to let her know I was coming over to day so that she might stay at home Well and it happened just as I thought mister Cobb came to the house at half past three But before that I d had a terrible row with Cissy That isn t a nice expression I know but it really was one of our worst quarrels mister Bowling hasn t been near since I left and Cissy is furious She said such things that I had to tell her very plainly what I thought of her and she positively foamed at the mouth Now look here she said if I find out that he goes to Sutton you ll see what will happen What will happen I asked Father will stop your allowance and you ll have to get on as best you can Oh very well I said in that case I shall marry mister Bowling You should have seen her rage You said you wouldn t marry him if he had ten thousand a year she screamed I dare say I did but if I ve nothing to live upon You can marry your mister Cobb can t you And she almost cried and I should have felt sorry for her if she hadn t made me so angry No I said I can t marry mister Cobb And I never dreamt of marrying mister Cobb And Emmeline interposed Really Louise that kind of talk isn t at all ladylike What a pity you went home Yes I was sorry for it afterwards I shan t go again for a long time I promise you I won t However mister Cobb came and I saw him alone He was astonished when he heard what had been going on he was astonished at me too I mean the way I spoke I wanted him to understand at once that there was nothing between us I talked in rather a you know the sort of way She raised her chin slightly and looked down from under her eyelids Oh I assure you I behaved quite nicely But he got into a rage as he always does and began to call me names and I wouldn t stand it mister Cobb I said very severely either you will conduct yourself properly or you will leave the house Then he tried another tone and said very different things the kind of thing one likes to hear you know but I pretended that I didn t care for it a bit It s all over between us then he shouted at last yes really shouted and I m sure people must have heard All over I said But there never was anything nothing serious Oh all right Good bye then And off he rushed And I dare say I ve seen the last of him for a time Now do try to live quietly my dear said Emmeline Go on with your music and read a little each day Yes that s just what I m going to do dear missus Mumford And your friends will be here to morrow it ll be so quiet and nice And on Monday we shall go to the theatre just for a change And I m not going to think of those people It s all settled I shall live very quietly indeed She banged on the piano till nearly eleven o clock and went off to bed with a smile of virtuous contentment The guests who arrived on Sunday morning were mister and missus Grove mister Bilton and mister Dunnill missus Grove was Emmeline s elder sister a merry talkative kindly woman Aware of the circumstances she at once made friends with Miss Derrick and greatly pleased that young lady by a skilful blending of superior talk with easy homeliness mister Bilton a stockbroker s clerk represented the better kind of City young man athletic yet intelligent spirited without vulgarity a breezy good humoured wholesome fellow He came down on his bicycle and would return in the same way Louise at once made a resolve to learn cycling I wish you lived at Sutton mister Bilton I should ask you to teach me I m really very sorry that I don t replied the young man discreetly Oh never mind I ll find somebody The fourth arrival mister Dunnill was older and less affable He talked chiefly with mister Grove a very quiet somewhat careworn man neither of them seemed able to shake off business but they did not obtrude it on the company in general The day passed pleasantly but in Miss Derrick s opinion rather soberly Doing her best to fascinate mister Bilton she felt a slight disappointment at her inability to engross his attention and at the civil friendliness which he thought a sufficient reply to her gay sallies For so good looking and well dressed a man he struck her as singularly reserved But perhaps he was engaged yes that must be the explanation When the guests had left she put a plain question to missus Mumford I don t think he is engaged answered Emmeline who on the whole was satisfied with Miss Derrick s demeanour throughout the day Oh But of course he may be without you knowing it Or is it always made known There s no rule about it my dear Well they re very nice people said Louise with a little sigh And I like your sister so much I m glad she asked me to go and see her Is mister Bilton often at her house Don t misunderstand me missus Mumford It s only that I do like men s society there s no harm is there And people like mister Bilton are very different from those I ve known and I want to see more of them you know There s no harm in saying that to me Louise replied missus Mumford But pray be careful not to seem forward People think and say such disagreeable things Miss Derrick was grateful and again gave an assurance that repose and modesty should be the rule of her life At the theatre on Monday evening she exhibited a childlike enjoyment which her companions could not but envy The freshness of her sensibilities was indeed remarkable and Emmeline observed with pleasure that her mind seemed to have a very wholesome tone Louise might commit follies and be guilty of bad taste to any extent but nothing in her savoured of depravity Tuesday she spent at home pretending to read a little and obviously thinking a great deal On Wednesday morning she proposed of a sudden that Emmeline should go up to town with her on a shopping expedition They had already turned over her wardrobe numerous articles whereof were condemned by missus Mumford s taste and by Louise cheerfully sacrificed she could not rest till new purchases had been made So after early luncheon they took train to Victoria Louise insisting that all the expenses should be hers By five o clock she had laid out some fifteen pounds vastly to her satisfaction They took tea at a restaurant and reached Sutton not long before Mumford s return On Friday they went to London again to call upon missus Grove Louise promised that this should be her last outing for a whole week She admitted a feeling of restlessness but after to day she would overcome it And that night she apologised formally to Mumford for taking his wife so much from home Please don t think I shall always be running about like this I feel that I m settling down We are going to be very comfortable and quiet And to the surprise of her friends more than a week went by before she declared that a day in town was absolutely necessary mister Higgins had sent her a fresh supply of money as there were still a few things she needed to purchase But this time Emmeline begged her to go alone and Louise seemed quite satisfied with the arrangement Early in the afternoon as missus Mumford was making ready to go out the servant announced to her that a gentleman had called to see Miss Derrick on learning that Miss Derrick was away he had asked sundry questions and ended by requesting an interview with missus Mumford His name was Cobb Show him into the drawing room said Emmeline a trifle agitated I will be down in a few moments Beset by anxious anticipations she entered the room and saw before her a figure not wholly unlike what she had imagined a wiry resolute looking man with knitted brows lips close set and heavy feet firmly planted on the carpet He was respectably dressed but nothing more and in his large bare hands held a brown hat marked with a grease spot One would have judged him a skilled mechanic When he began to speak his blunt but civil phrases were in keeping with this impression He had not the tone of an educated man yet committed no vulgar errors My name is Cobb I must beg your pardon for troubling you Perhaps you have heard of me from Miss Derrick Yes mister Cobb your name has been mentioned Emmeline replied nervously Will you sit down Thank you I will He twisted his hat about and seemed to prepare with difficulty the next remark which at length burst rather than fell from his lips I wanted to see Miss Derrick I suppose she is still living with you They told me so A terrible man thought Emmeline when roused to anger his words must descend like sledge hammers And it would not take much to anger him For all that he had by no means a truculent countenance He was trying to smile and his features softened agreeably enough The more closely she observed him the less grew Emmeline s wonder that Louise felt an interest in the man Miss Derrick is likely to stay with us for some time I believe She has only gone to town to do some shopping I see When I met her last she talked a good deal about you missus Mumford and that s why I thought I would ask to see you You have a good deal of influence over her Do you think so returned Emmeline not displeased I hope I may use it for her good So do I But well it comes to this missus Mumford She seemed to hint though she didn t exactly say so that you were advising her to have nothing more to do with me Of course you don t know me and I ve no doubt you do what you think the best for her I should feel it a kindness if you would just tell me whether you are really persuading her to think no more about me It was an alarming challenge Emmeline s fears returned she half expected an outbreak of violence The man was growing very nervous and his muscles showed the working of strong emotion I have given her no such advice mister Cobb she answered with an attempt at calm dignity Miss Derrick s private affairs don t at all concern me In such matters as this she is really quite old enough to judge for herself That s what I should have said remarked mister Cobb sturdily I hope you ll excuse me I don t wish to make myself offensive After what she said to me when we met last I suppose most men would just let her go her own way But but somehow I can t do that The thing is I can t trust what she says I don t believe she knows her own mind And so long as you tell me that you re not interfering I mean that you don t think it right to set her against me I assure you nothing of the kind There was a brief silence then Cobb s voice again sounded with blunt emphasis We re neither of us very good tempered We ve known each other about a year and we must have quarrelled about fifty times Do you think then ventured the hostess that it would ever be possible for you to live peacefully together Yes I do was the robust answer It would be a fight for the upper hand but I know who d get it and after that things would be all right Emmeline could not restrain a laugh and her visitor joined in it with a heartiness which spoke in his favour I promise you mister Cobb that I will do nothing whatever against your interests That s very kind of you and it s all I wanted to know He stood up Emmeline still doubtful how to behave asked him if he would call on another day when Miss Derrick might be at home It s only by chance I was able to get here this afternoon he replied I haven t much time to go running about after her and that s where I m at a disadvantage I don t know whether there s anyone else and I m not asking you to tell me if you know Of course I have to take my chance but so long as you don t speak against me and she thinks a great deal of your advice I m very glad to be assured of that All I shall do mister Cobb is to keep before her mind the duty of behaving straightforwardly That s the thing Nobody can ask more than that Emmeline hesitated but could not dismiss him without shaking hands That he did not offer to do so until invited though he betrayed no sense of social inferiority seemed another point in his favour CHAPTER IV Not half an hour after Cobb s departure Louise returned Emmeline was surprised to see her back so soon they met near the railway station as missus Mumford was on her way to a shop in High Street Isn t it good of me If I had stayed longer I should have gone home to quarrel with Cissy but I struggled against the temptation Going to the grocer s Oh do let me go with you and see how you do that kind of thing I never gave an order at the grocer s in my life no indeed I never did Mother and Cissy have always looked after that And I want to learn about housekeeping you promised to teach me Emmeline made no mention of mister Cobb s call until they reached the house He came here Louise exclaimed reddening What impudence I shall at once write and tell him that his behaviour is outrageous Am I to be hunted like this Her wrath seemed genuine enough but she was vehemently eager to learn all that had passed Emmeline made a truthful report You re quite sure that was all Oh his impertinence Well and now that you ve seen him don t you understand how how impossible it is I shall say nothing more about it Louise It isn t my business to The girl s face threatened a tempest As Emmeline was moving away she rudely obstructed her I insist on you telling me what you think It was abominable of him to come when I wasn t at home and I don t think you ought to have seen him You ve no right to keep your thoughts to yourself missus Mumford was offended and showed it I have a perfect right and I shall do so Please don t let us quarrel You may be fond of it but I am not Louise went from the room and remained invisible till just before dinner when she came down with a grave and rather haughty countenance To Mumford s remarks she replied with curt formality he prepared for this state of things began conversing cheerfully with his wife and Miss Derrick kept silence After dinner she passed out into the garden It won t do said Mumford The house is upset I m afraid we shall have to get rid of her If she can t behave herself I m afraid we must It s my fault I ought to have known that it would never do At half past ten Louise was still sitting out of doors in the dark Emmeline wishing to lock up for the night went to summon her troublesome guest Hadn t you better come in Yes But I think you are very unkind missus Mumford Miss Derrick I really can t do anything but leave you alone when you are in such an unpleasant hum our But that s just what you oughtn t to do When I m left alone I sulk and that s bad for all of us If you would just get angry and give me what I deserve it would be all over very soon You are always talking about nice people Nice people don t have scenes of that kind No I suppose not And I m very sorry and if you ll let me beg your pardon There and we might have made it up hours ago I won t ask you to tell me what you think of mister Cobb I ve written him the kind of letter his impudence deserves Very well We won t talk of it any more And if you could be a little quieter in your manners Louise I will I promise I will Let me say good night to mister Mumford For a day or two there was halcyon weather On Saturday afternoon Louise hired a carriage and took her friends for a drive into the country at her special request the child accompanied them Nothing could have been more delightful She had quite made up her mind to have a house some day at Sutton She hoped the Mumfords would always live there that they might perpetually enjoy each other s society What were the rents she inquired Well to begin with she would be content with one of the smaller houses a modest semidetached little place like those at the far end of Cedar Road They were perfectly respectable were they not How this change in her station was to come about Louise offered no hint and did not seem to think of the matter Then restlessness again came upon her One day she all but declared her disappointment that the Mumfords saw so few people Emmeline repeating this to her husband avowed a certain compunction I almost feel that I deliberately misled her You know Clarence in our first conversation I mentioned the Kirby Simpsons and missus Hollings and I feel sure she remembers It wouldn t be nice to be taking her money on false pretences would it Oh don t trouble It s quite certain she has someone in mind whom she means to marry before long I can t help thinking that But I don t know who it can be She had a letter this morning in a man s writing and didn t speak of it It wasn t mister Cobb Louise next day put a point blank question Didn t you say that you knew some people at West Kensington Oh yes answered Emmeline carelessly The Kirby Simpsons They re away from home I m sorry for that Isn t there anyone else we could go and see or ask over here I think it very likely mister Bilton will come down in a few days Louise received mister Bilton s name with moderate interest But she dropped the subject and seemed to reconcile herself to domestic pleasures It was on the evening of this day that Emmeline received a letter which gave her much annoyance Her sister missus Grove wrote thus How news does get about And what ridiculous forms it takes Here is missus Powell writing to me from Birmingham and she says she has heard that you have taken in the daughter of some wealthy parvenu for a consideration to train her in the ways of decent society Just the kind of thing missus Powell would delight in talking about she is so very malicious Where she got her information I can t imagine She doesn t give the slightest hint They tell me I copy her words that the girl is all but a savage and does and says the most awful things I quite admire missus Mumford s courage I ve heard of people doing this kind of thing and I always wondered how they got on with their friends Of course I have written to contradict this rubbish But it s very annoying I m sure Mumford was angry The source of these fables must be either Bilton or Dunnill yet he had not thought either of them the kind of men to make mischief Who else knew anything of the affair Searching her memory Emmeline recalled a person unknown to her a married lady who had dropped in at missus Grove s when she and Louise were there I didn t like her a supercilious sort of person And she talked a great deal of her acquaintance with important people It s far more likely to have come from her than from either of those men I shall write and tell Molly so They began to feel uncomfortable and seriously thought of getting rid of the burden so imprudently undertaken Louise the next day wanted to take Emmeline to town and showed dissatisfaction when she had to go unaccompanied She stayed till late in the evening and came back with a gay account of her calls upon two or three old friends the girls of whom she had spoken to missus Mumford One of them Miss Featherstone she had taken to dine with her at a restaurant and afterwards they had spent an hour or two at Miss Featherstone s lodgings I didn t go near Tulse Hill and if you knew how I am wondering what is going on there Not a line from anyone I shall write to mother to morrow Emmeline produced a letter which had arrived for Miss Derrick Why didn t you give it me before Louise exclaimed impatiently My dear you had so much to tell me I waited for the first pause That isn t from home said the girl after a glance at the envelope It s nothing After saying good night she called to Emmeline from her bedroom door Entering the room missus Mumford saw the open letter in Louise s hand and read in her face a desire of confession I want to tell you something Don t be in a hurry just a few minutes This letter is from mister Bowling Yes and I ve had one from him before and I was obliged to answer it Do you mean they are love letters Yes I m afraid they are And it s so stupid and I m so vexed I don t want to have anything to do with him as I told you long ago Louise often used expressions which to a stranger would have implied that her intimacy with missus Mumford was of years standing He wrote for the first time last week Such a silly letter I wish you would read it Well he said that it was all over between him and Cissy and that he cared only for me and always had and always would you know how men write He said he considered himself quite free Cissy had refused him and wasn t that enough Now that I was away from home he could write to me and wouldn t I let him see me Of course I wrote that I didn t want to see him and I thought he was behaving very badly though I don t really think so because it s all that idiot Cissy s fault Didn t I do quite right I think so Very well And now he s writing again you see oh such a lot of rubbish I can hear him saying it all through his nose Do tell me what I ought to do next You must either pay no attention to the letter or reply so that he can t possibly misunderstand you Call him names you mean My dear Louise But that s the only way with such men I suppose you never were bothered with them I think I d better not write at all Emmeline approved this course and soon left Miss Derrick to her reflections The next day Louise carried out her resolve to write for information regarding the progress of things at Coburg Lodge She had not long to wait for a reply and it was of so startling a nature that she ran at once to missus Mumford whom she found in the nursery Do please come down Here s something I must tell you about What do you think mother says I ve to go back home again at once What s the reason Emmeline inquired knowing not whether to be glad or sorry I ll read it to you Dear Lou she says you ve made a great deal of trouble and I hope you re satisfied Things are all upside down and I ve never seen dada that s mister Higgins of course I ve never seen dada in such a bad temper not since first I knew him mister B that s mister Bowling you know has told him plain that he doesn t think any more of Cissy and that nothing mustn t be expected of him Oh what sweet letters mother does write That was when dada went and asked him about his intentions as he couldn t help doing because Cissy is fretting so It s all over and of course you re the cause of it and though I can t blame you as much as the others do I think you are to blame And Cissy said she must go to the seaside to get over it and she went off yesterday to Margate to your Aunt Annie s boarding house and there she says she shall stay as long as she doesn t feel quite well and dada has to pay two guineas a week for her So he says at once Now Loo ll have to come back I m not going to pay for the both of them boarding out he says And he means it He has told me to write to you at once and you re to come as soon as you can and he won t be responsible to missus Mumford for more than another week s payment There But I shan t go for all that The idea I left home just to please them and now I m to go back just when it suits their convenience Certainly not But what will you do Louise asked missus Mumford if mister Higgins is quite determined Do Oh I shall settle it easy enough I shall write at once to the old man and tell him I m getting on so nicely in every way that I couldn t dream of leaving you It s all nonsense you ll see Emmeline and her husband held a council that night and resolved that whatever the issue of Louise s appeal to her stepfather this was a very good opportunity for getting rid of their guest They would wait till Louise made known the upshot of her negotiations It seemed probable that mister Higgins would spare them the unpleasantness of telling Miss Derrick she must leave If not that disagreeable necessity must be faced I had rather cut down expenses all round said Emmeline than have our home upset in this way It isn t like home at all Louise is a whirlwind and the longer she stays the worse it ll be Yes it won t do at all Mumford assented By the bye I met Bilton to day and he asked after Miss Derrick I didn t like his look or his tone at all I feel quite sure there s a joke going round at our expense Confound it Never mind It ll be over in a day or two and it ll be a lesson to you Clarence won t it I quite admit that the idea was mine her husband replied rather irritably But it wasn t I who accepted the girl as a suitable person And certainly it wasn t me rejoined Emmeline You will please to remember that I said again and again Oh hang it Emmy We made a blunder both of us and don t let us make it worse by wrangling about it There you are people of that class bring infection into the house If she stayed here a twelvemonth we should have got to throwing things at each other The answer to Louise s letter of remonstrance came in the form of missus Higgins herself Shortly before luncheon that lady drove up to Runnymede in a cab and her daughter who had just returned from a walk was startled to hear of the arrival You ve got to come home with me Lou missus Higgins began as she wiped her perspiring face I ve promised to have you back by this afternoon Dada s right down angry you wouldn t know him He blames everything on to you and you d better just come home quiet I shall do nothing of the kind answered Louise her temper rising missus Higgins glared at her and began to rail the voice was painfully audible to Emmeline who just then passed through the hall Miss Derrick gave as good as she received a battle raged for some minutes differing from many a former conflict only in the moderation of pitch and vocabulary due to their being in a stranger s house Then you won t come cried the mother at length I ve had my journey for nothing have I Then just go and fetch missus What s her name She must hear what I ve got to say missus Mumford isn t at home answered Louise with bold mendacity And a very good thing too I should be sorry for her to see you in the state you re in I m in no more of a state than you are Louise And just you listen to this Not one farthing more will you have from ome not one farthing And you may think yourself lucky if you still ave a ome For all I know you ll have to earn your own living and I d like to hear how you mean to do it As soon as I get back I shall write to missus What s her name and tell her that nothing will be paid for you after the week that s due and the week that s for notice Now just take heed of what you re doing Lou It may have more serious results than you think for I ve thought all I m going to think replied the girl I shall stay here as long as I like and be indebted neither to you nor to stepfather missus Mumford breathed a sigh of thankfulness that she was not called upon to take part in this scene It was bad enough that the servant engaged in laying lunch could hear distinctly missus Higgins s coarse and violent onslaught When the front door at length closed she rejoiced but with trembling for the words that fell upon her ear from the hall announced too plainly that Louise was determined to stay CHAPTER V 
6540-232291-0000	train-other-500	Miss Derrick had gone back into the drawing room and to Emmeline s surprise remained there This retirement was ominous the girl must be taking some resolve Emmeline on her part braced her courage for the step on which she had decided
6540-232291-0001	train-other-500	Luncheon awaited them but it would be much better to arrive at an understanding before they sat down to the meal She entered the room and found Louise leaning on the back of a chair I dare say you heard the row Miss Derrick remarked coldly I m very sorry
6540-232291-0002	train-other-500	but nothing of that kind shall happen again Her countenance was disturbed she seemed to be putting a restraint upon herself and only with great effort to subdue her voice
none	none	 What are you going to do asked Emmeline 
6540-232291-0003	train-other-500	in a friendly tone but as it were from a distance I am going to ask you to do me a great kindness missus Mumford There was no reply The girl paused a moment then resumed impulsively
6540-232291-0004	train-other-500	mister Higgins says that if I don t come home he won t let me have any more money They re going to write and tell you that they won t be responsible after this for my board and lodging Of course I shall not go home I shouldn t dream of it I d rather earn my living as
6540-232291-0005	train-other-500	as a scullery maid I want to ask you missus Mumford whether you will let me stay on and trust me to pay what I owe you It won t be for very long and I promise you I will pay every penny
none	none	 The natural impulse of Emmeline s disposition was to reply with hospitable kindliness 
6540-232291-0006	train-other-500	she found it very difficult to maintain her purpose it shamed her to behave like the ordinary landlady to appear actuated by mean motives But the domestic strain was growing intolerable
6540-232291-0007	train-other-500	and she felt sure that Clarence would be exasperated if her weakness prolonged it Now do let me advise you Louise she answered gently Are you acting wisely Wouldn t it be very much better to go home Louise lost all her self control
6540-232291-0008	train-other-500	Flushed with anger her eyes glaring she broke into vehement exclamations You want to get rid of me Very well I ll go this moment I was going to tell you something
none	none	 but you don t care what becomes of me 
6540-232291-0009	train-other-500	I ll send for my luggage you shan t be troubled with it long
none	none	 And you ll be paid all that s owing 
6540-232291-0010	train-other-500	I didn t think you were one of that kind I ll go this minute Just as you please said Emmeline Your temper is really so very Oh I know It s always my temper and nobody else is ever to blame
none	none	 I wouldn t stay another night in the house if I had to sleep on the Downs 
6540-232291-0011	train-other-500	She flung out of the room and flew upstairs Emmeline angered by this unwarrantable treatment determined to hold aloof and let the girl do as she would
none	none	 Miss Derrick was of full age 
6540-232291-0012	train-other-500	and quite capable of taking care of herself or at all events ought to be Perhaps this was the only possible issue of the difficulties in which they had all become involved neither Louise nor her parents could be dealt with in the rational peaceful way preferred by well conditioned people
6540-232291-0013	train-other-500	To get her out of the house was the main point if she chose to depart in a whirlwind that was her own affair All but certainly she would go home to morrow if not to day In less than a quarter of an hour her step sounded on the stairs
6540-232291-0014	train-other-500	would she turn into the dining room where Emmeline now sat at table No straight through the hall and out at the front door which closed however quite softly behind her That she did not slam it seemed wonderful to Emmeline
6540-232291-0015	train-other-500	The girl was not wholly a savage Presently missus Mumford went up to inspect the forsaken chamber Louise had packed all her things
none	none	 of course she must have tumbled them recklessly into the trunks 
6540-232291-0016	train-other-500	Drawers were left open as if to exhibit their emptiness but in other respects the room looked tidy enough Neatness and order came by no means naturally to Miss Derrick and Emmeline did not know what pains the girl had taken ever since her arrival
6540-232291-0017	train-other-500	to live in conformity with the habits of a nice household Louise meanwhile had gone to the railway station intending to take a ticket for Victoria But half an hour must elapse before the arrival of a train
6540-232291-0018	train-other-500	and she walked about in an irresolute mood For one thing she felt hungry at Sutton her appetite had been keen and meal times were always welcome She entered the refreshment room
6540-232291-0019	train-other-500	and with inward murmurs made a repast which reminded her of the excellent luncheon she might now have been enjoying All the time she pondered her situation Ultimately instead of booking for Victoria she procured a ticket for Epsom Downs
6540-232291-0020	train-other-500	and had not long to wait for the train It was a hot day at the end of June Wafts of breezy coolness passed now and then over the high open country but did not suffice to combat the sun s steady glare After walking half a mile or so absorbed in thought
6540-232291-0021	train-other-500	Louise suffered so much that she looked about for shadow Before her was the towering ugliness of the Grand Stand this she had seen and admired when driving past it with her friends it did not now attract her
6540-232291-0022	train-other-500	In another direction the Downs were edged with trees and that way she turned All but overcome with heat and weariness she at length found a shaded spot where her solitude seemed secure And after seating herself
6540-232291-0023	train-other-500	the first thing she did was to have a good cry Then for an hour she sat thinking and as she thought her face gradually emerged from gloom the better truer face which so often allowed itself to be disguised at the prompting of an evil spirit
6540-232291-0024	train-other-500	her softening lips all but smiled as if at an amusing suggestion and her eyes in their reverie seemed to behold a pleasant promise Unconsciously she plucked and tasted the sweet stems of grass that grew about her At length
6540-232291-0025	train-other-500	the sun s movements having robbed her of shadow she rose looked at her watch and glanced around for another retreat Hard by was a little wood delightfully grassy and cool fenced about with railings she could easily have climbed
6540-232291-0026	train-other-500	but a notice board severely admonishing trespassers forbade the attempt With a petulant remark to herself on the selfishness of those people she sauntered past Along this edge of the Downs stands a picturesque row of pine trees
6540-232291-0027	train-other-500	stunted bittered and twisted through many a winter by the upland gales Louise noticed them only to think for a moment what ugly trees they were Before her east west and north lay the wooded landscape
6540-232291-0028	train-other-500	soft of hue beneath the summer sky spreading its tranquil beauty far away to the mists of the horizon In vivacious company she would have called it and perhaps have thought it a charming view alone she had no eye for such things
6540-232291-0029	train-other-500	an indifference characteristic of her mind and not at all dependent upon its mood Presently another patch of shade invited her to repose again and again she meditated for an hour or more The sun had grown less ardent
6540-232291-0030	train-other-500	and a breeze no longer fitful made walking pleasant The sight of holiday making school children who in their ribboned hats and white pinafores were having tea not far away suggested to Louise that she also would like such refreshment
6540-232291-0031	train-other-500	Doubtless it might be procured at the inn yonder near the racecourse and thither she began to move Her thoughts were more at rest she had made her plan for the evening all that had to be done was to kill time for another hour or so
6540-232291-0032	train-other-500	Walking lightly over the turf she noticed the chalk marks significant of golf and wondered how the game was played Without difficulty she obtained her cup of tea loitered over it as long as possible strayed yet awhile about the Downs
6540-232291-0033	train-other-500	and towards half past six made for the railway station She travelled no further than Sutton and there lingered in the waiting room till the arrival of a certain train from London Bridge As the train came in she took up a position near the exit
6540-232291-0034	train-other-500	Among the people who had alighted her eye soon perceived Clarence Mumford She stepped up to him and drew his attention Oh have you come by the same train he asked shaking hands with her No
6540-232291-0035	train-other-500	I ve been waiting here because I wanted to see you mister Mumford Will you spare me a minute or two Here In the station Please if you don t mind Astonished Mumford drew aside with her to a quiet part of the long platform
6540-232291-0036	train-other-500	Louise keeping a very grave countenance told him rapidly all that had befallen since his departure from home in the morning I behaved horridly
none	none	 and I was sorry for it as soon as I had left the house 
6540-232291-0037	train-other-500	After all missus Mumford s kindness to me and yours I don t know how I could be so horrid
none	none	 But the quarrel with mother had upset me so 
6540-232291-0038	train-other-500	and I felt so miserable when missus Mumford seemed to want to get rid of me I feel sure she didn t really want to send me away she was only advising me as she thought for my good But I can t and won t go home
6540-232291-0039	train-other-500	And I ve been waiting all the afternoon to see you No not here
none	none	 I went to Epsom Downs and walked about 
6540-232291-0040	train-other-500	and then came back just in time And do you think I might go back I don t mean now at once but this evening after you ve had dinner I really don t know where to go for the night and it s such a stupid position to be in isn t it
6540-232291-0041	train-other-500	With perfect naivete or with perfect simulation of it she looked him in the face and it was Mumford who had to avert his eyes The young man felt very uncomfortable
6540-232291-0042	train-other-500	Oh I m quite sure Emmy will be glad to let you come for the night Miss Derrick Yes but mister Mumford I want to stay longer a few weeks longer Do you think missus Mumford would forgive me I have made up my mind what to do
6540-232291-0043	train-other-500	and I ought to have told her I should have if I hadn t lost my temper Well replied the other in grave embarrassment but feeling that he had no alternative let us go to the house Oh I couldn t
none	none	 I shouldn t like anyone to know that I spoke to you about it 
6540-232291-0044	train-other-500	It wouldn t be nice would it I thought if I came later after dinner And perhaps you could talk to missus Mumford and and prepare her I mean
none	none	 perhaps you wouldn t mind saying you were sorry I had gone so suddenly 
6540-232291-0045	train-other-500	And then perhaps missus Mumford she s so kind would say that she was sorry too And then I might come into the garden and find you both sitting there Mumford despite his most uneasy frame of mind betrayed a passing amusement
6540-232291-0046	train-other-500	He looked into the girl s face and saw its prettiness flush with pretty confusion and this did not tend to restore his tranquillity What shall you do in the meantime
none	none	 Oh go into the town and have something to eat 
6540-232291-0047	train-other-500	and then walk about You must be dreadfully tired already Just a little but I don t mind It serves me right I shall be so grateful to you mister Mumford
none	none	 If you won t let me come I suppose I must go to London and ask one of my friends to take me in 
6540-232291-0048	train-other-500	I will arrange it Come about half past eight We shall be in the garden by then Avoiding her look he moved away and ran up the stairs But from the exit of the station he walked slowly in part to calm himself
none	none	 to assume his ordinary appearance 
6540-232291-0049	train-other-500	and in part to think over the comedy he was going to play Emmeline met him at the door herself too much flurried to notice anything peculiar in her husband s aspect She repeated the story with which he was already acquainted
6540-232291-0050	train-other-500	And really after all I am so glad was her conclusion I didn t think she had really gone all the afternoon I ve been expecting to see her back again But she won t come now and it is a good thing to have done with the wretched business
6540-232291-0051	train-other-500	I only hope she will tell the truth to her people She might say that we turned her out of the house But I don t think so in spite of all her faults she never seemed deceitful or malicious Mumford was strongly tempted to reveal what had happened at the station
6540-232291-0052	train-other-500	but he saw danger alike in disclosure and in reticence When there enters the slightest possibility of jealousy a man can never be sure that his wife will act as a rational being
6540-232291-0053	train-other-500	He feared to tell the simple truth lest Emmeline should not believe his innocence of previous plotting with Miss Derrick or at all events should be irritated by the circumstances into refusing Louise a lodging for the night
6540-232291-0054	train-other-500	And with no less apprehension he decided at length to keep the secret which might so easily become known hereafter and would then have such disagreeable consequences Well let us have dinner Emmy I m hungry
6540-232291-0055	train-other-500	Yes it s a good thing she has gone but I wish it hadn t happened in that way What a spitfire she is I never never saw the like And if you had heard missus Higgins Oh what dreadful people
none	none	 Clarence hear me register a vow 
6540-232291-0056	train-other-500	It was my fault dear
none	none	 I m awfully sorry I got you in for such horrors 
6540-232291-0057	train-other-500	It was wholly and entirely my fault By due insistence on this Mumford of course put his wife into an excellent humour and after they had dined she returned to her regret that the girl should have gone so suddenly
6540-232291-0058	train-other-500	Clarence declaring that he would allow himself a cigar instead of the usual pipe to celebrate the restoration of domestic peace soon led Emmeline into the garden Heavens how hot it has been
6540-232291-0059	train-other-500	Eighty five in our office at noon eighty five Fellows are discarding waistcoats and wearing what they call a cummerbund silk sash round the waist I think I must follow the fashion How should I look do you think
6540-232291-0060	train-other-500	You don t really mind that we lose the money Emmeline asked presently Pooh We shall do well enough Who s that Someone was entering the garden by the side path And in a moment there remained no doubt who the person was
6540-232291-0061	train-other-500	Louise came forward her head bent her features eloquent of fatigue and distress missus Mumford I couldn t without asking you to forgive me Her voice broke with a sob She stood in a humble attitude and Emmeline
6540-232291-0062	train-other-500	though pierced with vexation had no choice but to hold out a welcoming hand Have you come all the way back from London just to say this I haven t been to London I ve walked about all day and oh I m so tired and miserable
6540-232291-0063	train-other-500	Will you let me stay just for to night I shall be so grateful Of course you may stay Miss Derrick It was very far from my wish to see you go off at a moment s notice But I really couldn t stop you Mumford had stepped aside out of hearing
6540-232291-0064	train-other-500	He forgot his private embarrassment in speculation as to the young woman s character That she was acting distress and penitence he could hardly believe indeed there was no necessity to accuse her of dishonest behaviour
6540-232291-0065	train-other-500	The trivial concealment between him and her amounted to nothing did not alter the facts of the situation But what could be at the root of her seemingly so foolish existence Emmeline held to the view that she was in love with the man Cobb
6540-232291-0066	train-other-500	though perhaps unwilling to admit it even in her own silly mind It might be so and if so it made her more interesting for one was tempted to think that Louise had not the power of loving at all
6540-232291-0067	train-other-500	Yet for his own part he couldn t help liking her the eyes that had looked into his at the station haunted him a little and would not let him think of her contemptuously But what a woman to make ones wife Unless unless
6540-232291-0068	train-other-500	Louise had gone into the house Emmeline approached her husband There I foresaw it Isn t vexing Never mind dear She ll go to morrow or the day after
none	none	 I wish I could be sure of that CHAPTER VI Louise did not appear again that evening Thoroughly tired she unpacked her trunks sat awhile by the open window listening to a piano in a neighbouring house and then jumped into bed From ten o clock to eight next morning she slept soundly At breakfast her behaviour was marked with excessive decorum To the ordinary civilities of her host and hostess she replied softly modestly in the manner of a very young and timid girl save when addressed she kept silence and sat with head inclined a virginal freshness breathed about her she ate very little and that without her usual gusto but rather as if performing a dainty ceremony Her eyes never moved in Mumford s direction The threatened letter from missus Higgins had arrived Emmeline and her husband read it before their guest came down If Louise continued to reside with them they entertained her with a full knowledge that no payment must be expected from Coburg Lodge Emmeline awaited the disclosure of her guest s project which had more than once been alluded to yesterday she could not dream of permitting Louise to stay for more than a day or two whatever the suggestion offered This morning she had again heard from her sister missus Grove who was strongly of opinion that Miss Derrick should be sent back to her native sphere I shall always feel she said to her husband that we have behaved badly I was guilty of false pretences Fortunately we have the excuse of her unbearable temper But for that I should feel dreadfully ashamed of myself Very soon after Mumford s departure Louise begged for a few minutes private talk Every time I come into this drawing room missus Mumford I think how pretty it is What pains you must have taken in furnishing it I never saw such nice curtains anywhere else And that little screen I am so fond of that screen It was a wedding present from an old friend Emmeline replied complacently regarding the object which shone with embroidery of many colours Will you help me when I furnish my drawing room Louise asked sweetly And she added with a direct look I don t think it will be very long Indeed I am going to marry mister Bowling Emmeline could no longer feel astonishment at anything her guest said or did The tone the air with which Louise made this declaration affected her with a sense of something quite unforeseen but at the same time she asked herself why she had not foreseen it Was not this the obvious answer to the riddle All along Louise had wished to marry mister Bowling She might or might not have consciously helped to bring about the rupture between mister Bowling and Miss Higgins she might or might not have felt genuinely reluctant to take advantage of her half sister s defeat But a struggle had been going on in the girl s conscience at all events Yes this explained everything And on the whole it seemed to speak in Louise s favour Her ridicule of mister Bowling s person and character became in this new light a proof of desire to resist her inclinations She had only yielded when it was certain that Miss Higgins s former lover had quite thrown off his old allegiance and when no good could be done by self sacrifice When did you make up your mind to this Louise Yesterday after our horrid quarrel No you didn t quarrel it was all my abominable temper This morning I m going to answer mister Bowling s last letter and I shall tell him what I ve told you He ll be delighted Then you have really wished for this from the first Louise plucked at the fringe on the arm of her chair and replied at length with maidenly frankness I always thought it would be a good marriage for me But I never do believe me I never tried to cut Cissy out The truth is I thought a good deal of the other of mister Cobb But I knew that I couldn t marry him It would be dreadful we should quarrel frightfully and he would kill me I feel sure he would he s so violent in his temper But mister Bowling is very nice he couldn t get angry if he tried And he has a much better position than mister Cobb Emmeline began to waver in her conviction and to feel a natural annoyance And you think she said coldly that your marriage will take place soon That s what I want to speak about dear missus Mumford Did you hear from my mother this morning Then you see what my position is I am homeless If I leave you I don t know where I shall go When mister Higgins knows I m going to marry mister Bowling he won t have me in the house even if I wanted to go back Cissy will be furious she ll come back from Margate just to keep up her father s anger against me If you could let me stay here just a short time missus Mumford just a few weeks I should so like to be married from your house The listener trembled with irritation and before she could command her voice Louise added eagerly Of course when we re married mister Bowling will pay all my debts You are quite mistaken said Emmeline distantly if you think that the money matter has anything to do with with my unreadiness to agree Oh I didn t think it not for a moment I m a trouble to you I know I am But I ll be so quiet dear missus Mumford You shall hardly know I m in the house If once it s all settled I shall never be out of temper Do please let me stay I like you so much and how wretched it would be if I had to be married from a lodging house I m afraid Louise I m really afraid Of my temper the girl interrupted If ever I say an angry word you shall turn me out that very moment Dear missus Mumford Oh what shall I do if you won t be kind to me What will become of me I have no home and everybody hates me Tears streamed down her face she lay back overcome with misery Emmeline was distracted She felt herself powerless to act as common sense dictated yet desired more than ever to rid herself of every shadow of responsibility for the girl s proceedings The idea of this marriage taking place at Runnymede made her blood run cold No no that was absolutely out of the question But equally impossible did it seem to speak with brutal decision Once more she must temporise and hope for courage on another day I can t I really can t give you a definite answer till I have spoken with mister Mumford Oh I am sure he will do me this kindness sobbed Louise A slight emphasis on the he touched missus Mumford unpleasantly She rose and began to pick out some overblown flowers from a vase on the table near her Presently Louise became silent Before either of them spoke again a postman s knock sounded at the house door and Emmeline went to see what letter had been delivered It was for Miss Derrick the handwriting as Emmeline knew that of mister Cobb Oh bother Louise murmured as she took the letter from missus Mumford s hand Well I m a trouble to everybody and I don t know how it ll all end I daresay I shan t live very long Don t talk nonsense Louise Should you like me to go at once missus Mumford the girl asked with a submissive sigh No no Let us think over it for a day or two Perhaps you haven t quite made up your mind after all To this oddly enough Louise gave no reply She lingered by the window nervously bending and rolling her letter which she did not seem to think of opening After a glance or two of discreet curiosity missus Mumford left the room Daily duties called for attention and she was not at all inclined to talk further with Louise The girl as soon as she found herself alone broke mister Cobb s envelope which contained four sides of bold handwriting not a long letter but as usual vigorously worded Dear Miss Derrick he wrote I haven t been in a hurry to reply to your last as it seemed to me that you were in one of your touchy moods when you sent it It wasn t my fault that I called at the house when you were away I happened to have business at Croydon unexpectedly and ran over to Sutton just on the chance of seeing you And I have no objection to tell you all I said to your friend there I am not in the habit of saying things behind people s backs that I don t wish them to hear All I did was to ask out plainly whether missus M was trying to persuade you to have nothing to do with me She said she wasn t and that she didn t wish to interfere one way or another I told her that I could ask no more than that She seemed to me a sensible sort of woman and I don t suppose you ll get much harm from her though I daresay she thinks more about dress and amusements and so on than is good for her or anyone else You say at the end of your letter that I m to let you know when I think of coming again and if you mean by that that you would be glad to see me I can only say thank you I don t mean to give you up yet and I don t believe you want me to say what you will I don t spy after you you re mistaken in that But I m pretty much always thinking about you and I wish you were nearer to me I may have to go to Bristol in a week or two and perhaps I shall be there for a month or more so I must see you before then Will you tell me what day would suit you after seven If you don t want me to come to the house then meet me where you like And there s only one more thing I have to say you must deal honestly with me I can wait but I won t be deceived Louise pondered for a long time turning now to this part of the letter now to that And the lines of her face though they made no approach to smiling indicated agreeable thoughts Tears had left just sufficient trace to give her meditations a semblance of unwonted seriousness About midday she went up to her room and wrote letters The first was to Miss Cissy Higgins Dear Ciss I dare say you would like to know that mister B has proposed to me If you have any objection please let me know it by return Affectionately yours L E DERRICK This she addressed to Margate and stamped with a little thump of the fist Her next sheet of paper was devoted to mister Bowling and the letter though brief cost her some thought Dear mister Bowling Your last is so very nice and kind that I feel I ought to answer it without delay but I cannot answer in the way you wish I must have a long long time to think over such a very important question I don t blame you in the least for your behaviour to someone we know of and I think after all that happened you were quite free It is quite true that she did not behave straightforwardly and I am very sorry to have to say it I shall not be going home again I have quite made up my mind about that I am afraid I must not let you come here to call upon me I have a particular reason for it To tell you the truth my friend missus Mumford is very particular and rather fussy and has a rather trying temper So please do not come just yet I am quite well and enjoying myself in a very quiet way I remain sincerely yours LOUISE E DERRICK Finally she penned a reply to mister Cobb and this after a glance at a railway time table gave her no trouble at all Dear mister Cobb she scribbled if you really must see me before you go away to Bristol or wherever it is you had better meet me on Saturday at Streatham Station which is about halfway between me and you I shall come by the train from Sutton which reaches Streatham at eight point six Yours truly L E D To day was Thursday When Saturday came the state of things at Runnymede had undergone no change whatever Emmeline still waited for a moment of courage and Mumford though he did not relish the prospect began to think it more than probable that Miss Derrick would hold her ground until her actual marriage with mister Bowling Whether that unknown person would discharge the debt his betrothed was incurring seemed an altogether uncertain matter Louise in the meantime kept quiet as a mouse so strangely quiet indeed that Emmeline s prophetic soul dreaded some impending disturbance worse than any they had yet suffered At luncheon Louise made known that she would have to leave in the middle of dinner to catch a train No explanation was offered or asked but Emmeline it being Saturday said she would put the dinner hour earlier to suit her friend s convenience Louise smiled pleasantly and said how very kind it was of missus Mumford She had no difficulty in reaching Streatham by the time appointed Unfortunately it was a cloudy evening and a spattering of rain fell from time to time I suppose you ll be afraid to walk to the Common said mister Cobb who stood waiting at the exit from the station and showed more satisfaction in his countenance when Louise appeared than he evinced in words Oh I don t care she answered It won t rain much and I ve brought my umbrella and I ve nothing on that will take any harm She had indeed dressed herself in her least demonstrative costume Cobb wore the usual garb of his leisure hours which was better than that in which he had called the other day at Runnymede For some minutes they walked towards Streatham Common without interchange of a word and with no glance at each other Then the man coughed and said bluntly that he was glad Louise had come Well I wanted to see you was her answer What about I don t think I shall be able to stay with the Mumfords They re very nice people but they re not exactly my sort and we don t get on very well Where had I better go Go Why home of course The best place for you Cobb was prepared for a hot retort but it did not come After a moment s reflection Louise said quietly I can t go home I ve quarrelled with them too badly You haven t seen mother lately Then I must tell you how things are She did so with no concealment save of the correspondence with mister Bowling and the not unimportant statements concerning him which she had made to missus Mumford In talking with Cobb Louise seemed to drop a degree or so in social status her language was much less careful than when she conversed with the Mumfords and even her voice struck a note of less refinement Decidedly she was more herself if that could be said of one who very rarely made conscious disguise of her characteristics Better stay where you are then for the present said Cobb when he had listened attentively I dare say you can get along well enough with the people if you try That s all very well but what about paying them I shall owe three guineas for every week I stop It s a great deal and they ought to feed you very well for it replied the other smiling rather sourly Don t be vulgar I suppose you think I ought to live on a few shillings a week Lots of people have to But there s no reason why you should But look here why should you be quarrelling with your people now about that fellow Bowling You don t see him anywhere do you He flashed a glance at her and Louise answered with a defiant motion of the head No I don t But they put the blame on me all the same I shouldn t wonder if they think I m trying to get him She opened her umbrella for heavy drops had begun to fall they pattered on Cobb s hard felt hat and Louise tried to shelter him as well as herself Never mind me he said And here let me hold that thing over you If you just put your arm in mine it ll be easier That s the way Take two steps to my one that s it Again they were silent for a few moments They had reached the Common and Cobb struck along a path most likely to be unfrequented No wind was blowing the rain fell in steady spots that could all but be counted and the air grew dark Well I can only propose one thing sounded the masculine voice You can get out of it by marrying me Louise gave a little laugh rather timid than scornful Yes I suppose I can But it s an awkward way It would be rather like using a sledge hammer to crack a nut It ll come sooner or later asserted Cobb with genial confidence That s what I don t like about you Louise withdrew her arm petulantly You always speak as if I couldn t help myself Don t you suppose I have any choice Plenty no doubt was the grim answer Whenever we begin to quarrel it s your fault pursued Miss Derrick with unaccustomed moderation of tone I never knew a man who behaved like you do You seem to think the way to make anyone like you is to bully them We should have got on very much better if you had tried to be pleasant I don t think we ve got along badly all things considered Cobb replied as if after weighing a doubt We d a good deal rather be together than apart it seems to me or else why do we keep meeting And I don t want to bully anybody least of all you It s a way I have of talking I suppose You must judge a man by his actions and his meaning not by the tone of his voice You know very well what a great deal I think of you Of course I don t like it when you begin to speak as if you were only playing with me nobody would I m serious enough said Louise trying to hold the umbrella over her companion and only succeeding in directing moisture down the back of his neck And it s partly through you that I ve got into such difficulties How do you make that out If it wasn t for you I should very likely marry mister Bowling Oh he s asked you has he cried Cobb staring at her Why didn t you tell me that before Don t let me stand in your way I dare say he s just the kind of man for you At all events he s like you in not knowing his own mind Go on Go on Louise exclaimed carelessly There s plenty of time Say all you ve got to say From the gloom of the eastward sky came a rattling of thunder like quick pistol shots Cobb checked his steps We mustn t go any further You re getting wet and the rain isn t likely to stop I shall not go back Louise answered until something has been settled And she stood before him her eyes cast down whilst Cobb looked at the darkening sky I want to know what s going to become of me The Mumfords won t keep me much longer and I don t wish to stay where I m not wanted Let us walk down the hill A flash of lightning made Louise start and the thunder rattled again But only light drops were falling The girl stood her ground I want to know what I am to do If you can t help me say so and let me go my own way Of course I can help you That is if you ll be honest with me I want to know first of all whether you ve been encouraging that man Bowling No I haven t Very well I believe you And now I ll make you a fair offer Marry me as soon as I can make the arrangements and I ll pay all you owe and see that you are in comfortable lodgings until I ve time to get a house It could be done before I go to Bristol and then of course you could go with me You speak said Louise after a short silence just as if you were making an agreement with a servant That s all nonsense and you know it I ve told you how I think often enough in letters and I m not good at saying it Look here I don t think it s very wise to stand out in the middle of the Common in a thunderstorm Let us walk on and I think I would put down your umbrella It wouldn t trouble you much if I were struck with lightning All right take it so I shan t trouble to contradict Louise followed his advice and they began to walk quickly down the slope towards Streatham Neither spoke until they were in the high road again A strong wind was driving the rain clouds to other regions and the thunder had ceased there came a grey twilight rows of lamps made a shimmering upon the wet ways What sort of a house would you take Louise asked suddenly Oh a decent enough house What kind do you want Something like the Mumfords It needn t be quite so large she added quickly but a house with a garden in a nice road and in a respectable part That would suit me well enough answered Cobb cheerfully You seem to think I want to drag you down but you re very much mistaken I m doing pretty well and likely as far as I can see to do better I don t grudge you money far from it All I want to know is that you ll marry me for my own sake He dropped his voice not to express tenderness but because other people were near Upon Louise however it had a pleasing effect and she smiled Very well she made answer in the same subdued tone Then let us settle it in that way They talked amicably for the rest of the time that they spent together It was nearly an hour and never before had they succeeded in conversing so long without a quarrel Louise became light hearted and mirthful her companion though less abandoned to the mood of the moment wore a hopeful countenance Through all his roughness Cobb was distinguished by a personal delicacy which no doubt had impressed Louise say what she might of pretended fears At parting he merely shook hands with her as always CHAPTER VII Glad of a free evening Emmeline after dinner walked round to missus Fentiman s Louise had put a restraint upon the wonted friendly intercourse between the Mumfords and their only familiar acquaintances at Sutton missus Fentiman liked to talk of purely domestic matters and in a stranger s presence she was never at ease Coming alone and when the children were all safe in bed Emmeline had a warm welcome For the first time she spoke of her troublesome guest without reserve This chat would have been restful and enjoyable but for a most unfortunate remark that fell from the elder lady a perfectly innocent mention of something her husband had told her but secretly so disturbing missus Mumford that after hearing it she got away as soon as possible and walked quickly home with dark countenance It was ten o clock Louise had not yet returned but might do so any moment Wishing to be sure of privacy in a conversation with her husband Emmeline summoned him from his book to the bedroom Well what has happened now exclaimed Mumford If this kind of thing goes on much longer I shall feel inclined to take a lodging in town I have heard something very strange I can hardly believe it there must have been a mistake What is it Really one s nerves Is it true that on Thursday evening you and Miss Derrick were seen talking together at the station Thursday the day she went off and came back again after dinner Mumford would gladly have got out of this scrape at any expense of mendacity but he saw at once how useless such an attempt would prove Exasperated by the result of his indiscretion and resenting as all men do the undignified necessity of defending himself he flew into a rage Yes it was true and what next The girl had waylaid him begged him to intercede for her with his wife Of course it would have been better to come home and reveal the matter he didn t do so because it seemed to put him in a silly position For Heaven s sake let the whole absurd business be forgotten and done with Emmeline though not sufficiently enlightened to be above small jealousies would have been ashamed to declare her feeling with the energy of unsophisticated female nature She replied coldly and loftily that the matter of course was done with that it interested her no more but that she could not help regretting an instance of secretiveness such as she had never before discovered in her husband Surely he had put himself in a much sillier position as things turned out than if he had followed the dictates of honour The upshot of it is this cried Mumford Miss Derrick has to leave the house and if necessary I shall tell her so myself Again Emmeline was cold and lofty There was no necessity whatever for any further communication between Clarence and Miss Derrick Let the affair be left entirely in her hands Indeed she must very specially request that Clarence would have nothing more to do with Miss Derrick s business Whereupon Mumford took offence Did Emmeline wish to imply that there had been anything improper in his behaviour beyond the paltry indiscretion to which he had confessed No Emmeline was thankful to say that she did not harbour base suspicions Then rejoined Mumford let this be the last word of a difference as hateful to him as to her And he left the room His wife did not linger more than a minute behind him and she sat in the drawing room to await Miss Derrick s return Mumford kept apart in what was called the library To her credit Emmeline tried hard to believe that she had learnt the whole truth her mind as she had justly declared was not prone to ignoble imaginings but acquitting her husband by no means involved an equal charity towards Louise Hitherto uncertain in her judgment she had now the relief of an assurance that Miss Derrick was not at all a proper person to entertain as a guest on whatever terms The incident of the railway station proved her to be utterly lacking in self respect in feminine modesty even if her behaviour merited no darker description Emmeline could now face with confidence the scene from which she had shrunk not only was it a duty to insist upon Miss Derrick s departure it would be a positive pleasure Louise very soon entered she came into the room with her brightest look and cried gaily Oh I hope I haven t kept you waiting for me Are you alone No I have been out Had you the storm here I m not going to keep you talking you look tired I am rather said Emmeline with reserve She had no intention of allowing Louise to suspect the real cause of what she was about to say that would have seemed to her undignified but she could not speak quite naturally Still I should be glad if you would sit down for a minute The girl took a chair and began to draw off her gloves She understood what was coming it appeared in Emmeline s face Something to say to me missus Mumford I hope you won t think me unkind I feel obliged to ask you when you will be able to make new arrangements You would like me to go soon said Louise inspecting her finger nails and speaking without irritation I am sorry to say that I think it better you should leave us Forgive this plain speaking Miss Derrick It s always best to be perfectly straightforward isn t it Whether she felt the force of this innuendo or not Louise took it in good part As if the idea had only just struck her she looked up cheerfully You re quite right missus Mumford I m sure you ve been very kind to me and I ve had a very pleasant time here but it wouldn t do for me to stay longer May I wait over to morrow just till Wednesday morning to have an answer to a letter Certainly if it is quite understood that there will be no delay beyond that There are circumstances private matters I don t feel quite able to explain But I must be sure that you will have left us by Wednesday afternoon You may be sure of it I will write a line and post it to night for it to go as soon as possible Therewith Louise stood up and smiling withdrew Emmeline was both relieved and surprised she had not thought it possible for the girl to conduct herself at such a juncture with such perfect propriety An outbreak of ill temper perhaps of insolence had seemed more than likely at best she looked for tears and entreaties Well it was over and by Wednesday the house would be restored to its ancient calm Ancient indeed One could not believe that so short a time had passed since Miss Derrick first entered the portals Only one more day Oh blindness to the future kindly given That each may fill the circle marked by Heaven At school Emmeline had learnt and recited these lines but it was long since they had recurred to her memory In ten minutes Louise had written her letter She went out returned and looked in at the drawing room with a pleasant smile Good night missus Mumford Good night Miss Derrick For the grace of the thing Emmeline would have liked to say Louise but could not bring her lips to utter the name About a year ago there had been a little misunderstanding between mister and missus Mumford which lasted for some twenty four hours during which they had nothing to say to each other To night they found themselves in a similar situation and remembered that last difference and wondered both of them at the harmony of their married life It was in truth wonderful enough twelve months without a shadow of ill feeling between them The reflection compelled Mumford to speak when his head was on the pillow Emmy we re making fools of ourselves Just tell me what you have done I can t see how I am guilty of foolishness was the clear cut reply Then why are you angry with me I don t like deceit Hanged if I don t dislike it just as much When is that girl going Emmeline made known the understanding at which she had arrived and her husband breathed an exclamation of profound thankfulness But peace was not perfectly restored In another room Louise lay communing with her thoughts which were not at all disagreeable She had written to Cobb telling him what had happened and asking him to let her know by Wednesday morning what she was to do She could not go home he must not bid her do so but she would take a lodging wherever he liked The position seemed romantic and enjoyable Not till after her actual marriage should the people at home know what had become of her She was marrying with utter disregard of all her dearest ambitions all the same she had rather be the wife of Cobb than of anyone else Her stepfather might recover his old kindness and generosity as soon as he knew she no longer stood in Cissy s way and that she had never seriously thought of marrying mister Bowling Had she not thought of it The question did not enter her own mind and she would have been quite incapable of passing a satisfactory cross examination on the subject missus Mumford foreseeing the difficulty of spending the next day at home told her husband in the morning that she would have early luncheon and go to see missus Grove And I should like you to fetch me from there after business please I will answered Clarence readily He mentally added a hope that his wife did not mean to supervise him henceforth and for ever If so their troubles were only beginning At breakfast Louise continued to be discretion itself She talked of her departure on the morrow as though it had long been a settled thing and was quite unconnected with disagreeable circumstances Only midway in the morning did missus Mumford who had been busy with her child speak of the early luncheon and her journey to town She hoped Miss Derrick would not mind being left alone Oh don t speak of it answered Louise I ve lots to do You ll give my kind regards to missus Grove So they ate together at midday rather silently but with faces composed And Emmeline after a last look into the nursery hastened away to catch her train She had no misgivings during her absence all would be well as ever Louise passed the time without difficulty and at seven o clock made an excellent dinner This evening no reply could be expected from Cobb as he was not likely to have received her letter of last night till his return home from business Still there might be something from someone she always looked eagerly for the postman The weather was gloomy Not long after eight the housemaid brought in a lighted lamp and set it as usual upon the little black four legged table in the drawing room And in the same moment the knocker of the front door sounded a vigorous rat tat tat a visitor s summons CHAPTER VIII It may be someone calling upon me said Louise to the servant Let me know the name before you show anyone in Of course miss replied the domestic with pert familiarity and took her time in arranging the shade of the lamp When she returned from the door it was to announce smilingly that mister Cobb wished to see Miss Derrick Please to show him in Louise stood in an attitude of joyous excitement her eyes sparkling But at the first glance she perceived that her lover s mood was by no means correspondingly gay Cobb stalked forward and kept a stern gaze upon her but said nothing Well You got my letter I suppose What letter He had not been home since breakfast time so Louise s appeal to him for advice lay waiting his arrival Impatiently she described the course of events As soon as she had finished Cobb threw his hat aside and addressed her harshly I want to know what you mean by writing to your sister that you are going to marry Bowling I saw your mother this morning and that s what she told me It must have been only a day or two ago that you said that Just explain if you please I m about sick of this kind of thing and I ll have the truth out of you His anger had never taken such a form as this for the first time Louise did in truth feel afraid of him She shrank away her heart throbbed and her tongue refused its office Say what you mean by it Cobb repeated in a voice that was all the more alarming because he kept it low Did you write that to your sister Yes but I never meant it it was just to make her angry You expect me to believe that And if it s true doesn t it make you out a nice sort of girl But I don t believe it You ve been thinking of him in that way all along and you ve been writing to him or meeting him since you came here What sort of behaviour do you call this Louise was recovering self possession the irritability of her own temper began to support her courage What if I have I d never given you any promise till last night had I I was free to marry anyone I liked wasn t I What do you mean by coming here and going on like this I ve told you the truth about that letter and I ve always told you the truth about everything If you don t like it say so and go Cobb was impressed by the energy of her defence He looked her straight in the eyes and paused a moment then spoke less violently You haven t told me the whole truth I want to know when you saw Bowling last I haven t seen him since I left home When did you write to him last The same day I wrote to Cissy And I shall answer no more questions Of course not But that s quite enough You ve been playing a double game if you haven t told lies you ve acted them What sort of a wife would you make How could I ever believe a word you said I shall have no more to do with you He turned away and in the violence of the movement knocked over a little toy chair one of those perfectly useless and no less ugly impediments which stand about the floor of a well furnished drawing room Too angry to stoop and set the object on its legs again he strode towards the door Louise followed him You are going she asked in a struggling voice Cobb paid no attention and all but reached the door She laid a hand upon him You are going The touch and the voice checked him Again he turned abruptly and seized the hand that rested upon his arm Why are you stopping me What do you want with me I m to help you out of the fix you ve got into is that it I m to find you a lodging and take no end of trouble and then in a week s time get a letter to say that you want nothing more to do with me Louise was pale with anger and fear and as many other emotions as her little heart and brain could well hold She did not look her best far from it but the man saw something in her eyes which threw a fresh spell upon him Still grasping her one hand he caught her by the other arm held her as far off as he could and glared passionately as he spoke What do you want You know I ve told you the truth His grasp hurt her she tried to release herself and moved backwards For a moment Cobb left her free she moved backward again her eyes drawing him on She felt her power and could not be content with thus much exercise of it You may go if you like But you understand if you do Cobb inflamed with desire and jealousy made an effort to recapture her Louise sprang away from him but immediately behind her lay the foolish little chair which he had kicked over and just beyond that stood the scarcely less foolish little table which supported the heavy lamp with its bowl of coloured glass and its spreading yellow shade She tottered back fell with all her weight against the table and brought the lamp crashing to the floor A shriek of terror from Louise from her lover a shout of alarm blended with the sound of breaking glass In an instant a great flame shot up half way to the ceiling The lamp shade was ablaze the much embroidered screen missus Mumford s wedding present forthwith caught fire from a burning tongue that ran along the carpet and Louise s dress well sprinkled with paraffin aided the conflagration Cobb of course saw only the danger to the girl He seized the woollen hearthrug and tried to wrap it about her but with screams of pain and frantic struggles Louise did her best to thwart his purpose The window was open and now a servant rushing in to see what the uproar meant gave the blaze every benefit of draught Bring water roared Cobb who had just succeeded in extinguishing Louise s dress and was carrying her still despite her struggles out of the room Here one of you take Miss Derrick to the next house Bring water you All three servants were scampering and screeching about the hall Cobb caught hold of one of them and all but twisted her arm out of its socket At his fierce command the woman supported Louise into the garden and thence after a minute or two of faintness on the sufferer s part led her to the gate of the neighbouring house The people who lived there chanced to be taking the air on their front lawn Without delay Louise was conveyed beneath the roof and her host a man of energy sped towards the fire to be of what assistance he could The lamp shade the screen the little table and the diminutive chair blazed gallantly and with such a volleying of poisonous fumes that Cobb could scarce hold his ground to do battle Louise out of the way he at once became cool and resourceful Before a flame could reach the window he had rent down the flimsy curtains and flung them outside Bellowing for the water which was so long in coming he used the hearthrug to some purpose on the outskirts of the bonfire but had to keep falling back for fresh air Then appeared a pail and a can which he emptied effectively and next moment sounded the voice of the gentleman from next door Have you a garden hose Set it on to the tap and bring it in here The hose was brought into play and in no great time the last flame had flickered out amid a deluge When all danger was at an end one of the servants the nurse girl uttered a sudden shriek it merely signified that she had now thought for the first time of the little child asleep upstairs Aided by the housemaid she rushed to the nursery snatched her charge from bed and carried the unhappy youngster into the breezes of the night where he screamed at the top of his gamut Cobb when he no longer feared that the house would be burnt down hurried to inquire after Louise She lay on a couch wrapped in a dressing gown for the side and one sleeve of her dress had been burnt away Her moaning never ceased there was a fire mark on the lower part of her face and she stared with eyes of terror and anguish at whoever approached her Already a doctor had been sent for and Cobb reporting that all was safe at Runnymede wished to remove her at once to her own bed room and the strangers were eager to assist What will the Mumfords say Louise asked of a sudden trying to raise herself Leave all that to me Cobb replied reassuringly I ll make it all right don t trouble yourself The nervous shock had made her powerless they carried her in a chair back to Runnymede and upstairs to her bedroom Scarcely was this done when mister and missus Mumford after a leisurely walk from the station approached their garden gate The sight of a little crowd of people in the quiet road the smell of burning loud voices of excited servants caused them to run forward in alarm Emmeline frenzied by the certainty that her own house was on fire began to cry aloud for her child and Mumford rushed like a madman through the garden It s all right said a man who stood in the doorway You mister Mumford It s all right There s been a fire but we ve got it out Emmeline learnt at the same moment that her child had suffered no harm but she would not pause until she saw the little one and held him in her embrace Meanwhile Cobb and Mumford talked in the devastated drawing room which was illumined with candles It s a bad job mister Mumford My name is Cobb I daresay you ve heard of me I came to see Miss Derrick and I was clumsy enough to knock the lamp over Knock the lamp over How could you do that Were you drunk No but you may well ask the question I stumbled over something a little chair I think and fell against the table with the lamp on it Where s Miss Derrick Upstairs She got rather badly burnt I m afraid We ve sent for a doctor And here I am spoke a voice behind them Sorry to see this mister Mumford The two went upstairs together and on the first landing encountered Emmeline sobbing and wailing hysterically with the child in her arms Her husband spoke soothingly Don t don t Emmy Here s doctor Billings come to see Miss Derrick She s the only one that has been hurt Go down there s a good girl and send somebody to help in Miss Derrick s room you can t be any use yourself just now But how did it happen Oh how did it happen I ll come and tell you all about it Better put the boy to bed again hadn t you When she had recovered her senses Emmeline took this advice and leaving the nurse by the child s cot went down to survey the ruin of her property It was a sorry sight Where she had left a reception room such as any suburban lady in moderate circumstances might be proud of she now beheld a mere mass of unrecognisable furniture heaped on what had once been a carpet amid dripping walls and under a grimed ceiling Oh Oh She all but sank before the horror of the spectacle Then in a voice of fierce conviction She did it She did it It was because I told her to leave I know she did it on purpose Mumford closed the door of the room shutting out Cobb and the cook and the housemaid He repeated the story Cobb had told him and quietly urged the improbability of his wife s explanation Miss Derrick he pointed out was lying prostrate from severe burns the fire must have been accidental but the accident to be sure was extraordinary enough Thereupon missus Mumford s wrath turned against Cobb What business had such a man a low class savage in her drawing room He must have come knowing that she and her husband were away for the evening You can question him if you like said Mumford He s out there Emmeline opened the door and at once heard a cry of pain from upstairs Mumford also hearing it and seeing Cobb s misery stricken face by the light of the hall lamp whispered to his wife Hadn t you better go up dear doctor Billings may think it strange It was much wiser to urge this consideration than to make a direct plea for mercy Emmeline did not care to have it reported that selfish distress made her indifferent to the sufferings of a friend staying in her house But she could not pass Cobb without addressing him severely So you are the cause of this I am missus Mumford and I can only say that I ll do my best to make good the damage to your house Make good I fancy you have strange ideas of the value of the property destroyed Insolence was no characteristic of missus Mumford But calamity had put her beside herself she spoke not in her own person but as a woman whose carpets curtains and bric a brac have ignominiously perished I ll make it good Cobb repeated humbly however long it takes me And don t be angry with that poor girl missus Mumford It wasn t her fault not in any way She didn t know I was coming she hadn t asked me to come I m entirely to blame You mean to say you knocked over the table by accident I did indeed And I wish I d been burnt myself instead of her He had suffered by the way no inconsiderable scorching to which his hands would testify for many a week but of this he was still hardly aware Emmeline with a glance of uttermost scorn left him and ascended to the room where the doctor was busy Free to behave as he thought fit Mumford beckoned Cobb to follow him into the front garden where they conversed with masculine calm I shall put up at Sutton for the night said Cobb and perhaps you ll let me call the first thing in the morning to ask how she gets on Of course We ll see the doctor when he comes down But I wish I could understand how you managed to throw the lamp down The truth is Cobb replied we were quarrelling I d heard something about her that made me wild and I came and behaved like a fool I feel just now as if I could go and cut my throat that s the fact If anything happens to her I believe I shall I might as well in any case she ll never look at me again Oh don t take such a dark view of it The doctor came out on his way to fetch certain requirements and the two men walked with him to his house in the next road They learned that Louise was not dangerously injured her recovery would be merely a matter of time and care Cobb gave a description of the fire and his hearers marvelled that the results were no worse You must have some burns too said the doctor whose curiosity was piqued by everything he saw and heard of the strange occurrence I thought so those hands must be attended to Meanwhile Emmeline sat by the bedside and listened to the hysterical lamentation in which Louise gave her own the true account of the catastrophe It was all her fault and upon her let all the blame fall She would humble herself to mister Higgins and get him to pay for the furniture destroyed If missus Mumford would but forgive her And so on as her poor body agonised and the blood grew feverish in her veins CHAPTER IX Accept it Certainly Why should we bear the loss if he s able to make it good He seems to be very well off for an unmarried man Yes replied Mumford but he s just going to marry and it seems Well after all you know he didn t really cause the damage I should have felt much less scruple if Higgins had offered to pay He did cause the damage asseverated Emmeline It was his gross or violent behaviour If we had been insured it wouldn t matter so much And pray let this be a warning and insure at once However you look at it he ought to pay Emmeline s temper had suffered much since she made the acquaintance of Miss Derrick Aforetime she could discuss difference of opinion now a hint of diversity drove her at once to the female weapon angry and iterative assertion Her native delicacy also seemed to have degenerated Mumford could only hold his tongue and trust that this would be but a temporary obscurement of his wife s amiable virtues Cobb had written from Bristol a week after the accident formally requesting a statement of the pecuniary loss which the Mumfords had suffered he was resolved to repay them and would do so if possible as soon as he knew the sum Mumford felt a trifle ashamed to make the necessary declaration at the outside even with expenses of painting and papering their actual damage could not be estimated at more than fifty pounds and even Emmeline did not wish to save appearances by making an excessive demand The one costly object in the room the piano was practically uninjured and sundry other pieces of furniture could easily be restored for Cobb and his companion as amateur firemen had by no means gone recklessly to work By candle light when the floor was still a swamp things looked more desperate than they proved to be on subsequent investigation and it is wonderful at how little outlay in our glistening times a villa drawing room may be fashionably equipped So Mumford wrote to his correspondent that only a few articles had absolutely perished that it was not his wish to make any demand at all but that if mister Cobb insisted on offering restitution why a matter of fifty pounds et cetera et cetera And in a few days this sum arrived in the form of a draft upon respectable bankers Of course the house was in grievous disorder Upholsterers workmen would have been bad enough but much worse was the establishment of missus Higgins by her daughter s bedside which naturally involved her presence as a guest at table and the endurance of her conversation whenever she chose to come downstairs Mumford urged his wife to take her summer holiday to go away with the child until all was put right again a phrase which included the removal of Miss Derrick to her own home but of this Emmeline would not hear How could she enjoy an hour of mental quietude when for all she knew missus Higgins and the patient might be throwing lamps at each other And her jealousy was still active though she did not allow it to betray itself in words Clarence seemed to her quite needlessly anxious in his inquiries concerning Miss Derrick s condition Until that young lady had disappeared from Runnymede for ever Emmeline would keep matronly watch and ward missus Higgins declared at least a score of times every day that she could not understand how this dreadful affair had come to pass The most complete explanation from her daughter availed nothing she deemed the event an insoluble mystery and in familiar talk with missus Mumford breathed singular charges against Louise s lover She s shielding him my dear I ve no doubt of it I never had a very good opinion of him but now she shall never marry him with my consent To this kind of remark Emmeline at length deigned no reply She grew to detest missus Higgins and escaped her society by every possible manoeuvre Oh how pleasant it is she explained bitterly to her husband to think that everybody in the road is talking about us with contempt Of course the servants have spread nice stories And the Wilkinsons these were the people next door look upon us as hardly respectable Even missus Fentiman said yesterday that she really could not conceive how I came to take that girl into the house I acknowledged that I must have been crazy Whilst we re thoroughly upset replied Mumford with irritation at this purposeless talk hadn t we better leave the house and go to live as far away as possible Indeed I very much wish we could I don t think I shall ever be happy again at Sutton And Clarence went off muttering to himself about the absurdity and the selfishness of women For a week or ten days Louise lay very ill then her vigorous constitution began to assert itself It helped her greatly towards convalescence when she found that the scorches on her face would not leave a permanent blemish missus Mumford came into the room once a day and sat for a few minutes neither of them desiring longer communion but they managed to exchange inquiries and remarks with a show of friendliness When the fifty pounds came from Cobb Emmeline made no friendliness When the fifty pounds mention of it The next day however missus Higgins being absent when Emmeline looked in Louise said with an air of satisfaction So he has paid the money I m very glad of that mister Cobb insisted on paying missus Mumford answered with reserve We could not hurt his feelings by refusing Well that s all right isn t it You won t think so badly of us now Of course you wish you d never set eyes on me missus Mumford but that s only natural in your place I m sure I should feel the same Still now the money s paid you won t always think unkindly of me will you The girl lay propped on pillows her pale face with its healing scars bore witness to what she had undergone and one of her arms was completely swathed in bandages Emmeline did not soften towards her but the frank speech the rather pathetic little smile in decency demanded a suave response I shall wish you every happiness Louise Thank you We shall be married as soon as ever I m well but I m sure I don t know where Mother hates his very name and does her best to set me against him but I just let her talk We re beginning to quarrel a little did you hear us this morning I try to keep down my voice and I shan t be here much longer you know I shall go home at first my stepfather has written a kind letter and of course he s glad to know I shall marry mister Cobb But I don t think the wedding will be there It wouldn t be nice to go to church in a rage as I m sure I should with mother and Cissy looking on This might or might not signify a revival of the wish to be married from Runnymede Emmeline quickly passed to another subject missus Higgins was paying a visit to Coburg Lodge where during the days of confusion the master of the house had been left at his servants mercy On her return late in the evening she entered flurried and perspiring and asked the servant who admitted her where missus Mumford was With master in the library m Tell her I wish to speak to her at once Emmeline came forth and a lamp was lighted in the dining room for the drawing room had not yet been restored to a habitable condition Silent and wondering in gloomy resignation what new annoyance was prepared for her Emmeline sat with eyes averted whilst the stout woman mopped her face and talked disconnectedly of the hardships of travelling in such weather as this when at length she reached her point missus Higgins became lucid and emphatic I ve heard things as have made me that angry I can hardly bear myself Would you believe that people are trying to take away my daughter s character It s Cissy Iggins s doing I m sure of it though I haven t brought it ome to her yet I dropped in to see some friends of ours I shouldn t wonder if you know the name it s missus Jolliffe a niece of mister Baxter Baxter Lukin and company you know And she told me in confidence what people are saying as how Louise was to marry mister Bowling but he broke it off when he found the sort of people she was living with here at Sutton and a great many more things as I shouldn t like to tell you Now what do you think of Emmeline her eyes flashing broke in angrily I think nothing at all about it missus Higgins and I had very much rather not hear the talk of such people I don t wonder it aggravates you missus Mumford Did anyone ever hear such a scandal I m sure nobody that knows you could say a word against your respectability and as I told missus Jolliffe she s quite at liberty to call here to morrow or the next day Not to see me I hope said Emmeline I must refuse Now just let me tell you what I ve thought pursued the stout lady hardly aware of this interruption This ll have to be set right both for Lou s sake and for yours and to satisfy us all They re making a mystery d you see of Lou leaving ome and going off to live with strangers and Cissy s been doing her best to make people think there s something wrong the spiteful creature And there s only one way of setting it right As soon as Lou can be dressed and got down and when the drawing room s finished I want her to ask all our friends here to five o clock tea just to let them see with their own eyes missus Higgins Of course there ll be no expense for you missus Mumford not a farthing I ll provide everything and all I ask of you is just to sit in your own drawing room missus Higgins be so kind as to listen to me This is quite impossible I can t dream of allowing any such thing The other glared in astonishment which tended to wrath But can t you see missus Mumford that it s for your own good as well as ours Do you want people to be using your name What can it matter to me how such people think or speak of me cried Emmeline trembling with exasperation Such people I don t think you know who you re talking about missus Mumford You ll let me tell you that my friends are as respectable as yours I shall not argue about it said Emmeline standing up You will please to remember that already I ve had a great deal of trouble and annoyance and what you propose would be quite intolerable Once for all I can t dream of such a thing Then all I can say is missus Mumford the speaker rose with heavy dignity that you re not behaving in a very ladylike way I m not a quarrelsome person as you well know and I don t say nasty things if I can help it But there s one thing I must say and will say and that is that when we first came here you gave a very different account of yourself to what it s turned out You told me and my daughter distinctly that you had a great deal of the very best society and that was what Lou came here for and you knew it and you can t deny that you did And I should like to know how much society she s seen all the time she s been here that s the question I ask you I don t believe she s seen more than three or four people altogether They may have been respectable enough and I m not the one to say they weren t but I do say it isn t what we was led to expect and that you can t deny missus Mumford She paused for breath Emmeline had moved towards the door and stood struggling with the feminine rage which impelled her to undignified altercation To withdraw in silence would be like a shamed confession of the charge brought against her and she suffered not a little from her consciousness of the modicum of truth therein It was a most unfortunate thing missus Higgins burst from her lips that I ever consented to receive your daughter knowing as I did that she wasn t our social equal Wasn t what exclaimed the other as though the suggestion startled her by its novelty You think yourself superior to us You did us a favour Whilst missus Higgins was uttering these words the door opened and there entered a figure which startled her into silence It was that of Louise in a dressing gown and slippers with a shawl wrapped about the upper part of her body I heard you quarrelling she began Her bedroom was immediately above and at this silent hour the voices of the angry ladies had been quite audible to her as she lay in bed What is it all about It s too bad of you mother The idea Louise of coming down like that cried her parent indignantly How did you know mister Mumford wasn t here For shame Go up again this moment I don t see any harm if mister Mumford had been here replied the girl calmly I m sure it s most unwise of you to leave your bed began Emmeline with anxious thought for Louise s health due probably to her dread of having the girl in the house for an indefinite period Oh I ve wrapped up I feel shaky that s all and I shall have to sit down She did so on the nearest chair with a little laugh at her strange feebleness Now please don t quarrel you two missus Mumford don t mind anything that mother says Thereupon Louise s mother burst into a vehement exposition of the reasons of discord beginning with the calumnious stories she had heard at missus Jolliffe s and ending with the outrageous arrogance of missus Mumford s latest remark Louise listened with a smile Now look here mother she said when silence came for a moment you can t expect missus Mumford to have a lot of strangers coming to the house just on my account She s sick and tired of us all and wants to see our backs as soon as ever she can I don t say it to offend you missus Mumford but you know it s true And I tell you what it is To morrow morning I m going back home Yes I am You can t stay here mother after this and I m not going to have anyone new to wait on me I shall go home in a cab straight from this house to the other and I m quite sure I shan t take any harm You won t do it till the doctor s given you leave said missus Higgins with concern He ll be here at ten in the morning and I know he will give me leave So there s an end of it And you can go to bed and sleep in peace missus Mumford It was not at all unamiably said But for missus Higgins s presence Emmeline would have responded with a certain kindness Still smarting under the stout lady s accusations which continued to sound in sniffs and snorts she answered as austerely as possible I must leave you to judge Miss Derrick how soon you feel able to go I don t wish you to do anything imprudent But it will be much better if missus Higgins regards me as a stranger during the rest of her stay here Any communication she wishes to make to me must be made through a servant Having thus delivered herself Emmeline quitted the room From the library of which the door was left ajar she heard Louise and her mother pass upstairs both silent Mumford too well aware that yet another disturbance had come upon his unhappy household affected to read and it was only when the door of Louise s room had closed that Emmeline spoke to him missus Higgins will breakfast by herself to morrow she said severely She may perhaps go before lunch but in any case we shall not sit down at table with her again All right Mumford replied studiously refraining from any hint of curiosity So next morning their breakfast was served in the library missus Higgins came down at the usual hour found the dining room at her disposal and ate with customary appetite alone Had Emmeline s experience lain among the more vigorously vulgar of her sex she would have marvelled at missus Higgins s silence and general self restraint during these last hours Louise s mother might without transgressing the probabilities of the situation have made this a memorable morning indeed She confined herself to a rather frequent ringing of the bedroom bell Her requests of the servants became orders such as she would have given in a hotel or lodging house but no distinctly offensive word escaped her And this was almost entirely due to Louise s influence for the girl impressed upon her mother that to make a row would be the sure and certain way of proving that missus Mumford was justified in claiming social superiority over her guests The doctor easily perceiving how matters stood made no difficulty about the patient s removal in a closed carriage and with exercise of all obvious precautions she might travel as soon as she liked Anticipating this missus Higgins had already packed all the luggage and Louise as well as it could be managed had been clad for the journey I suppose you ll go and order the cab yourself she said to her mother when they were alone again Yes I must on account of making a bargain about the charge A nice expense you ve been to us Louise That man ought to pay every penny I ll tell him you say so and no doubt he will They wrangled about this whilst missus Higgins was dressing to go out As soon as her mother had left the house Louise stole downstairs and to the door of the drawing room which was half open Emmeline her back turned stood before the fireplace as if considering some new plan of decoration she did not hear the girl s light step Whitewashers and paperhangers had done their work a new carpet was laid down but pictures had still to be restored to their places and the furniture stood all together in the middle of the room Not till Louise had entered did her hostess look round missus Mumford I want to say good bye Oh yes Emmeline answered civilly but without a smile Good bye Miss Derrick And she stepped forward to shake hands Don t be afraid said the girl looking into her face good humouredly You shall never see me again unless you wish to I m sure I wish you all happiness was the embarrassed reply And I shall be glad to hear of your marriage I ll write to you about it But you won t talk unkindly about me when I ve gone you and mister Mumford No no indeed we shall not Louise tried to say something else but without success She pressed Emmeline s hand turned quickly and disappeared In half an hour s time arrived the vehicle missus Higgins had engaged without delay mother and daughter left the house and were driven off missus Mumford kept a strict retirement When the two had gone she learnt from the housemaid that their luggage would be removed later in the day A fortnight passed and the Mumfords once more lived in enjoyment of tranquillity though Emmeline could not quite recover her old self They never spoke of the dread experiences through which they had gone Mumford s holiday time approached and they were making arrangements for a visit to the seaside when one morning a carrier s cart delivered a large package unexpected and of unknown contents Emmeline stripped off the matting and found a drawing room screen not unlike that which she had lost in the fire Of course it came from Louise and though she professed herself very much annoyed missus Mumford had no choice but to acknowledge it in a civil little note addressed to Coburg Lodge They were away from home for three weeks On returning Emmeline found a letter which had arrived for her the day before it was from Louise and announced her marriage Dear missus Mumford I know you ll be glad to hear it s all over It was to have been at the end of October when our house was ready for us We have taken a very nice one at Holloway But of course something happened and mother and Cissy and I quarrelled so dreadfully that I went off and took a lodging And then Tom said that we must be married at once and so we were without any fuss at all and I think it was ever so much better though some girls would not care to go in their plain dress and without friends or anything After it was over Tom and I had just a little disagreement about something but of course he gave way and I don t think we shall get on together at all badly My stepfather has been very nice and is paying for all the furniture and has promised me a lot of things Of course he is delighted to see me out of the house just as you were You see that I write from Broadstairs where we are spending our honeymoon Please remember me to mister Mumford and believe me very sincerely yours Louise L Cobb Enclosed was a wedding card mister and missus Thomas Cobb in gilt lettering
