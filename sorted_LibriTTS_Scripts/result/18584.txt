did not uncover any evidence that the copyright on this publication was renewed THE EDGE OF THE KNIFE By H BEAM PIPER This story was rejected by two top flight science fiction editors for the same reason Too hot to handle Too dangerous for our book We d like to know whether or not the readers of Amazing Stories agree Drop us a line after you ve read it Chalmers stopped talking abruptly warned by the sudden attentiveness of the class in front of him They were all staring even Guellick in the fourth row was almost half awake Then one of them taking his silence as an invitation to questions found his voice You say Khalid ib n Hussein s been assassinated he asked incredulously When did that happen Illustration There was no past no future only a great chaotic NOW In nineteen seventy three at Basra There was a touch of impatience in his voice surely they ought to know that much He was shot while leaving the Parliament Building by an Egyptian Arab named Mohammed Noureed with an old U S Army Mthree submachine gun Noureed killed two of Khalid s guards and wounded another before he was overpowered He was lynched on the spot by the crowd stoned to death Ostensibly he and his accomplices were religious fanatics however there can be no doubt whatever that the murder was inspired at least indirectly by the Eastern Axis The class stirred like a grain field in the wind Some looked at him in blank amazement some were hastily averting faces red with poorly suppressed laughter For a moment he was puzzled and then realization hit him like a blow in the stomach pit He d forgotten again I didn t see anything in the papers about it one boy was saying The newscast last evening said Khalid was in Ankara talking to the President of Turkey another offered Professor Chalmers would you tell us just what effect Khalid s death had upon the Islamic Caliphate and the Middle Eastern situation in general a third voice asked with exaggerated solemnity That was Kendrick the class humorist the question was pure baiting Well mister Kendrick I m afraid it s a little too early to assess the full results of a thing like that if they can ever be fully assessed For instance who in nineteen eleven could have predicted all the consequences of the pistol shot at Sarajevo Who even today can guess what the history of the world would have been had Zangarra not missed Franklin Roosevelt in nineteen thirty two There s always that if He went on talking safe generalities as he glanced covertly at his watch Only five minutes to the end of the period thank heaven he hadn t made that slip at the beginning of the class For instance tomorrow when we take up the events in India from the First World War to the end of British rule we will be largely concerned with another victim of the assassin s bullet Mohandas K Gandhi You may ask yourselves then by how much that bullet altered the history of the Indian sub continent A word of warning however The events we will be discussing will be either contemporary with or prior to what was discussed today I hope that you re all keeping your notes properly dated It s always easy to become confused in matters of chronology He wished too late that he hadn t said that It pointed up the very thing he was trying to play down and raised a general laugh As soon as the room was empty he hastened to his desk snatched pencil and notepad This had been a bad one the worst yet he hadn t heard the end of it by any means He couldn t waste thought on that now though This was all new and important it had welled up suddenly and without warning into his conscious mind and he must get it down in notes before the memory even mentally he always put that word into quotes was lost He was still scribbling furiously when the instructor who would use the room for the next period entered followed by a few of his students Chalmers finished crammed the notes into his pocket and went out into the hall Most of his own Modern History IV class had left the building and were on their way across the campus for science classes A few however were joining groups for other classes here in Prescott Hall and in every group they were the center of interest Sometimes when they saw him they would fall silent until he had passed sometimes they didn t and he caught snatches of conversation Oh brother Did Chalmers really blow his jets this time one voice was saying Bet he won t be around next year Another quartet with their heads together were talking more seriously Well I m not majoring in History myself but I think it s an outrage that some people s diplomas are going to depend on grades given by a lunatic Mine will and I m not going to stand for it My old man s president of the Alumni Association and That was something he had not thought of before It gave him an ugly start He was still thinking about it as he turned into the side hall to the History Department offices and entered the cubicle he shared with a colleague The colleague old Pottgeiter Medieval History was emerging in a rush short rotund gray bearded his arms full of books and papers oblivious as usual to anything that had happened since the Battle of Bosworth or the Fall of Constantinople Chalmers stepped quickly out of his way and entered behind him Marjorie Fenner the secretary they also shared was tidying up the old man s desk Good morning Doctor Chalmers She looked at him keenly for a moment They give you a bad time again in Modern Four Good Lord did he show it that plainly In any case it was no use trying to kid Marjorie She d hear the whole story before the end of the day Gave myself a bad time Marjorie still fussing with Pottgeiter s desk was about to say something in reply Instead she exclaimed in exasperation Ohhh That man He s forgotten his notes again She gathered some papers from Pottgeiter s desk rushing across the room and out the door with them For a while he sat motionless the books and notes for General European History II untouched in front of him This was going to raise hell It hadn t been the first slip he d made either that thought kept recurring to him There had been the time when he had alluded to the colonies on Mars and Venus There had been the time he d mentioned the secession of Canada from the British Commonwealth and the time he d called the U N the Terran Federation And the time he d tried to get a copy of Franchard s Rise and Decline of the System States which wouldn t be published until the Twenty eighth Century out of the college library None of those had drawn much comment beyond a few student jokes about the history professor who lived in the future instead of the past Now however they d all be remembered raked up exaggerated and added to what had happened this morning He sighed and sat down at Marjorie s typewriter and began transcribing his notes Assassination of Khalid ib n Hussein the pro Western leader of the newly formed Islamic Caliphate period of anarchy in the Middle East interfactional power struggles Turkish intervention He wondered how long that would last Khalid s son Tallal ib n Khalid was at school in England when his father was would be killed He would return and eventually take his father s place in time to bring the Caliphate into the Terran Federation when the general war came There were some notes on that already the war would result from an attempt by the Indian Communists to seize East Pakistan The trouble was that he so seldom remembered an exact date His memory of the year of Khalid s assassination was an exception Nineteen seventy three why that was this year He looked at the calendar October sixteen nineteen seventy three At very most the Arab statesman had two and a half months to live Would there be any possible way in which he could give a credible warning He doubted it Even if there were he questioned whether he should for that matter whether he could interfere He always lunched at the Faculty Club today was no time to call attention to himself by breaking an established routine As he entered trying to avoid either a furtive slink or a chip on shoulder swagger the crowd in the lobby stopped talking abruptly then began again on an obviously changed subject The word had gotten around apparently Handley the head of the Latin Department greeted him with a distantly polite nod Pompous old owl regarded himself for some reason as a sort of unofficial Dean of the Faculty Probably didn t want to be seen fraternizing with controversial characters One of the younger men with a thin face and a mop of unruly hair advanced to meet him as he came in as cordial as Handley was remote Oh hello Ed he greeted clapping a hand on Chalmers shoulder I was hoping I d run into you Can you have dinner with us this evening He was sincere Well thanks Leonard I d like to but I have a lot of work Could you give me a rain check Oh surely My wife was wishing you d come around but I know how it is Some other evening Yes indeed He guided Fitch toward the dining room door and nodded toward a table This doesn t look too crowded let s sit here After lunch he stopped in at his office Marjorie Fenner was there taking dictation from Pottgeiter she nodded to him as he entered but she had no summons to the president s office The summons was waiting for him the next morning when he entered the office after Modern History IV a few minutes past ten Doctor Whitburn just phoned Marjorie said He d like to see you as soon as you have a vacant period Which means right away I shan t keep him waiting She started to say something swallowed it and then asked if he needed anything typed up for General European II No I have everything ready He pocketed the pipe he had filled on entering and went out The president of Blanley College sat hunched forward at his desk he had rounded shoulders and round pudgy fists and a round bald head He seemed to be expecting his visitor to stand at attention in front of him Chalmers got the pipe out of his pocket sat down in the desk side chair and snapped his lighter Good morning Doctor Whitburn he said very pleasantly Whitburn s scowl deepened I hope I don t have to tell you why I wanted to see you he began I have an idea Chalmers puffed until the pipe was drawing satisfactorily It might help you get started if you did though I don t suppose at that that you realize the full effect of your performance yesterday morning in Modern History Four Whitburn replied I don t suppose you know for instance that I had to intervene at the last moment and suppress an editorial in the Black and Green derisively critical of you and your teaching methods and by implication of the administration of this college You didn t hear about that did you No living as you do in the future you wouldn t If the students who edit the Black and Green are dissatisfied with anything here I d imagine they ought to say so Chalmers commented Isn t that what they teach in the journalism classes that the purpose of journalism is to speak for the dissatisfied Why make exception I should think you d be grateful to me for trying to keep your behavior from being made a subject of public ridicule among your students Why this editorial which I suppressed actually went so far as to question your sanity I should suppose it might have sounded a good deal like that to them Of course I have been preoccupied lately with an imaginative projection of present trends into the future I ll quite freely admit that I should have kept my extracurricular work separate from my class and lecture work but That s no excuse even if I were sure it were true What you did while engaged in the serious teaching of history was to indulge in a farrago of nonsense obvious as such to any child and damage not only your own standing with your class but the standing of Blanley College as well Doctor Chalmers if this were the first incident of the kind it would be bad enough but it isn t You ve done things like this before and I ve warned you before I assumed then that you were merely showing the effects of overwork and I offered you a vacation which you refused to take Well this is the limit I m compelled to request your immediate resignation Chalmers laughed A moment ago you accused me of living in the future It seems you re living in the past Evidently you haven t heard about the Higher Education Faculty Tenure Act of nineteen sixty three or such things as tenure contracts Well for your information I have one you signed it yourself in case you ve forgotten If you want my resignation you ll have to show cause in a court of law why my contract should be voided and I don t think a slip of the tongue is a reason for voiding a contract that any court would accept Whitburn s face reddened You don t don t you Well maybe it isn t but insanity is It s a very good reason for voiding a contract voidable on grounds of unfitness or incapacity to teach He had been expecting and mentally shrinking from just that Now that it was out however he felt relieved He gave another short laugh You re willing to go into open court covered by reporters from papers you can t control as you do this student sheet here and testify that for the past twelve years you ve had an insane professor on your faculty You re You re trying to blackmail me Whitburn demanded half rising It isn t blackmail to tell a man that a bomb he s going to throw will blow up in his hand Chalmers glanced quickly at his watch Now Doctor Whitburn if you have nothing further to discuss I have a class in a few minutes If you ll excuse me He rose For a moment he stood facing Whitburn when the college president said nothing he inclined his head politely and turned going out Whitburn s secretary gave the impression of having seated herself hastily at her desk the second before he opened the door She watched him round eyed as he went out into the hall He reached his own office ten minutes before time for the next class Marjorie was typing something for Pottgeiter he merely nodded to her and picked up the phone The call would have to go through the school exchange and he had a suspicion that Whitburn kept a check on outside calls That might not hurt any he thought dialing a number Attorney Weill s office the girl who answered said Edward Chalmers Is mister Weill in She d find out He was he answered in a few seconds Hello Stanly Ed Chalmers I think I m going to need a little help I m having some trouble with President Whitburn here at the college A matter involving the validity of my tenure contract I don t want to go into it over this line Have you anything on for lunch No I haven t When and where the lawyer asked He thought for a moment Nowhere too close the campus but not too far away How about the Continental Fontainbleu Room Say twelve fifteen That ll be all right Be seeing you Marjorie looked at him curiously as he gathered up the things he needed for the next class Stanly Weill had a thin dark eyed face He was frowning as he set down his coffee cup Ed you ought to know better than to try to kid your lawyer he said You say Whitburn s trying to force you to resign With your contract he can t do that not without good and sufficient cause and under the Faculty Tenure Law that means something just an inch short of murder in the first degree Now what s Whitburn got on you Beat around the bush and try to build a background or come out with it at once and fill in the details afterward He debated mentally for a moment then decided upon the latter course Well it happens that I have the ability to prehend future events I can by concentrating bring into my mind the history of the world at least in general outline for the next five thousand years Whitburn thinks I m crazy mainly because I get confused at times and forget that something I know about hasn t happened yet Weill snatched the cigarette from his mouth to keep from swallowing it As it was he choked on a mouthful of smoke and coughed violently then sat back in the booth seat staring speechlessly It started a little over three years ago Chalmers continued Just after New Year s nineteen seventy I was getting up a series of seminars for some of my postgraduate students on extrapolation of present social and political trends to the middle of the next century and I began to find that I was getting some very fixed and definite ideas of what the world of twenty fifty to twenty seventy would be like Completely unified world abolition of all national states under a single world sovereignty colonies on Mars and Venus that sort of thing Some of these ideas didn t seem quite logical a number of them were complete reversals of present trends and a lot seemed to depend on arbitrary and unpredictable factors Mind this was before the first rocket landed on the Moon when the whole moon rocket and lunar base project was a triple top secret But I knew in the spring of nineteen seventy that the first unmanned rocket would be called the Kilroy and that it would be launched some time in nineteen seventy one You remember when the news was released it was stated that the rocket hadn t been christened until the day before it was launched when somebody remembered that old Kilroy was here thing from the Second World War Well I knew about it over a year in advance Weill had been listening in silence He had a naturally skeptical face his present expression mightn t really mean that he didn t believe what he was hearing How d you get all this stuff In dreams Chalmers shook his head It just came to me I d be sitting reading or eating dinner or talking to one of my classes and the first thing I d know something out of the future would come bubbling up in me It just kept pushing up into my conscious mind I wouldn t have an idea of something one minute and the next it would just be part of my general historical knowledge I d know it as positively as I know that Columbus discovered America in fourteen ninety two The only difference is that I can usually remember where I ve read something in past history but my future history I know without knowing how I know it Ah that s the question Weill pounced You don t know how you know it Look Ed we ve both studied psychology elementary psychology at least Anybody who has to work with people these days has to know some psychology What makes you sure that these prophetic impressions of yours aren t manufactured in your own subconscious mind That s what I thought at first I thought my subconscious was just building up this stuff to fill the gaps in what I d produced from logical extrapolation I ve always been a stickler for detail he added parenthetically It would be natural for me to supply details for the future But as I said a lot of this stuff is based on unpredictable and arbitrary factors that can t be inferred from anything in the present That left me with the alternatives of delusion or precognition and if I ever came near going crazy it was before the Kilroy landed and the news was released After that I knew which it was And yet you can t explain how you can have real knowledge of a thing before it happens Before it exists Weill said I really don t need to I m satisfied with knowing that I know But if you want me to furnish a theory let s say that all these things really do exist in the past or in the future and that the present is just a moving knife edge that separates the two You can t even indicate the present By the time you make up your mind to say Now and transmit the impulse to your vocal organs and utter the word the original present moment is part of the past The knife edge has gone over it Most people think they know only the present what they know is the past which they have already experienced or read about The difference with me is that I can see what s on both sides of the knife edge Weill put another cigarette in his mouth and bent his head to the flame of his lighter For a moment he sat motionless his thin face rigid What do you want me to do he asked I m a lawyer not a psychiatrist I want a lawyer This is a legal matter Whitburn s talking about voiding my tenure contract You helped draw it I have a right to expect you to help defend it Ed have you been talking about this to anybody else Weill asked You re the first person I ve mentioned it to It s not the sort of thing you d bring up casually in a conversation Then how d Whitburn get hold of it He didn t not the way I ve given it to you But I made a couple of slips now and then I made a bad one yesterday morning He told Weill about it and about his session with the president of the college that morning The lawyer nodded That was a bad one but you handled Whitburn the right way Weill said What he s most afraid of is publicity getting the college mixed up in anything controversial and above all the reactions of the trustees and people like that If Dacre or anybody else makes any trouble he ll do his best to cover for you Not willingly of course but because he ll know that that s the only way he can cover for himself I don t think you ll have any more trouble with him If you can keep your own nose clean that is Can you do that I believe so Yesterday I got careless I ll not do that again You d better not Weill hesitated for a moment I said I was a lawyer not a psychiatrist I m going to give you some psychiatrist s advice though Forget this whole thing You say you can bring these impressions into your conscious mind by concentrating He waited briefly Chalmers nodded and he continued Well stop it Stop trying to harbor this stuff It s dangerous Ed Stop playing around with it You think I m crazy too Weill shook his head impatiently I didn t say that But I ll say now that you re losing your grip on reality You are constructing a system of fantasies and the first thing you know they will become your reality and the world around you will be unreal and illusory And that s a state of mental incompetence that I can recognize as a lawyer How about the Kilroy Weill looked at him intently Ed are you sure you did have that experience he asked I m not trying to imply that you re consciously lying to me about that I am suggesting that you manufactured a memory of that incident in your subconscious mind and are deluding yourself into thinking that you knew about it in advance False memory is a fairly common thing in cases like this Even the little psychology I know I ve heard about that There s been talk about rockets to the Moon for years You included something about that in your future history fantasy and then after the event you convinced yourself that you d known all about it including the impromptu christening of the rocket all along A hot retort rose to his lips he swallowed it hastily Instead he nodded amicably That s a point worth thinking of But right now what I want to know is will you represent me in case Whitburn does take this to court and does try to void my contract Oh yes as you said I have an obligation to defend the contracts I draw up But you ll have to avoid giving him any further reason for trying to void it Don t make any more of these slips Watch what you say in class or out of it And above all don t talk about this to anybody Don t tell anybody that you can foresee the future or even talk about future probabilities Your business is with the past stick to it The afternoon passed quietly enough Word of his defiance of Whitburn had gotten around among the faculty Whitburn might have his secretary scared witless in his office but not gossipless outside it though it hadn t seemed to have leaked down to the students yet Handley the Latin professor managed to waylay him in a hallway a hallway Handley didn t normally use The tenure contract system under which we hold our positions here is one of our most valuable safeguards he said after exchanging greetings It was only won after a struggle in a time of public animosity toward all intellectuals and even now our professional position would be most insecure without it Yes I found that out today if I hadn t known it when I took part in the struggle you speak of It should not be jeopardized Handley declared You think I m jeopardizing it Handley frowned He didn t like being pushed out of the safety of generalization into specific cases Well now that you make that point yes I do If Doctor Whitburn tries to make an issue of of what happened yesterday and if the court decides against you you can see the position all of us will be in What do you think I should have done Given him my resignation when he demanded it We have our tenure contracts and the system was instituted to prevent just the sort of arbitrary action Whitburn tried to take with me today If he wants to go to court he ll find that out And if he wins he ll establish a precedent that will threaten the security of every college and university faculty member in the state In any state where there s a tenure law Leonard Fitch the psychologist took an opposite attitude As Chalmers was leaving the college at the end of the afternoon Fitch cut across the campus to intercept him I heard about the way you stood up to Whitburn this morning Ed he said Glad you did it I only wish I d done something like that three years ago Think he s going to give you any real trouble I doubt it Well I m on your side if he does I won t be the only one either Well thank you Leonard It always helps to know that I don t think there ll be any more trouble though He dined alone at his apartment and sat over his coffee outlining his work for the next day When both were finished he dallied indecisively Weill s words echoing through his mind and raising doubts It was possible that he had been manufacturing the whole thing in his subconscious mind That was at least a more plausible theory than any he had constructed to explain an ability to produce real knowledge of the future Of course there was that business about the Kilroy That had been too close on too many points to be dismissed as coincidence Then again Weill s words came back to disquiet him Had he really gotten that before the event as he believed or had he only imagined later that he had There was one way to settle that He rose quickly and went to the filing cabinet where he kept his future history notes and began pulling out envelopes There was nothing about the Kilroy in the Twentieth Century file where it should be although he examined each sheet of notes carefully The possibility that his notes on that might have been filed out of place by mistake occurred to him he looked in every other envelope The notes as far as they went were all filed in order and each one bore beside the future date of occurrence the date on which the knowledge or must he call it delusion had come to him But there was no note on the landing of the first unmanned rocket on Luna He put the notes away and went back to his desk rummaging through the drawers and finding nothing He searched everywhere in the apartment where a sheet of paper could have been mislaid taking all his books one by one from the shelves and leafing through them even books he knew he had not touched for more than three years In the end he sat down again at his desk defeated The note on the Kilroy simply did not exist Of course that didn t settle it as finding the note would have He remembered or believed he remembered having gotten that item of knowledge or delusion in nineteen seventy shortly before the end of the school term It hadn t been until after the fall opening of school that he had begun making notes He could have had the knowledge of the robot rocket in his mind then and neglected putting it on paper He undressed put on his pajamas poured himself a drink and went to bed Three hours later still awake he got up and poured himself another bigger drink Somehow eventually he fell asleep The next morning he searched his desk and book case in the office at school He had never kept a diary now he was wishing that he had That might have contained something that would be evidence one way or the other All day he vacillated between conviction of the reality of his future knowledge and resolution to have no more to do with it Once he decided to destroy all the notes he had made and thought of making a special study of some facet of history and writing another book to occupy his mind After lunch he found that more data on the period immediately before the Thirty Days War was coming into his consciousness He resolutely suppressed it knowing as he did that it might never come to him again That evening too he cooked dinner for himself at his apartment and laid out his class work for the next day He d better not stay in that evening too much temptation to settle himself by the living room fire with his pipe and his notepad and indulge in the vice he had determined to renounce After a little debate he decided upon a movie he put on again the suit he had taken off on coming home and went out 
3144-174048-0000	train-other-500	The picture a random choice among the three shows in the neighborhood was about Seventeenth Century buccaneers exciting action and a sound track loud with shots and cutlass clashing He let himself be drawn into it completely
3144-174048-0001	train-other-500	and until it was finished he was able to forget both the college and the history of the future But as he walked home he was struck by the parallel
3144-174048-0002	train-other-500	between the buccaneers of the West Indies and the space pirates in the days of the dissolution of the First Galactic Empire in the Tenth Century of the Interstellar Era He hadn t been too clear on that period and he found new data rising in his mind
3144-174048-0003	train-other-500	he hurried his steps almost running upstairs to his room It was long after midnight before he had finished the notes he had begun on his return home Well that had been a mistake but he wouldn t make it again
3144-174048-0004	train-other-500	He determined again to destroy his notes and began casting about for a subject which would occupy his mind to the exclusion of the future Not the Spanish Conquistadores that was too much like the early period of interstellar expansion
3144-174048-0005	train-other-500	He thought for a time of the Sepoy Mutiny and then rejected it he could remember something much like that on one of the planets of the Beta Hydrae system in the Fourth Century of the Atomic Era There were so few things in the history of the past
3144-174048-0006	train-other-500	which did not have their counter parts in the future That evening too he stayed at home preparing for his various classes for the rest of the week and making copious notes on what he would talk about to each
none	none	 He needed more whiskey to get to sleep that night 
3144-174048-0007	train-other-500	Whitburn gave him no more trouble
none	none	 and if any of the trustees or influential alumni made any protest about what had happened in Modern History IV he heard nothing about it He managed to conduct his classes without further incidents 
3144-174048-0008	train-other-500	and spent his evenings trying not always successfully to avoid drifting into memories of the future He came into his office that morning tired and unrefreshed by the few hours sleep he had gotten the night before
3144-174048-0009	train-other-500	edgy from the strain of trying to adjust his mind to the world of Blanley College in mid April of nineteen seventy three Pottgeiter hadn t arrived yet but Marjorie Fenner was waiting for him a newspaper in her hand almost bursting with excitement
3144-174048-0010	train-other-500	Here have you seen it Doctor Chalmers she asked as he entered He shook his head
none	none	 He ought to read the papers more to keep track of the advancing knife edge that divided what he might talk about from what he wasn t supposed to know 
3144-174048-0011	train-other-500	but each morning he seemed to have less and less time to get ready for work Well look Look at that She thrust the paper into his hands still folded the big black headline where he could see it
none	none	 KHALID IB N HUSSEIN ASSASSINATED 
3144-174048-0012	train-other-500	He glanced over the leading paragraphs Leader of Islamic Caliphate shot to death in Basra leaving Parliament Building for his palace outside the city fanatic identified as an Egyptian named Mohammed Noureed old American submachine gun
none	none	 two guards killed and a third seriously wounded seized by infuriated mob and stoned to death on the spot For a moment he felt guilt until he realized that nothing he could have done could have altered the event The death of Khalid ib n Hussein and all the millions of other deaths 
3144-174048-0013	train-other-500	that would follow it were fixed in the matrix of the space time continuum Including maybe the death of an obscure professor of Modern History named Edward Chalmers
3144-174048-0014	train-other-500	At least this ll be the end of that silly flap about what happened a month ago in Modern Four This is modern history now I can talk about it without a lot of fools yelling their heads off
none	none	 She was staring at him wide eyed 
3144-174048-0015	train-other-500	No doubt horrified at his cold blooded attitude toward what was really a shocking and senseless crime Yes of course the man s dead So s Julius Caesar but we ve gotten over being shocked at his murder
none	none	 He would have to talk about it in Modern History IV he supposed 
3144-174048-0016	train-other-500	explain why Khalid s death was necessary to the policies of the Eastern Axis and what the consequences would be How it would hasten the complete dissolution of the old U N already weakened by the crisis over the Eastern demands
3144-174048-0017	train-other-500	for the demilitarization and internationalization of the United States Lunar Base and necessitate the formation of the Terran Federation and how it would lead eventually to the Thirty Days War No he couldn t talk about that
3144-174048-0018	train-other-500	that was on the wrong side of the knife edge Have to be careful about the knife edge too easy to cut himself on it
none	none	 Nobody in Modern History IV was seated when he entered the room 
3144-174048-0019	train-other-500	they were all crowded between the door and his desk He stood blinking
none	none	 wondering why they were giving him an ovation and why Kendrick and Dacre were so abjectly apologetic 
3144-174048-0020	train-other-500	Great heavens did it take the murder of the greatest Moslem since Saladin to convince people that he wasn t crazy Before the period was over Whitburn s secretary entered with a note in the college president s hand and over his signature
3144-174048-0021	train-other-500	requesting Chalmers to come to his office immediately and without delay Just like that expected him to walk right out of his class He was protesting as he entered the president s office Whitburn cut him off short
3144-174048-0022	train-other-500	Doctor Chalmers Whitburn had risen behind his desk as the door opened
3144-174048-0023	train-other-500	I certainly hope that you can realize that there was nothing but the most purely coincidental connection between the event featured in this morning s newspapers and your performance a month ago in Modern History Four he began
3144-174048-0024	train-other-500	I realize nothing of the sort
none	none	 The death of Khalid ib n Hussein is a fact of history unalterably set in its proper place in time sequence It was a fact of history a month ago no less than today So that s going to be your attitude 
3144-174048-0025	train-other-500	that your wild utterances of a month ago have now been vindicated as fulfilled prophesies And I suppose you intend to exploit this this coincidence to the utmost
none	none	 The involvement of Blanley College in a mess of sensational publicity means nothing to you I presume I haven t any idea what you re talking about 
3144-174048-0026	train-other-500	You mean to tell me that you didn t give this story to the local newspaper the Valley Times Whitburn demanded I did not I haven t mentioned the subject to anybody connected with the Times or anybody else for that matter
3144-174048-0027	train-other-500	Except my attorney a month ago when you were threatening to repudiate the contract you signed with me I suppose I m expected to take your word for that Yes you are Unless you care to call me a liar in so many words He moved a step closer
3144-174048-0028	train-other-500	Lloyd Whitburn outweighed him by fifty pounds but most of the difference was fat Whitburn must have realized that too
none	none	 No no if you say you haven t talked about it to the Valley Times that s enough 
3144-174048-0029	train-other-500	he said hastily But somebody did A reporter was here not twenty minutes ago he refused to say who had given him the story but he wanted to question me about it What did you tell him I refused to make any statement whatever
3144-174048-0030	train-other-500	I also called Colonel Tighlman the owner of the paper and asked him very reasonably to suppress the story I thought that my own position and the importance of Blanley College to this town entitled me to that much consideration
3144-174048-0031	train-other-500	Whitburn s face became almost purple He he laughed at me
none	none	 Newspaper people don t like to be told to kill stories 
3144-174048-0032	train-other-500	Not even by college presidents That s only made things worse Personally I don t relish the prospect of having this publicized any more than you do
none	none	 I can assure you that I shall be most guarded if any of the Times reporters talk to me about it and if I have time to get back to my class before the end of the period I shall ask them 
3144-174048-0033	train-other-500	as a personal favor not to discuss the matter outside Whitburn didn t take the hint Instead he paced back and forth storming about the reporter the newspaper owner whoever had given the story to the paper and finally Chalmers himself
3144-174048-0034	train-other-500	He was livid with rage You certainly can t imagine that when you made those remarks in class you actually possessed any knowledge of a thing that was still a month in the future he spluttered
3144-174048-0035	train-other-500	Why it s ridiculous Utterly preposterous Unusual I ll admit But the fact remains that I did I should of course have been more careful and not confused future with past events The students didn t understand
3144-174048-0036	train-other-500	Whitburn half turned stopping short My God man You are crazy he cried horrified The period bell was ringing as he left Whitburn s office that meant
3144-174048-0037	train-other-500	that the twenty three students were scattering over the campus talking like mad He shrugged Keeping them quiet about a thing like this wouldn t have been possible in any case When he entered his office Stanly Weill was waiting for him The lawyer drew him out
none	none	 into the hallway quickly For God s sake have you been talking to the papers he demanded After what I told you No but somebody has He told about the call to Whitburn s office and the latter s behavior Weill cursed the college president bitterly Any time you want to get a story in the Valley Times just order Frank Tighlman not to print it 
3144-174048-0038	train-other-500	Well if you haven t talked don t Suppose somebody asks me A reporter no comment Anybody else none of his damn business
3144-174048-0039	train-other-500	And above all don t let anybody finagle you into making any claims about knowing the future I thought we had this under control now that it s out in the open what that fool Whitburn ll do is anybody s guess
3144-174048-0040	train-other-500	Leonard Fitch met him as he entered the Faculty Club sizzling with excitement Ed this has done it he began jubilantly This is one nobody can laugh off It s direct proof of precognition
none	none	 and because of the prominence of the event everybody will hear about it And it simply can t be dismissed as coincidence 
3144-174048-0041	train-other-500	Whitburn s trying to do that Whitburn s a fool if he is another man said calmly Turning he saw that the speaker was Tom Smith one of the math professors I figured the odds against that being chance
3144-174048-0042	train-other-500	There are a lot of variables that might affect it one way or another but ten to the fifteenth power is what I get for a sort of median figure Did you give that story to the Valley Times he asked Fitch suspicion rising and dragging anger up
3144-174048-0043	train-other-500	after it Of course I did Fitch said I ll admit I had to go behind your back and have some of my postgrads get statements from the boys in your history class but you wouldn t talk about it yourself Tom Smith was standing beside him
3144-174048-0044	train-other-500	He was twenty years younger than Chalmers he was an amateur boxer and he had good reflexes He caught Chalmers arm as it was traveling back for an uppercut and held it Take it easy Ed
none	none	 you don t want to start a slugfest in here This is the Faculty Club remember I won t Tom it wouldn t prove anything if I did He turned to Fitch I won t talk about sending your students to pump mine but at least you could have told me before you gave that story out 
3144-174048-0045	train-other-500	I don t know what you re sore about Fitch defended himself
none	none	 I believed in you when everybody else thought you were crazy 
3144-174048-0046	train-other-500	and if I hadn t collected signed and dated statements from your boys there d have been no substantiation It happens that extrasensory perception means as much to me as history does to you I ve believed in it ever since I read about Rhine s work when I was a kid
none	none	 I worked in ESP for a long time Then I had a chance to get a full professorship by coming here and after I did I found that I couldn t go on with it because Whitburn s president here and he s a stupid old bigot with an air locked mind Yes His anger died down as Fitch spoke I m glad Tom stopped me from making an ass of myself I can see your side of it Maybe that was the curse of the professional intellectual an ability to see everybody s side of everything 
3144-174048-0048	train-other-500	He thought for a moment What else did you do beside hand this story to the Valley Times I d better hear all about it
none	none	 I phoned the secretary of the American Institute of Psionics and Parapsychology as soon as I saw this morning s paper With the time difference to the East Coast I got him just as he reached his office He advised me to give the thing the widest possible publicity he thought that would advance the recognition and study of parapsychology A case like this can t be ignored it will demand serious study 
3144-174048-0049	train-other-500	Well you got your publicity all right I m up to my neck in it There was an uproar outside The doorman was saying firmly This is the Faculty Club gentlemen it s for members only
3144-174048-0050	train-other-500	I don t care if you gentlemen are the press you simply cannot come in here
none	none	 We re all up to our necks in it Smith said Leonard I don t care what your motives were you ought to have considered the effect on the rest of us first This place will be a madhouse Handley complained How we re going to get any of these students to keep their minds on their work I tell you I don t know a confounded thing about it Max Pottgeiter s voice rose petulantly at the door Are you trying to tell me that Professor Chalmers murdered some Arab Ridiculous He ate hastily and without enjoyment and slipped through the kitchen and out the back door cutting between two frat houses and circling back to Prescott Hall On the way he paused momentarily and chuckled The reporters unable to storm the Faculty Club had gone off in chase of other game and had cornered Lloyd Whitburn in front of Administration Center They had a jeep with a sound camera mounted on it and were trying to get something for telecast After gesticulating angrily Whitburn broke away from them and dashed up the steps and into the building A campus policeman stopped those who tried to follow His only afternoon class was American History III He got through it somehow though the class wasn t able to concentrate on the Reconstruction and the first election of Grover Cleveland The halls were free of reporters at least and when it was over he hurried to the Library going to the faculty reading room in the rear where he could smoke There was nobody there but old Max Pottgeiter smoking a cigar his head bent over a book The Medieval History professor looked up Oh hello Chalmers What the deuce is going on around here Has everybody gone suddenly crazy he asked Well they seem to think I have he said bitterly They do Stupid of them What s all this about some Arab being shot I didn t know there were any Arabs around here Not here At Basra He told Pottgeiter what had happened Well I m sorry to hear about that the old man said I have a friend at Southern California Bellingham who knew Khalid very well Was in the Middle East doing some research on the Byzantine Empire Khalid was most helpful Bellingham was quite impressed by him said he was a wonderful man and a fine scholar Why would anybody want to kill a man like that He explained in general terms Pottgeiter nodded understandingly assassination was a familiar feature of the medieval political landscape too Chalmers went on to elaborate It was a relief to talk to somebody like Pottgeiter who wasn t bothered by the present moment but simply boycotted it Eventually the period bell rang Pottgeiter looked at his watch as from conditioned reflex and then rose saying that he had a class and excusing himself He would have carried his cigar with him if Chalmers hadn t taken it away from him After Pottgeiter had gone Chalmers opened a book he didn t notice what it was and sat staring unseeing at the pages So the moving knife edge had come down on the end of Khalid ib n Hussein s life what were the events in the next segment of time and the segments to follow There would be bloody fighting all over the Middle East with consternation he remembered that he had been talking about that to Pottgeiter The Turkish army would move in and try to restore order There would be more trouble in northern Iran the Indian Communists would invade Eastern Pakistan and then the general war so long dreaded would come How far in the future that was he could not remember nor how the nuclear weapons stalemate that had so far prevented it would be broken He knew that today and for years before nobody had dared start an all out atomic war Wars now were marginal skirmishes like the one in Indonesia or the steady underground conflict of subversion and sabotage that had come to be called the Subwar And with the United States already in possession of a powerful Lunar base He wished he could remember how events between the murder of Khalid and the Thirty Day s War had been spaced chronologically Something of that had come to him after the incident in Modern History IV and he had driven it from his consciousness He didn t dare go home where the reporters would be sure to find him He simply left the college at the end of the school day and walked without conscious direction until darkness gathered This morning when he had seen the paper he had said and had actually believed that the news of the murder in Basra would put an end to the trouble that had started a month ago in the Modern History class It hadn t the trouble it seemed was only beginning And with the newspapers and Whitburn and Fitch it could go on forever It was fully dark now his shadow fell ahead of him on the sidewalk lengthening as he passed under and beyond a street light vanishing as he entered the stronger light of the one ahead The windows of a cheap cafe reminded him that he was hungry and he entered going to a table and ordering something absently There was a television screen over the combination bar and lunch counter Some kind of a comedy programme at which an invisible studio audience was laughing immoderately and without apparent cause The roughly dressed customers along the counter didn t seem to see any more humor in it than he did Then his food arrived on the table and he began to eat without really tasting it After a while an alteration in the noises from the television penetrated his consciousness a news program had come on and he raised his head The screen showed a square in an Eastern city the voice was saying Basra where Khalid ib n Hussein was assassinated early this morning early afternoon local time This is the scene of the crime the body of the murderer has been removed but you can still see the stones with which he was pelted to death by the mob A close up of the square still littered with torn up paving stones A Caliphate army officer displaying the weapon it was an old Mthree all right Chalmers had used one of those things himself thirty years before and he and his contemporaries had called it a grease gun There were some recent pictures of Khalid including one taken as he left the plane on his return from Ankara He watched absorbed it was all exactly as he had remembered a month ago It gratified him to see that his future memories were reliable in detail as well as generality But the most amazing part of the story comes not from Basra but from Blanley College in California the commentator was saying where it is revealed the murder of Khalid was foretold with uncanny accuracy a month ago by a history professor Doctor Edward Chalmers There was a picture of himself in hat and overcoat perfectly motionless as though a brief moving glimpse were being prolonged A glance at the background told him when and where it had been taken a year and a half ago at a convention at Harvard These telecast people must save up every inch of old news film they ever took There were views of Blanley campus and interviews with some of the Modern History IV boys including Dacre and Kendrick That was one of the things they d been doing with that jeep mounted sound camera this afternoon then The boys some brashly some embarrassedly were substantiating the fact that he had a month ago described yesterday s event in detail There was an interview with Leonard Fitch the psychology professor was trying to explain the phenomenon of precognition in layman s terms and making heavy going of it And there was the mobbing of Whitburn in front of Administration Center The college president was shouting denials of every question asked him and as he turned and fled the guffaws of the reporters were plainly audible An argument broke out along the counter I don t believe it How could anybody know all that about something before it happened Well you heard that there professor what was his name An you heard all them boys Ah college boys they ll do anything for a joke After refusing to be interviewed for telecast the president of Blanley College finally consented to hold a press conference in his office from which telecast cameras were barred He denied the whole story categorically and stated that the boys in Professor Chalmers class had concocted the whole thing as a hoax There See what I told you stating that Professor Chalmers is mentally unsound and that he has been trying for years to oust him from his position on the Blanley faculty but has been unable to do so because of the provisions of the Faculty Tenure Act of nineteen sixty three Most of his remarks were in the nature of a polemic against this law generally regarded as the college professors bill of rights It is to be stated here that other members of the Blanley faculty have unconditionally confirmed the fact that Doctor Chalmers did make the statements attributed to him a month ago long before the death of Khalid ib n Hussein Yah How about that now How ya gonna get around that Beckoning the waitress he paid his check and hurried out Before he reached the door he heard a voice almost stuttering with excitement Hey Look That s him He began to run He was two blocks from the cafe before he slowed to a walk again That night he needed three shots of whiskey before he could get to sleep A delegation from the American Institute of Psionics and Parapsychology reached Blanley that morning having taken a strato plane from the East Coast They had academic titles and degrees that even Lloyd Whitburn couldn t ignore They talked with Leonard Fitch and with the students from Modern History IV and took statements It wasn t until after General European History II that they caught up with Chalmers an elderly man with white hair and a ruddy face a young man who looked like a heavy weight boxer a middle aged man in tweeds who smoked a pipe and looked as though he ought to be more interested in grouse shooting and flower gardening than in clairvoyance and telepathy The names of the first two meant nothing to Chalmers They were important names in their own field but it was not his field The name of the third who listened silently he did not catch You understand gentlemen that I m having some difficulties with the college administration about this he told them President Whitburn has even gone so far as to challenge my fitness to hold a position here We ve talked to him the elderly man said It was not a very satisfactory discussion President Whitburn s fitness to hold his own position could very easily be challenged the young man added pugnaciously Well then you see what my position is I ve consulted my attorney mister Weill and he has advised me to make absolutely no statements of any sort about the matter I understand the eldest of the trio said But we re not the press or anything like that We can assure you that anything you tell us will be absolutely confidential He looked inquiringly at the middle aged man in tweeds who nodded silently We can understand that the students in your modern history class are telling what is substantially the truth If you re thinking about that hoax statement of Whitburn s that s a lot of idiotic drivel he said angrily I heard some of those boys on the telecast last night except for a few details in which they were confused they all stated exactly what they heard me say in class a month ago And we assume again he glanced at the man in tweeds that you had no opportunity of knowing anything at the time about any actual plot against Khalid s life The man in tweeds broke silence for the first time You can assume that I don t even think this fellow Noureed knew anything about it then Well we d like to know as nearly as you re able to tell us just how you became the percipient of this knowledge of the future event of the death of Khalid ib n Hussein the young man began Was it through a dream or a waking experience did you visualize or have an auditory impression or did it simply come into your mind I m sorry gentlemen He looked at his watch I have to be going somewhere at once In any case I simply can t discuss the matter with you I appreciate your position I know how I d feel if data of historical importance were being withheld from me However I trust that you will appreciate my position and spare me any further questioning That was all he allowed them to get out of him They spent another few minutes being polite to one another he invited them to lunch at the Faculty Club and learned that they were lunching there as Fitch s guests They went away trying to hide their disappointment The Psionics and Parapsychology people weren t the only delegation to reach Blanley that day Enough of the trustees of the college lived in the San Francisco area to muster a quorum for a meeting the evening before a committee including James Dacre the father of the boy in Modern History IV was appointed to get the facts at first hand they arrived about noon They talked to some of the students spent some time closeted with Whitburn and were seen crossing the campus with the Parapsychology people They didn t talk to Chalmers or Fitch In the afternoon Marjorie Fenner told Chalmers that his presence at a meeting to be held that evening in Whitburn s office was requested The request she said had come from the trustees committee not from Whitburn she also told him that Fitch would be there Chalmers promptly phoned Stanly Weill I ll be there along with you the lawyer said If this trustees committee is running it they ll realize that this is a matter in which you re entitled to legal advice I ll stop by your place and pick you up You haven t been doing any talking have you He described the interview with the Psionics and Parapsychology people That was all right Was there a man with a mustache in a brown tweed suit with them Yes I didn t catch his name It s Cutler He s an Army major Central Intelligence His crowd s interested in whether you had any real advance information on this He was in to see me just a while ago I have the impression he d like to see this whole thing played down so he ll be on our side more or less and for the time being I ll be around to your place about eight in the meantime don t do any more talking than you have to I hope we can get this straightened out this evening I ll have to go to Reno in a day or so to see a client there The meeting in Whitburn s office had been set for eight thirty Weill saw to it that they arrived exactly on time As they got out of his car at Administration Center and crossed to the steps Chalmers had the feeling of going to a duel accompanied by his second The briefcase Weill was carrying may have given him the idea it was flat and square cornered the size and shape of an old case of dueling pistols He commented on it Sound recorder Weill said Loaded with a four hour spool No matter how long this thing lasts I ll have a record of it if I want to produce one in court Another party was arriving at the same time the two Psionics and Parapsychology people and the Intelligence major who seemed to have formed a working partnership They all entered together after a brief and guardedly polite exchange of greetings There were voices raised in argument inside when they came to Whitburn s office The college president was trying to keep Handley Tom Smith and Max Pottgeiter from entering his private room in the rear It certainly is Handley was saying As faculty members any controversy involving establishment of standards of fitness to teach under a tenure contract concerns all of us because any action taken in this case may establish a precedent which could affect the validity of our own contracts A big man with iron gray hair appeared in the doorway of the private office behind Whitburn James Dacre These gentlemen have a substantial interest in this Doctor Whitburn he said If they re here as representatives of the college faculty they have every right to be present Whitburn stood aside Handley Smith and Pottgeiter went through the door the others followed The other three members of the trustees committee were already in the room A few minutes later Leonard Fitch arrived also carrying a briefcase Well everybody seems to be here Whitburn said starting toward his chair behind the desk We might as well get this started Yes If you ll excuse me Doctor Dacre stepped in front of him and sat down at the desk I ve been selected as chairman of this committee I believe I m presiding here Start the recorder somebody One of the other trustees went to the sound recorder beside the desk a larger but probably not more efficient instrument than the one Weill had concealed in his briefcase and flipped a switch Then he and his companions dragged up chairs to flank Dacre s and the rest seated themselves around the room Old Pottgeiter took a seat next to Chalmers Weill opened the case on his lap reached inside and closed it again What are they trying to do Ed Pottgeiter asked in a loud whisper Throw you off the faculty They can t do that can they I don t know Max We ll see This isn t any formal hearing and nobody s on trial here Dacre was saying Any action will have to be taken by the board of trustees as a whole at a regularly scheduled meeting All we re trying to do is find out just what s happened here and who if anybody is responsible Well there s the man who s responsible Whitburn cried pointing at Chalmers This whole thing grew out of his behavior in class a month ago and I ll remind you that at the time I demanded his resignation I thought it was Doctor Fitch here who gave the story to the newspapers one of the trustees a man with red hair and a thin eyeglassed face objected Doctor Fitch acted as any scientist should in making public what he believed to be an important scientific discovery the elder of the two Parapsychology men said He believed and so do we that he had discovered a significant instance of precognition a case of real prior knowledge of a future event He made a careful and systematic record of Professor Chalmers statements at least two weeks before the occurrence of the event to which they referred It is entirely due to him that we know exactly what Professor Chalmers said and when he said it Yes his younger colleague added and in all my experience I ve never heard anything more preposterous than this man Whitburn s attempt yesterday to deny the fact Well we re convinced that Doctor Chalmers did in fact say what he s alleged to have said last month Dacre began Jim I think we ought to get that established for the record another of the trustees put in Doctor Chalmers is it true that you spoke in the past tense about the death of Khalid ib n Hussein in one of your classes on the sixteenth of last month Chalmers rose Yes it is And the next day I was called into this room by Doctor Whitburn who demanded my resignation from the faculty of this college because of it Now what I d like to know is why did Doctor Whitburn in this same room deny yesterday that I d said anything of the sort and accuse my students of concocting the story after the event as a hoax One of them being my son Dacre added I d like to hear an answer to that myself So would I Stanly Weill chimed in You know my client has a good case against Doctor Whitburn for libel Chalmers looked around the room Of the thirteen men around him only Whitburn was an enemy Some of the others were on his side for one reason or another but none of them were friends Weill was his lawyer obeying an obligation to a client which at bottom was an obligation to his own conscience Handley was afraid of the possibility that a precedent might be established which would impair his own tenure contract Fitch and the two men from the Institute of Psionics and Parapsychology were interested in him as a source of study material Dacre resented a slur upon his son he and the others were interested in Blanley College as an institution almost an abstraction And the major in mufti was probably worrying about the consequences to military security of having a prophet at large Then a hand gripped his shoulder and a voice whispered in his ear That s good Ed don t let them scare you Old Max Pottgeiter at least was a friend Doctor Whitburn I m asking you and I expect an answer why did you make such statements to the press when you knew perfectly well that they were false Dacre demanded sharply I knew nothing of the kind Whitburn blustered showing under the bluster fear Yes I demanded this man s resignation on the morning of October Seventeenth the day after this incident occurred It had come to my attention on several occasions that he was making wild and unreasonable assertions in class and subjecting himself and with himself the whole faculty of this college to student ridicule Why there was actually an editorial about it written by the student editor of the campus paper the Black and Green I managed to prevent its publication He went on at some length about that If I might be permitted access to the drawers of my own desk he added with elephantine sarcasm I could show you the editorial in question You needn t bother I have a carbon copy Dacre told him We ve all read it If you did at the time you suppressed it you should have known what Doctor Chalmers said in class I knew he d talked a lot of poppycock about a man who was still living having been shot to death Whitburn retorted And if something of the sort actually happened what of it Somebody s always taking a shot at one or another of these foreign dictators and they can t miss all the time You claim this was pure coincidence Fitch demanded A ten point coincidence Event of assassination year of the event place circumstances name of assassin nationality of assassin manner of killing exact type of weapon used guards killed and wounded along with Khalid and fate of the assassin If that s a simple and plausible coincidence so s dealing ten royal flushes in succession in a poker game Tom you figured that out what did you say the odds against it were Was all that actually stated by Doctor Chalmers a month ago one of the trustees asked incredulously It absolutely was Look here mister Dacre gentlemen Fitch came forward unzipping his briefcase and pulling out papers Here are the signed statements of each of Doctor Chalmers twenty three Modern History Four students all made and dated before the assassination You can refer to them as you please they re in alphabetical order And here He unfolded a sheet of graph paper a yard long and almost as wide Here s a tabulated summary of the boys statements All agreed on the first point the fact of the assassination All agreed that the time was sometime this year Twenty out of twenty three agreed on Basra as the place Why seven of them even remembered the name of the assassin That in itself is remarkable Doctor Chalmers has an extremely intelligent and attentive class They re attentive because they know he s always likely to do something crazy and make a circus out of himself Whitburn interjected And this isn t the only instance of Doctor Chalmers precognitive ability Fitch continued There have been a number of other cases Chalmers jumped to his feet Stanly Weill rose beside him shoved the cased sound recorder into his hands and pushed him back into his seat Gentlemen the lawyer began quietly but firmly and clearly This is all getting pretty badly out of hand After all this isn t an investigation of the actuality of precognition as a psychic phenomenon What I d like to hear and what I haven t heard yet is Doctor Whitburn s explanation of his contradictory statements that he knew about my client s alleged remarks on the evening after they were supposed to have been made and that at the same time the whole thing was a hoax concocted by his students Are you implying that I m a liar Whitburn bristled I m pointing out that you made a pair of contradictory statements and I m asking how you could do that knowingly and honestly Weill retorted What I meant Whitburn began with exaggerated slowness as though speaking to an idiot was that yesterday when those infernal reporters were badgering me I really thought that some of Professor Chalmers students had gotten together and given the Valley Times an exaggerated story about his insane maunderings a month ago I hadn t imagined that a member of the faculty had been so lacking in loyalty to the college You couldn t imagine anybody with any more intellectual integrity than you have Fitch fairly yelled at him You re as crazy as Chalmers Whitburn yelled back He turned to the trustees You see the position I m in here with this infernal Higher Education Faculty Tenure Act I have a madman on my faculty and can I get rid of him No I demand his resignation and he laughs at me and goes running for his lawyer And he is a madman Nobody but a madman would talk the way he does You think this Khalid ib n Hussein business is the only time he s done anything like this Why I have a list of a dozen occasions when he s done something just as bad only he didn t have a lucky coincidence to back him up Trying to get books that don t exist out of the library and then insisting that they re standard textbooks Talking about the revolt of the colonies on Mars and Venus Talking about something he calls the Terran Federation some kind of a world empire Or something he calls Operation Triple Cross that saved the country during some fantastic war he imagined What did you say The question cracked out like a string of pistol shots Everybody turned The quiet man in the brown tweed suit had spoken now he looked as though he were very much regretting it Is there such a thing as Operation Triple Cross Fitch was asking No no I never heard anything about that that wasn t what I meant It was this Terran Federation thing the major said a trifle too quickly and too smoothly He turned to Chalmers You never did any work for PSPB did you ever talk to anybody who did he asked I don t even know what the letters mean Chalmers replied Politico Strategic Planning Board It s all pretty hush hush but this term Terran Federation is a tentative name for a proposed organization to take the place of the U N if that organization breaks up It s nothing particularly important and it only exists on paper It won t exist only on paper very long Chalmers thought He was wondering what Operation Triple Cross was he had some notes on it but he had forgotten what they were Maybe he did pick that up from somebody who d talked indiscreetly Whitburn conceded But the rest of this tommyrot Why he was talking about how the city of Reno had been destroyed by an explosion and fire literally wiped off the map There s an example for you He d forgotten about that too It had been a relatively minor incident in the secret struggle of the Subwar now he remembered having made a note about it He was sure that it followed closely after the assassination of Khalid ib n Hussein He turned quickly to Weill Didn t you say you had to go to Reno in a day or so he asked Weill hushed him urgently pointing with his free hand to the recorder The exchange prevented him from noticing that Max Pottgeiter had risen until the old man was speaking Are you trying to tell these people that Professor Chalmers is crazy he was demanding Why he has one of the best minds on the campus I was talking to him only yesterday in the back room at the Library You know he went on apologetically my subject is Medieval History I don t pay much attention to what s going on in the contemporary world and I didn t understand really what all this excitement was about But he explained the whole thing to me and did it in terms that I could grasp drawing some excellent parallels with the Byzantine Empire and the Crusades All about the revolt at Damascus and the sack of Beirut and the war between Jordan and Saudi Arabia and how the Turkish army intervened and the invasion of Pakistan When did all this happen one of the trustees demanded Pottgeiter started to explain Chalmers realized sickly how much of his future history he had poured into the trusting ear of the old medievalist the day before Good Lord man don t you read the papers at all another of the trustees asked No And I don t read inside dope magazines or science fiction I read carefully substantiated facts And I know when I m talking to a sane and reasonable man It isn t a common experience around here Dacre passed a hand over his face Doctor Whitburn he said I must admit that I came to this meeting strongly prejudiced against you and I ll further admit that your own behavior here has done very little to dispel that prejudice But I m beginning to get some idea of what you have to contend with here at Blanley and I find that I must make a lot of allowances I had no idea Simply no idea at all Look you re getting a completely distorted picture of this mister Dacre Fitch broke in It s precisely as I believed Doctor Chalmers is an unusually gifted precognitive percipient You ve seen gentlemen how his complicated chain of precognitions about the death of Khalid has been proven veridical I d stake my life that every one of these precognitions will be similarly verified And I ll stake my professional reputation that the man is perfectly sane Of course abnormal psychology and psychopathology aren t my subjects but They re not my subjects either Whitburn retorted but I know a lunatic by his ravings Doctor Fitch is taking an entirely proper attitude Pottgeiter said in pointing out that abnormal psychology is a specialized branch outside his own field I wouldn t dream myself of trying to offer a decisive opinion on some point of Roman or Babylonian history Well if the question of Doctor Chalmers sanity is at issue here let s consult somebody who specializes in insanity I don t believe that anybody here is qualified even to express an opinion on that subject Doctor Whitburn least of all Whitburn turned on him angrily Oh shut up you doddering old fool he shouted Look there s another of them he told the trustees Another deadhead on the faculty that this Tenure Law keeps me from getting rid of He s as bad as Chalmers himself You just heard that string of nonsense he was spouting Why his courses have been noted among the students for years as snap courses in which nobody ever has to do any work Chalmers was on his feet again thoroughly angry Abuse of himself he could take talking that way about gentle learned old Pottgeiter was something else I think Doctor Pottgeiter s said the most reasonable thing I ve heard since I came in here he declared If my sanity is to be questioned I insist that it be questioned by somebody qualified to do so Illustration Had the sane restrained the insane or was it the other way around Weill set his recorder on the floor and jumped up beside him trying to haul him back into his seat For God s sake man Sit down and shut up he hissed Chalmers shook off his hand No I won t shut up This is the only way to settle this once and for all And when my sanity s been vindicated I m going to sue this fellow Whitburn started to make some retort then stopped short After a moment he smiled nastily Do I understand Doctor Chalmers that you would be willing to submit to psychiatric examination he asked Don t agree you re putting your foot in a trap Weill told him urgently Of course I agree as long as the examination is conducted by a properly qualified psychiatrist How about Doctor Hauserman at Northern State Mental Hospital Whitburn asked quickly Would you agree to an examination by him Excellent Fitch exclaimed One of the best men in the field I d accept his opinion unreservedly Weill started to object again Chalmers cut him off Doctor Hauserman will be quite satisfactory to me The only question is would he be available I think he would Dacre said glancing at his watch I wonder if he could be reached now He got to his feet Telephone in your outer office Doctor Whitburn Fine If you gentlemen will excuse me It was a good fifteen minutes before he returned smiling Well gentlemen it s all arranged he said Doctor Hauserman is quite willing to examine Doctor Chalmers with the latter s consent of course He ll have it In writing if he wishes Yes I assured him on that point He ll be here about noon tomorrow it s a hundred and fifty miles from the hospital but the doctor flies his own plane and the examination can start at two in the afternoon He seems familiar with the facilities of the psychology department here I assured him that they were at his disposal Will that be satisfactory to you Doctor Chalmers I have a class at that time but one of the instructors can take it over if holding classes will be possible around here tomorrow he said Now if you gentlemen will pardon me I think I ll go home and get some sleep Weill came up to the apartment with him He mixed a couple of drinks and they went into the living room with them Just in case you don t know what you ve gotten yourself into Weill said this Hauserman isn t any ordinary couch pilot he s the state psychiatrist If he gets the idea you aren t sane he can commit you to a hospital and I ll bet that s exactly what Whitburn had in mind when he suggested him And I don t trust this man Dacre I thought he was on our side at the start but that was before your friends got into the act He frowned into his drink And I don t like the way that Intelligence major was acting toward the last If he thinks you know something you are not supposed to a mental hospital may be his idea of a good place to put you away You don t think this man Hauserman would allow himself to be influenced No You just don t think I m sane Do you I know what Hauserman ll think He ll think this future history business is a classical case of systematized schizoid delusion I wish I d never gotten into this case I wish I d never even heard of you And another thing in case you get past Hauserman all right you can forget about that damage suit bluff of mine You would not stand a chance with it in court In spite of what happened to Khalid After tomorrow I won t stay in the same room with anybody who even mentions that name to me Well win or lose it ll be over tomorrow and then I can leave here Did you tell me you were going to Reno Chalmers asked Don t do it You remember Whitburn mentioning how I spoke about an explosion there It happened just a couple of days after the murder of Khalid There was will be a trainload of high explosives in the railroad yard it ll be the biggest non nuclear explosion since the Mont Blanc blew up in Halifax harbor in World War One Weill threw his drink into the fire he must have avoided throwing the glass in with it by a last second exercise of self control Well he said after a brief struggle to master himself One thing about the legal profession you do hear the damnedest things Good night Professor And try please try for the sake of your poor harried lawyer to keep your mouth shut about things like that at least till after you get through with Hauserman And when you re talking to him don t don t for heaven s sake don t volunteer anything The room was a pleasant warmly colored place There was a desk much like the ones in the classrooms and six or seven wicker armchairs A lot of apparatus had been pushed back along the walls the dust covers were gay cretonne There was a couch with more apparatus similarly covered beside it Hauserman was seated at the desk when Chalmers entered He rose and they shook hands A man of about his own age smooth faced partially bald Chalmers tried to guess something of the man s nature from his face but could read nothing A face well trained to keep its owner s secrets Something to smoke Professor he began offering his cigarette case My pipe if you don t mind He got it out and filled it Any of those chairs Hauserman said gesturing toward them They were all arranged to face the desk He sat down lighting his pipe Hauserman nodded approvingly he was behaving calmly and didn t need being put at ease They talked at random at least Hauserman tried to make it seem so for some time about his work his book about the French Revolution current events He picked his way carefully through the conversation alert for traps which the psychiatrist might be laying for him Finally Hauserman said Would you mind telling me just why you felt it advisable to request a psychiatric examination Professor I didn t request it But when the suggestion was made by one of my friends in reply to some aspersions of my sanity I agreed to it Good distinction And why was your sanity questioned I won t deny that I had heard of this affair here before mister Dacre called me last evening but I d like to hear your version of it He went into that from the original incident in Modern History IV choosing every word carefully trying to concentrate on making a good impression upon Hauserman and at the same time finding that more memories of the future were beginning to seep past the barrier of his consciousness He tried to dam them back when he could not he spoke with greater and greater care lest they leak into his speech I can t recall the exact manner in which I blundered into it The fact that I did make such a blunder was because I was talking extemporaneously and had wandered ahead of my text I was trying to show the results of the collapse of the Ottoman Empire after the First World War and the partition of the Middle East into a loose collection of Arab states and the passing of British and other European spheres of influence following the Second You know when you consider it the Islamic Caliphate was inevitable the surprising thing is that it was created by a man like Khalid He was talking to gain time and he suspected that Hauserman knew it The memories were coming into his mind more and more strongly it was impossible to suppress them The period of anarchy following Khalid s death would be much briefer and much more violent than he had previously thought Tallal ib n Khalid would be flying from England even now perhaps he had already left the plane to take refuge among the black tents of his father s Bedouins The revolt at Damascus would break out before the end of the month before the end of the year the whole of Syria and Lebanon would be in bloody chaos and the Turkish army would be on the march Yes And you allowed yourself to be carried a little beyond the present moment into the future without realizing it Is that it Something like that he replied wide awake to the trap Hauserman had set and fearful that it might be a blind to disguise the real trap History follows certain patterns I m not a Toynbean by any manner of means but any historian can see that certain forces generally tend to produce similar effects For instance space travel is now a fact our government has at present a military base on Luna Within our lifetimes certainly within the lifetimes of my students there will be explorations and attempts at colonization on Mars and Venus You believe that Doctor Oh unreservedly I m not supposed to talk about it but I did some work on the Philadelphia Project myself I d say that every major problem of interplanetary flight had been solved before the first robot rocket was landed on Luna Yes And when Mars and Venus are colonized there will be the same historic situations at least in general shape as arose when the European powers were colonizing the New World or for that matter when the Greek city states were throwing out colonies across the Aegean That s the sort of thing we call projecting the past into the future through the present Hauserman nodded But how about the details Things like the assassination of a specific personage How can you extrapolate to a thing like that Well More memories were coming to the surface he tried to crowd them back I do my projecting in what you might call fictionalized form try to fill in the details from imagination In the case of Khalid I was trying to imagine what would happen if his influence were suddenly removed from Near Eastern and Middle Eastern affairs I suppose I constructed an imaginary scene of his assassination He went on at length Mohammed and Noureed were common enough names The Middle East was full of old U S weapons Stoning was the traditional method of execution it diffused responsibility so that no individual could be singled out for blood feud vengeance You have no idea how disturbed I was when the whole thing happened exactly as I had described it he continued And worst of all to me was this Intelligence officer showing up I thought I was really in for it Then you ve never really believed that you had real knowledge of the future I m beginning to since I ve been talking to these Psionics and Parapsychology people he laughed It sounded he hoped like a natural and unaffected laugh They seem to be convinced that I have There would be an Eastern inspired uprising in Azerbaijan by the middle of the next year before autumn the Indian Communists would make their fatal attempt to seize East Pakistan The Thirty Days War would be the immediate result By that time the Lunar Base would be completed and ready the enemy missiles would be aimed primarily at the rocketports from which it was supplied Delivered without warning it should have succeeded except that every rocketport had its secret duplicate and triplicate That was Operation Triple Cross no wonder Major Cutler had been so startled at the words last evening The enemy would be utterly overwhelmed under the rain of missiles from across space but until the moon rockets began to fall the United States would suffer grievously Honestly though I feel sorry for my friend Fitch he added He s going to be frightfully let down when some more of my alleged prophecies misfire on him But I really haven t been deliberately deceiving him And Blanley College was at the center of one of the areas which would receive the worst of the thermonuclear hell to come And it would be a little under a year And that s all there is to it Hauserman exclaimed annoyance in his voice I m amazed that this man Whitburn allowed a thing like this to assume the proportions it did I must say that I seem to have gotten the story about this business in a very garbled form indeed He laughed shortly I came here convinced that you were mentally unbalanced I hope you won t take that the wrong way Professor he hastened to add In my profession anything can be expected A good psychiatrist can never afford to forget how sharp and fine is the knife edge The knife edge The words startled him He had been thinking at that moment of the knife edge slicing moment after moment relentlessly away from the future into the past at each slice coming closer and closer to the moment when the missiles of the Eastern Axis would fall I didn t know they still resorted to surgery in mental cases he added trying to cover his break Oh no all that sort of thing is as irrevocably discarded as the whips and shackles of Bedlam I meant another kind of knife edge the thin almost invisible line which separates sanity from non sanity From madness to use a deplorable lay expression Hauserman lit another cigarette Most minds are a lot closer to it than their owners suspect too In fact Professor I was so convinced that yours had passed over it that I brought with me a commitment form made out all but my signature for you He took it from his pocket and laid it on the desk The modern equivalent of the lettre de cachet I suppose the author of a book on the French Revolution would call it I was all ready to certify you as mentally unsound and commit you to Northern State Mental Hospital Chalmers sat erect in his chair He knew where that was on the other side of the mountains in the one part of the state completely untouched by the H bombs of the Thirty Days War Why the town outside which the hospital stood had been a military headquarters during the period immediately after the bombings and the center from which all the rescue work in the state had been directed And you thought you could commit me to Northern State he demanded laughing scornfully and this time he didn t try to make the laugh sound natural and unaffected You confine me anywhere Confine a poor old history professor s body yes but that isn t me I m universal I exist in all space time When this old body I m wearing now was writing that book on the French Revolution I was in Paris watching it happen from the fall of the Bastile to the Ninth Thermidor I was in Basra and saw that crazed tool of the Axis shoot down Khalid ib n Hussein and the professor talked about it a month before it happened I have seen empires rise and stretch from star to star across the Galaxy and crumble and fall I have seen Doctor Hauserman had gotten his pen out of his pocket and was signing the commitment form with one hand with the other he pressed a button on the desk A door at the rear opened and a large young man in a white jacket entered You ll have to go away for a while Professor Hauserman was telling him much later after he had allowed himself to become calm again For how long I don t know Maybe a year or so You mean to Northern State Mental Well Yes Professor You ve had a bad crack up I don t suppose you realize how bad You ve been working too hard harder than your nervous system could stand It s been too much for you You mean I m nuts Please Professor I deplore that sort of terminology You ve had a severe psychological breakdown Will I be able to have books and papers and work a little I couldn t bear the prospect of complete idleness That would be all right if you didn t work too hard And could I say good bye to some of my friends Hauserman nodded and asked Who Well Professor Pottgeiter He s outside now He was inquiring about you And Stanly Weill my attorney Not business just to say good bye Oh I m sorry Professor He s not in town now He left almost immediately after After After he found out I was crazy for sure Where d he go To Reno he took the plane at five o clock Weill wouldn t have believed anyhow no use trying to blame himself for that But he was as sure that he would never see Stanly Weill alive again as he was that the next morning the sun would rise He nodded impassively Sorry he couldn t stay Can I see Max Pottgeiter alone Yes of course Professor Old Pottgeiter came in his face anguished Ed It isn t true he stammered I won t believe that it s true What Max That you re crazy Nobody can make me believe that He put his hand on the old man s shoulder Confidentially Max neither do I But don t tell anybody I m not It s a secret Pottgeiter looked troubled For a moment he seemed to be wondering if he mightn t be wrong and Hauserman and Whitburn and the others right Max do you believe in me he asked Do you believe that I knew about Khalid s assassination a month before it happened It s a horribly hard thing to believe Pottgeiter admitted But dammit Ed you did I know medieval history is full of stories about prophecies being fulfilled I always thought those stories were just legends that grew up after the event And of course he s about a century late for me but there was Nostradamus Maybe those old prophecies weren t just ex post facto legends after all Yes After Khalid I ll believe that All right I m saying now that in a few days there ll be a bad explosion at Reno Nevada Watch the papers and the telecast for it If it happens that ought to prove it And you remember what I told you about the Turks annexing Syria and Lebanon The old man nodded When that happens get away from Blanley Come up to the town where Northern State Mental Hospital is and get yourself a place to live and stay there And try to bring Marjorie Fenner along with you Will you do that Max If you say so His eyes widened Something bad s going to happen here Yes Max Something very bad You promise me you will Of course Ed You know you re the only friend I have around here You and Marjorie I ll come and bring her along Here s the key to my apartment He got it from his pocket and gave it to Pottgeiter with instructions Everything in the filing cabinet on the left of my desk And don t let anybody else see any of it Keep it safe for me The large young man in the white coat
