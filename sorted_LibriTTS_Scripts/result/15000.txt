reserved for the sequel Introduction to The Life of Reason Sidenote Progress is relative to an ideal which reflection creates Whatever forces may govern human life if they are to be recognised by man must betray themselves in human experience Progress in science or religion no less than in morals and art is a dramatic episode in man s career a welcome variation in his habit and state of mind although this variation may often regard or propitiate things external adjustment to which may be important for his welfare The importance of these external things as well as their existence he can establish only by the function and utility which a recognition of them may have in his life The entire history of progress is a moral drama a tale man might unfold in a great autobiography could his myriad heads and countless scintillas of consciousness conspire like the seventy Alexandrian sages in a single version of the truth committed to each for interpretation What themes would prevail in such an examination of heart In what order and with what emphasis would they be recounted In which of its adventures would the human race reviewing its whole experience acknowledge a progress and a gain To answer these questions as they may be answered speculatively and provisionally by an individual is the purpose of the following work Sidenote Efficacious reflection is reason A philosopher could hardly have a higher ambition than to make himself a mouth piece for the memory and judgment of his race Yet the most casual consideration of affairs already involves an attempt to do the same thing Reflection is pregnant from the beginning with all the principles of synthesis and valuation needed in the most comprehensive criticism So soon as man ceases to be wholly immersed in sense he looks before and after he regrets and desires and the moments in which prospect or retrospect takes place constitute the reflective or representative part of his life in contrast to the unmitigated flux of sensations in which nothing ulterior is regarded Representation however can hardly remain idle and merely speculative To the ideal function of envisaging the absent memory and reflection will add since they exist and constitute a new complication in being the practical function of modifying the future Vital impulse however when it is modified by reflection and veers in sympathy with judgments pronounced on the past is properly called reason Man s rational life consists in those moments in which reflection not only occurs but proves efficacious What is absent then works in the present and values are imputed where they cannot be felt Such representation is so far from being merely speculative that its presence alone can raise bodily change to the dignity of action Reflection gathers experiences together and perceives their relative worth which is as much as to say that it expresses a new attitude of will in the presence of a world better understood and turned to some purpose The limits of reflection mark those of concerted and rational action they circumscribe the field of cumulative experience or what is the same thing of profitable living Sidenote The Life of Reason a name for all practical thought and all action justified by its fruits in consciousness Thus if we use the word life in a eulogistic sense to designate the happy maintenance against the world of some definite ideal interest we may say with Aristotle that life is reason in operation The Life of Reason will then be a name for that part of experience which perceives and pursues ideals all conduct so controlled and all sense so interpreted as to perfect natural happiness Without reason as without memory there might still be pleasures and pains in existence To increase those pleasures and reduce those pains would be to introduce an improvement into the sentient world as if a devil suddenly died in hell or in heaven a new angel were created Since the beings however in which these values would reside would by hypothesis know nothing of one another and since the betterment would take place unprayed for and unnoticed it could hardly be called a progress and certainly not a progress in man since man without the ideal continuity given by memory and reason would have no moral being In human progress therefore reason is not a casual instrument having its sole value in its service to sense such a betterment in sentience would not be progress unless it were a progress in reason and the increasing pleasure revealed some object that could please for without a picture of the situation from which a heightened vitality might flow the improvement could be neither remembered nor measured nor desired The Life of Reason is accordingly neither a mere means nor a mere incident in human progress it is the total and embodied progress itself in which the pleasures of sense are included in so far as they can be intelligently enjoyed and pursued To recount man s rational moments would be to take an inventory of all his goods for he is not himself as we say with unconscious accuracy in the others If he ever appropriates them in recollection or prophecy it is only on the ground of some physical relation which they may have to his being Reason is as old as man and as prevalent as human nature for we should not recognise an animal to be human unless his instincts were to some degree conscious of their ends and rendered his ideas in that measure relevant to conduct Many sensations or even a whole world of dreams do not amount to intelligence until the images in the mind begin to represent in some way however symbolic the forces and realities confronted in action There may well be intense consciousness in the total absence of rationality Such consciousness is suggested in dreams in madness and may be found for all we know in the depths of universal nature Minds peopled only by desultory visions and lusts would not have the dignity of human souls even if they seemed to pursue certain objects unerringly for that pursuit would not be illumined by any vision of its goal Reason and humanity begin with the union of instinct and ideation when instinct becomes enlightened establishes values in its objects and is turned from a process into an art while at the same time consciousness becomes practical and cognitive beginning to contain some symbol or record of the company ordinate realities among which it arises Reason accordingly requires the fusion of two types of life commonly led in the world in well nigh total separation one a life of impulse expressed in affairs and social passions the other a life of reflection expressed in religion science and the imitative arts In the Life of Reason if it were brought to perfection intelligence would be at once the universal method of practice and its continual reward All reflection would then be applicable in action and all action fruitful in happiness Though this be an ideal yet everyone gives it from time to time a partial embodiment when he practises useful arts when his passions happily lead him to enlightenment or when his fancy breeds visions pertinent to his ultimate good Everyone leads the Life of Reason in so far as he finds a steady light behind the world s glitter and a clear residuum of joy beneath pleasure or success No experience not to be repented of falls without its sphere Every solution to a doubt in so far as it is not a new error every practical achievement not neutralised by a second maladjustment consequent upon it every consolation not the seed of another greater sorrow may be gathered together and built into this edifice The Life of Reason is the happy marriage of two elements impulse and ideation which if wholly divorced would reduce man to a brute or to a maniac The rational animal is generated by the union of these two monsters He is constituted by ideas which have ceased to be visionary and actions which have ceased to be vain Sidenote It is the sum of Art Thus the Life of Reason is another name for what in the widest sense of the word might be called Art Operations become arts when their purpose is conscious and their method teachable In perfect art the whole idea is creative and exists only to be embodied while every part of the product is rational and gives delightful expression to that idea Like art again the Life of Reason is not a power but a result the spontaneous expression of liberal genius in a favouring environment Both art and reason have natural sources and meet with natural checks but when a process is turned successfully into an art so that its issues have value and the ideas that accompany it become practical and cognitive reflection finding little that it cannot in some way justify and understand begins to boast that it directs and has created the world in which it finds itself so much at home Thus if art could extend its sphere to include every activity in nature reason being everywhere exemplified might easily think itself omnipotent This ideal far as it is from actual realisation has so dazzled men that in their religion and mythical philosophy they have often spoken as if it were already actual and efficient This anticipation amounts when taken seriously to a confusion of purposes with facts and of functions with causes a confusion which in the interests of wisdom and progress it is important to avoid but these speculative fables when we take them for what they are poetic expressions of the ideal help us to see how deeply rooted this ideal is in man s mind and afford us a standard by which to measure his approaches to the rational perfection of which he dreams For the Life of Reason being the sphere of all human art is man s imitation of divinity Sidenote It has a natural basis which makes it definable To study such an ideal dimly expressed though it be in human existence is no prophetic or visionary undertaking Every genuine ideal has a natural basis anyone may understand and safely interpret it who is attentive to the life from which it springs To decipher the Life of Reason nothing is needed but an analytic spirit and a judicious love of man a love quick to distinguish success from failure in his great and confused experiment of living The historian of reason should not be a romantic poet vibrating impotently to every impulse he finds afoot without a criterion of excellence or a vision of perfection Ideals are free but they are neither more numerous nor more variable than the living natures that generate them Ideals are legitimate and each initially envisages a genuine and innocent good but they are not realisable together nor even singly when they have no deep roots in the world Neither is the philosopher compelled by his somewhat judicial office to be a satirist or censor without sympathy for those tentative and ingenuous passions out of which after all his own standards must arise He is the chronicler of human progress and to measure that progress he should be equally attentive to the impulses that give it direction and to the circumstances amid which it stumbles toward its natural goal Sidenote Modern philosophy not helpful There is unfortunately no school of modern philosophy to which a critique of human progress can well be attached Almost every school indeed can furnish something useful to the critic sometimes a physical theory sometimes a piece of logical analysis We shall need to borrow from current science and speculation the picture they draw of man s conditions and environment his history and mental habits These may furnish a theatre and properties for our drama but they offer no hint of its plot and meaning A great imaginative apathy has fallen on the mind One half the learned world is amused in tinkering obsolete armour as Don Quixote did his helmet deputing it after a series of catastrophes to be at last sound and invulnerable The other half the naturalists who have studied psychology and evolution look at life from the outside and the processes of Nature make them forget her uses Bacon indeed had prized science for adding to the comforts of life a function still commemorated by positivists in their eloquent moments Habitually however when they utter the word progress it is in their mouths a synonym for inevitable change or at best for change in that direction which they conceive to be on the whole predominant If they combine with physical speculation some elements of morals these are usually purely formal to the effect that happiness is to be pursued probably alas because to do so is a psychological law but what happiness consists in we gather only from casual observations or by putting together their national prejudices and party saws Sidenote Positivism no positive ideal The truth is that even this radical school emancipated as it thinks itself is suffering from the after effects of supernaturalism Like children escaped from school they find their whole happiness in freedom They are proud of what they have rejected as if a great wit were required to do so but they do not know what they want If you astonish them by demanding what is their positive ideal further than that there should be a great many people and that they should be all alike they will say at first that what ought to be is obvious and later they will submit the matter to a majority vote They have discarded the machinery in which their ancestors embodied the ideal they have not perceived that those symbols stood for the Life of Reason and gave fantastic and embarrassed expression to what in itself is pure humanity and they have thus remained entangled in the colossal error that ideals are something adventitious and unmeaning not having a soil in mortal life nor a possible fulfilment there Sidenote Christian philosophy mythical it misrepresents facts and conditions The profound and pathetic ideas which inspired Christianity were attached in the beginning to ancient myths and soon crystallised into many new ones The mythical manner pervades Christian philosophy but myth succeeds in expressing ideal life only by misrepresenting its history and conditions This method was indeed not original with the Fathers they borrowed it from Plato who appealed to parables himself in an open and harmless fashion yet with disastrous consequences to his school Nor was he the first for the instinct to regard poetic fictions as revelations of supernatural facts is as old as the soul s primitive incapacity to distinguish dreams from waking perceptions sign from thing signified and inner emotions from external powers Such confusions though in a way they obey moral forces make a rational estimate of things impossible To misrepresent the conditions and consequences of action is no merely speculative error it involves a false emphasis in character and an artificial balance and company ordination among human pursuits When ideals are hypostasised into powers alleged to provide for their own expression the Life of Reason cannot be conceived in theory its field of operation is pre empted and its function gone while in practice its inner impulses are turned awry by artificial stimulation and repression The Patristic systems though weak in their foundations were extraordinarily wise and comprehensive in their working out and while they inverted life they preserved it Dogma added to the universe fabulous perspectives it interpolated also innumerable incidents and powers which gave a new dimension to experience Yet the old world remained standing in its strange setting like the Pantheon in modern Rome and what is more important the natural springs of human action were still acknowledged and if a supernatural discipline was imposed it was only because experience and faith had disclosed a situation in which the pursuit of earthly happiness seemed hopeless Nature was not destroyed by its novel appendages nor did reason die in the cloister it hibernated there and could come back to its own in due season only a little dazed and weakened by its long confinement Such at least is the situation in Catholic regions where the Patristic philosophy has not appreciably varied Among Protestants Christian dogma has taken a new and ambiguous direction which has at once minimised its disturbing effect in practice and isolated its primary illusion The symptoms have been cured and the disease driven in Sidenote Liberal theology a superstitious attitude toward a natural world The tenets of Protestant bodies are notoriously varied and on principle subject to change There is hardly a combination of tradition and spontaneity which has not been tried in some quarter If we think however of broad tendencies and ultimate issues it appears that in Protestantism myth without disappearing has changed its relation to reality instead of being an extension to the natural world myth has become its substratum Religion no longer reveals divine personalities future rewards and tenderer Elysian consolations nor does it seriously propose a heaven to be reached by a ladder nor a purgatory to be shortened by prescribed devotions It merely gives the real world an ideal status and teaches men to accept a natural life on supernatural grounds The consequence is that the most pious can give an unvarnished description of things Even immortality and the idea of God are submitted in liberal circles to scientific treatment On the other hand it would be hard to conceive a more inveterate obsession than that which keeps the attitude of these same minds inappropriate to the objects they envisage They have accepted natural conditions they will not accept natural ideals The Life of Reason has no existence for them because although its field is clear they will not tolerate any human or finite standard of value and will not suffer extant interests which can alone guide them in action or judgment to define the worth of life The after effects of Hebraism are here contrary to its foundations for the Jews loved the world so much that they brought themselves in order to win and enjoy it to an intense concentration of purpose but this effort and discipline which had of course been mythically sanctioned not only failed of its object but grew far too absolute and sublime to think its object could ever have been earthly and the supernatural machinery which was to have secured prosperity while that still enticed now had to furnish some worthier object for the passion it had artificially fostered Fanaticism consists in redoubling your effort when you have forgotten your aim An earnestness which is out of proportion to any knowledge or love of real things which is therefore dark and inward and thinks itself deeper than the earth s foundations such an earnestness until culture turns it into intelligent interests will naturally breed a new mythology It will try to place some world of Afrites and shadowy giants behind the constellations which it finds too distinct and constant to be its companions or supporters and it will assign to itself vague and infinite tasks for which it is doubtless better equipped than for those which the earth now sets before it Even these however since they are parts of an infinite whole the mystic may histrionically perhaps yet zealously undertake but as his eye will be perpetually fixed on something invisible beyond and nothing will be done for its own sake or enjoyed in its own fugitive presence there will be little art and little joy in existence All will be a tossing servitude and illiberal mist where the parts will have no final values and the whole no pertinent direction Sidenote The Greeks thought straight in both physics and morals In Greek philosophy the situation is far more auspicious The ancients led a rational life and envisaged the various spheres of speculation as men might whose central interests were rational In physics they leaped at once to the conception of a dynamic unity and general evolution thus giving that background to human life which shrewd observation would always have descried and which modern science has laboriously rediscovered Two great systems offered in two legitimate directions what are doubtless the final and radical accounts of physical being Heraclitus describing the immediate found it to be in constant and pervasive change no substances no forms no identities could be arrested there but as in the human soul so in nature all was instability contradiction reconstruction and oblivion This remains the empirical fact and we need but to rescind the artificial division which Descartes has taught us to make between nature and life to feel again the absolute aptness of Heraclitus s expressions These were thought obscure only because they were so disconcertingly penetrating and direct The immediate is what nobody sees because convention and reflection turn existence as soon as they can into ideas a man who discloses the immediate seems profound yet his depth is nothing but innocence recovered and a sort of intellectual abstention Mysticism scepticism and transcendentalism have all in their various ways tried to fall back on the immediate but none of them has been ingenuous enough Each has added some myth or sophistry or delusive artifice to its direct observation Heraclitus remains the honest prophet of immediacy a mystic without raptures or bad rhetoric a sceptic who does not rely for his results on conventions unwittingly adopted a transcendentalist without false pretensions or incongruous dogmas Sidenote Heraclitus and the immediate The immediate is not however a good subject for discourse and the expounders of Heraclitus were not unnaturally blamed for monotony All they could do was to iterate their master s maxim and declare everything to be in flux In suggesting laws of recurrence and a reason in which what is common to many might be expressed Heraclitus had opened the door into another region had he passed through his philosophy would have been greatly modified for permanent forms would have forced themselves on his attention no less than shifting materials Such a Heraclitus would have anticipated Plato but the time for such a synthesis had not yet arrived Sidenote Democritus and the naturally intelligible At the opposite pole from immediacy lies intelligibility To reduce phenomena to constant elements as similar and simple as possible and to conceive their union and separation to obey constant laws is what a natural philosopher will inevitably do so soon as his interest is not merely to utter experience but to understand it Democritus brought this scientific ideal to its ultimate expression By including psychic existence in his atomic system he indicated a problem which natural science has since practically abandoned but which it may some day be compelled to take up The atoms of Democritus seem to us gross even for chemistry and their quality would have to undergo great transformation if they were to support intelligibly psychic being as well but that very grossness and false simplicity had its merits and science must be for ever grateful to the man who at its inception could so clearly formulate its mechanical ideal That the world is not so intelligible as we could wish is not to be wondered at In other respects also it fails to respond to our ideals yet our hope must be to find it more propitious to the intellect as well as to all the arts in proportion as we learn better how to live in it The atoms of what we call hydrogen or oxygen may well turn out to be worlds as the stars are which make atoms for astronomy Their inner organisation might be negligible on our rude plane of being did it disclose itself however it would be intelligible in its turn only if constant parts and constant laws were discernible within each system So that while atomism at a given level may not be a final or metaphysical truth it will describe on every level the practical and efficacious structure of the world We owe to Democritus this ideal of practical intelligibility and he is accordingly an eternal spokesman of reason His system long buried with other glories of the world has been partly revived and although it cannot be verified in haste for it represents an ultimate ideal every advance in science reconstitutes it in some particular Mechanism is not one principle of explanation among others In natural philosophy where to explain means to discover origins transmutations and laws mechanism is explanation itself Heraclitus had the good fortune of having his physics absorbed by Plato It is a pity that Democritus physics was not absorbed by Aristotle For with the flux observed and mechanism conceived to explain it the theory of existence is complete and had a complete physical theory been incorporated into the Socratic philosophy wisdom would have lacked none of its parts Democritus however appeared too late when ideal science had overrun the whole field and initiated a verbal and dialectical physics so that Aristotle for all his scientific temper and studies built his natural philosophy on a lamentable misunderstanding and condemned thought to confusion for two thousand years Sidenote Socrates and the autonomy of mind If the happy freedom of the Greeks from religious dogma made them the first natural philosophers their happy political freedom made them the first moralists It was no accident that Socrates walked the Athenian agora it was no petty patriotism that made him shrink from any other scene His science had its roots there in the personal independence intellectual vivacity and clever dialectic of his countrymen Ideal science lives in discourse it consists in the active exercise of reason in signification appreciation intent and self expression Its sum total is to know oneself not as psychology or anthropology might describe a man but to know as the saying is one s own mind Nor is he who knows his own mind forbidden to change it the dialectician has nothing to do with future possibilities or with the opinion of anyone but the man addressed This kind of truth is but adequate veracity its only object is its own intent Having developed in the spirit the consciousness of its meanings and purposes Socrates rescued logic and ethics for ever from authority With his friends the Sophists he made man the measure of all things after bidding him measure himself as they neglected to do by his own ideal That brave humanity which had first raised its head in Hellas and had endowed so many things in heaven and earth where everything was hitherto monstrous with proportion and use so that man s works might justify themselves to his mind now found in Socrates its precise definition and it was naturally where the Life of Reason had been long cultivated that it came finally to be conceived Sidenote Plato gave the ideal its full expression Socrates had however a plebeian strain in his humanity and his utilitarianism at least in its expression hardly did justice to what gives utility to life His condemnation for atheism if we choose to take it symbolically was not altogether unjust the gods of Greece were not honoured explicitly enough in his philosophy Human good appeared there in its principle you would not set a pilot to mend shoes because you knew your own purpose but what purposes a civilised soul might harbour and in what highest shapes the good might appear was a problem that seems not to have attracted his genius It was reserved to Plato to bring the Socratic ethics to its sublimest expression and to elicit from the depths of the Greek conscience those ancestral ideals which had inspired its legislators and been embodied in its sacred civic traditions The owl of Minerva flew as Hegel says in the dusk of evening and it was horror at the abandonment of all creative virtues that brought Plato to conceive them so sharply and to preach them in so sad a tone It was after all but the love of beauty that made him censure the poets for like a true Greek and a true lover he wished to see beauty flourish in the real world It was love of freedom that made him harsh to his ideal citizens that they might be strong enough to preserve the liberal life And when he broke away from political preoccupations and turned to the inner life his interpretations proved the absolute sufficiency of the Socratic method and he left nothing pertinent unsaid on ideal love and ideal immortality Sidenote Aristotle supplied its natural basis Beyond this point no rendering of the Life of Reason has ever been carried Aristotle improved the detail and gave breadth and precision to many a part If Plato possessed greater imaginative splendour and more enthusiasm in austerity Aristotle had perfect sobriety and adequacy with greater fidelity to the common sentiments of his race Plato by virtue of his scope and plasticity together with a certain prophetic zeal outran at times the limits of the Hellenic and the rational he saw human virtue so surrounded and oppressed by physical dangers that he wished to give it mythical sanctions and his fondness for transmigration and nether punishments was somewhat more than playful If as a work of imagination his philosophy holds the first place Aristotle s has the decisive advantage of being the unalloyed expression of reason In Aristotle the conception of human nature is perfectly sound everything ideal has a natural basis and everything natural an ideal development His ethics when thoroughly digested and weighed especially when the meagre outlines are filled in with Plato s more discursive expositions will seem therefore entirely final The Life of Reason finds there its classic explication Sidenote Philosophy thus complete yet in need of restatement As it is improbable that there will soon be another people so free from preoccupations so gifted and so fortunate as the Greeks or capable in consequence of so well exemplifying humanity so also it is improbable that a philosopher will soon arise with Aristotle s scope judgment or authority one knowing so well how to be both reasonable and exalted It might seem vain therefore to try to do afresh what has been done before with unapproachable success and instead of writing inferior things at great length about the Life of Reason it might be simpler to read and to propagate what Aristotle wrote with such immortal justness and masterly brevity But times change and though the principles of reason remain the same the facts of human life and of human conscience alter A new background a new basis of application appears for logic and it may be useful to restate old truths in new words the better to prove their eternal validity Aristotle is in his morals Greek concise and elementary As a Greek he mixes with the ideal argument illustrations appreciations and conceptions which are not inseparable from its essence In themselves no doubt these accessories are better than what in modern times would be substituted for them being less sophisticated and of a nobler stamp but to our eyes they disguise what is profound and universal in natural morality by embodying it in images which do not belong to our life Our direst struggles and the last sanctions of our morality do not appear in them The pagan world because its maturity was simpler than our crudeness seems childish to us We do not find there our sins and holiness our love charity and honour The Greek too would not find in our world the things he valued most things to which he surrendered himself perhaps with a more constant self sacrifice piety country friendship and beauty and he might add that his ideals were rational and he could attain them while ours are extravagant and have been missed Yet even if we acknowledged his greater good fortune it would be impossible for us to go back and become like him To make the attempt would show no sense of reality and little sense of humour We must dress in our own clothes if we do not wish to substitute a masquerade for practical existence What we can adopt from Greek morals is only the abstract principle of their development their foundation in all the extant forces of human nature and their effort toward establishing a perfect harmony among them These forces themselves have perceptibly changed at least in their relative power Thus we are more conscious of wounds to stanch and wrongs to fight against and less of goods to attain The movement of conscience has veered the centre of gravity lies in another part of the character Another circumstance that invites a restatement of rational ethics is the impressive illustration of their principle which subsequent history has afforded Mankind has been making extraordinary experiments of which Aristotle could not dream and their result is calculated to clarify even his philosophy For in some respects it needed experiments and clarification He had been led into a systematic fusion of dialectic with physics and of this fusion all pretentious modern philosophy is the aggravated extension Socrates pupils could not abandon his ideal principles yet they could not bear to abstain from physics altogether they therefore made a mock physics in moral terms out of which theology was afterward developed Plato standing nearer to Socrates and being no naturalist by disposition never carried the fatal experiment beyond the mythical stage He accordingly remained the purer moralist much as Aristotle s judgment may be preferred in many particulars Their relative position may be roughly indicated by saying that Plato had no physics and that Aristotle s physics was false so that ideal science in the one suffered from want of environment and control while in the other it suffered from misuse in a sphere where it had no application Sidenote Plato s myths in lieu of physics What had happened was briefly this Plato having studied many sorts of philosophy and being a bold and universal genius was not satisfied to leave all physical questions pending as his master had done He adopted accordingly Heraclitus s doctrine of the immediate which he now called the realm of phenomena for what exists at any instant if you arrest and name it turns out to have been an embodiment of some logical essence such as discourse might define in every fact some idea makes its appearance and such an apparition of the ideal is a phenomenon Moreover another philosophy had made a deep impression on Plato s mind and had helped to develop Socratic definitions Parmenides had called the concept of pure Being the only reality and to satisfy the strong dialectic by which this doctrine was supported and at the same time to bridge the infinite chasm between one formless substance and many appearances irrelevant to it Plato substituted the many Socratic ideas all of which were relevant to appearance for the one concept of Parmenides The ideas thus acquired what is called metaphysical subsistence for they stood in the place of the Eleatic Absolute and at the same time were the realities that phenomena manifested The technique of this combination is much to be admired but the feat is technical and adds nothing to the significance of what Plato has to say on any concrete subject This barren triumph was however fruitful in misunderstandings The characters and values a thing possessed were now conceived to subsist apart from it and might even have preceded it and caused its existence a mechanism composed of values and definitions could thus be placed behind phenomena to constitute a substantial physical world Such a dream could not be taken seriously until good sense was wholly lost and a bevy of magic spirits could be imagined peopling the infinite and yet carrying on the business of earth Aristotle rejected the metaphysical subsistence of ideas but thought they might still be essences operative in nature if only they were identified with the life or form of particular things The dream thus lost its frank wildness but none of its inherent incongruity for the sense in which characters and values make a thing what it is is purely dialectical They give it its status in the ideal world but the appearance of these characters and values here and now is what needs explanation in physics an explanation which can be furnished of course only by the physical concatenation and distribution of causes Sidenote Aristotle s final causes Modern science can avoid such expedients Aristotle himself did not fail to Aristotle s make this necessary distinction between efficient cause and formal essence but as his science was only natural history and mechanism had no plausibility in his eyes the efficiency of the cause was always due in his view to its ideal quality as in heredity the father s human character not his physical structure might seem to warrant the son s humanity Every ideal before it could be embodied had to pre exist in some other embodiment but as when the ultimate purpose of the cosmos is considered it seems to lie beyond any given embodiment the highest ideal must somehow exist disembodied It must pre exist thought Aristotle in order to supply by way of magic attraction a physical cause for perpetual movement in the world It must be confessed in justice to this consummate philosopher who is not less masterly in the use of knowledge than unhappy in divination that the transformation of the highest good into a physical power is merely incidental with him and due to a want of faith at that time excusable in mechanism and evolution Aristotle s deity is always a moral ideal and every detail in its definition is based on discrimination between the better and the worse No accommodation to the ways of nature is here allowed to cloud the kingdom of heaven this deity is not condemned to do whatever happens nor to absorb whatever exists It is mythical only in its physical application in moral philosophy it remains a legitimate conception Truth certainly exists if existence be not too mean an attribute for that eternal realm which is tenanted by ideals but truth is repugnant to physical or psychical being Moreover truth may very well be identified with an impassible intellect which should do nothing but possess all truth with no point of view no animal warmth and no transitive process Such an intellect and truth are expressions having a different metaphorical background and connotation but when thought out an identical import They both attempt to evoke that ideal standard which human thought proposes to itself This function is their effective essence It insures their eternal fixity and this property surely endows them with a very genuine and sublime reality What is fantastic is only the dynamic function attributed to them by Aristotle which obliges them to inhabit some fabulous extension to the physical world Even this physical efficacy however is spiritualised as much as possible since deity is said to move the cosmos only as an object of love or an object of knowledge may move the mind Such efficacy is imputed to a hypostasised end but evidently resides in fact in the functioning and impulsive spirit that conceives and pursues an ideal endowing it with whatever attraction it may seem to have The absolute intellect described by Aristotle remains therefore as pertinent to the Life of Reason as Plato s idea of the good Though less comprehensive for it abstracts from all animal interests from all passion and mortality it is more adequate and distinct in the region it dominates It expresses sublimely the goal of speculative thinking which is none other than to live as much as may be in the eternal and to absorb and be absorbed in the truth The rest of ancient philosophy belongs to the decadence and rests in physics on eclecticism and in morals on despair That creative breath which had stirred the founders and legislators of Greece no longer inspired their descendants Helpless to control the course of events they took refuge in abstention or in conformity and their ethics became a matter of private economy and sentiment no longer aspiring to mould the state or give any positive aim to existence The time was approaching when both speculation and morals were to regard the other world reason had abdicated the throne and religion after that brief interregnum resumed it for long ages Sidenote Transcendentalism true but inconsequential Such are the threads which tradition puts into the hands of an observer who at the present time might attempt to knit the Life of Reason ideally together The problem is to unite a trustworthy conception of the conditions under which man lives with an adequate conception of his interests Both conceptions fortunately lie before us Heraclitus and Democritus in systems easily seen to be complementary gave long ago a picture of nature such as all later observation down to our own day has done nothing but fill out and confirm Psychology and physics still repeat their ideas often with richer detail but never with a more radical or prophetic glance Nor does the transcendental philosophy in spite of its self esteem add anything essential It was a thing taken for granted in ancient and scholastic philosophy that a being dwelling like man in the immediate whose moments are in flux needed constructive reason to interpret his experience and paint in his unstable consciousness some symbolic picture of the world To have reverted to this constructive process and studied its stages is an interesting achievement but the construction is already made by common sense and science and it was visionary insolence in the Germans to propose to make that construction otherwise Retrospective self consciousness is dearly bought if it inhibits the intellect and embarrasses the inferences which in its spontaneous operation it has known perfectly how to make In the heat of scientific theorising or dialectical argument it is sometimes salutary to be reminded that we are men thinking but after all it is no news We know that life is a dream and how should thinking be more Yet the thinking must go on and the only vital question is to what practical or poetic conceptions it is able to lead us Sidenote Verbal ethics Similarly the Socratic philosophy affords a noble and genuine account of what goods may be realised by living Modern theory has not done so much to help us here however as it has in physics It seldom occurs to modern moralists that theirs is the science of all good and the art of its attainment they think only of some set of categorical precepts or some theory of moral sentiments abstracting altogether from the ideals reigning in society in science and in art They deal with the secondary question What ought I to do without having answered the primary question What ought to be They attach morals to religion rather than to politics and this religion unhappily long ago ceased to be wisdom expressed in fancy in order to become superstition overlaid with reasoning They divide man into compartments and the less they leave in the one labelled morality the more sublime they think their morality is and sometimes pedantry and scholasticism are carried so far that nothing but an abstract sense of duty remains in the broad region which should contain all human goods Sidenote Spinoza and the Life of Reason Such trivial sanctimony in morals is doubtless due to artificial views about the conditions of welfare the basis is laid in authority rather than in human nature and the goal in salvation rather than in happiness One great modern philosopher however was free from these preconceptions and might have reconstituted the Life of Reason had he had a sufficient interest in culture Spinoza brought man back into nature and made him the nucleus of all moral values showing how he may recognise his environment and how he may master it But Spinoza s sympathy with mankind fell short of imagination any noble political or poetical ideal eluded him Everything impassioned seemed to him insane everything human necessarily petty Man was to be a pious tame animal with the stars shining above his head Instead of imagination Spinoza cultivated mysticism which is indeed an alternative A prophet in speculation he remained a levite in sentiment Little or nothing would need to be changed in his system if the Life of Reason in its higher ranges were to be grafted upon it but such affiliation is not necessary and it is rendered unnatural by the lack of sweep and generosity in Spinoza s practical ideals Sidenote Modern and classic sources of inspiration For moral philosophy we are driven back then upon the ancients but not of course for moral inspiration Industrialism and democracy the French Revolution the Renaissance and even the Catholic system which in the midst of ancient illusions enshrines so much tenderness and wisdom still live in the world though forgotten by philosophers and point unmistakably toward their several goals Our task is not to construct but only to interpret ideals confronting them with one another and with the conditions which for the most part they alike ignore There is no need of refuting anything for the will which is behind all ideals and behind most dogmas cannot itself be refuted but it may be enlightened and led to reconsider its intent when its satisfaction is seen to be either naturally impossible or inconsistent with better things The age of controversy is past that of interpretation has succeeded Here then is the programme of the following work Starting with the immediate flux in which all objects and impulses are given to describe the Life of Reason that is to note what facts and purposes seem to be primary to show how the conception of nature and life gathers around them and to point to the ideals of thought and action which are approached by this gradual mastering of experience by reason A great task which it would be beyond the powers of a writer in this age either to execute or to conceive had not the Greeks drawn for us the outlines of an ideal culture at a time when life was simpler than at present and individual intelligence more resolute and free REASON IN COMMON SENSE CHAPTER I THE BIRTH OF REASON Sidenote 
3955-38223-0001	train-other-500	Existence always has an Order called Chaos when incompatible with a chosen good Whether Chaos or Order lay at the beginning of things is a question once much debated in the schools but afterward long in abeyance
3955-38223-0002	train-other-500	not so much because it had been solved as because one party had been silenced by social pressure
none	none	 The question is bound to recur in an age when observation and dialectic again freely confront each other Naturalists look back to chaos since they observe everything growing from seeds and shifting its character 
3955-38223-0003	train-other-500	in regeneration The order now established in the world may be traced back to a situation in which it did not appear Dialecticians on the other hand
3955-38223-0004	train-other-500	refute this presumption by urging that every collocation of things must have been preceded by another collocation in itself no less definite and precise and further that some principle of transition or continuity
3955-38223-0005	train-other-500	must always have obtained else successive states would stand in no relation to one another notably not in the relation of cause and effect expressed in a natural law which is presupposed in this instance
3955-38223-0006	train-other-500	Potentialities are dispositions and a disposition involves an order as does also the passage from any specific potentiality into act Thus the world we are told must always have possessed a structure
none	none	 The two views may perhaps be reconciled if we take each with a qualification 
3955-38223-0007	train-other-500	Chaos doubtless has existed and will return nay it reigns now very likely in the remoter and inmost parts of the universe
none	none	 if by chaos we understand a nature containing none of the objects we are wont to distinguish 
3955-38223-0008	train-other-500	a nature such that human life and human thought would be impossible
none	none	 in its bosom 
3955-38223-0009	train-other-500	but this nature must be presumed to have an order an order directly importing if the tendency of its movement be taken into account all the complexities and beauties all the sense and reason which exist now
3955-38223-0010	train-other-500	Order is accordingly continual but only when order means not a specific arrangement favourable to a given form of life but any arrangement whatsoever
3955-38223-0011	train-other-500	The process by which an arrangement which is essentially unstable gradually shifts cannot be said to aim at every stage which at any moment it involves For the process passes beyond
3955-38223-0012	train-other-500	It presently abolishes all the forms which may have arrested attention and generated love its initial energy defeats every purpose which we may fondly attribute to it
3955-38223-0013	train-other-500	Nor is it here necessary to remind ourselves that to call results their own causes is always preposterous for in this case even the mythical sense which might be attached to such language is inapplicable
3955-38223-0014	train-other-500	Here the process taken in the gross does not even by mechanical necessity support the value which is supposed to guide it That value is realised for a moment only
3955-38223-0015	train-other-500	so that if we impute to Cronos any intent to beget his children we must also impute to him an intent to devour them
none	none	 Sidenote 
3955-38223-0016	train-other-500	Absolute order or truth is static impotent indifferent Of course the various states of the world when we survey them retrospectively constitute another and now static order called historic truth
3955-38223-0017	train-other-500	To this absolute and impotent order every detail is essential If we wished to abuse language so much as to speak of will in an Absolute where change is excluded
none	none	 so that nothing can be 
3955-38223-0018	train-other-500	or be conceived beyond it we might say that the Absolute willed everything that ever exists and that the eternal order terminated in every fact indiscriminately
none	none	 but such language involves an after image of motion and life of preparation risk and subsequent accomplishment 
3955-38223-0019	train-other-500	adventures all pre supposing refractory materials and excluded from eternal truth by its very essence The only function those traditional metaphors have is to shield confusion and sentimentality
3955-38223-0020	train-other-500	Because Jehovah once fought for the Jews we need not continue to say that the truth is solicitous about us when it is only we that are fighting to attain it
3955-38223-0021	train-other-500	The universe can wish particular things only in so far as particular beings wish them only in its relative capacity can it find things good and only in its relative capacity can it be good for anything
none	none	 The efficacious or physical order which exists at any moment in the world and out of which the next moment s order is developed 
3955-38223-0022	train-other-500	may accordingly be termed a relative chaos a chaos because the values suggested and supported by the second moment could not have belonged to the first but merely a relative chaos
3955-38223-0023	train-other-500	first because it probably carried values of its own which rendered it an order in a moral and eulogistic sense and secondly because it was potentially by virtue of its momentum a basis for the second moment s values as well
none	none	 Sidenote 
3955-38223-0024	train-other-500	In experience order is relative to interests which determine the moral status of all powers Human life when it begins to possess intrinsic value
3955-38223-0025	train-other-500	is an incipient order in the midst of what seems a vast though to some extent a vanishing chaos
3955-38223-0026	train-other-500	This reputed chaos can be deciphered and appreciated by man only in proportion as the order in himself is confirmed and extended
3955-38223-0027	train-other-500	For man s consciousness is evidently practical it clings to his fate registers so to speak the higher and lower temperature of his fortunes and so far as it can
3955-38223-0028	train-other-500	represents the agencies on which those fortunes depend When this dramatic vocation of consciousness has not been fulfilled at all consciousness is wholly confused
3955-38223-0029	train-other-500	the world it envisages seems consequently a chaos Later if experience has fallen into shape
none	none	 and there are settled categories and constant objects in human discourse 
3955-38223-0030	train-other-500	the inference is drawn that the original disposition of things was also orderly and indeed mechanically conducive to just those feats of instinct and intelligence which have been since accomplished
3955-38223-0031	train-other-500	A theory of origins of substance and of natural laws may thus be framed and accepted and may receive confirmation in the further march of events It will be observed however
3955-38223-0032	train-other-500	that what is credibly asserted about the past is not a report which the past was itself able to make when it existed
3955-38223-0033	train-other-500	nor one it is now able in some oracular fashion to formulate and to impose upon us The report is a rational construction based and seated in present experience
3955-38223-0034	train-other-500	it has no cogency for the inattentive and no existence for the ignorant Although the universe then may not have come from chaos human experience certainly has begun in a private and dreamful chaos of its own
3955-38223-0035	train-other-500	out of which it still only partially and momentarily emerges The history of this awakening is of course not the same as that of the environing world ultimately discovered it is the history however
3955-38223-0036	train-other-500	of that discovery itself of the knowledge through which alone the world can be revealed
none	none	 We may accordingly dispense ourselves from preliminary courtesies to the real universal order 
3955-38223-0037	train-other-500	nature the absolute and the gods We shall make their acquaintance in due season and better appreciate their moral status
none	none	 if we strive merely to recall our own experience and to retrace the visions and reflections out of which those apparitions have grown Sidenote 
3955-38223-0038	train-other-500	The discovered conditions of reason not its beginning To revert to primordial feeling is an exercise in mental disintegration not a feat of science We might indeed
3955-38223-0039	train-other-500	as in animal psychology retrace the situations in which instinct and sense seem first to appear and write as it were a genealogy of reason based on circumstantial evidence Reason was born
3955-38223-0040	train-other-500	as it has since discovered into a world already wonderfully organised in which it found its precursor in what is called life
none	none	 its seat in an animal body of unusual plasticity and its function in rendering that body s volatile instincts and sensations harmonious with one another and with the outer world 
3955-38223-0041	train-other-500	on which they depend It did not arise until the will or conscious stress by which any modification of living bodies inertia seems to be accompanied
3955-38223-0042	train-other-500	began to respond to represented objects and to maintain that inertia not absolutely by resistance but only relatively and indirectly through labour
3955-38223-0043	train-other-500	Reason has thus supervened at the last stage of an adaptation which had long been carried on by irrational and even unconscious processes Nature preceded
none	none	 with all that fixation of impulses and conditions which gives reason its tasks and its point d appui Nevertheless 
3955-38223-0044	train-other-500	such a matrix or cradle for reason belongs only externally to its life The description of conditions involves their previous discovery and a historian equipped with many data and many analogies of thought
3955-38223-0045	train-other-500	Such scientific resources are absent in those first moments of rational living which we here wish to recall
none	none	 the first chapter in reason s memoirs would no more entail the description of its real environment than the first chapter in human history would include true accounts of astronomy psychology and animal evolution Sidenote The flux first In order to begin at the beginning we must try to fall back on uninterpreted feeling as the mystics aspire to do We need not expect however to find peace there for the immediate is in flux Pure feeling rejoices in a logical nonentity very deceptive to dialectical minds They often think when they fall back on elements necessarily indescribable that they have come upon true nothingness If they are mystics distrusting thought and craving the largeness of indistinction they may embrace this alleged nothingness with joy even if it seem positively painful hoping to find rest there through self abnegation If on the contrary they are rationalists they may reject the immediate with scorn and deny that it exists at all since in their books they cannot define it satisfactorily Both mystics and rationalists however are deceived by their mental agility the immediate exists even if dialectic cannot explain it What the rationalist calls nonentity is the substrate and locus of all ideas having the obstinate reality of matter the crushing irrationality of existence itself and one who attempts to override it becomes to that extent an irrelevant rhapsodist dealing with thin after images of being Nor has the mystic who sinks into the immediate much better appreciated the situation This immediate is not God but chaos its nothingness is pregnant restless and brutish it is that from which all things emerge in so far as they have any permanence or value so that to lapse into it again is a dull suicide and no salvation Peace which is after all what the mystic seeks lies not in indistinction but in perfection If he reaches it in a measure himself it is by the traditional discipline he still practises not by his heats or his languors The seed bed of reason lies then in the immediate but what reason draws thence is momentum and power to rise above its source It is the perturbed immediate itself that finds or at least seeks its peace in reason through which it comes in sight of some sort of ideal permanence When the flux manages to form an eddy and to maintain by breathing and nutrition what we call a life it affords some slight foothold and object for thought and becomes in a measure like the ark in the desert a moving habitation for the eternal Sidenote Life the fixation of interests Life begins to have some value and continuity so soon as there is something definite that lives and something definite to live for The primacy of will as Fichte and Schopenhauer conceived it is a mythical way of designating this situation Of course a will can have no being in the absence of realities or ideas marking its direction and contrasting the eventualities it seeks with those it flies from and tendency no less than movement needs an organised medium to make it possible while aspiration and fear involve an ideal world Yet a principle of choice is not deducible from mere ideas and no interest is involved in the formal relations of things All survey needs an arbitrary starting point all valuation rests on an irrational bias The absolute flux cannot be physically arrested but what arrests it ideally is the fixing of some point in it from which it can be measured and illumined Otherwise it could show no form and maintain no preference it would be impossible to approach or recede from a represented state and to suffer or to exert will in view of events The irrational fate that lodges the transcendental self in this or that body inspires it with definite passions and subjects it to particular buffets from the outer world this is the prime condition of all observation and inference of all failure or success Sidenote Primary dualities Those sensations in which a transition is contained need only analysis to yield two ideal and related terms two points in space or two characters in feeling Hot and cold here and there good and bad now and then are dyads that spring into being when the flux accentuates some term and so makes possible a discrimination of parts and directions in its own movement An initial attitude sustains incipient interests What we first discover in ourselves before the influence we obey has given rise to any definite idea is the working of instincts already in motion Impulses to appropriate and to reject first teach us the points of the compass and space itself like charity begins at home Sidenote First gropings Instinct the nucleus of reason The guide in early sensuous education is the same that conducts the whole Life of Reason namely impulse checked by experiment and experiment judged again by impulse What teaches the child to distinguish the nurse s breast from sundry blank or disquieting presences What induces him to arrest that image to mark its associates and to recognise them with alacrity The discomfort of its absence and the comfort of its possession To that image is attached the chief satisfaction he knows and the force of that satisfaction disentangles it before all other images from the feeble and fluid continuum of his life What first awakens in him a sense of reality is what first is able to appease his unrest Had the group of feelings now welded together in fruition found no instinct in him to awaken and become a signal for the group would never have persisted its loose elements would have been allowed to pass by unnoticed and would not have been recognised when they recurred Experience would have remained absolute inexperience as foolishly perpetual as the gurglings of rivers or the flickerings of sunlight in a grove But an instinct was actually present so formed as to be aroused by a determinate stimulus and the image produced by that stimulus when it came could have in consequence a meaning and an individuality It seemed by divine right to signify something interesting something real because by natural contiguity it flowed from something pertinent and important to life Every accompanying sensation which shared that privilege or in time was engrossed in that function would ultimately become a part of that conceived reality a quality of that thing The same primacy of impulses irrational in themselves but expressive of bodily functions is observable in the behaviour of animals and in those dreams obsessions and primary passions which in the midst of sophisticated life sometimes lay bare the obscure groundwork of human nature Reason s work is there undone We can observe sporadic growths disjointed fragments of rationality springing up in a moral wilderness In the passion of love for instance a cause unknown to the sufferer but which is doubtless the spring flood of hereditary instincts accidentally let loose suddenly checks the young man s gayety dispels his random curiosity arrests perhaps his very breath and when he looks for a cause to explain his suspended faculties he can find it only in the presence or image of another being of whose character possibly he knows nothing and whose beauty may not be remarkable yet that image pursues him everywhere and he is dominated by an unaccustomed tragic earnestness and a new capacity for suffering and joy If the passion be strong there is no previous interest or duty that will be remembered before it if it be lasting the whole life may be reorganised by it it may impose new habits other manners and another religion Yet what is the root of all this idealism An irrational instinct normally intermittent such as all dumb creatures share which has here managed to dominate a human soul and to enlist all the mental powers in its more or less permanent service upsetting their usual equilibrium This madness however inspires method and for the first time perhaps in his life the man has something to live for The blind affinity that like a magnet draws all the faculties around it in so uniting them suffuses them with an unwonted spiritual light Sidenote Better and worse the fundamental categories Here on a small scale and on a precarious foundation we may see clearly illustrated and foreshadowed that Life of Reason which is simply the unity given to all existence by a mind in love with the good In the higher reaches of human nature as much as in the lower rationality depends on distinguishing the excellent and that distinction can be made in the last analysis only by an irrational impulse As life is a better form given to force by which the universal flux is subdued to create and serve a somewhat permanent interest so reason is a better form given to interest itself by which it is fortified and propagated and ultimately perhaps assured of satisfaction The substance to which this form is given remains irrational so that rationality like all excellence is something secondary and relative requiring a natural being to possess or to impute it When definite interests are recognised and the values of things are estimated by that standard action at the same time veering in harmony with that estimation then reason has been born and a moral world has arisen CHAPTER II FIRST STEPS AND FIRST FLUCTUATIONS Sidenote Dreams before thoughts Consciousness is a born hermit Though subject by divine dispensation to spells of fervour and apathy like a singing bird it is at first quite unconcerned about its own conditions or maintenance To acquire a notion of such matters or an interest in them it would have to lose its hearty simplicity and begin to reflect it would have to forget the present with its instant joys in order laboriously to conceive the absent and the hypothetical The body may be said to make for self preservation since it has an organic equilibrium which when not too rudely disturbed restores itself by growth and company operative action but no such principle appears in the soul Foolish in the beginning and generous in the end consciousness thinks of nothing so little as of its own interests It is lost in its objects nor would it ever acquire even an indirect concern in its future did not love of things external attach it to their fortunes Attachment to ideal terms is indeed what gives consciousness its continuity its parts have no relevance or relation to one another save what they acquire by depending on the same body or representing the same objects Even when consciousness grows sophisticated and thinks it cares for itself it really cares only for its ideals the world it pictures seems to it beautiful and it may incidentally prize itself also when it has come to regard itself as a part of that world Initially however it is free even from that honest selfishness it looks straight out it is interested in the movements it observes it swells with the represented world suffers with its commotion and subsides no less willingly in its interludes of calm Natural history and psychology arrive at consciousness from the outside and consequently give it an artificial articulation and rationality which are wholly alien to its essence These sciences infer feeling from habit or expression so that only the expressible and practical aspects of feeling figure in their calculation But these aspects are really peripheral the core is an irresponsible ungoverned irrevocable dream Psychologists have discussed perception ad nauseam and become horribly entangled in a combined idealism and physiology for they must perforce approach the subject from the side of matter since all science and all evidence is external nor could they ever reach consciousness at all if they did not observe its occasions and then interpret those occasions dramatically At the same time the inferred mind they subject to examination will yield nothing but ideas and it is a marvel how such a dream can regard those natural objects from which the psychologist has inferred it Perception is in fact no primary phase of consciousness it is an ulterior practical function acquired by a dream which has become symbolic of its conditions and therefore relevant to its own destiny Such relevance and symbolism are indirect and slowly acquired their status cannot be understood unless we regard them as forms of imagination happily grown significant In imagination not in perception lies the substance of experience while knowledge and reason are but its chastened and ultimate form Sidenote The mind vegetates uncontrolled save by physical forces Every actual animal is somewhat dull and somewhat mad He will at times miss his signals and stare vacantly when he might well act while at other times he will run off into convulsions and raise a dust in his own brain to no purpose These imperfections are so human that we should hardly recognise ourselves if we could shake them off altogether Not to retain any dulness would mean to possess untiring attention and universal interests thus realising the boast about deeming nothing human alien to us while to be absolutely without folly would involve perfect self knowledge and self control The intelligent man known to history nourishes within a dullard and holds a lunatic in leash He is encased in a protective shell of ignorance and insensibility which keeps him from being exhausted and confused by this too complicated world but that integument blinds him at the same time to many of his nearest and highest interests He is amused by the antics of the brute dreaming within his breast he gloats on his passionate reveries an amusement which sometimes costs him very dear Thus the best human intelligence is still decidedly barbarous it fights in heavy armour and keeps a fool at court Sidenote Internal order supervenes If consciousness could ever have the function of guiding conduct better than instinct can in the beginning it would be most incompetent for that office Only the routine and equilibrium which healthy instinct involves keep thought and will at all within the limits of sanity The predetermined interests we have as animals fortunately focus our attention on practical things pulling it back like a ball with an elastic cord within the radius of pertinent matters Instinct alone compels us to neglect and seldom to recall the irrelevant infinity of ideas Philosophers have sometimes said that all ideas come from experience they never could have been poets and must have forgotten that they were ever children The great difficulty in education is to get experience out of ideas Shame conscience and reason continually disallow and ignore what consciousness presents and what are they but habit and latent instinct asserting themselves and forcing us to disregard our midsummer madness Idiocy and lunacy are merely reversions to a condition in which present consciousness is in the ascendant and has escaped the control of unconscious forces We speak of people being out of their senses when they have in fact fallen back into them or of those who have lost their mind when they have lost merely that habitual control over consciousness which prevented it from flaring into all sorts of obsessions and agonies Their bodies having become deranged their minds far from correcting that derangement instantly share and betray it A dream is always simmering below the conventional surface of speech and reflection Even in the highest reaches and serenest meditations of science it sometimes breaks through Even there we are seldom constant enough to conceive a truly natural world somewhere passionate fanciful or magic elements will slip into the scheme and baffle rational ambition A body seriously out of equilibrium either with itself or with its environment perishes outright Not so a mind Madness and suffering can set themselves no limit they lapse only when the corporeal frame that sustains them yields to circumstances and changes its habit If they are unstable at all it is because they ordinarily correspond to strains and conjunctions which a vigorous body overcomes or which dissolve the body altogether A pain not incidental to the play of practical instincts may easily be recurrent and it might be perpetual if even the worst habits were not intermittent and the most useless agitations exhausting Some respite will therefore ensue upon pain but no magic cure Madness in like manner if pronounced is precarious but when speculative enough to be harmless or not strong enough to be debilitating it too may last for ever An imaginative life may therefore exist parasitically in a man hardly touching his action or environment There is no possibility of exorcising these apparitions by their own power A nightmare does not dispel itself it endures until the organic strain which caused it is relaxed either by natural exhaustion or by some external influence Therefore human ideas are still for the most part sensuous and trivial shifting with the chance currents of the brain and representing nothing so to speak but personal temperature Personal temperature moreover is sometimes tropical There are brains like a South American jungle as there are others like an Arabian desert strewn with nothing but bones While a passionate sultriness prevails in the mind there is no end to its luxuriance Languages intricately articulate flaming mythologies metaphysical perspectives lost in infinity arise in remarkable profusion In time however there comes a change of climate and the whole forest disappears It is easy from the stand point of acquired practical competence to deride a merely imaginative life Derision however is not interpretation and the better method of overcoming erratic ideas is to trace them out dialectically and see if they will not recognise their own fatuity The most irresponsible vision has certain principles of order and valuation by which it estimates itself and in these principles the Life of Reason is already broached however halting may be its development We should lead ourselves out of our dream as the Israelites were led out of Egypt by the promise and eloquence of that dream itself Otherwise we might kill the goose that lays the golden egg and by proscribing imagination abolish science Sidenote Intrinsic pleasure in existence Sidenote Pleasure a good Visionary experience has a first value in its possible pleasantness Why any form of feeling should be delightful is not to be explained transcendentally a physiological law may after the fact render every instance predictable but no logical affinity between the formal quality of an experience and the impulse to welcome it will thereby be disclosed We find however that pleasure suffuses certain states of mind and pain others which is another way of saying that for no reason we love the first and detest the second The polemic which certain moralists have waged against pleasure and in favour of pain is intelligible when we remember that their chief interest is edification and that ability to resist pleasure and pain alike is a valuable virtue in a world where action and renunciation are the twin keys to happiness But to deny that pleasure is a good and pain an evil is a grotesque affectation it amounts to giving good and evil artificial definitions and thereby reducing ethics to arbitrary verbiage Not only is good that adherence of the will to experience of which pleasure is the basal example and evil the corresponding rejection which is the very essence of pain but when we pass from good and evil in sense to their highest embodiments pleasure remains eligible and pain something which it is a duty to prevent A man who without necessity deprived any person of a pleasure or imposed on him a pain would be a contemptible knave and the person so injured would be the first to declare it nor could the highest celestial tribunal if it was just reverse that sentence For it suffices that one being however weak loves or abhors anything no matter how slightly for that thing to acquire a proportionate value which no chorus of contradiction ringing through all the spheres can ever wholly abolish An experience good or bad in itself remains so for ever and its inclusion in a more general order of things can only change that totality proportionately to the ingredient absorbed which will infect the mass so far as it goes with its own colour The more pleasure a universe can yield other things being equal the more beneficent and generous is its general nature the more pains its constitution involves the darker and more malign is its total temper To deny this would seem impossible yet it is done daily for there is nothing people will not maintain when they are slaves to superstition and candour and a sense of justice are in such a case the first things lost Sidenote but not pursued or remembered unless it suffuses an object Pleasures differ sensibly in intensity but the intensest pleasures are often the blindest and it is hard to recall or estimate a feeling with which no definite and complex object is conjoined The first step in making pleasure intelligible and capable of being pursued is to make it pleasure in something The object it suffuses acquires a value and gives the pleasure itself a place in rational life The pleasure can now be named its variations studied in reference to changes in its object and its comings and goings foreseen in the order of events The more articulate the world that produces emotion the more controllable and recoverable is the emotion itself Therefore diversity and order in ideas makes the life of pleasure richer and easier to lead A voluminous dumb pleasure might indeed outweigh the pleasure spread thin over a multitude of tame perceptions if we could only weigh the two in one scale but to do so is impossible and in memory and prospect if not in experience diversified pleasure must needs carry the day Sidenote Subhuman delights Here we come upon a crisis in human development which shows clearly how much the Life of Reason is a natural thing a growth that a different course of events might well have excluded Laplace is reported to have said on his death bed that science was mere trifling and that nothing was real but love Love for such a man doubtless involved objects and ideas it was love of persons The same revulsion of feeling may however be carried further Lucretius says that passion is a torment because its pleasures are not pure that is because they are mingled with longing and entangled in vexatious things Pure pleasure would be without ideas Many a man has found in some moment of his life an unutterable joy which made all the rest of it seem a farce as if a corpse should play it was living Mystics habitually look beneath the Life of Reason for the substance and infinity of happiness In all these revulsions and many others there is a certain justification inasmuch as systematic living is after all an experiment as is the formation of animal bodies and the inorganic pulp out of which these growths have come may very likely have had its own incommunicable values its absolute thrills which we vainly try to remember and to which in moments of dissolution we may half revert Protoplasmic pleasures and strains may be the substance of consciousness and as matter seeks its own level and as the sea and the flat waste to which all dust returns have a certain primordial life and a certain sublimity so all passions and ideas when spent may rejoin the basal note of feeling and enlarge their volume as they lose their form This loss of form may not be unwelcome if it is the formless that by anticipation speaks through what is surrendering its being Though to acquire or impart form is delightful in art in thought in generation in government yet a euthanasia of finitude is also known All is not affectation in the poet who says Now more than ever seems it rich to die and without any poetry or affectation men may love sleep and opiates and every luxurious escape from humanity The step by which pleasure and pain are attached to ideas so as to be predictable and to become factors in action is therefore by no means irrevocable It is a step however in the direction of reason and though reason s path is only one of innumerable courses perhaps open to existence it is the only one that we are tracing here the only one obviously which human discourse is competent to trace Sidenote Animal living When consciousness begins to add diversity to its intensity its value is no longer absolute and inexpressible The felt variations in its tone are attached to the observed movement of its objects in these objects its values are imbedded A world loaded with dramatic values may thus arise in imagination terrible and delightful presences may chase one another across the void life will be a kind of music made by all the senses together Many animals probably have this form of experience they are not wholly submerged in a vegetative stupor they can discern what they love or fear Yet all this is still a disordered apparition that reels itself off amid sporadic movements efforts and agonies Now gorgeous now exciting now indifferent the landscape brightens and fades with the day If a dog while sniffing about contentedly sees afar off his master arriving after long absence the change in the animal s feeling is not merely in the quantity of pure pleasure a new circle of sensations appears with a new principle governing interest and desire instead of waywardness subjection instead of freedom love But the poor brute asks for no reason why his master went why he has come again why he should be loved or why presently while lying at his feet you forget him and begin to grunt and dream of the chase all that is an utter mystery utterly unconsidered Such experience has variety scenery and a certain vital rhythm its story might be told in dithyrambic verse It moves wholly by inspiration every event is providential every act unpremeditated Absolute freedom and absolute helplessness have met together you depend wholly on divine favour yet that unfathomable agency is not distinguishable from your own life This is the condition to which some forms of piety invite men to return and it lies in truth not far beneath the level of ordinary human consciousness Sidenote Causes at last discerned The story which such animal experience contains however needs only to be better articulated in order to disclose its underlying machinery The figures even of that disordered drama have their exits and their entrances and their cues can be gradually discovered by a being capable of fixing his attention and retaining the order of events Thereupon a third step is made in imaginative experience As pleasures and pains were formerly distributed among objects so objects are now marshalled into a world Felix qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas said a poet who stood near enough to fundamental human needs and to the great answer which art and civilisation can make to them to value the Life of Reason and think it sublime To discern causes is to turn vision into knowledge and motion into action It is to fix the associates of things so that their respective transformations are collated and they become significant of one another In proportion as such understanding advances each moment of experience becomes consequential and prophetic of the rest The calm places in life are filled with power and its spasms with resource No emotion can overwhelm the mind for of none is the basis or issue wholly hidden no event can disconcert it altogether because it sees beyond Means can be looked for to escape from the worst predicament and whereas each moment had been formerly filled with nothing but its own adventure and surprised emotion each now makes room for the lesson of what went before and surmises what may be the plot of the whole At the threshold of reason there is a kind of choice Not all impressions contribute equally to the new growth many in fact which were formerly equal in rank to the best now grow obscure Attention ignores them in its haste to arrive at what is significant of something more Nor are the principles of synthesis by which the aristocratic few establish their oligarchy themselves unequivocal The first principles of logic are like the senses few but arbitrary They might have been quite different and yet produced by a now unthinkable method a language no less significant than the one we speak Twenty six letters may suffice for a language but they are a wretched minority among all possible sounds So the forms of perception and the categories of thought which a grammarian s philosophy might think primordial necessities are no less casual than words or their syntactical order Why we may ask did these forms assert themselves here What principles of selection guide mental growth Sidenote Attention guided by bodily impulse To give a logical ground for such a selection is evidently impossible since it is logic itself that is to be accounted for A natural ground is in strictness also irrelevant since natural connections where thought has not reduced them to a sort of equivalence and necessity are mere data and juxtapositions Yet it is not necessary to leave the question altogether unanswered By using our senses we may discover not indeed why each sense has its specific quality or exists at all but what are its organs and occasions In like manner we may by developing the Life of Reason come to understand its conditions When consciousness awakes the body has as we long afterward discover a definite organisation Without guidance from reflection bodily processes have been going on and most precise affinities and reactions have been set up between its organs and the surrounding objects On these affinities and reactions sense and intellect are grafted The plants are of different nature yet growing together they bear excellent fruit It is as the organs receive appropriate stimulations that attention is riveted on definite sensations It is as the system exercises its natural activities that passion will and meditation possess the mind No syllogism is needed to persuade us to eat no prophecy of happiness to teach us to love On the contrary the living organism caught in the act informs us how to reason and what to enjoy The soul adopts the body s aims from the body and from its instincts she draws a first hint of the right means to those accepted purposes Thus reason enters into partnership with the world and begins to be respected there which it would never be if it were not expressive of the same mechanical forces that are to preside over events and render them fortunate or unfortunate for human interests Reason is significant in action only because it has begun by taking so to speak the body s side that sympathetic bias enables her to distinguish events pertinent to the chosen interests to compare impulse with satisfaction and by representing a new and circular current in the system to preside over the formation of better habits habits expressing more instincts at once and responding to more opportunities CHAPTER III THE DISCOVERY OF NATURAL OBJECTS Sidenote Nature man s home At first sight it might seem an idle observation that the first task of intelligence is to represent the environing reality a reality actually represented in the notion universally prevalent among men of a cosmos in space and time an animated material engine called nature In trying to conceive nature the mind lisps its first lesson natural phenomena are the mother tongue of imagination no less than of science and practical life Men and gods are not conceivable otherwise than as inhabitants of nature Early experience knows no mystery which is not somehow rooted in transformations of the natural world and fancy can build no hope which would not be expressible there But we are grown so accustomed to this ancient apparition that we may be no longer aware how difficult was the task of conjuring it up We may even have forgotten the possibility that such a vision should never have arisen at all A brief excursion into that much abused subject the psychology of perception may here serve to remind us of the great work which the budding intellect must long ago have accomplished unawares Sidenote Difficulties in conceiving nature Consider how the shocks out of which the notion of material things is to be built first strike home into the soul Eye and hand if we may neglect the other senses transmit their successive impressions all varying with the position of outer objects and with the other material conditions A chaos of multitudinous impressions rains in from all sides at all hours Nor have the external or cognitive senses an original primacy The taste the smell the alarming sounds of things are continually distracting attention There are infinite reverberations in memory of all former impressions together with fresh fancies created in the brain things at first in no wise subordinated to external objects All these incongruous elements are mingled like a witches brew And more there are indications that inner sensations such as those of digestion have an overpowering influence on the primitive mind which has not learned to articulate or distinguish permanent needs So that to the whirl of outer sensations we must add to reach some notion of what consciousness may contain before the advent of reason interruptions and lethargies caused by wholly blind internal feelings trances such as fall even on comparatively articulate minds in rage lust or madness Against all these bewildering forces the new born reason has to struggle and we need not wonder that the costly experiments and disillusions of the past have not yet produced a complete enlightenment Sidenote Transcendental qualms The onslaught made in the last century by the transcendental philosophy upon empirical traditions is familiar to everybody it seemed a pertinent attack yet in the end proved quite trifling and unavailing Thought we are told rightly enough cannot be accounted for by enumerating its conditions A number of detached sensations being each its own little world cannot add themselves together nor conjoin themselves in the void Again experiences having an alleged common cause would not have merely for that reason a common object Nor would a series of successive perceptions no matter how quick logically involve a sense of time nor a notion of succession Yet in point of fact when such a succession occurs and a living brain is there to acquire some structural modification by virtue of its own passing states a memory of that succession and its terms may often supervene It is quite true also that the simultaneous presence or association of images belonging to different senses does not carry with it by intrinsic necessity any fusion of such images nor any notion of an object having them for its qualities Yet in point of fact such a group of sensations does often merge into a complex image instead of the elements originally perceptible in isolation there arises a familiar term a sort of personal presence To this felt presence certain instinctive reactions are attached and the sensations that may be involved in that apparition when each for any reason becomes emphatic are referred to it as its qualities or its effects Such complications of course involve the gift of memory with capacity to survey at once vestiges of many perceptions to feel their implication and absorption in the present object and to be carried by this sense of relation to the thought that those perceptions have a representative function And this is a great step It manifests the mind s powers It illustrates those transformations of consciousness the principle of which when abstracted we call intelligence We must accordingly proceed with caution for we are digging at the very roots of reason Sidenote Thought an aspect of life and transitive The chief perplexity however which besets this subject and makes discussions of it so often end in a cloud is quite artificial Thought is not a mechanical calculus where the elements and the method exhaust the fact Thought is a form of life and should be conceived on the analogy of nutrition generation and art Reason as Hume said with profound truth is an unintelligible instinct It could not be otherwise if reason is to remain something transitive and existential for transition is unintelligible and yet is the deepest characteristic of existence Philosophers however having perceived that the function of thought is to fix static terms and reveal eternal relations have inadvertently transferred to the living act what is true only of its ideal object and they have expected to find in the process treated psychologically that luminous deductive clearness which belongs to the ideal world it tends to reveal The intelligible however lies at the periphery of experience the surd at its core and intelligence is but one centrifugal ray darting from the slime to the stars Thought must execute a metamorphosis and while this is of course mysterious it is one of those familiar mysteries like motion and will which are more natural than dialectical lucidity itself for dialectic grows cogent by fulfilling intent but intent or meaning is itself vital and inexplicable Sidenote Perception cumulative and synthetic The process of counting is perhaps as simple an instance as can be found of a mental operation on sensible data The clock let us say strikes two if the sensorium were perfectly elastic and after receiving the first blow reverted exactly to its previous state retaining absolutely no trace of that momentary oscillation and no altered habit then it is certain that a sense for number or a faculty of counting could never arise The second stroke would be responded to with the same reaction which had met the first There would be no summation of effects no complication However numerous the successive impressions might come to be each would remain fresh and pure the last being identical in character with the first One one one would be the monotonous response for ever Just so generations of ephemeral insects that succeeded one another without transmitting experience might repeat the same round of impressions an everlasting progression without a shadow of progress Such too is the idiot s life his liquid brain transmits every impulse without resistance and retains the record of no impression Intelligence is accordingly conditioned by a modification of both structure and consciousness by dint of past events To be aware that a second stroke is not itself the first I must retain something of the old sensation The first must reverberate still in my ears when the second arrives so that this second coming into a consciousness still filled by the first is a different experience from the first which fell into a mind perfectly empty and unprepared Now the newcomer finds in the subsisting One a sponsor to christen it by the name of Two The first stroke was a simple one The second is not simply another one a mere iteration of the first It is one where the coefficient represents the reverberating first stroke still persisting in the mind and forming a background and perspective against which the new stroke may be distinguished The meaning of two then is this after that or this again where we have a simultaneous sense of two things which have been separately perceived but are identified as similar in their nature Repetition must cease to be pure repetition and become cumulative before it can give rise to the consciousness of repetition The first condition of counting then is that the sensorium should retain something of the first impression while it receives the second or to state the corresponding mental fact that the second sensation should be felt together with a survival of the first from which it is distinguished in point of existence and with which it is identified in point of character Sidenote No identical agent needed Now to secure this it is not enough that the sensorium should be materially continuous or that a spiritual substance or a transcendental ego should persist in time to receive the second sensation after having received and registered the first A perfectly elastic sensorium a wholly unchanging soul or a quite absolute ego might remain perfectly identical with itself through various experiences without collating them It would then remain in fact more truly and literally identical than if it were modified somewhat by those successive shocks Yet a sensorium or a spirit thus unchanged would be incapable of memory unfit to connect a past perception with one present or to become aware of their relation It is not identity in the substance impressed but growing complication in the phenomenon presented that makes possible a sense of diversity and relation between things The identity of substance or spirit if it were absolute would indeed prevent comparison because it would exclude modifications and it is the survival of past modifications within the present that makes comparisons possible We may impress any number of forms successively on the same water and the identity of the substance will not help those forms to survive and accumulate their effects But if we have a surface that retains our successive stampings we may change the substance from wax to plaster and from plaster to bronze and the effects of our labour will survive and be superimposed upon one another It is the actual plastic form in both mind and body not any unchanging substance or agent that is efficacious in perpetuating thought and gathering experience Sidenote Example of the sun Were not Nature and all her parts such models of patience and pertinacity they never would have succeeded in impressing their existence on something so volatile and irresponsible as thought is A sensation needs to be violent like the sun s blinding light to arrest attention and keep it taut as it were long enough for the system to acquire a respectful attitude and grow predisposed to resume it A repetition of that sensation will thereafter meet with a prepared response which we call recognition the concomitants of the old experience will form themselves afresh about the new one and by their convergence give it a sort of welcome and interpretation The movement for instance by which the face was raised toward the heavens was perhaps one element which added to the first sensation brightness a concomitant sensation height the brightness was not bright merely but high Now when the brightness reappears the face will more quickly be lifted up the place where the brightness shone will be looked for the brightness will have acquired a claim to be placed somewhere The heat which at the same moment may have burned the forehead will also be expected and when felt projected into the brightness which will now be hot as well as high So with whatever other sensations time may associate with this group They will all adhere to the original impression enriching it with an individuality which will render it before long a familiar complex in experience and one easy to recognise and to complete in idea Sidenote His primitive divinity In the case of so vivid a thing as the sun s brightness many other sensations beside those out of which science draws the qualities attributed to that heavenly body adhere in the primitive mind to the phenomenon Before he is a substance the sun is a god He is beneficent and necessary no less than bright and high he rises upon all happy opportunities and sets upon all terrors He is divine since all life and fruitfulness hang upon his miraculous revolutions His coming and going are life and death to the world As the sensations of light and heat are projected upward together to become attributes of his body so the feelings of pleasure safety and hope which he brings into the soul are projected into his spirit and to this spirit more than to anything else energy independence and substantiality are originally attributed The emotions felt in his presence being the ultimate issue and term of his effect in us the counterpart or shadow of those emotions is regarded as the first and deepest factor in his causality It is his divine life more than aught else that underlies his apparitions and explains the influences which he propagates The substance or independent existence attributed to objects is therefore by no means only or primarily a physical notion What is conceived to support the physical qualities is a pseudo psychic or vital force It is a moral and living object that we construct building it up out of all the materials emotional intellectual and sensuous which lie at hand in our consciousness to be synthesised into the hybrid reality which we are to fancy confronting us To discriminate and redistribute those miscellaneous physical and psychical elements and to divorce the god from the material sun is a much later problem arising at a different and more reflective stage in the Life of Reason Sidenote Causes and essences contrasted When reflection turning to the comprehension of a chaotic experience busies itself about recurrences when it seeks to normalise in some way things coming and going and to straighten out the causes of events that reflection is inevitably turned toward something dynamic and independent and can have no successful issue except in mechanical science When on the other hand reflection stops to challenge and question the fleeting object not so much to prepare for its possible return as to conceive its present nature this reflection is turned no less unmistakably in the direction of ideas and will terminate in logic or the morphology of being We attribute independence to things in order to normalise their recurrence We attribute essences to them in order to normalise their manifestations or constitution Independence will ultimately turn out to be an assumed constancy in material processes essence an assumed constancy in ideal meanings or points of reference in discourse The one marks the systematic distribution of objects the other their settled character Sidenote Voracity of intellect We talk of recurrent perceptions but materially considered no perception recurs Each recurrence is one of a finite series and holds for ever its place and number in that series Yet human attention while it can survey several simultaneous impressions and find them similar cannot keep them distinct if they grow too numerous The mind has a native bias and inveterate preference for form and identification Water does not run down hill more persistently than attention turns experience into constant terms The several repetitions of one essence given in consciousness will tend at once to be neglected and only the essence itself the character shared by those sundry perceptions will stand and become a term in mental discourse After a few strokes of the clock the reiterated impressions merge and cover one another we lose count and perceive the quality and rhythm but not the number of the sounds If this is true of so abstract and mathematical a perception as is counting how emphatically true must it be of continuous and infinitely varied perceptions flowing in from the whole spatial world Glimpses of the environment follow one another in quick succession like a regiment of soldiers in uniform only now and then does the stream take a new turn catch a new ray of sunlight or arrest our attention at some break The senses in their natural play revert constantly to familiar objects gaining impressions which differ but slightly from one another These slight differences are submerged in apperception so that sensation comes to be not so much an addition of new items to consciousness as a reburnishing there of some imbedded device Its character and relations are only slightly modified at each fresh rejuvenation To catch the passing phenomenon in all its novelty and idiosyncrasy is a work of artifice and curiosity Such an exercise does violence to intellectual instinct and involves an aesthetic power of diving bodily into the stream of sensation having thrown overboard all rational ballast and escaped at once the inertia and the momentum of practical life Normally every datum of sense is at once devoured by a hungry intellect and digested for the sake of its vital juices The result is that what ordinarily remains in memory is no representative of particular moments or shocks though sensation as in dreams may be incidentally recreated from within but rather a logical possession a sense of acquaintance with a certain field of reality in a word a consciousness of knowledge Sidenote Can the transcendent be known But what we may ask is this reality which we boast to know May not the sceptic justly contend that nothing is so unknown and indeed unknowable as this pretended object of knowledge The sensations which reason treats so cavalierly were at least something actual while they lasted and made good their momentary claim to our interest but what is this new ideal figment unseizable yet ever present invisible but indispensable unknowable yet alone interesting or important Strange that the only possible object or theme of our knowledge should be something we cannot know Sidenote Can the immediate be meant An answer these doubts will perhaps appear if we ask ourselves what sort of contact with reality would satisfy us and in what terms we expect or desire to possess the subject matter of our thoughts Is it simply corroboration that we look for Is it a verification of truth in sense It would be unreasonable in that case after all the evidence we demand has been gathered to complain that the ideal term thus concurrently suggested the super sensible substance reality or independent object does not itself descend into the arena of immediate sensuous presentation Knowledge is not eating and we cannot expect to devour and possess what we mean Knowledge is recognition of something absent it is a salutation not an embrace It is an advance on sensation precisely because it is representative The terms or goals of thought have for their function to subtend long tracts of sensuous experience to be ideal links between fact and fact invisible wires behind the scenes threads along which inference may run in making phenomena intelligible and controllable An idea that should become an image would cease to be ideal a principle that is to remain a principle can never become a fact A God that you could see with the eyes of the body a heaven you might climb into by a ladder planted at Bethel would be parts of this created and interpretable world not terms in its interpretation nor objects in a spiritual sphere Now external objects are thought to be principles and sources of experience they are accordingly conceived realities on an ideal plane We may look for all the evidence we choose before we declare our inference to be warranted but we must not ask for something more than evidence nor expect to know realities without inferring them anew They are revealed only to understanding We cannot cease to think and still continue to know Sidenote Is thought a bridge from sensation to sensation It may be said however that principles and external objects are interesting only because they symbolise further sensations that thought is an expedient of finite minds and that representation is a ghostly process which we crave to materialise into bodily possession We may grow sick of inferring truth and long rather to become reality Intelligence is after all no compulsory possession and while some of us would gladly have more of it others find that they already have too much The tension of thought distresses them and to represent what they cannot and would not be is not a natural function of their spirit To such minds experience that should merely corroborate ideas would prolong dissatisfaction The ideas must be realised they must pass into immediacy If reality a word employed generally in a eulogistic sense is to mean this desired immediacy no ideal of thought can be real All intelligible objects and the whole universe of mental discourse would then be an unreal and conventional structure impinging ultimately on sense from which it would derive its sole validity There would be no need of quarrelling with such a philosophy were not its use of words rather misleading Call experience in its existential and immediate aspect if you will the sole reality that will not prevent reality from having an ideal dimension The intellectual world will continue to give beauty meaning and scope to those bubbles of consciousness on which it is painted Reality would not be in that case what thought aspires to reach Consciousness is the least ideal of things when reason is taken out of it Reality would then need thought to give it all those human values of which in its substance it would have been wholly deprived and the ideal would still be what lent music to throbs and significance to being Sidenote Mens naturaliter platonica The equivocation favoured by such language at once begins to appear Is not thought with all its products a part of experience Must not sense if it be the only reality be sentient sometimes of the ideal What the site is to a city that is immediate experience to the universe of discourse The latter is all held materially within the limits defined by the former but if immediate experience be the seat of the moral world the moral world is the only interesting possession of immediate experience When a waste is built on however it is a violent paradox to call it still a waste and an immediate experience that represents the rest of sentience with all manner of ideal harmonies read into the whole in the act of representing it is an immediate experience raised to its highest power it is the Life of Reason In vain then will a philosophy of intellectual abstention limit so Platonic a term as reality to the immediate aspect of existence when it is the ideal aspect that endows existence with character and value together with representative scope and a certain lien upon eternity More legitimate therefore would be the assertion that knowledge reaches reality when it touches its ideal goal Reality is known when as in mathematics a stable and unequivocal object is developed by thinking The locus or material embodiment of such a reality is no longer in view these questions seem to the logician irrelevant If necessary ideas find no illustration in sense he deems the fact an argument against the importance and validity of sensation not in the least a disproof of his ideal knowledge If no site be found on earth for the Platonic city its constitution is none the less recorded and enshrined in heaven nor is that the only true ideal that has not where to lay its head What in the sensualistic or mystical system was called reality will now be termed appearance and what there figured as an imaginary construction borne by the conscious moment will now appear to be a prototype for all existence and an eternal standard for its estimation It is this rationalistic or Platonic system little as most men may suspect the fact that finds a first expression in ordinary perception When you distinguish your sensations from their cause and laugh at the idealist as this kind of sceptic is called who says that chairs and tables exist only in your mind you are treating a figment of reason as a deeper and truer thing than the moments of life whose blind experience that reason has come to illumine What you call the evidence of sense is pure confidence in reason You will not be so idiotic as to make no inferences from your sensations you will not pin your faith so unimaginatively on momentary appearance as to deny that the world exists when you stop thinking about it You feel that your intellect has wider scope and has discovered many a thing that goes on behind the scenes many a secret that would escape a stupid and gaping observation It is the fool that looks to look and stops at the barely visible you not only look but see for you understand Sidenote Identity and independence predicated of things Now the practical burden of such understanding if you take the trouble to analyse it will turn out to be what the sceptic says it is assurance of eventual sensations But as these sensations in memory and expectation are numerous and indefinitely variable you are not able to hold them clearly before the mind indeed the realisation of all the potentialities which you vaguely feel to lie in the future is a task absolutely beyond imagination Yet your present impressions dependent as they are on your chance attitude and disposition and on a thousand trivial accidents are far from representing adequately all that might be discovered or that is actually known about the object before you This object then to your apprehension is not identical with any of the sensations that reveal it nor is it exhausted by all these sensations when they are added together yet it contains nothing assignable but what they might conceivably reveal As it lies in your fancy then this object the reality is a complex and elusive entity the sum at once and the residuum of all particular impressions which underlying the present one have bequeathed to it their surviving linkage in discourse and consequently endowed it with a large part of its present character With this hybrid object sensuous in its materials and ideal in its locus each particular glimpse is compared and is recognised to be but a glimpse an aspect which the object presents to a particular observer Here are two identifications In the first place various sensations and felt relations which cannot be kept distinct in the mind fall together into one term of discourse represented by a sign a word or a more or less complete sensuous image In the second place the new perception is referred to that ideal entity of which it is now called a manifestation and effect Such are the primary relations of reality and appearance A reality is a term of discourse based on a psychic complex of memories associations and expectations but constituted in its ideal independence by the assertive energy of thought An appearance is a passing sensation recognised as belonging to that group of which the object itself is the ideal representative and accordingly regarded as a manifestation of that object Thus the notion of an independent and permanent world is an ideal term used to mark and as it were to justify the cohesion in space and the recurrence in time of recognisable groups of sensations This coherence and recurrence force the intellect if it would master experience at all or understand anything to frame the idea of such a reality If we wish to defend the use of such an idea and prove to ourselves its necessity all we need do is to point to that coherence and recurrence in external phenomena That brave effort and flight of intelligence which in the beginning raised man to the conception of reality enabling him to discount and interpret appearance will if we retain our trust in reason raise us continually anew to that same idea by a no less spontaneous and victorious movement of thought CHAPTER IV ON SOME CRITICS OF THIS DISCOVERY Sidenote Psychology as a solvent The English psychologists who first disintegrated the idea of substance and whose traces we have in general followed in the above account did not study the question wholly for its own sake or in the spirit of a science that aims at nothing but a historical analysis of mind They had a more or less malicious purpose behind their psychology They thought that if they could once show how metaphysical ideas are made they would discredit those ideas and banish them for ever from the world If they retained confidence in any notion as Hobbes in body Locke in matter and in God Berkeley in spirits and Kant the inheritor of this malicious psychology in the thing in itself and in heaven it was merely by inadvertence or want of courage The principle of their reasoning where they chose to apply it was always this that ideas whose materials could all be accounted for in consciousness and referred to sense or to the operations of mind were thereby exhausted and deprived of further validity Only the unaccountable or rather the uncriticised could be true Consequently the advance of psychology meant in this school the retreat of reason for as one notion after another was clarified and reduced to its elements it was ipso facto deprived of its function So far were these philosophers from conceiving that validity and truth are ideal relations accruing to ideas by virtue of dialectic and use that while on the one hand they pointed out vital affinities and pragmatic sanctions in the mind s economy they confessed on the other that the outcome of their philosophy was sceptical for no idea could be found in the mind which was not a phenomenon there and no inference could be drawn from these phenomena not based on some inherent tendency to feign The analysis which was in truth legitimising and purifying knowledge seemed to them absolutely to blast it and the closer they came to the bed rock of experience the more incapable they felt of building up anything upon it Self knowledge meant they fancied self detection the representative value of thought decreased as thought grew in scope and elaboration It became impossible to be at once quite serious and quite intelligent for to use reason was to indulge in subjective fiction while conscientiously to abstain from using it was to sink back upon inarticulate and brutish instinct In Hume this sophistication was frankly avowed Philosophy discredited itself but a man of parts who loved intellectual games even better than backgammon might take a hand with the wits and historians of his day until the clock struck twelve and the party was over Even in Kant though the mood was more cramped and earnest the mystical sophistication was quite the same Kant too imagined that the bottom had been knocked out of the world that in comparison with some unutterable sort of truth empirical truth was falsehood and that validity for all possible experience was weak validity in comparison with validity of some other and unmentionable sort Since space and time could not repel the accusation of being the necessary forms of perception space and time were not to be much thought of and when the sad truth was disclosed that causality and the categories were instruments by which the idea of nature had to be constructed if such an idea was to exist at all then nature and causality shrivelled up and were dishonoured together so that the soul s occupation being gone she must needs appeal to some mysterious oracle some abstract and irrelevant omen within the breast and muster up all the stern courage of an accepted despair to carry her through this world of mathematical illusion into some green and infantile paradise beyond Sidenote Misconceived role of intelligence What idea we may well ask ourselves did these modern philosophers entertain regarding the pretensions of ancient and mediaeval metaphysics What understanding had they of the spirit in which the natural organs of reason had been exercised and developed in those schools Frankly very little for they accepted from ancient philosophy and from common sense the distinction between reality and appearance but they forgot the function of that distinction and dislocated its meaning which was nothing but to translate the chaos of perception into the regular play of stable natures and objects congenial to discursive thought and valid in the art of living Philosophy had been the natural science of perception raised to the reflective plane the objects maintaining themselves on this higher plane being styled realities and those still floundering below it being called appearances or mere ideas The function of envisaging reality ever since Parmenides and Heraclitus had been universally attributed to the intellect When the moderns therefore proved anew that it was the mind that framed that idea and that what we call reality substance nature or God can be reached only by an operation of reason they made no very novel or damaging discovery Of course it is possible to disregard the suggestions of reason in any particular case and it is quite possible to believe for instance that the hypothesis of an external material world is an erroneous one But that this hypothesis is erroneous does not follow from the fact that it is a hypothesis To discard it on that ground would be to discard all reasoned knowledge and to deny altogether the validity of thought If intelligence is assumed to be an organ of cognition and a vehicle for truth a given hypothesis about the causes of perception can only be discarded when a better hypothesis on the same subject has been supplied To be better such a hypothesis would have to meet the multiplicity of phenomena and their mutations with a more intelligible scheme of comprehension and a more useful instrument of control Sidenote All criticism dogmatic Scepticism is always possible while it is partial It will remain the privilege and resource of a free mind that has elasticity enough to disintegrate its own formations and to approach its experience from a variety of sides and with more than a single method But the method chosen must be coherent in itself and the point of view assumed must be adhered to during that survey so that whatever reconstruction the novel view may produce in science will be science still and will involve assumptions and dogmas which must challenge comparison with the dogmas and assumptions they would supplant People speak of dogmatism as if it were a method to be altogether outgrown and something for which some non assertive philosophy could furnish a substitute But dogmatism is merely a matter of degree Some thinkers and some systems retreat further than others into the stratum beneath current conventions and make us more conscious of the complex machinery which working silently in the soul makes possible all the rapid and facile operations of reason The deeper this retrospective glance the less dogmatic the philosophy A primordial constitution or tendency however must always remain having structure and involving a definite life for if we thought to reach some wholly vacant and indeterminate point of origin we should have reached something wholly impotent and indifferent a blank pregnant with nothing that we wished to explain or that actual experience presented When starting with the inevitable preformation and constitutional bias we sought to build up a simpler and nobler edifice of thought to be a palace and fortress rather than a prison for experience our critical philosophy would still be dogmatic since it would be built upon inexplicable but actual data by a process of inference underived but inevitable Sidenote A choice of hypotheses No doubt Aristotle and the scholastics were often uncritical They were too intent on building up and buttressing their system on the broad human or religious foundations which they had chosen for it They nursed the comfortable conviction that whatever their thought contained was eternal and objective truth a copy of the divine intellect or of the world s intelligible structure A sceptic may easily deride that confidence of theirs their system may have been their system and nothing more But the way to proceed if we wish to turn our shrewd suspicions and our sense of insecurity into an articulate conviction and to prove that they erred is to build another system a more modest one perhaps which will grow more spontaneously and inevitably in the mind out of the data of experience Obviously the rival and critical theory will make the same tacit claim as the other to absolute validity If all our ideas and perceptions conspire to reinforce the new hypothesis this will become inevitable and necessary to us We shall then condemn the other hypothesis not indeed for having been a hypothesis which is the common fate of all rational and interpretative thought but for having been a hypothesis artificial misleading and false one not following necessarily nor intelligibly out of the facts nor leading to a satisfactory reaction upon them either in contemplation or in practice Sidenote Critics disguised enthusiasts Now this is in truth exactly the conviction which those malicious psychologists secretly harboured Their critical scruples and transcendental qualms covered a robust rebellion against being fooled by authority They rose to abate abuses among which as Hobbes said the frequency of insignificant speech is one Their psychology was not merely a cathartic but a gospel Their young criticism was sent into the world to make straight the path of a new positivism as now in its old age it is invoked to keep open the door to superstition Some of those reformers like Hobbes and Locke had at heart the interests of a physical and political mechanism which they wished to substitute for the cumbrous and irritating constraints of tradition Their criticism stopped at the frontiers of their practical discontent they did not care to ask how the belief in matter space motion God or whatever else still retained their allegiance could withstand the kind of psychology which as they conceived had done away with individual essences and nominal powers Berkeley whose interests lay in a different quarter used the same critical method in support of a different dogmatism armed with the traditional pietistic theory of Providence he undertook with a light heart to demolish the whole edifice which reason and science had built upon spatial perception He wished the lay intellect to revert to a pious idiocy in the presence of Nature lest consideration of her history and laws should breed mathematical atheists and the outer world being thus reduced to a sensuous dream and to the blur of immediate feeling intelligence and practical faith would be more unremittingly employed upon Christian mythology Men would be bound to it by a necessary allegiance there being no longer any rival object left for serious or intelligent consideration The psychological analysis on which these partial or total negations were founded was in a general way admirable the necessary artifices to which it had recourse in distinguishing simple and complex ideas principles of association and inference were nothing but premonitions of what a physiological psychology would do in referring the mental process to its organic and external supports for experience has no other divisions than those it creates in itself by distinguishing its objects and its organs Reference to external conditions though seldom explicit in these writers who imagined they could appeal to an introspection not revealing the external world was pervasive in them as for instance where Hume made his fundamental distinction between impressions and ideas where the discrimination was based nominally on relative vividness and priority in time but really on causation respectively by outer objects or by spontaneous processes in the brain Sidenote Hume s gratuitous scepticism Hume it was who carried this psychological analysis to its goal giving it greater simplicity and universal scope and he had also the further advantage of not nursing any metaphysical changeling of his own to substitute for the legitimate offspring of human understanding His curiosity was purer and his scepticism more impartial so that he laid bare the natural habits and necessary fictions of thought with singular lucidity and sufficient accuracy for general purposes But the malice of a psychology intended as a weapon against superstition here recoils on science itself Hume like Berkeley was extremely young scarce five and twenty when he wrote his most incisive work he was not ready to propose in theory that test of ideas by their utility which in practice he and the whole English school have instinctively adopted An ulterior test of validity would not have seemed to him satisfactory for though inclined to rebellion and positivism he was still the pupil of that mythical philosophy which attributed the value of things to their origin rather than to their uses because it had first in its parabolic way erected the highest good into a First Cause Still breathing in spite of himself this atmosphere of materialised Platonism Hume could not discover the true origin of anything without imagining that he had destroyed its value A natural child meant for him an illegitimate one his philosophy had not yet reached the wisdom of that French lady who asked if all children were not natural The outcome of his psychology and criticism seemed accordingly to be an inhibition of reason he was left free to choose between the distractions of backgammon and sitting down in a forlorn scepticism In his first youth while disintegrating reflection still overpowered the active interests of his mind Hume seems to have had some moments of genuine suspense and doubt but with years and prosperity the normal habits of inference which he had so acutely analysed asserted themselves in his own person and he yielded to the tendency to feign so far at least as to believe languidly in the histories he wrote the compliments he received and the succulent dinners he devoured There is a kind of courtesy in scepticism It would be an offence against polite conventions to press our doubts too far and question the permanence of our estates our neighbours independent existence or even the justification of a good bishop s faith and income Against metaphysicians and even against bishops sarcasm was not without its savour but the line must be drawn somewhere by a gentleman and a man of the world Hume found no obstacle in his speculations to the adoption of all necessary and useful conceptions in the sphere to which he limited his mature interests That he never extended this liberty to believe into more speculative and comprehensive regions was due simply to a voluntary superficiality in his thought Had he been interested in the rationality of things he would have laboured to discover it as he laboured to discover that historical truth or that political utility to which his interests happened to attach Sidenote Kant s substitute for knowledge Kant like Berkeley had a private mysticism in reserve to raise upon the ruins of science and common sense Knowledge was to be removed to make way for faith This task is ambiguous and the equivocation involved in it is perhaps the deepest of those confusions with which German metaphysics has since struggled and which have made it waver between the deepest introspection and the dreariest mythology To substitute faith for knowledge might mean to teach the intellect humility to make it aware of its theoretic and transitive function as a faculty for hypothesis and rational fiction building a bridge of methodical inferences and ideal unities between fact and fact between endeavour and satisfaction It might be to remind us sprinkling over us as it were the Lenten ashes of an intellectual contrition that our thoughts are air even as our bodies are dust momentary vehicles and products of an immortal vitality in God and in nature which fosters and illumines us for a moment before it lapses into other forms Had Kant proposed to humble and concentrate into a practical faith the same natural ideas which had previously been taken for absolute knowledge his intention would have been innocent his conclusions wise and his analysis free from venom and arriere pensee Man because of his finite and propulsive nature and because he is a pilgrim and a traveller throughout his life is obliged to have faith the absent the hidden the eventual is the necessary object of his concern But what else shall his faith rest in except in what the necessary forms of his perception present to him and what the indispensable categories of his understanding help him to conceive What possible objects are there for faith except objects of a possible experience What else should a practical and moral philosophy concern itself with except the governance and betterment of the real world It is surely by using his only possible forms of perception and his inevitable categories of understanding that man may yet learn as he has partly learned already to live and prosper in the universe Had Kant s criticism amounted simply to such a confession of the tentative practical and hypothetical nature of human reason it would have been wholly acceptable to the wise and its appeal to faith would have been nothing but an expression of natural vitality and courage just as its criticism of knowledge would have been nothing but a better acquaintance with self This faith would have called the forces of impulse and passion to reason s support not to its betrayal Faith would have meant faith in the intellect a faith naturally expressing man s practical and ideal nature and the only faith yet sanctioned by its fruits Sidenote False subjectivity attributed to reason Side by side with this reinstatement of reason however which was not absent from Kant s system in its critical phase and in its application to science there lurked in his substitution of faith for knowledge another and sinister intention He wished to blast as insignificant because subjective the whole structure of human intelligence with all the lessons of experience and all the triumphs of human skill and to attach absolute validity instead to certain echoes of his rigoristic religious education These notions were surely just as subjective and far more local and transitory than the common machinery of thought and it was actually proclaimed to be an evidence of their sublimity that they remained entirely without practical sanction in the form of success or of happiness The categorical imperative was a shadow of the ten commandments the postulates of practical reason were the minimal tenets of the most abstract Protestantism These fossils found unaccountably imbedded in the old man s mind he regarded as the evidences of an inward but supernatural revelation Sidenote Chimerical reconstruction Only the quaint severity of Kant s education and character can make intelligible to us the restraint he exercised in making supernatural postulates All he asserted was his inscrutable moral imperative and a God to reward with the pleasures of the next world those who had been Puritans in this But the same principle could obviously be applied to other cherished imaginations there is no superstition which it might not justify in the eyes of men accustomed to see in that superstition the sanction of their morality For the practical proofs of freedom immortality and Providence of which all evidence in reason or experience had previously been denied exceed in perfunctory sophistry anything that can be imagined Yet this lamentable epilogue was in truth the guiding thought of the whole investigation Nature had been proved a figment of human imagination so that once rid of all but a mock allegiance to her facts and laws we might be free to invent any world we chose and believe it to be absolutely real and independent of our nature Strange prepossession that while part of human life and mind was to be an avenue to reality and to put men in relation to external and eternal things the whole of human life and mind should not be able to do so Conceptions rooted in the very elements of our being in our senses intellect and imagination which had shaped themselves through many generations under a constant fire of observation and disillusion these were to be called subjective not only in the sense in which all knowledge must obviously be so since it is knowledge that someone possesses and has gained but subjective in a disparaging sense and in contrast to some better form of knowledge But what better form of knowledge is this If it be a knowledge of things as they really are and not as they appear we must remember that reality means what the intellect infers from the data of sense and yet the principles of such inference by which the distinction between appearance and reality is first instituted are precisely the principles now to be discarded as subjective and of merely empirical validity Merely empirical is a vicious phrase what is other than empirical is less than empirical and what is not relative to eventual experience is something given only in present fancy The gods of genuine religion for instance are terms in a continual experience the pure in heart may see God If the better and less subjective principle be said to be the moral law we must remember that the moral law which has practical importance and true dignity deals with facts and forces of the natural world that it expresses interests and aspirations in which man s fate in time and space with his pains pleasures and all other empirical feelings is concerned This was not the moral law to which Kant appealed for this is a part of the warp and woof of nature His moral law was a personal superstition irrelevant to the impulse and need of the world His notions of the supernatural were those of his sect and generation and did not pass to his more influential disciples what was transmitted was simply the contempt for sense and understanding and the practice authorised by his modest example of building air castles in the great clearing which the Critique was supposed to have made It is noticeable in the series of philosophers from Hobbes to Kant that as the metaphysical residuum diminished the critical and psychological machinery increased in volume and value In Hobbes and Locke with the beginnings of empirical psychology there is mixed an abstract materialism in Berkeley with an extension of analytic criticism a popular and childlike theology entirely without rational development in Hume with a completed survey of human habits of ideation a withdrawal into practical conventions and in Kant with the conception of the creative understanding firmly grasped and elaborately worked out a flight from the natural world altogether Sidenote The Critique a word on mental architecture The Critique in spite of some artificialities and pedantries in arrangement presented a conception never before attained of the rich architecture of reason It revealed the intricate organisation comparable to that of the body possessed by that fine web of intentions and counter intentions whose pulsations are our thoughts The dynamic logic of intelligence was laid bare and the hierarchy of ideas if not always correctly traced was at least manifested in its principle It was as great an enlargement of Hume s work as Hume s had been of Locke s or Locke s of Hobbes s And the very fact that the metaphysical residuum practically disappeared for the weak reconstruction in the second Critique may be dismissed as irrelevant renders the work essentially valid essentially a description of something real It is therefore a great source of instruction and a good compendium or store house for the problems of mind But the work has been much overestimated It is the product of a confused though laborious mind It contains contradictions not merely incidental such as any great novel work must retain since no man can at once remodel his whole vocabulary and opinions but contradictions absolutely fundamental and inexcusable like that between the transcendental function of intellect and its limited authority or that between the efficacy of things in themselves and their unknowability Kant s assumptions and his conclusions his superstitions and his wisdom alternate without neutralising each other Sidenote Incoherences That experience is a product of two factors is an assumption made by Kant It rests on a psychological analogy namely on the fact that organ and stimulus are both necessary to sensation That experience is the substance or matter of nature which is a construction in thought is Kant s conclusion based on intrinsic logical analysis Here experience is evidently viewed as something uncaused and without conditions being itself the source and condition of all thinkable objects The relation between the transcendental function of experience and its empirical causes Kant never understood The transcendentalism which if we have it at all must be fundamental he made derivative and the realism which must then be derivative he made absolute Therefore his metaphysics remained fabulous and his idealism sceptical or malicious Ask what can be meant by conditions of experience and Kant s bewildering puzzle solves itself at the word Condition like cause is a term that covers a confusion between dialectical and natural connections The conditions of experience in the dialectical sense are the characteristics a thing must have to deserve the name of experience in other words its conditions are its nominal essence If experience be used in a loose sense to mean any given fact or consciousness in general the condition of experience is merely immediacy If it be used as it often is in empirical writers for the shock of sense its conditions are two a sensitive organ and an object capable of stimulating it If finally experience be given its highest and most pregnant import and mean a fund of knowledge gathered by living the condition of experience is intelligence Taking the word in this last sense Kant showed in a confused but essentially conclusive fashion that only by the application of categories to immediate data could knowledge of an ordered universe arise or in other language that knowledge is a vista that it has a perspective since it is the presence to a given thought of a diffused and articulated landscape The categories are the principles of interpretation by which the flat datum acquires this perspective in thought and becomes representative of a whole system of successive or collateral existences The circumstance that experience in the second sense is a term reserved for what has certain natural conditions namely for the spark flying from the contact of stimulus and organ led Kant to shift his point of view and to talk half the time about conditions in the sense of natural causes or needful antecedents Intelligence is not an antecedent of thought and knowledge but their character and logical energy Synthesis is not a natural but only a dialectical condition of pregnant experience it does not introduce such experience but constitutes it Nevertheless the whole skeleton and dialectical mould of experience came to figure in Kant s mythology as machinery behind the scenes as a system of non natural efficient forces as a partner in a marriage the issue of which was human thought The idea could thus suggest itself favoured also by remembering inopportunely the actual psychological situation that all experience in every sense of the word had supernatural antecedents and that the dialectical conditions of experience in the highest sense were efficient conditions of experience in the lowest Sidenote Nature the true system of conditions It is hardly necessary to observe that absolute experience can have no natural conditions Existence in the abstract can have no cause for every real condition would have to be a factor in absolute experience and every cause would be something existent Of course there is a modest and non exhaustive experience that is any particular sensation thought or life which it would be preposterous to deny was subject to natural conditions Saint Lawrence s experience of being roasted for instance had conditions some of them were the fire the decree of the court and his own stalwart Christianity But these conditions are other parts or objects of conceivable experience which as we have learned fall into a system with the part we say they condition In our groping and inferential thought one part may become a ground for expecting or supposing the other Nature is then the sum total of its own conditions the whole object the parts observed plus the parts interpolated is the self existent fact The mind in its empirical flux is a part of this complex to say it is its own condition or that of the other objects is a grotesque falsehood A babe s casual sensation of light is a condition neither of his own existence nor of his mother s The true conditions are those other parts of the world without which as we find by experience sensations of light do not appear Had Kant been trained in a better school of philosophy he might have felt that the phrase subjective conditions is a contradiction in terms When we find ourselves compelled to go behind the actual and imagine something antecedent or latent to pave the way for it we are ipso facto conceiving the potential that is the objective world All antecedents by transcendental necessity are therefore objective and all conditions natural An imagined potentiality that holds together the episodes which are actual in consciousness is the very definition of an object or thing Nature is the sum total of things potentially observable some observed actually others interpolated hypothetically and common sense is right as against Kant s subjectivism in regarding nature as the condition of mind and not mind as the condition of nature This is not to say that experience and feeling are not the only given existence from which the material part of nature something essentially dynamic and potential must be intelligently inferred But are not conditions inferred Are they not in their deepest essence potentialities and powers Kant s fabled conditions also are inferred but they are inferred illegitimately since the subjective ones are dialectical characters turned into antecedents while the thing in itself is a natural object without a natural function Experience alone being given it is the ground from which its conditions are inferred its conditions therefore are empirical The secondary position of nature goes with the secondary position of all causes objects conditions and ideals To have made the conditions of experience metaphysical and prior in the order of knowledge to experience itself was simply a piece of surviving Platonism The form was hypostasised into an agent and mythical machinery was imagined to impress that form on whatever happened to have it All this was opposed to Kant s own discovery and to his critical doctrine which showed that the world which is the complex of those conditions which experience assigns to itself as it develops and progresses in knowledge is not before experience in the order of knowledge but after it His fundamental oversight and contradiction lay in not seeing that the concept of a set of conditions was the precise and exact concept of nature which he consequently reduplicated having one nature before experience and another after The first thus became mythical and the second illusory for the first said to condition experience was a set of verbal ghosts while the second which alone could be observed or discovered scientifically was declared fictitious The truth is that the single nature or set of conditions for experience which the intellect constructs is the object of our thoughts and perceptions ideally completed This is neither mythical nor illusory It is strictly speaking in its system and in many of its parts hypothetical but the hypothesis is absolutely safe At whatever point we test it we find the experience we expect and the inferences thence made by the intellect are verified in sense at every moment of existence Sidenote Artificial pathos in subjectivism The ambiguity in Kant s doctrine makes him a confusing representative of that criticism of perception which malicious psychology has to offer When the mind has made its great discovery when it has recognised independent objects and thus taken a first step in its rational life we need to know unequivocally whether this step is a false or a true one If it be false reason is itself misleading since a hypothesis indispensable in the intellectual mastery of experience is a false hypothesis and the detail of experience has no substructure Now Kant s answer was that the discovery of objects was a true and valid discovery in the field of experience there were scientifically speaking causes for perception which could be inferred from perception by thought But this inference was not true absolutely or metaphysically because there was a real world beyond possible experience and there were oracles not intellectual by which knowledge of that unrealisable world might be obtained This mysticism undid the intellectualism which characterised Kant s system in its scientific and empirical application so that the justification for the use of such categories as that of cause and substance categories by which the idea of reality is constituted was invalidated by the counter assertion that empirical reality was not true reality but being an object reached by inferential thought was merely an idea Nor was the true reality appearance itself in its crude immediacy as sceptics would think it was a realm of objects present to a supposed intuitive thought that is to a non inferential inference or non discursive discourse So that while Kant insisted on the point which hardly needed pressing that it is mind that discovers empirical reality by making inferences from the data of sense he admitted at the same time that such use of understanding is legitimate and even necessary and that the idea of nature so framed his empirical truth There remained however a sense that this empirical truth was somehow insufficient and illusory Understanding was a superficial faculty and we might by other and oracular methods arrive at a reality that was not empirical Why any reality such as God for instance should not be just as empirical as the other side of the moon if experience suggested it and reason discovered it or why if not suggested by experience and discovered by reason anything should be called a reality at all or should hold for a moment a man s waking attention that is what Kant never tells us and never himself knew Clearer upon this question of perception is the position of Berkeley we may therefore take him as a fair representative of those critics who seek to invalidate the discovery of material objects Sidenote Berkeley s algebra of perception Our ideas said Berkeley were in our minds the material world was patched together out of our ideas it therefore existed only in our minds To the suggestion that the idea of the external world is of course in our minds but that our minds have constructed it by treating sensations as effects of a permanent substance distributed in a permanent space he would reply that this means nothing because substance permanence and space are non existent ideas i e they are not images in sense They might however be notions like that of spirit which Berkeley ingenuously admitted into his system to be mysteriously enough that which has ideas Or they might be what would do just as well for our purpose that which he elsewhere called them algebraic signs used to facilitate the operations of thought This is indeed what they are if we take the word algebraic in a loose enough sense They are like algebraic signs in being in respect of their object or signification not concrete images but terms in a mental process elements in a method of inference Why then denounce them They could be used with all confidence to lead us back to the concrete values for which they stood and to the relations which they enabled us to state and discover Experience would thus be furnished with an intelligible structure and articulation and a psychological analysis would be made of knowledge into its sensuous material and its ideal objects What then was Berkeley s objection to these algebraic methods of inference and to the notions of space matter independent existence and efficient causality which these methods involve Sidenote Horror of physics What he abhorred was the belief that such methods of interpreting experience were ultimate and truly valid and that by thinking after the fashion of mathematical atheists we could understand experience as well as it can be understood If the flux of ideas had no other key to it than that system of associations and algebraic substitutions which is called the natural world we should indeed know just as well what to expect in practice and should receive the same education in perception and reflection but what difference would there be between such an idealist and the most pestilential materialist save his even greater wariness and scepticism Berkeley at this time long before days of Siris and tar water was too ignorant and hasty to understand how inane all spiritual or poetic ideals would be did they not express man s tragic dependence on nature and his congruous development in her bosom He lived in an age when the study and dominion of external things no longer served directly spiritual uses The middle men had appeared those spirits in whom the pursuit of the true and the practical never leads to possession of the good but loses itself like a river in sand amid irrational habits and passions He was accordingly repelled by whatever philosophy was in him no less than by his religious prejudices from submergence in external interests and he could see no better way of vindicating the supremacy of moral goods than to deny the reality of matter the finality of science and the constructive powers of reason altogether With honest English empiricism he saw that science had nothing absolute or sacrosanct about it and rightly placed the value of theory in its humane uses but the complementary truth escaped him altogether that only the free and contemplative expression of reason of which science is a chief part can render anything else humane useful or practical He was accordingly a party man in philosophy where partisanship is treason and opposed the work of reason in the theoretical field hoping thus to advance it in the moral Sidenote Puerility in morals Of the moral field he had it need hardly be added a quite childish and perfunctory conception There the prayer book and the catechism could solve every problem He lacked the feeling possessed by all large and mature minds that there would be no intelligibility or value in things divine were they not interpretations and sublimations of things natural To master the real world was an ancient and not too promising ambition it suited his youthful radicalism better to exorcise or to cajole it He sought to refresh the world with a water spout of idealism as if to change the names of things could change their values Away with all arid investigation away with the cold algebra of sense and reason and let us have instead a direct conversation with heaven an unclouded vision of the purposes and goodness of God as if there were any other way of understanding the sources of human happiness than to study the ways of nature and man Converse with God has been the life of many a wiser and sadder philosopher than Berkeley but they like Plato for instance or Spinoza have made experience the subject as well as the language of that intercourse and have thus given the divine revelation some degree of pertinence and articulation Berkeley in his positive doctrine was satisfied with the vaguest generalities he made no effort to find out how the consciousness that God is the direct author of our incidental perceptions is to help us to deal with them what other insights and principles are to be substituted for those that disclose the economy of nature how the moral difficulties incident to an absolute providentialism are to be met or how the existence and influence of fellow minds is to be defended So that to a piety inspired by conventional theology and a psychology that refused to pass except grudgingly and unintelligently beyond the sensuous stratum Berkeley had nothing to add by way of philosophy An insignificant repetition of the truism that ideas are all in the mind constituted his total wisdom To be was to be perceived That was the great maxim by virtue of which we were asked if not to refrain from conceiving nature at all which was perhaps impossible at so late a stage in human development at least to refrain from regarding our necessary thoughts on nature as true or rational Intelligence was but a false method of imagination by which God trained us in action and thought for it was apparently impossible to endow us with a true method that would serve that end And what shall we think of the critical acumen or practical wisdom of a philosopher who dreamed of some other criterion of truth than necessary implication in thought and action Sidenote Truism and sophism In the melodramatic fashion so common in what is called philosophy we may delight ourselves with such flashes of lightning as this esse est percipi The truth of this paradox lies in the fact that through perception alone can we get at being a modest and familiar notion which makes as Plato s Theaetetus shows not a bad point of departure for a serious theory of knowledge The sophistical intent of it however is to deny our right to make a distinction which in fact we do make and which the speaker himself is making as he utters the phrase for he would not be so proud of himself if he thought he was thundering a tautology If a thing were never perceived or inferred from perception we should indeed never know that it existed but once perceived or inferred it may be more conducive to comprehension and practical competence to regard it as existing independently of our perception and our ability to make this supposition is registered in the difference between the two words to be and to be perceived words which are by no means synonymous but designate two very different relations of things in thought Such idealism at one fell swoop through a collapse of assertive intellect and a withdrawal of reason into self consciousness has the puzzling character of any clever pun that suspends the fancy between two incompatible but irresistible meanings The art of such sophistry is to choose for an axiom some ambiguous phrase which taken in one sense is a truism and taken in another is an absurdity and then by showing the truth of that truism to give out that the absurdity has also been proved It is a truism to say that I am the only seat or locus of my ideas and that whatever I know is known by me it is an absurdity to say that I am the only object of my thought and perception Sidenote Reality is the practical made intelligible To confuse the instrument with its function and the operation with its meaning has been a persistent foible in modern philosophy It could thus come about that the function of intelligence should be altogether misconceived and in consequence denied when it was discovered that figments of reason could never become elements of sense but must always remain as of course they should ideal and regulative objects and therefore objects to which a practical and energetic intellect will tend to give the name of realities Matter is a reality to the practical intellect because it is a necessary and ideal term in the mastery of experience while negligible sensations like dreams are called illusions by the same authority because though actual enough while they last they have no sustained function and no right to practical dominion Let us imagine Berkeley addressing himself to that infant or animal consciousness which first used the category of substance and passed from its perceptions to the notion of an independent thing Beware my child he would have said you are taking a dangerous step one which may hereafter produce a multitude of mathematical atheists not to speak of cloisterfuls of scholastic triflers Your ideas can exist only in your mind if you suffer yourself to imagine them materialised in mid air and subsisting when you do not perceive them you will commit a great impiety If you unthinkingly believe that when you shut your eyes the world continues to exist until you open them again you will inevitably be hurried into an infinity of metaphysical quibbles about the discrete and the continuous and you will be so bewildered and deafened by perpetual controversies that the clear light of the gospel will be extinguished in your soul But that tender Peripatetic might answer I cannot forget the things about me when I shut my eyes I know and almost feel their persistent presence and I always find them again upon trial just as they were before or just in that condition to which the operation of natural causes would have brought them in my absence If I believe they remain and suffer steady and imperceptible transformation I know what to expect and the event does not deceive me but if I had to resolve upon action before knowing whether the conditions for action were to exist or no I should never understand what sort of a world I lived in Ah my child the good Bishop would reply you misunderstand me You may indeed nay you must live and think as if everything remained independently real That is part of your education for heaven which God in his goodness provides for you in this life He will send into your soul at every moment the impressions needed to verify your necessary hypotheses and support your humble and prudent expectations Only you must not attribute that constancy to the things themselves which is due to steadfastness in the designs of Providence Think and act as if a material world existed but do not for a moment believe it to exist Sidenote Vain realities and trustworthy fictions With this advice coming reassuringly from the combined forces of scepticism and religion we may leave the embryonic mind to its own devices satisfied that even according to the most malicious psychologists its first step toward the comprehension of experience is one it may congratulate itself on having taken and which for the present at least it is not called upon to retrace The Life of Reason is not concerned with speculation about unthinkable and gratuitous realities it seeks merely to attain those conceptions which are necessary and appropriate to man in his acting and thinking The first among these underlying all arts and philosophies alike is the indispensable conception of permanent external objects forming in their congeries shifts and secret animation the system and life of nature NOTE There is a larger question raised by Berkeley s arguments which I have not attempted to discuss here namely whether knowledge is possible at all and whether any mental representation can be supposed to inform us about anything Berkeley of course assumed this power in that he continued to believe in God in other spirits in the continuity of experience and in its discoverable laws His objection to material objects therefore could not consistently be that they are objects of knowledge rather than absolute feelings exhausted by their momentary possession in consciousness It could only be that they are unthinkable and invalid objects in which the materials of sense are given a mode of existence inconsistent with their nature But if the only criticism to which material objects were obnoxious were a dialectical criticism such as that contained in Kant s antinomies the royal road to idealism coveted by Berkeley would be blocked to be an idea in the mind would not involve lack of cognitive and representative value in that idea The fact that material objects were represented or conceived would not of itself prove that they could not have a real existence It would be necessary to prove their unreality to study their nature and function and to compare them with such conceptions as those of Providence and a spirit world in order to determine their relative validity Such a critical comparison would have augured ill for Berkeley s prejudices what its result might have been we can see in Kant s Critique of Pure Reason In order to escape such evil omens and prevent the collapse of his mystical paradoxes Berkeley keeps in reserve a much more insidious weapon the sceptical doubt as to the representative character of anything mental the possible illusiveness of all knowledge This doubt he invokes in all those turns of thought and phrase in which he suggests that if an idea is in the mind it cannot have its counterpart elsewhere and that a given cognition exhausts and contains its object There are then two separate maxims in his philosophy one held consistently viz that nothing can be known which is different in character or nature from the object present to the thinking mind the other held incidentally and inconsistently since it is destructive of all predication and knowledge viz that nothing can exist beyond the mind which is similar in nature or character to the ideas within it or to put the same thing in other words that nothing can be revealed by an idea which is different from that idea in point of existence The first maxim does not contradict the existence of external objects in space the second contradicts every conception that the human mind can ever form the most airy no less than the grossest No idealist can go so far as to deny that his memory represents his past experience by inward similarity and conscious intention or if he prefers this language that the moments or aspects of the divine mind represent one another and their general system Else the idealist s philosophy itself would be an insignificant and momentary illusion CHAPTER V NATURE UNIFIED AND MIND DISCERNED Sidenote Man s feeble grasp of nature When the mind has learned to distinguish external objects and to attribute to them a constant size shape and potency in spite of the variety and intermittence ruling in direct experience there yet remains a great work to do before attaining a clear even if superficial view of the world An animal s customary habitat may have constant features and their relations in space may be learned by continuous exploration but probably many other landscapes are also within the range of memory and fancy that stand in no visible relation to the place in which we find ourselves at a given moment It is true that at this day we take it for granted that all real places as we call them lie in one space in which they hold definite geometric relations to one another and if we have glimpses of any region for which no room can be found in the single map of the universe which astronomy has drawn we unhesitatingly relegate that region to the land of dreams Since the Elysian Fields and the Coast of Bohemia have no assignable latitude and longitude we call these places imaginary even if in some dream we remember to have visited them and dwelt there with no less sense of reality than in this single and geometrical world of commerce It belongs to sanity and common sense as men now possess them to admit no countries unknown to geography and filling no part of the conventional space in three dimensions All our waking experience is understood to go on in some part of this space and no court of law would admit evidence relating to events in some other sphere This principle axiomatic as it has become is in no way primitive since primitive experience is sporadic and introduces us to detached scenes separated by lapses in our senses and attention These scenes do not hang together in any local contiguity To construct a chart of the world is a difficult feat of synthetic imagination not to be performed without speculative boldness and a heroic insensibility to the claims of fancy Even now most people live without topographical ideas and have no clear conception of the spatial relations that keep together the world in which they move They feel their daily way about like animals following a habitual scent without dominating the range of their instinctive wanderings Reality is rather a story to them than a system of objects and forces nor would they think themselves mad if at any time their experience should wander into a fourth dimension Vague dramatic and moral laws when they find any casual application seem to such dreaming minds more notable truths deeper revelations of efficacious reality than the mechanical necessities of the case which they scarcely conceive of and in this primordial prejudice they are confirmed by superstitious affinities often surviving in their religion and philosophy In the midst of cities and affairs they are like landsmen at sea incapable of an intellectual conception of their position nor have they any complete confidence in their principles of navigation They know the logarithms by rote merely and if they reflect are reduced to a stupid wonder and only half believe they are in a known universe or will ever reach an earthly port It would not require superhuman eloquence in some prophetic passenger to persuade them to throw compass and quadrant overboard and steer enthusiastically for El Dorado The theory of navigation is essentially as speculative as that of salvation only it has survived more experiences of the judgment and repeatedly brought those who trust in it to their promised land Sidenote Its unity ideal and discoverable only by steady thought The theory that all real objects and places lie together in one even and homogeneous space conceived as similar in its constitution to the parts of extension of which we have immediate intuition is a theory of the greatest practical importance and validity By its light we carry on all our affairs and the success of our action while we rely upon it is the best proof of its truth The imaginative parsimony and discipline which such a theory involves are balanced by the immense extension and certitude it gives to knowledge It is at once an act of allegiance to nature and a Magna Charta which mind imposes on the tyrannous world which in turn pledges itself before the assembled faculties of man not to exceed its constitutional privilege and to harbour no magic monsters in unattainable lairs from which they might issue to disturb human labours Yet that spontaneous intelligence which first enabled men to make this genial discovery and take so fundamental a step toward taming experience should not be laid by after this first victory it is a weapon needed in many subsequent conflicts To conceive that all nature makes one system is only a beginning the articulation of natural life has still to be discovered in detail and what is more a similar articulation has to be given to the psychic world which now by the very act that constitutes Nature and makes her consistent appears at her side or rather in her bosom That the unification of nature is eventual and theoretical is a point useful to remember else the relation of the natural world to poetry metaphysics and religion will never become intelligible Lalande or whoever it was who searched the heavens with his telescope and could find no God would not have found the human mind if he had searched the brain with a microscope Yet God existed in man s apprehension long before mathematics or even perhaps before the vault of heaven for the objectification of the whole mind with its passions and motives naturally precedes that abstraction by which the idea of a material world is drawn from the chaos of experience an abstraction which culminates in such atomic and astronomical theories as science is now familiar with The sense for life in things be they small or great is not derived from the abstract idea of their bodies but is an ancient concomitant to that idea inseparable from it until it became abstract Truth and materiality mechanism and ideal interests are collateral projections from one rolling experience which shows up one aspect or the other as it develops various functions and dominates itself to various ends When one ore is abstracted and purified the residuum subsists in that primeval quarry in which it originally lay The failure to find God among the stars or even the attempt to find him there does not indicate that human experience affords no avenue to the idea of God for history proves the contrary but indicates rather the atrophy in this particular man of the imaginative faculty by which his race had attained to that idea Such an atrophy might indeed become general and God would in that case disappear from human experience as music would disappear if universal deafness attacked the race Such an event is made conceivable by the loss of allied imaginative habits which is observable in historic times Yet possible variations in human faculty do not involve the illegitimacy of such faculties as actually subsist and the abstract world known to science unless it dries up the ancient fountains of ideation by its habitual presence in thought does not remove those parallel dramatisations or abstractions which experience may have suggested to men What enables men to perceive the unity of nature is the unification of their own wills A man half asleep without fixed purposes without intellectual keenness or joy in recognition might graze about like an animal forgetting each satisfaction in the next and banishing from his frivolous mind the memory of every sorrow what had just failed to kill him would leave him as thoughtless and unconcerned as if it had never crossed his path Such irrational elasticity and innocent improvidence would never put two and two together Every morning there would be a new world with the same fool to live in it But let some sobering passion some serious interest lend perspective to the mind and a point of reference will immediately be given for protracted observation then the laws of nature will begin to dawn upon thought Every experiment will become a lesson every event will be remembered as favourable or unfavourable to the master passion At first indeed this keen observation will probably be animistic and the laws discovered will be chiefly habits human or divine special favours or envious punishments and warnings But the same constancy of aim which discovers the dramatic conflicts composing society and tries to read nature in terms of passion will if it be long sustained discover behind this glorious chaos a deeper mechanical order Men s thoughts like the weather are not so arbitrary as they seem and the true master in observation the man guided by a steadfast and superior purpose will see them revolving about their centres in obedience to quite calculable instincts and the principle of all their flutterings will not be hidden from his eyes Belief in indeterminism is a sign of indetermination No commanding or steady intellect flirts with so miserable a possibility which in so far as it actually prevailed would make virtue impotent and experience in its pregnant sense impossible Sidenote Mind the erratic residue of existence We have said that those objects which cannot be incorporated into the one space which the understanding envisages are relegated to another sphere called imagination We reach here a most important corollary As material objects making a single system which fills space and evolves in time are conceived by abstraction from the flux of sensuous experience so pari passu the rest of experience with all its other outgrowths and concretions falls out with the physical world and forms the sphere of mind the sphere of memory fancy and the passions We have in this discrimination the genesis of mind not of course in the transcendental sense in which the word mind is extended to mean the sum total and mere fact of existence for mind so taken can have no origin and indeed no specific meaning but the genesis of mind as a determinate form of being a distinguishable part of the universe known to experience and discourse the mind that unravels itself in meditation inhabits animal bodies and is studied in psychology Mind in this proper sense of the word is the residue of existence the leavings so to speak and parings of experience when the material world has been cut out of the whole cloth Reflection underlines in the chaotic continuum of sense and longing those aspects that have practical significance it selects the efficacious ingredients in the world The trustworthy object which is thus retained in thought the complex of connected events is nature and though so intelligible an object is not soon nor vulgarly recognised because human reflection is perturbed and halting yet every forward step in scientific and practical knowledge is a step toward its clearer definition At first much parasitic matter clings to that dynamic skeleton Nature is drawn like a sponge heavy and dripping from the waters of sentience It is soaked with inefficacious passions and overlaid with idle accretions Nature in a word is at first conceived mythically dramatically and retains much of the unintelligible sporadic habit of animal experience itself But as attention awakes and discrimination practically inspired grows firm and stable irrelevant qualities are stripped off and the mechanical process the efficacious infallible order is clearly disclosed beneath Meantime the incidental effects the secondary qualities are relegated to a personal inconsequential region they constitute the realm of appearance the realm of mind Sidenote Ghostly character of mind Mind is therefore sometimes identified with the unreal We oppose in an antithesis natural to thought and language the imaginary to the true fancy to fact idea to thing But this thing fact or external reality is as we have seen a completion and hypostasis of certain portions of experience packed into such shapes as prove cogent in thought and practice The stuff of external reality the matter out of which its idea is made is therefore continuous with the stuff and matter of our own minds Their common substance is the immediate flux This living worm has propagated by fission and the two halves into which it has divided its life are mind and nature Mind has kept and clarified the crude appearance the dream the purpose that seethed in the mass nature has appropriated the order the constant conditions the causal substructure disclosed in reflection by which the immediate flux is explained and controlled The chemistry of thought has precipitated these contrasted terms each maintaining a recognisable identity and having the function of a point of reference for memory and will Some of these terms or objects of thought we call things and marshal in all their ideal stability for there is constancy in their motions and transformations to make the intelligible external world of practice and science Whatever stuff has not been absorbed in this construction whatever facts of sensation ideation or will do not coalesce with the newest conception of reality we then call the mind Raw experience then lies at the basis of the idea of nature and approves its reality while an equal reality belongs to the residue of experience not taken up as yet into that idea But this residual sensuous reality often seems comparatively unreal because what it presents is entirely without practical force apart from its mechanical associates This inconsequential character of what remains over follows of itself from the concretion of whatever is constant and efficacious into the external world If this fact is ever called in question it is only because the external world is vaguely conceived and loose wills and ideas are thought to govern it by magic Yet in many ways falling short of absolute precision people recognise that thought is not dynamic or as they call it not real The idea of the physical world is the first flower or thick cream of practical thinking Being skimmed off first and proving so nutritious it leaves the liquid below somewhat thin and unsavoury Especially does this result appear when science is still unpruned and mythical so that what passes into the idea of material nature is much more than the truly causal network of forces and includes many spiritual and moral functions The material world as conceived in the first instance had not that clear abstractness nor the spiritual world that wealth and interest which they have acquired for modern minds The complex reactions of man s soul had been objectified together with those visual and tactile sensations which reduced to a mathematical baldness now furnish terms to natural science Mind then dwelt in the world not only in the warmth and beauty with which it literally clothed material objects as it still does in poetic perception but in a literal animistic way for human passion and reflection were attributed to every object and made a fairy land of the world Poetry and religion discerned life in those very places in which sense and understanding perceived body and when so much of the burden of experience took wing into space and the soul herself floated almost visibly among the forms of nature it is no marvel that the poor remnant a mass of merely personal troubles an uninteresting distortion of things in individual minds should have seemed a sad and unsubstantial accident The inner world was all the more ghostly because the outer world was so much alive Sidenote Hypostasis and criticism both need control This movement of thought which clothed external objects in all the wealth of undeciphered dreams has long lost its momentum and yielded to a contrary tendency Just as the hypostasis of some terms in experience is sanctioned by reason when the objects so fixed and externalised can serve as causes and explanations for the order of events so the criticism which tends to retract that hypostasis is sanctioned by reason when the hypostasis has exceeded its function and the external object conceived is loaded with useless ornament The transcendental and functional secret of such hypostases however is seldom appreciated by the headlong mind so that the ebb no less than the flow of objectification goes on blindly and impulsively and is carried to absurd extremes An age of mythology yields to an age of subjectivity reason being equally neglected and exceeded in both The reaction against imagination has left the external world as represented in many minds stark and bare All the interesting and vital qualities which matter had once been endowed with have been attributed instead to an irresponsible sensibility in man And as habits of ideation change slowly and yield only piecemeal to criticism or to fresh intuitions such a revolution has not been carried out consistently but instead of a thorough renaming of things and a new organisation of thought it has produced chiefly distress and confusion Some phases of this confusion may perhaps repay a moment s attention they may enable us when seen in their logical sequence to understand somewhat better the hypostasising intellect that is trying to assert itself and come to the light through all these gropings Sidenote Comparative constancy in objects and in ideas What helps in the first place to disclose a permanent object is a permanent sensation There is a vast and clear difference between a floating and a fixed feeling the latter in normal circumstances is present only when continuous stimulation renews it at every moment Attention may wander but the objects in the environment do not cease to radiate their influences on the body which is thereby not allowed to lose the modification which those influences provoke The consequent perception is therefore always at hand and in its repetitions substantially identical Perceptions not renewed in this way by continuous stimulation come and go with cerebral currents they are rare visitors instead of being like external objects members of the household Intelligence is most at home in the ultimate which is the object of intent Those realities which it can trust and continually recover are its familiar and beloved companions The mists that may originally have divided it from them and which psychologists call the mind are gladly forgotten so soon as intelligence avails to pierce them and as friendly communication can be established with the real world Moreover perceptions not sustained by a constant external stimulus are apt to be greatly changed when they reappear and to be changed unaccountably whereas external things show some method and proportion in their variations Even when not much changed in themselves mere ideas fall into a new setting whereas things unless something else has intervened to move them reappear in their old places Finally things are acted upon by other men but thoughts are hidden from them by divine miracle Existence reveals reality when the flux discloses something permanent that dominates it What is thus dominated though it is the primary existence itself is thereby degraded to appearance Perceptions caused by external objects are as we have just seen long sustained in comparison with thoughts and fancies but the objects are themselves in flux and a man s relation to them may be even more variable so that very often a memory or a sentiment will recur almost unchanged in character long after the perception that first aroused it has become impossible The brain though mobile is subject to habit its formations while they lapse instantly return again and again These ideal objects may accordingly be in a way more real and enduring than things external Hence no primitive mind puts all reality or what is most real in reality in an abstract material universe It finds rather ideal points of reference by which material mutation itself seems to be controlled An ideal world is recognised from the beginning and placed not in the immediate foreground nearer than material things but much farther off It has greater substantiality and independence than material objects are credited with It is divine When agriculture commerce or manual crafts have given men some knowledge of nature the world thus recognised and dominated is far from seeming ultimate It is thought to lie between two others both now often called mental but in their original quality altogether disparate the world of spiritual forces and that of sensuous appearance The notions of permanence and independence by which material objects are conceived apply also of course to everything spiritual and while the dominion exercised by spirits may be somewhat precarious they are as remote as possible from immediacy and sensation They come and go they govern nature or if they neglect to do so it is from aversion or high indifference they visit man with obsessions and diseases they hasten to extricate him from difficulties and they dwell in him constituting his powers of conscience and invention Sense on the other hand is a mere effect either of body or spirit or of both in conjunction It gives a vitiated personal view of these realities Its pleasures are dangerous and unintelligent and it perishes as it goes Sidenote Spirit and sense defined by their relation to nature Such are for primitive apperception the three great realms of being nature sense and spirit Their frontiers however always remain uncertain Sense because it is insignificant when made an object is long neglected by reflection No attempt is made to describe its processes or ally them systematically to natural changes Its illusions when noticed are regarded as scandals calculated to foster scepticism The spiritual world is on the other hand a constant theme for poetry and speculation In the absence of ideal science it can be conceived only in myths which are naturally as shifting and self contradictory as they are persistent They acquire no fixed character until in dogmatic religion they are defined with reference to natural events foretold or reported Nature is what first acquires a form and then imparts form to the other spheres Sense admits definition and distribution only as an effect of nature and spirit only as its principle Sidenote Vague notions of nature involve vague notions of spirit The form nature acquires is however itself vague and uncertain and can ill serve for long ages to define the other realms which depend on it for definition Hence it has been common for instance to treat the spiritual as a remote or finer form of the natural Beyond the moon everything seemed permanent it was therefore called divine and declared to preside over the rest The breath that escaped from the lips at death since it took away with it the spiritual control and miraculous life that had quickened the flesh was itself the spirit On the other hand natural processes have been persistently attributed to spiritual causes for it was not matter that moved itself but intent that moved it Thus spirit was barbarously taken for a natural substance and a natural force It was identified with everything in which it was manifested so long as no natural causes could be assigned for that operation Sidenote Sense and spirit the life of nature which science redistributes but does not deny If the unification of nature were complete sense would evidently fall within it it is to subtend and sustain the sensible flux that intelligence acknowledges first stray material objects and then their general system The elements of experience not taken up into the constitution of objects remain attached to them as their life In the end the dynamic skeleton without losing its articulation would be clothed again with its flesh Suppose my notions of astronomy allowed me to believe that the sun sinking into the sea was extinguished every evening and that what appeared the next morning was his younger brother hatched in a sun producing nest to be found in the Eastern regions My theory would have robbed yesterday s sun of its life and brightness it would have asserted that during the night no sun existed anywhere but it would have added the sun s qualities afresh to a matter that did not previously possess them namely to the imagined egg that would produce a sun for to morrow Suppose we substitute for that astronomy the one that now prevails we have deprived the single sun which now exists and spreads its influences without interruption of its humanity and even of its metaphysical unity It has become a congeries of chemical substances The facts revealed to perception have partly changed their locus and been differently deployed throughout nature Some have become attached to operations in the human brain Nature has not thereby lost any quality she had ever manifested these have merely been redistributed so as to secure a more systematic connection between them all They are the materials of the system which has been conceived by making existences continuous whenever this extension of their being was needful to render their recurrences intelligible Sense which was formerly regarded as a sad distortion of its objects now becomes an original and congruent part of nature from which as from any other part the rest of nature might be scientifically inferred Spirit is not less closely attached to nature although in a different manner Taken existentially it is a part of sense taken ideally it is the form or value which nature acquires when viewed from the vantage ground of any interest Individual objects are recognisable for a time not because the flux is materially arrested but because it somewhere circulates in a fashion which awakens an interest and brings different parts of the surrounding process into definable and prolonged relations with that interest Particular objects may perish yet others may continue like the series of suns imagined by Heraclitus to perform the same office The function will outlast the particular organ That interest in reference to which the function is defined will essentially determine a perfect world of responsive extensions and conditions These ideals will be a spiritual reality and they will be expressed in nature in so far as nature supports that regulative interest Many a perfect and eternal realm merely potential in existence but definite in constitution will thus subtend nature and be what a rational philosophy might call the ideal What is called spirit would be the ideal in so far as it obtained expression in nature and the power attributed to spirit would be the part of nature s fertility by which such expression was secured CHAPTER VI DISCOVERY OF FELLOW MINDS Sidenote Another background for current experience may be found in alien minds When a ghostly sphere containing memory and all ideas has been distinguished from the material world it tends to grow at the expense of the latter until nature is finally reduced to a mathematical skeleton This skeleton itself but for the need of a bridge to connect calculably episode with episode in experience might be transferred to mind and identified with the scientific thought in which it is represented But a scientific theory inhabiting a few scattered moments of life cannot connect those episodes among which it is itself the last and the least substantial nor would such a notion have occurred even to the most reckless sceptic had the world not possessed another sort of reputed reality the minds of others which could serve even after the supposed extinction of the physical world to constitute an independent order and to absorb the potentialities of being when immediate consciousness nodded But other men s minds being themselves precarious and ineffectual would never have seemed a possible substitute for nature to be in her stead the background and intelligible object of experience Something constant omnipresent infinitely fertile is needed to support and connect the given chaos Just these properties however are actually attributed to one of the minds supposed to confront the thinker namely the mind of God The divine mind has therefore always constituted in philosophy either the alternative to nature or her other name it is par excellence the seat of all potentiality and as Spinoza said the refuge of all ignorance Speculative problems would be greatly clarified and what is genuine in them would be more easily distinguished from what is artificial if we could gather together again the original sources for the belief in separate minds and compare these sources with those we have already assigned to the conception of nature But speculative problems are not alone concerned for in all social life we envisage fellow creatures conceived to share the same thoughts and passions and to be similarly affected by events What is the basis of this conviction What are the forms it takes and in what sense is it a part or an expression of reason This question is difficult and in broaching it we cannot expect much aid from what philosophers have hitherto said on the subject For the most part indeed they have said nothing as by nature s kindly disposition most questions which it is beyond a man s power to answer do not occur to him at all The suggestions which have actually been made in the matter may be reduced to two first that we conceive other men s minds by projecting into their bodies those feelings which we immediately perceive to accompany similar operations in ourselves that is we infer alien minds by analogy and second that we are immediately aware of them and feel them to be friendly or hostile counterparts of our own thinking and effort that is we evoke them by dramatic imagination Sidenote Two usual accounts of this conception criticised Sidenote analogy between bodies The first suggestion has the advantage that it escapes solipsism by a reasonable argument provided the existence of the material world has already been granted But if the material world is called back into the private mind it is evident that every soul supposed to inhabit it or to be expressed in it must follow it thither as inevitably as the characters and forces in an imagined story must remain with it in the inventor s imagination When on the contrary nature is left standing it is reasonable to suppose that animals having a similar origin and similar physical powers should have similar minds if any of them was to have a mind at all The theory however is not satisfactory on other grounds We do not in reality associate our own grimaces with the feelings that accompany them and subsequently on recognising similar grimaces in another proceed to attribute emotions to him like those we formerly experienced Our own grimaces are not easily perceived and other men s actions often reveal passions which we have never had at least with anything like their suggested colouring and intensity This first view is strangely artificial and mistakes for the natural origin of the belief in question what may be perhaps its ultimate test Sidenote and dramatic dialogue in the soul The second suggestion on the other in hand takes us into a mystic region That we evoke the felt souls of our fellows by dramatic imagination is doubtless true but this does not explain how we come to do so under what stimulus and in what circumstances Nor does it avoid solipsism for the felt counterparts of my own will are echoes within me while if other minds actually exist they cannot have for their essence to play a game with me in my own fancy Such society would be mythical and while the sense for society may well be mythical in its origin it must acquire some other character if it is to have practical and moral validity But practical and moral validity is above all what society seems to have This second theory therefore while its feeling for psychological reality is keener does not make the recognition of other minds intelligible and leaves our faith in them without justification Sidenote Subject and object empirical not transcendental terms In approaching the subject afresh we should do well to remember that crude experience knows nothing of the distinction between subject and object This distinction is a division in things a contrast established between masses of images which show different characteristics in their modes of existence and relation If this truth is overlooked if subject and object are made conditions of experience instead of being like body and mind its contrasted parts the revenge of fate is quick and ironical either subject or object must immediately collapse and evaporate altogether All objects must become modifications of the subject or all subjects aspects or fragments of the object Sidenote Objects originally soaked in secondary and tertiary qualities Now the fact that crude experience is innocent of modern philosophy has this important consequence that for crude experience all data whatever lie originally side by side in the same field extension is passionate desire moves bodies thought broods in space and is constituted by a visible metamorphosis of its subject matter Animism or mythology is therefore no artifice Passions naturally reside in the object they agitate our own body if that be the felt seat of some pang the stars if the pang can find no nearer resting place Only a long and still unfinished education has taught men to separate emotions from things and ideas from their objects This education was needed because crude experience is a chaos and the qualities it jumbles together do not march together in time Reflection must accordingly separate them if knowledge that is ideas with eventual application and practical transcendence is to exist at all In other words action must be adjusted to certain elements of experience and not to others and those chiefly regarded must have a certain interpretation put upon them by trained apperception The rest must be treated as moonshine and taken no account of except perhaps in idle and poetic revery In this way crude experience grows reasonable and appearance becomes knowledge of reality The fundamental reason then why we attribute consciousness to natural bodies is that those bodies before they are conceived to be merely material are conceived to possess all the qualities which our own consciousness possesses when we behold them Such a supposition is far from being a paradox since only this principle justifies us to this day in believing in whatever we may decide to believe in The qualities attributed to reality must be qualities found in experience and if we deny their presence in ourselves e g in the case of omniscience that is only because the idea of self like that of matter has already become special and the region of ideals in which omniscience lies has been formed into a third sphere But before the idea of self is well constituted and before the category of ideals has been conceived at all every ingredient ultimately assigned to those two regions is attracted into the perceptual vortex for which such qualities as pressure and motion supply a nucleus The moving image is therefore impregnated not only with secondary qualities colour heat et cetera but with qualities which we may call tertiary such as pain fear joy malice feebleness expectancy Sometimes these tertiary qualities are attributed to the object in their fulness and just as they are felt Thus the sun is not only bright and warm in the same way as he is round but by the same right he is also happy arrogant ever young and all seeing for a suggestion of these tertiary qualities runs through us when we look at him just as immediately as do his warmth and light The fact that these imaginative suggestions are not constant does not impede the instant perception that they are actual and for crude experience whatever a thing possesses in appearance it possesses indeed no matter how soon that quality may be lost again The moment when things have most numerous and best defined tertiary qualities is accordingly for crude experience the moment when they are most adequately manifested and when their inner essence is best revealed for it is then that they appear in experience most splendidly arrayed and best equipped for their eventual functions The sun is a better expression of all his ulterior effects when he is conceived to be an arrogant and all seeing spirit than when he is stupidly felt to be merely hot so that the attentive and devout observer to whom those tertiary qualities are revealed stands in the same relation to an ordinary sensualist who can feel only the sun s material attributes as the sensualist in turn stands in to one born blind who cannot add the sun s brightness to its warmth except by faith in some happier man s reported intuition The mythologist or poet before science exists is accordingly the man of truest and most adequate vision His persuasion that he knows the heart and soul of things is no fancy reached by artificial inference or analogy but is a direct report of his own experience and honest contemplation Sidenote Tertiary qualities transposed More often however tertiary qualities are somewhat transposed in projection as sound in being lodged in the bell is soon translated into sonority made that is into its own potentiality In the same way painfulness is translated into malice or wickedness terror into hate and every felt tertiary quality into whatever tertiary quality is in experience its more quiescent or potential form So religion which remains for the most part on the level of crude experience attributes to the gods not only happiness the object s direct tertiary quality but goodness its tertiary quality transposed and made potential for goodness is that disposition which is fruitful in happiness throughout imagined experience The devil in like manner is cruel and wicked as well as tormented Uncritical science still attributes these transposed tertiary qualities to nature the mythical notion of force for instance being a transposed sensation of effort In this case we may distinguish two stages or degrees in the transposition first before we think of our own pulling we say the object itself pulls in the first transposition we say it pulls against us its pull is the counterpart or rival of ours but it is still conceived in the same direct terms of effort and in the second transposition this intermittent effort is made potential or slumbering in what we call strength or force Sidenote Imputed mind consists of the tertiary qualities of perceived body It is obvious that the feelings attributed to other men are nothing but the tertiary qualities of their bodies In beings of the same species however these qualities are naturally exceedingly numerous variable and precise Nature has made man man s constant study His thought from infancy to the drawing up of his last will and testament is busy about his neighbour A smile makes a child happy a caress a moment s sympathetic attention wins a heart and gives the friend s presence a voluminous and poignant value In youth all seems lost in losing a friend For the tertiary values the emotions attached to a given image the moral effluence emanating from it pervade the whole present world The sense of union though momentary is the same that later returns to the lover or the mystic when he feels he has plucked the heart of life s mystery and penetrated to the peaceful centre of things What the mystic beholds in his ecstasy and loses in his moments of dryness what the lover pursues and adores what the child cries for when left alone is much more a spirit a person a haunting mind than a set of visual sensations yet the visual sensations are connected inextricably with that spirit else the spirit would not withdraw when the sensations failed We are not dealing with an articulate mind whose possessions are discriminated and distributed into a mastered world where everything has its department its special relations its limited importance we are dealing with a mind all pulp all confusion keenly sensitive to passing influences and reacting on them massively and without reserve This mind is feeble passionate and ignorant Its sense for present spirit is no miracle of intelligence or of analogical reasoning on the contrary it betrays a vagueness natural to rudimentary consciousness Those visual sensations suddenly cut off cannot there be recognised for what they are The consequences which their present disappearance may have for subsequent experience are in no wise foreseen or estimated much less are any inexperienced feelings invented and attached to that retreating figure otherwise a mere puppet What happens is that by the loss of an absorbing stimulus the whole chaotic mind is thrown out of gear the child cries the lover faints the mystic feels hell opening before him All this is a present sensuous commotion a derangement in an actual dream Yet just at this lowest plunge of experience in this drunkenness of the soul does the overwhelming reality and externality of the other mind dawn upon us Then we feel that we are surrounded not by a blue sky or an earth known to geographers but by unutterable and most personal hatreds and loves For then we allow the half deciphered images of sense to drag behind them every emotion they have awakened We endow each overmastering stimulus with all its diffuse effects and any dramatic potentiality that our dream acts out under that high pressure and crude experience is rich in dreams becomes our notion of the life going on before us We cannot regard it as our own life because it is not felt to be a passion in our own body but attaches itself rather to images we see moving about in the world it is consequently without hesitation called the life of those images or those creatures souls Sidenote Pathetic fallacy normal yet ordinarily fallacious The pathetic fallacy is accordingly what originally peoples the imagined world All the feelings aroused by perceived things are merged in those things and made to figure as the spiritual and invisible part of their essence a part moreover quite as well known and as directly perceived as their motions To ask why such feelings are objectified would be to betray a wholly sophisticated view of experience and its articulation They do not need to be objectified seeing they were objective from the beginning inasmuch as they pertain to objects and have never any more than those objects been subjectified or localised in the thinker s body nor included in that train of images which as a whole is known to have in that body its seat and thermometer The thermometer for these passions is on the contrary the body of another and the little dream in us the quick dramatic suggestion which goes with our perception of his motions is our perception of his thoughts A sense for alien thought is accordingly at its inception a complete illusion The thought is one s own it is associated with an image moving in space and is uncritically supposed to be a hidden part of that image a metaphysical signification attached to its motion and actually existing behind the scenes in the form of an unheard soliloquy A complete illusion this sense remains in mythology in animism in the poetic forms of love and religion A better mastery of experience will in such cases dispel those hasty conceits by showing the fundamental divergence which at once manifests itself between the course of phenomena and the feelings associated with them It will appear beyond question that those feelings were private fancies merged with observation in an undigested experience They indicated nothing in the object but its power of arousing emotional and playful reverberations in the mind Criticism will tend to clear the world of such poetic distortion and what vestiges of it may linger will be avowed fables metaphors employed merely in conventional expression In the end even poetic power will forsake a discredited falsehood the poet himself will soon prefer to describe nature in natural terms and to represent human emotions in their pathetic humility not extended beyond their actual sphere nor fantastically uprooted from their necessary soil and occasions He will sing the power of nature over the soul the joys of the soul in the bosom of nature the beauty visible in things and the steady march of natural processes so rich in momentous incidents and collocations The precision of such a picture will accentuate its majesty as precision does in the poems of Lucretius and Dante while its pathos and dramatic interest will be redoubled by its truth Sidenote Case where it is not a fallacy A primary habit producing widespread illusions may in certain cases become the source of rational knowledge This possibility will surprise no one who has studied nature and life to any purpose Nature and life are tentative in all their processes so that there is nothing exceptional in the fact that since in crude experience image and emotion are inevitably regarded as constituting a single event this habit should usually lead to childish absurdities but also under special circumstances to rational insight and morality There is evidently one case in which the pathetic fallacy is not fallacious the case in which the object observed happens to be an animal similar to the observer and similarly affected as for instance when a flock or herd are swayed by panic fear The emotion which each as he runs attributes to the others is as usual the emotion he feels himself but this emotion fear is the same which in fact the others are then feeling Their aspect thus becomes the recognised expression for the feeling which really accompanies it So in hand to hand fighting the intention and passion which each imputes to the other is what he himself feels but the imputation is probably just since pugnacity is a remarkably contagious and monotonous passion It is awakened by the slightest hostile suggestion and is greatly intensified by example and emulation those we fight against and those we fight with arouse it concurrently and the universal battle cry that fills the air and that each man instinctively emits is an adequate and exact symbol for what is passing in all their souls Whenever then feeling is attributed to an animal similar to the percipient and similarly employed the attribution is mutual and correct Contagion and imitation are great causes of feeling but in so far as they are its causes and set the pathetic fallacy to work they forestall and correct what is fallacious in that fallacy and turn it into a vehicle of true and as it were miraculous insight Sidenote Knowledge succeeds only by accident Let the reader meditate for a moment upon the following point to know reality is in a way an impossible pretension because knowledge means significant representation discourse about an existence not contained in the knowing thought and different in duration or locus from the ideas which represent it But if knowledge does not possess its object how can it intend it And if knowledge possesses its object how can it be knowledge or have any practical prophetic or retrospective value Consciousness is not knowledge unless it indicates or signifies what actually it is not This transcendence is what gives knowledge its cognitive and useful essence its transitive function and validity In knowledge therefore there must be some such thing as a justified illusion an irrational pretension by chance fulfilled a chance shot hitting the mark For dead logic would stick at solipsism yet irrational life as it stumbles along from moment to moment and multiplies itself in a thousand centres is somehow amenable to logic and finds uses for the reason it breeds Now in the relation of a natural being to similar beings in the same habitat there is just the occasion we require for introducing a miraculous transcendence in knowledge a leap out of solipsism which though not prompted by reason will find in reason a continual justification For tertiary qualities are imputed to objects by psychological or pathological necessity Something not visible in the object something not possibly revealed by any future examination of that object is thus united with it felt to be its core its metaphysical truth Tertiary qualities are emotions or thoughts present in the observer and in his rudimentary consciousness not yet connected with their proper concomitants and antecedents not yet relegated to his private mind nor explained by his personal endowment and situation To take these private feelings for the substance of other beings is evidently a gross blunder yet this blunder without ceasing to be one in point of method ceases to be one in point of fact when the other being happens to be similar in nature and situation to the mythologist himself and therefore actually possesses the very emotions and thoughts which lie in the mythologist s bosom and are attributed by him to his fellow Thus an imaginary self transcendence a rash pretension to grasp an independent reality and to know the unknowable may find itself accidentally rewarded Imagination will have drawn a prize in its lottery and the pathological accidents of thought will have begotten knowledge and right reason The inner and unattainable core of other beings will have been revealed to private intuition Sidenote Limits of insight This miracle of insight as it must seem to those who have not understood its natural and accidental origin extends only so far as does the analogy between the object and the instrument of perception The gift of intuition fails in proportion as the observer s bodily habit differs from the habit and body observed Misunderstanding begins with constitutional divergence and deteriorates rapidly into false imputations and absurd myths The limits of mutual understanding coincide with the limits of similar structure and common occupation so that the distortion of insight begins very near home It is hard to understand the minds of children unless we retain unusual plasticity and capacity to play men and women do not really understand each other what rules between them being not so much sympathy as habitual trust idealisation or satire foreigners minds are pure enigmas and those attributed to animals are a grotesque compound of AEsop and physiology When we come to religion the ineptitude of all the feelings attributed to nature or the gods is so egregious that a sober critic can look to such fables only for a pathetic expression of human sentiment and need while even apart from the gods each religion itself is quite unintelligible to infidels who have never followed its worship sympathetically or learned by contagion the human meaning of its sanctions and formulas Hence the stupidity and want of insight commonly shown in what calls itself the history of religions We hear for instance that Greek religion was frivolous because its mystic awe and momentous practical and poetic truths escape the Christian historian accustomed to a catechism and a religious morality and similarly Catholic piety seems to the Protestant an aesthetic indulgence a religion appealing to sense because such is the only emotion its externals can awaken in him unused as he is to a supernatural economy reaching down into the incidents and affections of daily life Language is an artificial means of establishing unanimity and transferring thought from one mind to another Every symbol or phrase like every gesture throws the observer into an attitude to which a certain idea corresponded in the speaker to fall exactly into the speaker s attitude is exactly to understand Every impediment to contagion and imitation in expression is an impediment to comprehension For this reason language like all art becomes pale with years words and figures of speech lose their contagious and suggestive power the feeling they once expressed can no longer be restored by their repetition Even the most inspired verse which boasts not without a relative justification to be immortal becomes in the course of ages a scarcely legible hieroglyphic the language it was written in dies a learned education and an imaginative effort are requisite to catch even a vestige of its original force Nothing is so irrevocable as mind Unsure the ebb and flood of thought The moon comes back the spirit not Sidenote Perception of character There is however a wholly different and far more positive method of reading the mind or what in a metaphorical sense is called by that name This method is to read character Any object with which we are familiar teaches us to divine its habits slight indications which we should be at a loss to enumerate separately betray what changes are going on and what promptings are simmering in the organism Hence the expression of a face or figure hence the traces of habit and passion visible in a man and that indescribable something about him which inspires confidence or mistrust The gift of reading character is partly instinctive partly a result of experience it may amount to foresight and is directed not upon consciousness but upon past or eventual action Habits and passions however have metaphorical psychic names names indicating dispositions rather than particular acts a disposition being mythically represented as a sort of wakeful and haunting genius waiting to whisper suggestions in a man s ear We may accordingly delude ourselves into imagining that a pose or a manner which really indicates habit indicates feeling instead In truth the feeling involved if conceived at all is conceived most vaguely and is only a sort of reverberation or penumbra surrounding the pictured activities Sidenote Conduct divined consciousness ignored It is a mark of the connoisseur to be able to read character and habit and to divine at a glance all a creature s potentialities This sort of penetration characterises the man with an eye for horse flesh the dog fancier and men and women of the world It guides the born leader in the judgments he instinctively passes on his subordinates and enemies it distinguishes every good judge of human affairs or of natural phenomena who is quick to detect small but telling indications of events past or brewing As the weather prophet reads the heavens so the man of experience reads other men Nothing concerns him less than their consciousness he can allow that to run itself off when he is sure of their temper and habits A great master of affairs is usually unsympathetic His observation is not in the least dramatic or dreamful he does not yield himself to animal contagion or re enact other people s inward experience He is too busy for that and too intent on his own purposes His observation on the contrary is straight calculation and inference and it sometimes reaches truths about people s character and destiny which they themselves are very far from divining Such apprehension is masterful and odious to weaklings who think they know themselves because they indulge in copious soliloquy which is the discourse of brutes and madmen but who really know nothing of their own capacity situation or fate If Rousseau for instance after writing those Confessions in which candour and ignorance of self are equally conspicuous had heard some intelligent friend like Hume draw up in a few words an account of their author s true and contemptible character he would have been loud in protestations that no such ignoble characteristics existed in his eloquent consciousness and they might not have existed there because his consciousness was a histrionic thing and as imperfect an expression of his own nature as of man s When the mind is irrational no practical purpose is served by stopping to understand it because such a mind is irrelevant to practice and the principles that guide the man s practice can be as well understood by eliminating his mind altogether So a wise governor ignores his subjects religion or concerns himself only with its economic and temperamental aspects if the real forces that control life are understood the symbols that represent those forces in the mind may be disregarded But such a government like that of the British in India is more practical than sympathetic While wise men may endure it for the sake of their material interests they will never love it for itself There is nothing sweeter than to be sympathised with while nothing requires a rarer intellectual heroism than willingness to see one s equation written out Sidenote Consciousness untrustworthy Nevertheless this same algebraic sense for character plays a large part in human friendship A chief element in friendship is trust and trust is not to be acquired by reproducing consciousness but only by penetrating to the constitutional instincts which in determining action and habit determine consciousness as well Fidelity is not a property of ideas It is a virtue possessed pre eminently by nature from the animals to the seasons and the stars But fidelity gives friendship its deepest sanctity and the respect we have for a man for his force ability constancy and dignity is no sentiment evoked by his floating thoughts but an assurance founded on our own observation that his conduct and character are to be counted upon Smartness and vivacity much emotion and many conceits are obstacles both to fidelity and to merit There is a high worth in rightly constituted natures independent of incidental consciousness It consists in that ingrained virtue which under given circumstances would insure the noblest action and with that action of course the noblest sentiments and ideas ideas which would arise spontaneously and would make more account of their objects than of themselves Sidenote Metaphorical mind The expression of habit in psychic metaphors is a procedure known also to theology Whenever natural or moral law is declared to reveal the divine mind this mind is a set of formal or ethical principles rather than an imagined consciousness re enacted dramatically What is conceived is the god s operation not his emotions In this way God s goodness becomes a symbol for the advantages of life his wrath a symbol for its dangers his commandments a symbol for its laws The deity spoken of by the Stoics had exclusively this symbolic character it could be called a city dear City of Zeus as readily as an intelligence And that intelligence which ancient and ingenuous philosophers said they saw in the world was always intelligence in this algebraic sense it was intelligible order Nor did the Hebrew prophets in their emphatic political philosophy seem to mean much more by Jehovah than a moral order a principle giving vice and virtue their appropriate fruits Sidenote Summary True society then is limited to similar beings living similar lives and enabled by the contagion of their common habits and arts to attribute to one another each out of his own experience what the other actually endures A fresh thought may be communicated to one who has never had it before but only when the speaker so dominates the auditor s mind by the instrumentalities he brings to bear upon it that he compels that mind to reproduce his experience Analogy between actions and bodies is accordingly the only test of valid inference regarding the existence or character of conceived minds but this eventual test is far from being the source of such a conception Its source is not inference at all but direct emotion and the pathetic fallacy In the beginning as in the end what is attributed to others is something directly felt a dream dreamed through and dramatically enacted but uncritically attributed to the object by whose motions it is suggested and controlled In a single case however tertiary qualities happen to correspond to an experience actually animating the object to which they are assigned This is the case in which the object is a body similar in structure and action to the percipient himself who assigns to that body a passion he has caught by contagion from it and by imitation of its actual attitude Such are the conditions of intelligible expression and true communion beyond these limits nothing is possible save myth and metaphor or the algebraic designation of observed habits under the name of moral dispositions CHAPTER VII CONCRETIONS IN DISCOURSE AND IN EXISTENCE Sidenote So called abstract qualities primary Ideas of material objects ordinarily absorb the human mind and their prevalence has led to the rash supposition that ideas of all other kinds are posterior to physical ideas and drawn from the latter by a process of abstraction The table people said was a particular and single reality its colour form and material were parts of its integral nature qualities which might be attended to separately perhaps but which actually existed only in the table itself Colour form and material were therefore abstract elements They might come before the mind separately and be contrasted objects of attention but they were incapable of existing in nature except together in the concrete reality called a particular thing Moreover as the same colour shape or substance might be found in various tables these abstract qualities were thought to be general qualities as well they were universal terms which might be predicated of many individual things A contrast could then be drawn between these qualities or ideas which the mind may envisage and the concrete reality existing beyond Thus philosophy could reach the familiar maxim of Aristotle that the particular alone exists in nature and the general alone in the mind Sidenote General qualities prior to particular things Such language expresses correctly enough a secondary conventional stage of conception but it ignores the primary fictions on which convention itself must rest Individual physical objects must be discovered before abstractions can be made from their conceived nature the bird must be caught before it is plucked To discover a physical object is to pack in the same part of space and fuse in one complex body primary data like coloured form and tangible surface Intelligence observing these sensible qualities to evolve together and to be controlled at once by external forces or by one s own voluntary motions identifies them in their operation although they remain for ever distinct in their sensible character A physical object is accordingly conceived by fusing or interlacing spatial qualities in a manner helpful to practical intelligence It is a far higher and remoter thing than the elements it is compacted of and that suggest it what habits of appearance and disappearance the latter may have the object reduces to permanent and calculable principles It is altogether erroneous therefore to view an object s sensible qualities as abstractions from it seeing they are its original and component elements nor can the sensible qualities be viewed as generic notions arising by comparison of several concrete objects seeing that these concretions would never have been made or thought to be permanent did they not express observed variations and recurrences in the sensible qualities immediately perceived and already recognised in their recurrence These are themselves the true particulars They are the first objects discriminated in attention and projected against the background of consciousness The immediate continuum may be traversed and mapped by two different methods The prior one because it is so very primitive and rudimentary and so much a condition of all mental discourse is usually ignored in psychology The secondary method by which external things are discovered has received more attention The latter consists in the fact that when several disparate sensations having become recognisable in their repetitions are observed to come and go together or in fixed relation to some voluntary operation on the observer s part they may be associated by contiguity and merged in one portion of perceived space Those having like sensations of touch and sight an essentially spatial character may easily be superposed the surface I see and that I touch may be identified by being presented together and being found to undergo simultaneous variations and to maintain common relations to other perceptions Thus I may come to attribute to a single object the term of an intellectual synthesis and ideal intention my experiences through all the senses within a certain field of association defined by its practical relations That ideal object is thereby endowed with as many qualities and powers as I had associable sensations of which to make it up This object is a concretion of my perceptions in space so that the redness hardness sweetness and roundness of the apple are all fused together in my practical regard and given one local habitation and one name Sidenote Universals are concretions in discourse This kind of synthesis this superposition and mixture of images into notions of physical objects is not however the only kind to which perceptions are subject They fall together by virtue of their qualitative identity even before their spatial superposition for in order to be known as repeatedly simultaneous and associable by contiguity they must be associated by similarity and known as individually repeated The various recurrences of a sensation must be recognised as recurrences and this implies the collection of sensations into classes of similars and the apperception of a common nature in several data Now the more frequent a perception is the harder it will be to discriminate in memory its past occurrences from one another and yet the more readily will its present recurrence be recognised as familiar The perception in sense will consequently be received as a repetition not of any single earlier sensation but of a familiar and generic experience This experience a spontaneous reconstruction based on all previous sensations of that kind will be the one habitual idea with which recurring sensations will be henceforth identified Such a living concretion of similars succeeding one another in time is the idea of a nature or quality the universal falsely supposed to be an abstraction from physical objects which in truth are conceived by putting together these very ideas into a spatial and permanent system Here we have if I am not mistaken the origin of the two terms most prominent in human knowledge ideas and things Two methods of conception divide our attention in common life science and philosophy develop both although often with an unjustifiable bias in favour of one or the other They are nothing but the old principles of Aristotelian psychology association by similarity and association by contiguity Only now after logicians have exhausted their ingenuity in criticising them and psychologists in applying them we may go back of the traditional position and apply the ancient principles at a deeper stage of mental life Sidenote Similar reactions merged in one habit of reproduction yield an idea Association by similarity is a fusion of impressions merging what is common in them interchanging what is peculiar and cancelling in the end what is incompatible so that any excitement reaching that centre revives one generic reaction which yields the idea These concrete generalities are actual feelings the first terms in mental discourse the first distinguishable particulars in knowledge and the first bearers of names Intellectual dominion of the conscious stream begins with the act of recognising these pervasive entities which having character and ideal permanence can furnish common points of reference for different moments of discourse Save for ideas no perception could have significance or acquire that indicative force which we call knowledge For it would refer to nothing to which another perception might also have referred and so long as perceptions have no common reference so long as successive moments do not enrich by their contributions the same object of thought evidently experience in the pregnant sense of the word is impossible No fund of valid ideas no wisdom could in that case be acquired by living Sidenote Ideas are ideal Ideas although their material is of course sensuous are not sensations nor perceptions nor objects of any possible immediate experience they are creatures of intelligence goals of thought ideal terms which cogitation and action circle about As the centre of mass is a body while it may by chance coincide with one or another of its atoms is no atom itself and no material constituent of the bulk that obeys its motion so an idea the centre of mass of a certain mental system is no material fragment of that system but an ideal term of reference and signification by allegiance to which the details of consciousness first become parts of a system and of a thought An idea is an ideal It represents a functional relation in the diffuse existences to which it gives a name and a rational value An idea is an expression of life and shares with life that transitive and elusive nature which defies definition by mere enumeration of its materials The peculiarity of life is that it lives and thought also when living passes out of itself and directs itself on the ideal on the eventual It is an activity Activity does not consist in velocity of change but in constancy of purpose in the conspiracy of many moments and many processes toward one ideal harmony and one concomitant ideal result The most rudimentary apperception recognition or expectation is already a case of representative cognition of transitive thought resting in a permanent essence Memory is an obvious case of the same thing for the past in its truth is a system of experiences in relation a system now non existent and never as a system itself experienced yet confronted in retrospect and made the ideal object and standard for all historical thinking Sidenote So called abstractions complete facts These arrested and recognisable ideas concretions of similars succeeding one another in time are not abstractions but they may come to be regarded as such after the other kind of concretions in experience concretions of superposed perceptions in space have become the leading objects of attention The sensuous material for both concretions is the same the perception which recurring in different objects otherwise not retained in memory gives the idea of roundness is the same perception which helps to constitute the spatial concretion called the sun Roundness may therefore be carelessly called an abstraction from the real object sun whereas the peculiar optical and muscular feelings by which the sense of roundness is constituted probably feelings of gyration and perpetual unbroken movement are much earlier than any solar observations they are a self sufficing element in experience which by repetition in various accidental contests has come to be recognised and named and to be a characteristic by virtue of which more complex objects can be distinguished and defined The idea of the sun is a much later product and the real sun is so far from being an original datum from which roundness is abstracted that it is an ulterior and quite ideal construction a spatial concretion into which the logical concretion roundness enters as a prior and independent factor Roundness may be felt in the dark by a mere suggestion of motion and is a complete experience in itself When this recognisable experience happens to be associated by contiguity with other recognisable experiences of heat light height and yellowness and these various independent objects are projected into the same portion of a real space then a concretion occurs and these ideas being recognised in that region and finding a momentary embodiment there become the qualities of a thing A conceived thing is doubly a product of mind more a product of mind if you will than an idea since ideas arise so to speak by the mind s inertia and conceptions of things by its activity Sidenote Things concretions of concretions Ideas are mental sediment conceived things are mental growths A concretion in discourse occurs by repetition and mere emphasis on a datum but a concretion in existence requires a synthesis of disparate elements and relations An idea is nothing but a sensation apperceived and rendered cognitive so that it envisages its own recognised character as its object and ideal yellowness is only some sensation of yellow raised to the cognitive power and employed as the symbol for its own specific essence It is consequently capable of entering as a term into rational discourse and of becoming the subject or predicate of propositions eternally valid A thing on the contrary is discovered only when the order and grouping of such recurring essences can be observed and when various themes and strains of experience are woven together into elaborate progressive harmonies When consciousness first becomes cognitive it frames ideas but when it becomes cognitive of causes that is when it becomes practical it perceives things Sidenote Ideas prior in the order of knowledge things in the order of nature Concretions of qualities recurrent in time and concretions of qualities associated in existence are alike involved in daily life and inextricably ingrown into the structure of reason In consciousness and for logic association by similarity with its aggregations and identifications of recurrences in time is fundamental rather than association by contiguity and its existential syntheses for recognition identifies similars perceived in succession and without recognition of similars there could be no known persistence of phenomena But physiologically and for the observer association by contiguity comes first All instinct without which there would be no fixity or recurrence in ideation makes movement follow impression in an immediate way which for consciousness becomes a mere juxtaposition of sensations a juxtaposition which it can neither explain nor avoid Yet this juxtaposition in which pleasure pain and striving are prominent factors is the chief stimulus to attention and spreads before the mind that moving and variegated field in which it learns to make its first observations Facts the burdens of successive moments are all associated by contiguity from the first facts of perception and passion to the last facts of fate and conscience We undergo events we grow into character by the subterraneous working of irrational forces that make their incalculable irruptions into life none the less wonderfully in the revelations of a man s heart to himself than in the cataclysms of the world around him Nature s placid procedure to which we yield so willingly in times of prosperity is a concatenation of states which can only be understood when it is made its own standard and law A sort of philosophy without wisdom may seek to subjugate this natural life this blind budding of existence to some logical or moral necessity but this very attempt remains perhaps the most striking monument to that irrational fatality that rules affairs a monument which reason itself is compelled to raise with unsuspected irony Sidenote Aristotle s compromise Reliance on external perception constant appeals to concrete fact and physical sanctions have always led the mass of reasonable men to magnify concretions in existence and belittle concretions in discourse They are too clever as they feel to mistake words for things The most authoritative thinker on this subject because the most mature Aristotle himself taught that things had reality individuality independence and were the outer cause of perception while general ideas products of association by similarity existed only in the mind The public pleased at its ability to understand this doctrine and overlooking the more incisive part of the philosopher s teaching could go home comforted and believing that material things were primary and perfect entities while ideas were only abstractions effects those realities produced on our incapable minds Aristotle however had a juster view of general concepts and made in the end the whole material universe gravitate around them and feel their influence though in a metaphysical and magic fashion to which a more advanced natural science need no longer appeal While in the shock of life man was always coming upon the accidental in the quiet of reflection he could not but recast everything in ideal moulds and retain nothing but eternal natures and intelligible relations Aristotle conceived that while the origin of knowledge lay in the impact of matter upon sense its goal was the comprehension of essences and that while man was involved by his animal nature in the accidents of experience he was also by virtue of his rationality a participator in eternal truth A substantial justice was thus done both to the conditions and to the functions of human life although for want of a natural history inspired by mechanical ideas this dualism remained somewhat baffling and incomprehensible in its basis Aristotle being a true philosopher and pupil of experience preferred incoherence to partiality Sidenote Empirical bias in favour of contiguity Active life and the philosophy that borrows its concepts from practice has thus laid a great emphasis on association by contiguity Hobbes and Locke made knowledge of this kind the only knowledge of reality while recognising it to be quite empirical tentative and problematical It was a kind of acquaintance with fact that increased with years and brought the mind into harmony with something initially alien to it Besides this practical knowledge or prudence there was a sort of verbal and merely ideal knowledge a knowledge of the meaning and relation of abstract terms In mathematics and logic we might carry out long trains of abstracted thought and analyse and develop our imaginations ad infinitum These speculations however were in the air or what for these philosophers is much the same thing in the mind their applicability and their relevance to practical life and to objects given in perception remained quite problematical A self developing science a synthetic science a priori had a value entirely hypothetical and provisional its practical truth depended on the verification of its results in some eventual sensible experience Association was invoked to explain the adjustment of ideation to the order of external perception Association by which association by contiguity was generally understood thus became the battle cry of empiricism if association by similarity had been equally in mind the philosophy of pregnant reason could also have adopted the principle for its own But logicians and mathematicians naturally neglect the psychology of their own processes and accustomed as they are to an irresponsible and constructive use of the intellect regard as a confused and uninspired intruder the critic who by a retrospective and naturalistic method tries to give them a little knowledge of themselves Sidenote Artificial divorce of logic from practice Rational ideas must arise somehow in the mind and since they are not meant to be without application to the world of experience it is interesting to discover the point of contact between the two and the nature of their interdependence This would have been found in the mind s initial capacity to frame objects of two sorts those compacted of sensations that are persistently similar and those compacted of sensations that are momentarily fused In empirical philosophy the applicability of logic and mathematics remains a miracle or becomes a misinterpretation a miracle if the process of nature independently follows the inward elaboration of human ideas a misinterpretation if the bias of intelligence imposes a priori upon reality a character and order not inherent in it The mistake of empiricists among which Kant is in this respect to be numbered which enabled them to disregard this difficulty was that they admitted beside rational thinking another instinctive kind of wisdom by which men could live a wisdom the Englishmen called experience and the Germans practical reason spirit or will The intellectual sciences could be allowed to spin themselves out in abstracted liberty while man practised his illogical and inspired art of life Here we observe a certain elementary crudity or barbarism which the human spirit often betrays when it is deeply stirred Not only are chance and divination welcomed into the world but they are reverenced all the more like the wind and fire of idolaters precisely for not being amenable to the petty rules of human reason In truth however the English duality between prudence and science is no more fundamental than the German duality between reason and understanding A The true contrast is between impulse and reflection instinct and intelligence When men feel the primordial authority of the animal in them and have little respect for a glimmering reason which they suspect to be secondary but cannot discern to be ultimate they readily imagine they are appealing to something higher than intelligence when in reality they are falling back on something deeper and lower The rudimentary seems to them at such moments divine and if they conceive a Life of Reason at all they despise it as a mass of artifices and conventions Reason is indeed not indispensable to life nor needful if living anyhow be the sole and indeterminate aim as the existence of animals and of most men sufficiently proves In so far as man is not a rational being and does not live in and by the mind in so far as his chance volitions and dreamful ideas roll by without mutual representation or adjustment in so far as his body takes the lead and even his galvanised action is a form of passivity we may truly say that his life is not intellectual and not dependent on the application of general concepts to experience for he lives by instinct Sidenote Their mutual involution The Life of Reason the comprehension of causes and pursuit of aims begins precisely where instinctive operation ceases to be merely such by becoming conscious of its purposes and representative of its conditions Logical forms of thought impregnate and constitute practical intellect The shock of experience can indeed correct disappoint or inhibit rational expectation but it cannot take its place The very first lesson that experience should again teach us after our disappointment would be a rebirth of reason in the soul Reason has the indomitable persistence of all natural tendencies it returns to the attack as waves beat on the shore To observe its defeat is already to give it a new embodiment Prudence itself is a vague science and science when it contains real knowledge is but a clarified prudence a description of experience and a guide to life Speculative reason if it is not also practical is not reason at all Propositions irrelevant to experience may be correct in form the method they are reached by may parody scientific method but they cannot be true in substance because they refer to nothing Like music they have no object They merely flow and please those whose unattached sensibility they somehow flatter Hume in this respect more radical and satisfactory than Kant himself saw with perfect clearness that reason was an ideal expression of instinct and that consequently no rational spheres could exist other than the mathematical and the empirical and that what is not a datum must certainly be a construction In establishing his tendencies to feign at the basis of intelligence and in confessing that he yielded to them himself no less in his criticism of human nature than in his practical life he admitted the involution of reason that unintelligible instinct in all the observations and maxims vouchsafed to an empiricist or to a man He veiled his doctrine however in a somewhat unfair and satirical nomenclature and he has paid the price of that indulgence in personal humour by incurring the immortal hatred of sentimentalists who are too much scandalised by his tone ever to understand his principles Sidenote Rationalistic suicide If the common mistake in empiricism is not to see the omnipresence of reason in thought the mistake of rationalism is not to admit its variability and dependence not to understand its natural life Parmenides was the Adam of that race and first tasted the deceptive kind of knowledge which promising to make man God banishes him from the paradise of experience His sin has been transmitted to his descendants though hardly in its magnificent and simple enormity The whole is one Xenophanes had cried gazing into heaven and that same sense of a permeating identity translated into rigid and logical terms brought his sublime disciple to the conviction that an indistinguishable immutable substance was omnipresent in the world Parmenides carried association by similarity to such lengths that he arrived at the idea of what alone is similar in everything viz the fact that it is Being exists and nothing else does whereby every relation and variation in experience is reduced to a negligible illusion and reason loses its function at the moment of asserting its absolute authority Notable lesson taught us like so many others by the first experiments of the Greek mind in its freedom and insight a mind led quickly by noble self confidence to the ultimate goals of thought Such a pitch of heroism and abstraction has not been reached by any rationalist since No one else has been willing to ignore entirely all the data and constructions of experience save the highest concept reached by assimilations in that experience no one else has been willing to demolish all the scaffolding and all the stones of his edifice hoping still to retain the sublime symbol which he had planted on the summit Yet all rationalists have longed to demolish or to degrade some part of the substructure like those Gothic architects who wished to hang the vaults of their churches upon the slenderest possible supports abolishing and turning into painted crystal all the dead walls of the building So experience and its crowning conceptions were to rest wholly on a skeleton of general natures physical forces being assimilated to logical terms and concepts gained by identification of similars taking the place of those gained by grouping disparate things in their historical conjunctions These contiguous sensations which occasionally exemplify the logical contrasts in ideas and give them incidental existence were either ignored altogether and dismissed as unmeaning or admitted merely as illusions The eye was to be trained to pass from that parti coloured chaos to the firm lines and permanent divisions that were supposed to sustain it and frame it in Rationalism is a kind of builder s bias which the impartial public cannot share for the dead walls and glass screens which may have no function in supporting the roof are yet as needful as the roof itself to shelter and beauty So the incidental filling of experience which remains unclassified under logical categories retains all its primary reality and importance The outlines of it emphasised by logic though they may be the essential vehicle of our most soaring thoughts are only a method and a style of architecture They neither absorb the whole material of life nor monopolise its values And as each material imposes upon the builder s ingenuity a different type of construction and stone wood and iron must be treated on different structural principles so logical methods of comprehension spontaneous though they be in their mental origin must prove themselves fitted to the natural order and affinity of the facts B Nor is there in this necessity any violence to the spontaneity of reason for reason also has manifold forms and the accidents of experience are more than matched in variety by the multiplicity of categories Here one principle of order and there another shoots into the mind which breeds more genera and species than the most fertile terrestrial slime can breed individuals Sidenote Complementary character of essence and existence Language then with the logic imbedded in it is a repository of terms formed by identifying successive perceptions as the external world is a repository of objects conceived by superposing perceptions that exist together Being formed on different principles these two orders of conception the logical and the physical do not coincide and the attempt to fuse them into one system of demonstrable reality or moral physics is doomed to failure by the very nature of the terms compared When the Eleatics proved the impossibility i e the inexpressibility of motion or when Kant and his followers proved the unreal character of all objects of experience and of all natural knowledge their task was made easy by the native diversity between the concretions in existence which were the object of their thought and the concretions in discourse which were its measure The two do not fit and intrenched as these philosophers were in the forms of logic they compelled themselves to reject as unthinkable everything not fully expressible in those particular forms Thus they took their revenge upon the vulgar who being busy chiefly with material things and dwelling in an atmosphere of sensuous images call unreal and abstract every product of logical construction or reflective analysis These logical products however are not really abstract but as we have seen concretions arrived at by a different method than that which results in material conceptions Whereas the conception of a thing is a local conglomerate of several simultaneous sensations logical entity is a homogeneous revival in memory of similar sensations temporally distinct Thus the many armed with prejudice and the few armed with logic fight an eternal battle the logician charging the physical world with unintelligibility and the man of common sense charging the logical world with abstractness and unreality The former view is the more profound since association by similarity is the more elementary and gives constancy to meanings while the latter view is the more practical since association by contiguity alone informs the mind about the mechanical sequence of its own experience Neither principle can be dispensed with and each errs only in denouncing the other and wishing to be omnivorous as if on the one hand logic could make anybody understand the history of events and the conjunction of objects or on the other hand as if cognitive and moral processes could have any other terms than constant and ideal natures The namable essence of things or the standard of values must always be an ideal figment existence must always be an empirical fact The former remains always remote from natural existence and the latter irreducible to a logical principle C FOOTNOTES Footnote A This distinction in one sense is Platonic but Plato s Reason was distinguished from understanding which dealt with phenomenal experience because it was a moral faculty defining those values and meanings which in Platonic nomenclature took the title of reality The German Reason was only imagination substituting a dialectical or poetic history of the world for its natural development German idealism accordingly was not like Plato s a moral philosophy hypostasised but a false physics adored Footnote B This natural order and affinity is something imputed to the ultimate object of thought the reality by the last act of judgment assuming its own truth It is of course not observable by consciousness before the first experiment in comprehension has been made the act of comprehension which first imposes on the sensuous material some subjective category is the first to arrive at the notion of an objective order The historian however has a well tried and mature conception of the natural order arrived at after many such experiments in comprehension From the vantage ground of this latest hypothesis he surveys the attempts others have made to understand events and compares them with the objective order which he believes himself to have discovered This observation is made here lest the reader should confuse the natural order imagined to exist before any application of human categories with the last conception of that order attained by the philosopher The latter is but faith the former is faith s ideal object Footnote C For the sake of simplicity only such ideas as precede conceptions of things have been mentioned here After things are discovered however they may be used as terms in a second ideal synthesis and a concretion in discourse on a higher plane may be composed out of sustained concretions in existence Proper names are such secondary concretions in discourse Venice is a term covering many successive aspects and conditions not distinguished in fancy belonging to an object existing continuously in space and time Each of these states of Venice constitutes a natural object a concretion in existence and is again analysable into a mass of fused but recognisable qualities light motion beauty each of which was an original concretion in discourse a primordial term in experience A quality is recognised by its own idea or permanent nature a thing by its constituent qualities and an embodied spirit by fusion into an ideal essence of the constant characters possessed by a thing To raise natural objects into historic entities it is necessary to repeat upon a higher plane that concretion in discourse by which sensations were raised to ideas When familiar objects attain this ideal character they have become poetical and achieved a sort of personality They then possess a spiritual status Thus sensuous experience is solidified into logical terms these into ideas of things and these recast and smelted again in imagination into forms of spirit CHAPTER VIII ON THE RELATIVE VALUE OF THINGS AND IDEAS Sidenote Moral tone of opinions derived from their logical principle Those who look back upon the history of opinion for many centuries commonly feel by a vague but profound instinct that certain consecrated doctrines have an inherent dignity and spirituality while other speculative tendencies and other vocabularies seem wedded to all that is ignoble and shallow So fundamental is this moral tone in philosophy that people are usually more firmly convinced that their opinions are precious than that they are true They may avow in reflective moments that they may be in error seeing that thinkers of no less repute have maintained opposite opinions but they are commonly absolutely sure that if their own views could be generally accepted it would be a boon to mankind that in fact the moral interests of the race are bound up not with discovering what may chance to be true but with discovering the truth to have a particular complexion This predominant trust in moral judgments is in some cases conscious and avowed so that philosophers invite the world to embrace tenets for which no evidence is offered but that they chime in with current aspirations or traditional bias Thus the substance of things hoped for becomes even in philosophy the evidence of things not seen Such faith is indeed profoundly human and has accompanied the mind in all its gropings and discoveries preference being the primary principle of discrimination and attention Reason in her earliest manifestations already discovered her affinities and incapacities and loaded the ideas she framed with friendliness or hostility It is not strange that her latest constructions should inherit this relation to the will and we shall see that the moral tone and affinity of metaphysical systems corresponds exactly with the primary function belonging to that type of idea on which they are based Idealistic systems still cultivating concretions in discourse study the first conditions of knowledge and the last interests of life materialistic systems still emphasising concretions in existence describe causal relations and the habits of nature Thus the spiritual value of various philosophies rests in the last instance on the kind of good which originally attached the mind to that habit and plane of ideation Sidenote Concretions in discourse express instinctive reactions We have said that perceptions must be recognised before they can be associated by contiguity and that consequently the fusion of temporally diffused experiences must precede their local fusion into material objects It might be urged in opposition to this statement that concrete objects can be recognised in practice before their general qualities have been distinguished in discourse Recognition may be instinctive that is based on the repetition of a felt reaction or emotion rather than on any memory of a former occasion on which the same perception occurred Such an objection seems to be well grounded for it is instinctive adjustments and suggested action that give cognitive value to sensation and endow it with that transitive force which makes it consciously representative of what is past future or absent If practical instinct did not stretch what is given into what is meant reason could never recognise the datum for a copy of an ideal object Sidenote Idealism rudimentary This description of the case involves an application or extension of our theory rather than an argument against it For where recognition is instinctive and a familiar action is performed with absent minded confidence and without attending to the indications that justify that action there is in an eminent degree a qualitative concretion in experience Present impressions are merged so completely in structural survivals of the past that instead of arousing any ideas distinct enough to be objectified they merely stimulate the inner sense remain imbedded in the general feeling of motion or life and constitute in fact a heightened sentiment of pure vitality and freedom For the lowest and vaguest of concretions in discourse are the ideas of self and of an embosoming external being with the felt continuity of both what Fichte would call the Ego the Non Ego and Life Where no particular events are recognised there is still a feeling of continuous existence We trail after us from our whole past some sense of the continuous energy and movement both of our passionate fancies and of the phantasmagoria capriciously at work beyond An ignorant mind believes itself omniscient and omnipotent those impulses in itself which really represent the inertia and unspent momentum of its last dream it regards as the creative forces of nature The first lines of cleavage and the first recognisable bulks at which attention is arrested are in truth those shadowy Fichtean divisions such are the rude beginnings of logical architecture In its inability to descry anything definite and fixed for want of an acquired empirical background and a distinct memory the mind flounders forward in a dream full of prophecies and wayward identifications The world possesses as yet in its regard only the superficial forms that appear in revery it has no hidden machinery no third dimension in which unobserved and perpetual operations are going on Its only terms in a word are concretions in discourse ideas combined in their aesthetic and logical harmonies not in their habitual and efficacious conjunctions The disorder of such experience is still a spontaneous disorder it has not discovered how calculable are its unpremeditated shocks The cataclysms that occur seem to have only ideal grounds and only dramatic meaning Though the dream may have its terrors and degenerate at moments into a nightmare it has still infinite plasticity and buoyancy What perceptions are retained merge in those haunting and friendly presences they have an intelligible and congenial character because they appear as parts and effluences of an inner fiction evolving according to the barbaric prosody of an almost infant mind This is the fairy land of idealism where only the miraculous seems a matter of course and every hint of what is purely natural is disregarded for the truly natural still seems artificial dead and remote New and disconcerting facts which intrude themselves inopportunely into the story chill the currents of spontaneous imagination and are rejected as long as possible for being alien and perverse Perceptions on the contrary which can be attached to the old presences as confirmations or corollaries become at once parts of the warp and woof of what we call ourselves They seem of the very substance of spirit obeying a vital momentum and flowing from the inmost principle of being and they are so much akin to human presumptions that they pass for manifestations of necessary truth Thus the demonstrations of geometry being but the intent explication of a long consolidated ideal concretion which we call space are welcomed by the mind as in a sense familiar and as revelations of a truth implicit in the soul so that Plato could plausibly take them for recollections of prenatal wisdom But a rocket that bursts into sparks of a dozen colours even if expected is expected with anxiety and observed with surprise it assaults the senses at an incalculable moment with a sensation individual and new The exciting tension and lively stimulus may please in their way yet the badge of the accidental and unmeaning adheres to the thing It is a trivial experience and one quickly forgotten The shock is superficial and were it repeated would soon fatigue We should retire with relief into darkness and silence to our permanent and rational thoughts Sidenote Naturalism sad It is a remarkable fact which may easily be misinterpreted that while all the benefits and pleasures of life seem to be associated with external things and all certain knowledge seems to describe material laws yet a deified nature has generally inspired a religion of melancholy Why should the only intelligible philosophy seem to defeat reason and the chief means of benefiting mankind seem to blast our best hopes Whence this profound aversion to so beautiful and fruitful a universe Whence this persistent search for invisible regions and powers and for metaphysical explanations that can explain nothing while nature s voice without and within man cries aloud to him to look act and enjoy And when someone in protest against such senseless oracular prejudices has actually embraced the life and faith of nature and taught others to look to the natural world for all motives and sanctions expecting thus to refresh and marvellously to invigorate human life why have those innocent hopes failed so miserably Why is that sensuous optimism we may call Greek or that industrial optimism we may call American such a thin disguise for despair Why does each melt away and become a mockery at the first approach of reflection Why has man s conscience in the end invariably rebelled against naturalism and reverted in some form or other to a cultus of the unseen Sidenote The soul akin to the eternal and ideal We may answer in the words of Saint Paul because things seen are temporal and things not seen are eternal And we may add remembering our analysis of the objects inhabiting the mind that the eternal is the truly human that which is akin to the first indispensable products of intelligence which arise by the fusion of successive images in discourse and transcend the particular in time peopling the mind with permanent and recognisable objects and strengthening it with a synthetic dramatic apprehension of itself and its own experience Concretion in existence on the contrary yields essentially detached and empirical unities foreign to mind in spite of their order and unintelligible in spite of their clearness Reason fails to assimilate in them precisely that which makes them real namely their presence here and now in this order and number The form and quality of them we can retain domesticate and weave into the texture of reflection but their existence and individuality remain a datum of sense needing to be verified anew at every moment and actually receiving continual verification or disproof while we live in this world This world we call it not without justifiable pathos for many other worlds are conceivable and if discovered might prove more rational and intelligible and more akin to the soul than this strange universe which man has hitherto always looked upon with increasing astonishment The materials of experience are no sooner in hand than they are transformed by intelligence reduced to those permanent presences those natures and relations which alone can live in discourse Those materials rearranged into the abstract summaries we call history or science or pieced out into the reconstructions and extensions we call poetry or religion furnish us with ideas of as many dream worlds as we please all nearer to reason s ideal than is the actual chaos of perceptual experience and some nearer to the heart s desire When an empirical philosophy therefore calls us back from the irresponsible flights of imagination to the shock of sense and tries to remind us that in this alone we touch existence and come upon fact we feel dispossessed of our nature and cramped in our life The actuality possessed by external experience cannot make up for its instability nor the applicability of scientific principles for their hypothetical character The dependence upon sense which we are reduced to when we consider the world of existences becomes a too plain hint of our essential impotence and mortality while the play of logical fancy though it remain inevitable is saddened by a consciousness of its own insignificance Sidenote Her inexperience That dignity then which inheres in logical ideas and their affinity to moral enthusiasm springs from their congruity with the primary habits of intelligence and idealisation The soul or self or personality which in sophisticated social life is so much the centre of passion and concern is itself an idea a concretion in discourse and the level on which it swims comes to be by association and affinity the region of all the more vivid and massive human interests The pleasures which lie beneath it are ignored and the ideals which lie above it are not perceived Aversion to an empirical or naturalistic philosophy accordingly expresses a sort of logical patriotism and attachment to homespun ideas The actual is too remote and unfriendly to the dreamer to understand it he has to learn a foreign tongue which his native prejudice imagines to be unmeaning and unpoetical The truth is however that nature s language is too rich for man and the discomfort he feels when he is compelled to use it merely marks his lack of education There is nothing cheaper than idealism It can be had by merely not observing the ineptitude of our chance prejudices and by declaring that the first rhymes that have struck our ear are the eternal and necessary harmonies of the world Sidenote Platonism spontaneous The thinker s bias is naturally favourable to logical ideas The man of reflection will attribute as far as possible validity and reality to these alone Platonism remains the classic instance of this way of thinking Living in an age of rhetoric with an education that dealt with nothing but ideal entities verbal moral or mathematical Plato saw in concretions in discourse the true elements of being Definable meanings being the terms of thought must also he fancied be the constituents of reality And with that directness and audacity which was possible to the ancients and of which Pythagoreans and Eleatics had already given brilliant examples he set up these terms of discourse like the Pythagorean numbers for absolute and eternal entities existing before all things revealed in all things giving the cosmic artificer his models and the creature his goal By some inexplicable necessity the creation had taken place The ideas had multiplied themselves in a flux of innumerable images which could be recognised by their resemblance to their originals but were at once cancelled and expunged by virtue of their essential inadequacy What sounds are to words and words to thoughts that was a thing to its idea Sidenote Its essential fidelity to the ideal Plato however retained the moral and significant essence of his ideas and while he made them ideal absolutes fixed meanings antecedent to their changing expressions never dreamed that they could be natural existences or psychological beings In an original thinker in one who really thinks and does not merely argue to call a thing supernatural or spiritual or intelligible is to declare that it is no thing at all no existence actual or possible but a value a term of thought a merely ideal principle and the more its reality in such a sense is insisted on the more its incommensurability with brute existence is asserted To express this ideal reality myth is the natural vehicle a vehicle Plato could avail himself of all the more freely that he inherited a religion still plastic and conscious of its poetic essence and did not have to struggle like his modern disciples with the arrested childishness of minds that for a hundred generations have learned their metaphysics in the cradle His ideas although their natural basis was ignored were accordingly always ideal they always represented meanings and functions and were never degraded from the moral to the physical sphere The counterpart of this genuine ideality was that the theory retained its moral force and did not degenerate into a bewildered and idolatrous pantheism Plato conceived the soul s destiny to be her emancipation from those material things which in this illogical apparition were so alien to her essence She should return after her baffling and stupefying intercourse with the world of sense and accident into the native heaven of her ideas For animal desires were no less illusory and yet no less significant than sensuous perceptions They engaged man in the pursuit of the good and taught him through disappointment to look for it only in those satisfactions which can be permanent and perfect Love like intelligence must rise from appearance to reality and rest in that divine world which is the fulfilment of the human Sidenote Equal rights of empiricism A geometrician does a good service when he declares and explicates the nature of the triangle an object suggested by many casual and recurring sensations His service is not less real even if less obvious when he arrests some fundamental concretion in discourse and formulates the first principles of logic Mastering such definitions sinking into the dry life of such forms he may spin out and develop indefinitely in the freedom of his irresponsible logic their implications and congruous extensions opening by his demonstration a depth of knowledge which we should otherwise never have discovered in ourselves But if the geometer had a fanatical zeal and forbade us to consider space and the triangles it contains otherwise than as his own ideal science considers them forbade us for instance to inquire how we came to perceive those triangles or that space what organs and senses conspired in furnishing the idea of them what material objects show that character and how they came to offer themselves to our observation then surely the geometer would qualify his service with a distinct injury and while he opened our eyes to one fascinating vista would tend to blind them to others no less tempting and beautiful For the naturalist and psychologist have also their rights and can tell us things well worth knowing nor will any theory they may possibly propose concerning the origin of spatial ideas and their material embodiments ever invalidate the demonstrations of geometry These in their hypothetical sphere are perfectly autonomous and self generating and their applicability to experience will hold so long as the initial images they are applied to continue to abound in perception If we awoke to morrow in a world containing nothing but music geometry would indeed lose its relevance to our future experience but it would keep its ideal cogency and become again a living language if any spatial objects should ever reappear in sense The history of such reappearances natural history is meantime a good subject for observation and experiment Chronicler and critic can always approach experience with a method complementary to the deductive methods pursued in mathematics and logic instead of developing the import of a definition he can investigate its origin and describe its relation to other disparate phenomena The mathematician develops the import of given ideas the psychologist investigates their origin and describes their relation to the rest of human experience So the prophet develops the import of his trance and the theologian the import of the prophecy which prevents not the historian from coming later and showing the origin the growth and the possible function of that maniacal sort of wisdom True the theologian commonly dreads a critic more than does the geometer but this happens only because the theologian has probably not developed the import of his facts with any austerity or clearness but has distorted that ideal interpretation with all sorts of concessions and side glances at other tenets to which he is already pledged so that he justly fears when his methods are exposed that the religious heart will be alienated from him and his conclusions be left with no foothold in human nature If he had not been guilty of such misrepresentation no history or criticism that reviewed his construction would do anything but recommend it to all those who found in themselves the primary religious facts and religious faculties which that construction had faithfully interpreted in its ideal deductions and extensions All who perceived the facts would thus learn their import and theology would reveal to the soul her natural religion just as Euclid reveals to architects and navigators the structure of natural space so that they value his demonstrations not only for their hypothetical cogency but for their practical relevance and truth Sidenote Logic dependent on fact for its importance Now like the geometer and ingenuous theologian that he was Plato developed the import of moral and logical experience Even his followers though they might give rein to narrower and more fantastic enthusiasms often unveiled secrets hidden in the oracular intent of the heart which might never have been disclosed but for their lessons But with a zeal unbecoming so well grounded a philosophy they turned their backs upon the rest of wisdom they disparaged the evidence of sense they grew hot against the ultimate practical sanctions furnished by impulse and pleasure they proscribed beauty in art where Plato had proscribed chiefly what to a fine sensibility is meretricious ugliness and in a word they sought to abolish all human activities other than the one pre eminent in themselves In revenge for their hostility the great world has never given them more than a distrustful admiration and confronted daily by the evident truths they denied has encouraged itself to forget the truths they asserted For they had the bias of reflection and man is born to do more than reflect they attributed reality and validity only to logical ideas and man finds other objects continually thrusting themselves before his eyes claiming his affection and controlling his fortunes The most legitimate constructions of reason soon become merely speculative soon pass I mean beyond the sphere of practical application and the man of affairs adjusting himself at every turn to the opaque brutality of fact loses his respect for the higher reaches of logic and forgets that his recognition of facts themselves is an application of logical principles In his youth perhaps he pursued metaphysics which are the love affairs of the understanding now he is wedded to convention and seeks in the passion he calls business or in the habit he calls duty some substitute for natural happiness He fears to question the value of his life having found that such questioning adds nothing to his powers and he thinks the mariner would die of old age in port who should wait for reason to justify his voyage Reason is indeed like the sad Iphigenia whom her royal father the Will must sacrifice before any wind can fill his sails The emanation of all things from the One involves not only the incarnation but the crucifixion of the Logos Reason must be eclipsed by its supposed expressions and can only shine in a darkness which does not comprehend it For reason is essentially hypothetical and subsidiary and can never constitute what it expresses in man nor what it recognises in nature Sidenote and for its subsistence If logic should refuse to make this initial self sacrifice and to subordinate itself to impulse and fact it would immediately become irrational and forfeit its own justification For it exists by virtue of a human impulse and in answer to a human need To ask a man in the satisfaction of a metaphysical passion to forego every other good is to render him fanatical and to shut his eyes daily to the sun in order that he may see better by the star light The radical fault of rationalism is not any incidental error committed in its deductions although such necessarily abound in every human system Its great original sin is its denial of its own basis and its refusal to occupy its due place in the world an ignorant fear of being invalidated by its history and dishonoured as it were if its ancestry is hinted at Only bastards should fear that fate and criticism would indeed be fatal to a bastard philosophy to one that does not spring from practical reason and has no roots in life But those products of reason which arise by reflection on fact and those spontaneous and demonstrable systems of ideas which can be verified in experience and thus serve to render the facts calculable and articulate will lose nothing of their lustre by discovering their lineage So the idea of nature remains true after psychology has analysed its origin and not only true but beautiful and beneficent For unlike many negligible products of speculative fancy it is woven out of recurrent perceptions into a hypothetical cause from which further perceptions can be deduced as they are actually experienced Such a mechanism once discovered confirms itself at every breath we draw and surrounds every object in history and nature with infinite and true suggestions making it doubly interesting fruitful and potent over the mind The naturalist accordingly welcomes criticism because his constructions though no less hypothetical and speculative than the idealist s dreams are such legitimate and fruitful fictions that they are obvious truths For truth at the intelligible level where it arises means not sensible fact but valid ideation verified hypothesis and inevitable stable inference If the idealist fears and deprecates any theory of his own origin and function he is only obeying the instinct of self preservation for he knows very well that his past will not bear examination He is heir to every superstition and by profession an apologist his deepest vocation is to rescue by some logical tour de force what spontaneously he himself would have taken for a consecrated error Now history and criticism would involve as he instinctively perceives the reduction of his doctrines to their pragmatic value to their ideal significance for real life But he detests any admission of relativity in his doctrines all the more because he cannot avow his reasons for detesting it and zeal here as in so many cases becomes the cover and evidence of a bad conscience Bigotry and craft with a rhetorical vilification of enemies then come to reinforce in the prophet that natural limitation of his interests which turns his face away from history and criticism until his system in its monstrous unreality and disingenuousness becomes intolerable and provokes a general revolt in which too often the truth of it is buried with the error in a common oblivion Sidenote Reason and docility If idealism is intrenched in the very structure of human reason empiricism represents all those energies of the external universe which as Spinoza says must infinitely exceed the energies of man If meditation breeds science wisdom comes by disillusion even on the subject of science itself Docility to the facts makes the sanity of science Reason is only half grown and not really distinguishable from imagination so long as she cannot check and recast her own processes wherever they render the moulds of thought unfit for their subject matter Docility is as we have seen the deepest condition of reason s existence for if a form of mental synthesis were by chance developed which was incapable of appropriating the data of sense these data could not be remembered or introduced at all into a growing and cumulative experience Sensations would leave no memorial while logical thoughts would play idly like so many parasites in the mind and ultimately languish and die of inanition To be nourished and employed intelligence must have developed such structure and habits as will enable it to assimilate what food comes in its way so that the persistence of any intellectual habit is a proof that it has some applicability however partial to the facts of sentience Sidenote Applicable thought and clarified experience This applicability the prerequisite of significant thought is also its eventual test and the gathering of new experiences the consciousness of more and more facts crowding into the memory and demanding company ordination is at once the presentation to reason of her legitimate problem and a proof that she is already at work It is a presentation of her problem because reason is not a faculty of dreams but a method in living and by facing the flux of sensations and impulses that constitute mortal life with the gift of ideal construction and the aspiration toward eternal goods she is only doing her duty and manifesting what she is To accumulate facts moreover is in itself to prove that rational activity is already awakened because a consciousness of multitudinous accidents diversifying experience involves a wide scope in memory good methods of classification and keen senses so that all working together they may collect many observations Memory and all its instruments are embodiments on a modest scale of rational activities which in theory and speculation reappear upon a higher level The expansion of the mind in point of retentiveness and wealth of images is as much an advance in knowledge as is its development in point of organisation The structure may be widened at the base as well as raised toward its ideal summit and while a mass of information imperfectly digested leaves something still for intelligence to do it shows at the same time how much intelligence has done already The function of reason is to dominate experience and obviously openness to new impressions is no less necessary to that end than is the possession of principles by which new impressions may be interpreted CHAPTER IX HOW THOUGHT IS PRACTICAL Sidenote Functional relations of mind and body Nothing is more natural or more congruous with all the analogies of experience than that animals should feel and think The relation of mind to body of reason to nature seems to be actually this when bodies have reached a certain complexity and vital equilibrium a sense begins to inhabit them which is focussed upon the preservation of that body and on its reproduction This sense as it becomes reflective and expressive of physical welfare points more and more to its own persistence and harmony and generates the Life of Reason Nature is reason s basis and theme reason is nature s consciousness and from the point of view of that consciousness when it has arisen reason is also nature s justification and goal To separate things so closely bound together as are mind and body reason and nature is consequently a violent and artificial divorce and a man of judgment will instinctively discredit any philosophy in which it is decreed But to avoid divorce it is well first to avoid unnatural unions and not to attribute to our two elements which must be partners for life relations repugnant to their respective natures and offices Now the body is an instrument the mind its function the witness and reward of its operation Mind is the body s entelechy a value which accrues to the body when it has reached a certain perfection of which it would be a pity so to speak that it should remain unconscious so that while the body feeds the mind the mind perfects the body lifting it and all its natural relations and impulses into the moral world into the sphere of interests and ideas No connection could be closer than this reciprocal involution as nature and life reveal it but the connection is natural not dialectical The union will be denaturalised and so far as philosophy goes actually destroyed if we seek to carry it on into logical equivalence If we isolate the terms mind and body and study the inward implications of each apart we shall never discover the other That matter cannot by transposition of its particles become what we call consciousness is an admitted truth that mind cannot become its own occasions or determine its own march though it be a truth not recognised by all philosophers is in itself no less obvious Matter dialectically studied makes consciousness seem a superfluous and unaccountable addendum mind studied in the same way makes nature an embarrassing idea a figment which ought to be subservient to conscious aims and perfectly transparent but which remains opaque and overwhelming In order to escape these sophistications it suffices to revert to immediate observation and state the question in its proper terms nature lives and perception is a private echo and response to ambient motions The soul is the voice of the body s interests in watching them a man defines the world that sustains him and that conditions all his satisfactions In discerning his origin he christens Nature by the eloquent name of mother under which title she enters the universe of discourse Simultaneously he discerns his own existence and marks off the inner region of his dreams And it behooves him not to obliterate these discoveries By trying to give his mind false points of attachment in nature he would disfigure not only nature but also that reason which is so much the essence of his life Sidenote They form one natural life Consciousness then is the expression of bodily life and the seat of all its values Its place in the natural world is like that of its own ideal products art religion or science it translates natural relations into synthetic and ideal symbols by which things are interpreted with reference to the interests of consciousness itself This representation is also an existence and has its place along with all other existences in the bosom of nature In this sense its connection with its organs and with all that affects the body or that the body affects is a natural connection If the word cause did not suggest dialectical bonds we might innocently say that thought was a link in the chain of natural causes It is at least a link in the chain of natural events for it has determinate antecedents in the brain and senses and determinate consequents in actions and words But this dependence and this efficacy have nothing logical about them they are habitual collocations in the world like lightning and thunder A more minute inspection of psycho physical processes were it practicable would doubtless disclose undreamed of complexities and harmonies in them the mathematical and dynamic relations of stimulus and sensation might perhaps be formulated with precision But the terms used in the equation their quality and inward habit would always remain data which the naturalist would have to assume after having learned them by inspection Movement could never be deduced dialectically or graphically from thought nor thought from movement Indeed no natural relation is in a different case Neither gravity nor chemical reaction nor life and reproduction nor time space and motion themselves are logically deducible nor intelligible in terms of their limits The phenomena have to be accepted at their face value and allowed to retain a certain empirical complexity otherwise the seed of all science is sterilised and calculation cannot proceed for want of discernible and pregnant elements How fine nature s habits may be where repetition begins and down to what depth a mathematical treatment can penetrate is a question for the natural sciences to solve Whether consciousness for instance accompanies vegetative life or even all motion is a point to be decided solely by empirical analogy When the exact physical conditions of thought are discovered in man we may infer how far thought is diffused through the universe for it will be coextensive with the conditions it will have been shown to have Now in a very rough way we know already what these conditions are They are first the existence of an organic body and then its possession of adaptable instincts of instincts that can be modified by experience This capacity is what an observer calls intelligence docility is the observable half of reason When an animal winces at a blow and readjusts his pose we say he feels and we say he thinks when we see him brooding over his impressions and find him launching into a new course of action after a silent decoction of his potential impulses Conversely when observation covers both the mental and the physical process that is in our own experience we find that felt impulses the conceived objects for which they make and the values they determine are all correlated with animal instincts and external impressions A desire is the inward sign of a physical proclivity to act an image in sense is the sign in most cases of some material object in the environment and always we may presume of some cerebral change The brain seems to simmer like a caldron in which all sorts of matters are perpetually transforming themselves into all sorts of shapes When this cerebral reorganisation is pertinent to the external situation and renders the man when he resumes action more a master of his world the accompanying thought is said to be practical for it brings a consciousness of power and an earnest of success Cerebral processes are of course largely hypothetical Theory suggests their existence and experience can verify that theory only in an indirect and imperfect manner The addition of a physical substratum to all thinking is only a scientific expedient a hypothesis expressing the faith that nature is mechanically intelligible even beyond the reaches of minute verification The accompanying consciousness on the other hand is something intimately felt by each man in his own person it is a portion of crude and immediate experience That it accompanies changes in his body and in the world is not an inference for him but a datum But when crude experience is somewhat refined and the soul at first mingled with every image finds that it inhabits only her private body to whose fortunes hers are altogether wedded we begin to imagine that we know the cosmos at large better than the spirit for beyond the narrow limits of our own person only the material phase of things is open to our observation To add a mental phase to every part and motion of the cosmos is then seen to be an audacious fancy It violates all empirical analogy for the phenomenon which feeling accompanies in crude experience is not mere material existence but reactive organisation and docility Sidenote Artifices involved in separating them The limits set to observation however render the mental and material spheres far from coincident and even in a rough way mutually supplementary so that human reflection has fallen into a habit of interlarding them The world instead of being a living body a natural system with moral functions has seemed to be a bisectible hybrid half material and half mental the clumsy conjunction of an automaton with a ghost These phases taken in their abstraction as they first forced themselves on human attention have been taken for independent and separable facts Experience remaining in both provinces quite sensuous and superficial has accordingly been allowed to link this purely mental event with that purely mechanical one The linkage is practically not deceptive because mental transformations are indeed signs of changes in bodies and so long as a cause is defined merely as a sign mental and physical changes may truly be said to cause one another But so soon as this form of augury tries to overcome its crude empiricism and to establish phenomenal laws the mental factor has to fall out of the efficient process and be represented there by what upon accurate examination it is seen to be really the sign of I mean by some physiological event If philosophers of the Cartesian school had taken to heart as the German transcendentalists did the cogito ergo sum of their master and had considered that a physical world is for knowledge nothing but an instrument to explain sensations and their order they might have expected this collapse of half their metaphysics at the approach of their positive science for if mental existence was to be kept standing only by its supposed causal efficacy nothing could prevent the whole world from becoming presently a bete machine Psychic events have no links save through their organs and their objects the function of the material world is indeed precisely to supply their linkage The internal relations of ideas on the other hand are dialectical their realm is eternal and absolutely irrelevant to the march of events If we must speak therefore of causal relations between mind and body we should say that matter is the pervasive cause of mind s distribution and mind the pervasive cause of matter s discovery and value To ask for an efficient cause to trace back a force or investigate origins is to have already turned one s face in the direction of matter and mechanical laws no success in that undertaking can fail to be a triumph for materialism To ask for a justification on the other hand is to turn no less resolutely in the direction of ideal results and actualities from which instrumentality and further use have been eliminated Spirit is useless being the end of things but it is not vain since it alone rescues all else from vanity It is called practical when it is prophetic of its own better fulfilments which is the case whenever forces are being turned to good uses whenever an organism is exploring its relations and putting forth new tentacles with which to grasp the world Sidenote Consciousness expresses vital equilibrium and docility We saw in the beginning that the exigences of bodily life gave consciousness its first articulation A bodily feat like nutrition or reproduction is celebrated by a festival in the mind and consciousness is a sort of ritual solemnising by prayer jubilation or mourning the chief episodes in the body s fortunes The organs by their structure select the impressions possible to them from the divers influences abroad in the world all of which if animal organisms had learned to feed upon them might plausibly have offered a basis for sensation Every instinct or habitual impulse further selects from the passing bodily affections those that are pertinent to its own operation and which consequently adhere to it and modify its reactive machinery Prevalent and notable sensations are therefore signs presumably marking the presence of objects important for the body s welfare or for the execution of its predestined offices So that not only are the soul s aims transcripts of the body s tendencies but all ideas are grafted upon the interplay of these tendencies with environing forces Early images hover about primary wants as highest conceptions do about ultimate achievements Sidenote Its worthlessness as a cause and value as an expression Thought is essentially practical in the sense that but for thought no motion would be an action no change a progress but thought is in no way instrumental or servile it is an experience realised not a force to be used That same spontaneity in nature which has suggested a good must be trusted to fulfil it If we look fairly at the actual resources of our minds we perceive that we are as little informed concerning the means and processes of action as concerning the reason why our motives move us To execute the simplest intention we must rely on fate our own acts are mysteries to us Do I know how I open my eyes or how I walk down stairs Is it the supervising wisdom of consciousness that guides me in these acts Is it the mind that controls the bewildered body and points out the way to physical habits uncertain of their affinities Or is it not much rather automatic inward machinery that executes the marvellous work while the mind catches here and there some glimpse of the operation now with delight and adhesion now with impotent rebellion When impulses work themselves out unimpeded we say we act when they are thwarted we say we are acted upon but in neither case do we in the least understand the natural history of what is occurring The mind at best vaguely forecasts the result of action a schematic verbal sense of the end to be accomplished possibly hovers in consciousness while the act is being performed but this premonition is itself the sense of a process already present and betrays the tendency at work it can obviously give no aid or direction to the unknown mechanical process that produced it and that must realise its own prophecy if that prophecy is to be realised at all That such an unknown mechanism exists and is adequate to explain every so called decision is indeed a hypothesis far outrunning detailed verification although conceived by legitimate analogy with whatever is known about natural processes but that the mind is not the source of itself or its own transformations is a matter of present experience for the world is an unaccountable datum in its existence in its laws and in its incidents The highest hopes of science and morality look only to discovering those laws and bringing one set of incidents facts of perception into harmony with another set facts of preference This hoped for issue if it comes must come about in the mind but the mind cannot be its cause since by hypothesis it does not possess the ideas it seeks nor has power to realise the harmonies it desiderates These have to be waited for and begged of destiny human will not controlling its basis cannot possibly control its effects Its existence and its efforts have at best the value of a good omen They show in what direction natural forces are moving in so far as they are embodied in given men Sidenote Thought s march automatic and thereby implicated in events Men like all things else in the world are products and vehicles of natural energy and their operation counts But their conscious will in its moral assertiveness is merely a sign of that energy and of that will s eventual fortunes Dramatic terror and dramatic humour both depend on contrasting the natural pregnancy of a passion with its conscious intent Everything in human life is ominous even the voluntary acts We cannot by taking thought add a cubit to our stature but we may build up a world without meaning it Man is as full of potentiality as he is of impotence A will that represents many active forces and is skilful in divination and augury may long boast to be almighty without being contradicted by the event Sidenote Contemplative essence of action That thought is not self directive appears best in the most immaterial processes In strife against external forces men being ignorant of their deeper selves attribute the obvious effects of their action to their chance ideas but when the process is wholly internal the real factors are more evenly represented in consciousness and the magical involuntary nature of life is better perceived My hand guided by I know not what machinery is at this moment adding syllable to syllable upon this paper to the general fulfilment perhaps of my felt intent yet giving that intent an articulation wholly unforeseen and often disappointing The thoughts to be expressed simmer half consciously in my brain I feel their burden and tendency without seeing their form until the mechanical train of impulsive association started by the perusal of what precedes or by the accidental emergence of some new idea lights the fuse and precipitates the phrases If this happens in the most reflective and deliberate of activities like this of composition how much more does it happen in positive action The die is cast said Caesar feeling a decision in himself of which he could neither count nor weigh the multitudinous causes and so says every strong and clear intellect every well formed character seizing at the same moment with comprehensive instinct both its purposes and the means by which they shall be attained Only the fool whose will signifies nothing boasts to have created it himself We must not seek the function of thought then in any supposed power to discover either ends not suggested by natural impulse or means to the accomplishment of those irrational ends Attention is utterly powerless to change or create its objects in either respect it rather registers without surprise for it expects nothing in particular and watches eagerly the images bubbling up in the living mind and the processes evolving there These processes are themselves full of potency and promise will and reflection are no more inconsequential than any other processes bound by natural links to the rest of the world Even if an atomic mechanism suffices to mark the concatenation of everything in nature including the mind it cannot rob what it abstracts from of its natural weight and reality a thread that may suffice to hold the pearls together is not the whole cause of the necklace But this pregnancy and implication of thought in relation to its natural environment is purely empirical Since natural connection is merely a principle of arrangement by which the contiguities of things may be described and inferred there is no difficulty in admitting consciousness and all its works into the web and woof of nature Each psychic episode would be heralded by its material antecedents its transformations would be subject to mechanical laws which would also preside over the further transition from thought into its material expression Sidenote Mechanical efficacy alien to thought s essence This inclusion of mind in nature however is as far as possible from constituting the mind s function and value or its efficacy in a moral and rational sense To have prepared changes in matter would give no rationality to mind unless those changes in turn paved the way to some better mental existence The worth of natural efficacy is therefore always derivative the utility of mind would be no more precious than the utility of matter both borrow all their worth from the part they may play empirically in introducing those moral values which are intrinsic and self sufficing In so far as thought is instrumental it is not worth having any more than matter except for its promise it must terminate in something truly profitable and ultimate which being good in itself may lend value to all that led up to it But this ultimate good is itself consciousness thought rational activity so that what instrumental mentality may have preceded might be abolished without loss if matter suffices to sustain reason in being or if that instrumental mentality is worth retaining it is so only because it already contains some premonition and image of its own fulfilment In a word the value of thought is ideal The material efficacy which may be attributed to it is the proper efficacy of matter an efficacy which matter would doubtless claim if we knew enough of its secret mechanism And when that imputed and incongruous utility was subtracted from ideas they would appear in their proper form of expressions realisations ultimate fruits Sidenote Consciousness transcendental The incongruity of making thought in its moral and logical essence an instrument in the natural world will appear from a different point of view if we shift the discussion for a moment to a transcendental level Since the material world is an object for thought and potential in relation to immediate experience it can hardly lie in the same plane of reality with the thought to which it appears The spectator on this side of the foot lights while surely regarded by the play as a whole cannot expect to figure in its mechanism or to see himself strutting among the actors on the boards He listens and is served being at once impotent and supreme It has been well said that Only the free divine the laws The causeless only know the cause Conversely what in such a transcendental sense is causeless and free will evidently not be causal or determinant being something altogether universal and notional without inherent determinations or specific affinities The objects figuring in consciousness will have implications and will require causes not so the consciousness itself The Ego to which all things appear equally whatever their form or history is the ground of nothing incidental no specific characters or order found in the world can be attributed to its efficacy The march of experience is not determined by the mere fact that experience exists Another experience differently logical might be equally real Consciousness is not itself dynamic for it has no body no idiosyncrasy or particular locus to be the point of origin for definite relationships It is merely an abstract name for the actuality of its random objects All force implication or direction inhere in the constitution of specific objects and live in their interplay Logic is revealed to thought no less than nature is and even what we call invention or fancy is generated not by thought itself but by the chance fertility of nebulous objects floating and breeding in the primeval chaos Where the natural order lapses if it ever does not mind or will or reason can possibly intervene to fill the chasm for these are parcels and expressions of the natural order but only nothingness and pure chance Sidenote and transcendent Thought is thus an expression of natural relations as will is of natural affinities yet consciousness of an object s value while it declares the blind disposition to pursue that object constitutes its entire worth Apart from the pains and satisfactions involved an impulse and its execution would be alike destitute of importance It would matter nothing how chaotic or how orderly the world became or what animal bodies arose or perished there any tendencies afoot in nature whatever they might construct or dissolve would involve no progress or disaster since no preferences would exist to pronounce one eventual state of things better than another These preferences are in themselves if the dynamic order alone be considered works of supererogation expressing force but not producing it like a statue of Hercules but the principle of such preferences the force they express and depend upon is some mechanical impulse itself involved in the causal process Expression gives value to power and the strength of Hercules would have no virtue in it had it contributed nothing to art and civilisation That conceived basis of all life which we call matter would be a mere potentiality an inferred instrument deprived of its function if it did not actually issue in life and consciousness What gives the material world a legitimate status and perpetual pertinence in human discourse is the conscious life it supports and carries in its own direction as a ship carries its passengers or rather as a passion carries its hopes Conscious interests first justify and moralise the mechanisms they express Eventual satisfactions while their form and possibility must be determined by animal tendencies alone render these tendencies vehicles of the good The direction in which benefit shall lie must be determined by irrational impulse but the attainment of benefit consists in crowning that impulse with its ideal achievement Nature dictates what men shall seek and prompts them to seek it a possibility of happiness is thus generated and only its fulfilment would justify nature and man in their common venture Sidenote It is the seat of value Satisfaction is the touchstone of value without reference to it all talk about good and evil progress or decay is merely confused verbiage pure sophistry in which the juggler adroitly withdraws attention from what works the wonder namely that human and moral colouring to which the terms he plays with owe whatever efficacy they have Metaphysicians sometimes so define the good as to make it a matter of no importance not seldom they give that name to the sum of all evils A good absolute in the sense of being divorced from all natural demand and all possible satisfaction would be as remote as possible from goodness to call it good is mere disloyalty to morals brought about by some fantastic or dialectical passion In excellence there is an essential bias an opposition to the possible opposite this bias expresses a mechanical impulse a situation that has stirred the senses and the will Impulse makes value possible and the value becomes actual when the impulse issues in processes that give it satisfaction and have a conscious worth Character is the basis of happiness and happiness the sanction of character D That thought is nature s concomitant expression or entelechy never one of her instruments is a truth long ago divined by the more judicious thinkers like Aristotle and Spinoza but it has not met with general acceptance or even consideration It is obstructed by superficial empiricism which associates the better known aspects of events directly together without considering what mechanical bonds may secretly unite them it is obstructed also by the traditional mythical idealism intent as this philosophy is on proving nature to be the expression of something ulterior and non natural and on hugging the fatal misconception that ideals and eventual goods are creative and miraculous forces without perceiving that it thereby renders goods and ideals perfectly senseless for how can anything be a good at all to which some existing nature is not already directed It may therefore be worth while before leaving this phase of the subject to consider one or two prejudices which might make it sound paradoxical to say as we propose that ideals are ideal and nature natural Sidenote Apparent utility of pain Sidenote Its real impotence Of all forms of consciousness the one apparently most useful is pain which is also the one most immersed in matter and most opposite to ideality and excellence Its utility lies in the warning it gives in trying to escape pain we escape destruction That we desire to escape pain is certain its very definition can hardly go beyond the statement that pain is that element of feeling which we seek to abolish on account of its intrinsic quality That this desire however should know how to initiate remedial action is a notion contrary to experience and in itself unthinkable If pain could have cured us we should long ago have been saved The bitterest quintessence of pain is its helplessness and our incapacity to abolish it The most intolerable torments are those we feel gaining upon us intensifying and prolonging themselves indefinitely This baffling quality so conspicuous in extreme agony is present in all pain and is perhaps its essence If we sought to describe by a circumlocution what is of course a primary sensation we might scarcely do better than to say that pain is consciousness at once intense and empty fixing attention on what contains no character and arrests all satisfactions without offering anything in exchange The horror of pain lies in its intolerable intensity and its intolerable tedium It can accordingly be cured either by sleep or by entertainment In itself it has no resource its violence is quite helpless and its vacancy offers no expedients by which it might be unknotted and relieved Pain is not only impotent in itself but is a sign of impotence in the sufferer Its appearance far from constituting its own remedy is like all other organic phenomena subject to the law of inertia and tends only to its own continuance A man s hatred of his own condition no more helps to improve it than hatred of other people tends to improve them If we allowed ourselves to speak in such a case of efficacy at all we should say that pain perpetuates and propagates itself in various ways now by weakening the system now by prompting convulsive efforts now by spreading to other beings through the contagion of sympathy or vengeance In fact however it merely betrays a maladjustment which has more or less natural stability It may be instantaneous only by its lack of equilibrium it may involve the immediate destruction of one of its factors In that case we fabulously say that the pain has instinctively removed its own cause Pain is here apparently useful because it expresses an incipient tension which the self preserving forces in the organism are sufficient to remove Pain s appearance is then the sign for its instant disappearance not indeed by virtue of its inner nature or of any art it can initiate but merely by virtue of mechanical associations between its cause and its remedy The burned child dreads the fire and reading only the surface of his life fancies that the pain once felt and still remembered is the ground of his new prudence Punishments however are not always efficacious as everyone knows who has tried to govern children or cities by the rod suffering does not bring wisdom nor even memory unless intelligence and docility are already there that is unless the friction which the pain betrayed sufficed to obliterate permanently one of the impulses in conflict This readjustment on which real improvement hangs and which alone makes experience useful does not correspond to the intensity or repetition of the pains endured it corresponds rather to such a plasticity in the organism that the painful conflict is no longer produced Sidenote Preformations involved Threatened destruction would not involve pain unless that threatened destruction were being resisted so that the reaction which pain is supposed to cause must already be taking place before pain can be felt A will without direction cannot be thwarted so that inhibition cannot be the primary source of any effort or of any ideal Determinate impulses must exist already for their inhibition to have taken place or for the pain to arise which is the sign of that inhibition The child s dread of the fire marks the acceleration of that impulse which when he was burned originally enabled him to withdraw his hand and if he did not now shrink in anticipation he would not remember the pain nor know to what to attach his terror Sight now suffices to awaken the reaction which touch at first was needed to produce the will has extended its line of battle and thrown out its scouts farther afield and pain has been driven back to the frontiers of the spirit The conflicting reactions are now peripheral and feeble the pain involved in aversion is nothing to that once involved in the burn Had this aversion to fire been innate as many aversions are no pain would have been caused because no profound maladjustment would have occurred The surviving attraction checked by fear is a remnant of the old disorganisation in the brain which was the seat of conflicting reactions Sidenote Its untoward significance To say that this conflict is the guide to its own issue is to talk without thinking The conflict is the sign of inadequate organisation or of non adaptation in the given organism to the various stimuli which irritate it The reconstruction which follows this conflict when it indeed follows is of course a new and better adaptation so that what involves the pain may often be a process of training which directs reaction into new and smoother channels But the pain is present whether a permanent adaptation is being attained or not It is present in progressive dissolution and in hopeless and exhausting struggles far more than in education or in profitable correction Toothache and sea sickness birth pangs and melancholia are not useful ills The intenser the pain the more probable its uselessness Only in vanishing is it a sign of progress in occurring it is an omen of defeat just as disease is an omen of death although for those diseased already medicine and convalescence may be approaches to health again Where a man s nature is out of gear and his instincts are inordinate suffering may be a sign that a dangerous peace in which impulse was carrying him ignorantly into paths without issue is giving place to a peace with security in which his reconstructed character may respond without friction to the world and enable him to gather a clearer experience and enjoy a purer vitality The utility of pain is thus apparent only and due to empirical haste in collating events that have no regular nor inward relation and even this imputed utility pain has only in proportion to the worthlessness of those who need it Sidenote Perfect function no unconscious A second current prejudice which may deserve notice suggests that an organ when its function is perfect becomes unconscious so that if adaptation were complete life would disappear The well learned routine of any mechanical art passes into habit and habit into unconscious operation The virtuoso is not aware how he manipulates his instrument what was conscious labour in the beginning has become instinct and miracle in the end Thus it might appear that to eliminate friction and difficulty would be to eliminate consciousness and therefore value from the world Life would thus be involved in a contradiction and moral effort in an absurdity for while the constant aim of practice is perfection and that of labour ease and both are without meaning or standard unless directed to the attainment of these ends yet such attainment if it were actual would be worthless so that what alone justifies effort would lack justification and would in fact be incapable of existence The good musician must strive to play perfectly but alas we are told if he succeeded he would have become an automaton The good man must aspire to holiness but alas if he reached holiness his moral life would have evaporated These melodramatic prophecies however need not alarm us They are founded on nothing but rhetoric and small allegiance to any genuine good When we attain perfection of function we lose consciousness of the medium to become more clearly conscious of the result The eye that does its duty gives no report of itself and has no sense of muscular tension or weariness but it gives all the brighter and steadier image of the object seen Consciousness is not lost when focussed and the labour of vision is abolished in its fruition So the musician could he play so divinely as to be unconscious of his body his instrument and the very lapse of time would be only the more absorbed in the harmony more completely master of its unities and beauty At such moments the body s long labour at last brings forth the soul Life from its inception is simply some partial natural harmony raising its voice and bearing witness to its own existence to perfect that harmony is to round out and intensify that life This is the very secret of power of joy of intelligence Not to have understood it is to have passed through life without understanding anything The analogy extends to morals where also the means may be advantageously forgotten when the end has been secured That leisure to which work is directed and that perfection in which virtue would be fulfilled are so far from being apathetic that they are states of pure activity by containing which other acts are rescued from utter passivity and unconsciousness Impure feeling ranges between two extremes absolute want and complete satisfaction The former limit is reached in anguish madness or the agony of death when the accidental flux of things in contradiction has reached its maximum or vanishing point so that the contradiction and the flux themselves disappear by diremption Such feeling denotes inward disorganisation and a hopeless conflict of reflex actions tending toward dissolution The second limit is reached in contemplation when anything is loved understood or enjoyed Synthetic power is then at its height the mind can survey its experience and correlate all the motions it suggests Power in the mind is exactly proportionate to representative scope and representative scope to rational activity A steady vision of all things in their true order and worth results from perfection of function and is its index it secures the greatest distinctness in thought together with the greatest decision wisdom and ease in action as the lightning is brilliant and quick It also secures so far as human energies avail its own perpetuity since what is perfectly adjusted within and without lasts long and goes far Sidenote Inchoate ethics To confuse means with ends and mistake disorder for vitality is not unnatural to minds that hear the hum of mighty workings but can imagine neither the cause nor the fruits of that portentous commotion All functions in such chaotic lives seem instrumental functions It is then supposed that what serves no further purpose can have no value and that he who suffers no offuscation can have no feeling and no life To attain an ideal seems to destroy its worth Moral life at that low level is a fantastic game only not having come in sight of humane and liberal interests The barbarian s intensity is without seriousness and his passion without joy His philosophy which means to glorify all experience and to digest all vice is in truth an expression of pathetic innocence It betrays a rudimentary impulse to follow every beckoning hand to assume that no adventure and no bewitchment can be anything but glorious Such an attitude is intelligible in one who has never seen anything worth seeing nor loved anything worth loving Immaturity could go no farther than to acknowledge no limits defining will and happiness When such limits however are gradually discovered and an authoritative ideal is born of the marriage of human nature with experience happiness becomes at once definite and attainable for adjustment is possible to a world that has a fruitful and intelligible structure Such incoherences which might well arise in ages without traditions may be preserved and fostered by superstition Perpetual servile employments and subjection to an irrational society may render people incapable even of conceiving a liberal life They may come to think their happiness no longer separable from their misery and to fear the large emptiness as they deem it of a happy world Like the prisoner of Chillon after so long a captivity they would regain their freedom with a sigh The wholesome influences of nature however would soon revive their wills contorted by unnatural oppression and a vision of perfection would arise within them upon breathing a purer air Freedom and perfection are synonymous with life The peace they bring is one whose names are also rapture power Clear sight and love for these are parts of peace Sidenote Thought the entelechy of being Thought belongs to the sphere of ultimate results What indeed could be more fitting than that consciousness which is self revealing and transcendentally primary should be its own excuse for being and should contain its own total value together with the total value of everything else What could be more proper than that the whole worth of ideas should be ideal To make an idea instrumental would be to prostitute what being self existent should be self justifying That continual absoluteness which consciousness possesses since in it alone all heaven and earth are at any moment revealed ought to convince any radical and heart searching philosopher that all values should be continually integrated and realised there where all energies are being momently focussed Thought is a fulfilment its function is to lend utility to its causes and to make actual those conceived and subterranean processes which find in it their ultimate expression Thought is nature represented it is potential energy producing life and becoming an actual appearance Sidenote Its exuberance The conditions of consciousness however are far from being its only theme As consciousness bears a transcendent relation to the dynamic world for it is actual and spiritual while the dynamic is potential and material so it may be exuberant and irresponsibly rich Although its elements in point of distribution and derivation are grounded in matter as music is in vibrations yet in point of character the result may be infinitely redundant The complete musician would devote but a small part of his attention to the basis of music its mechanism psychology or history Long before he had represented to his mind the causes of his art he would have proceeded to practise and enjoy it So sense and imagination passion and reason may enrich the soil that breeds them and cover it with a maze of flowers The theme of consciousness is accordingly far more than the material world which constitutes its basis though this also is one of its themes thought is no less at home in various expressions and embroideries with which the material world can be overlaid in imagination The material world is conceived by digging beneath experience to find its cause it is the efficacious structure and skeleton of things This is the subject of scientific retrospect and calculation The forces disclosed by physical studies are of course not directed to producing a mind that might merely describe them A force is expressed in many other ways than by being defined it may be felt resisted embodied transformed or symbolised Forces work they are not like mathematical concepts exhausted in description From that matter which might be describable in mechanical formulae there issue notwithstanding all manner of forms and harmonies visible audible imaginable and passionately prized Every phase of the ideal world emanates from the natural and loudly proclaims its origin by the interest it takes in natural existences of which it gives a rational interpretation Sense art religion society express nature exuberantly and in symbols long before science is added to represent by a different abstraction the mechanism which nature contains FOOTNOTES Footnote D Aristippus asked Socrates whether he knew anything good so that if he answered by naming food or drink or money or health or strength or valour or anything of that sort he might at once show that it was sometimes an evil Socrates however knew very well that if anything troubles us what we demand is its cure and he replied in the most pertinent fashion Are you asking me he said if I know anything good for a fever Oh no said the other Or for sore eyes Not that either Or for hunger No not for hunger Well then said he if you ask me whether I know a good that is good for nothing I neither know it nor want to know it Xenophon Memorabilia iii eight CHAPTER X THE MEASURE OF VALUES IN REFLECTION Sidenote Honesty in hedonism To put value in pleasure and pain regarding a given quantity of pain as balancing a given quantity of pleasure is to bring to practical ethics a worthy intention to be clear and what is more precious an undoubted honesty not always found in those moralists who maintain the opposite opinion and care more for edification than for truth For in spite of all logical and psychological scruples conduct that should not justify itself somehow by the satisfactions secured and the pains avoided would not justify itself at all The most instinctive and unavoidable desire is forthwith chilled if you discover that its ultimate end is to be a preponderance of suffering and what arrests this desire is not fear or weakness but conscience in its most categorical and sacred guise Who would not be ashamed to acknowledge or to propose so inhuman an action By sad experience rooted impulses may be transformed or even obliterated And quite intelligibly for the idea of pain is already the sign and the beginning of a certain stoppage To imagine failure is to interpret ideally a felt inhibition To prophesy a check would be impossible but for an incipient movement already meeting an incipient arrest Intensified this prophecy becomes its own fulfilment and totally inhibits the opposed tendency Therefore a mind that foresees pain to be the ultimate result of action cannot continue unreservedly to act seeing that its foresight is the conscious transcript of a recoil already occurring Conversely the mind that surrenders itself wholly to any impulse must think that its execution would be delightful A perfectly wise and representative will therefore would aim only at what in its attainment could continue to be aimed at and approved and this is another way of saying that its aim would secure the maximum of satisfaction eventually possible Sidenote Necessary qualifications In spite however of this involution of pain and pleasure in all deliberate forecast and volition pain and pleasure are not the ultimate sources of value A correct psychology and logic cannot allow that an eventual and in strictness unpresentable feeling can determine any act or volition but must insist that on the contrary all beliefs about future experience with all premonition of its emotional quality is based on actual impulse and feeling so that the source of value is nothing but the inner fountain of life and imagination and the object of pursuit nothing but the ideal object counterpart of the present demand Abstract satisfaction is not pursued but if the will and the environment are constant satisfaction will necessarily be felt in achieving the object desired A rejection of hedonistic psychology therefore by no means involves any opposition to eudaemonism in ethics Eudaemonism is another name for wisdom there is no other moral morality Any system that for some sinister reason should absolve itself from good will toward all creatures and make it somehow a duty to secure their misery would be clearly disloyal to reason humanity and justice Nor would it be hard in that case to point out what superstition what fantastic obsession or what private fury had made those persons blind to prudence and kindness in so plain a matter Happiness is the only sanction of life where happiness fails existence remains a mad and lamentable experiment The question however what happiness shall consist in its complexion if it should once arise can only be determined by reference to natural demands and capacities so that while satisfaction by the attainment of ends can alone justify their pursuit this pursuit itself must exist first and be spontaneous thereby fixing the goals of endeavour and distinguishing the states in which satisfaction might be found Natural disposition therefore is the principle of preference and makes morality and happiness possible Sidenote The will must judge The standard of value like every standard must be one Pleasures and pains are not only infinitely diverse but even if reduced to their total bulk and abstract opposition they remain two Their values must be compared and obviously neither one can be the standard by which to judge the other This standard is an ideal involved in the judgment passed whatever that judgment may be Thus when Petrarch says that a thousand pleasures are not worth one pain he establishes an ideal of value deeper than either pleasure or pain an ideal which makes a life of satisfaction marred by a single pang an offence and a horror to his soul If our demand for rationality is less acute and the miscellaneous affirmations of the will carry us along with a well fed indifference to some single tragedy within us we may aver that a single pang is only the thousandth part of a thousand pleasures and that a life so balanced is nine hundred and ninety nine times better than nothing This judgment for all its air of mathematical calculation in truth expresses a choice as irrational as Petrarch s It merely means that as a matter of fact the mixed prospect presented to us attracts our wills and attracts them vehemently So that the only possible criterion for the relative values of pains and pleasures is the will that chooses among them or among combinations of them nor can the intensity of pleasures and pains apart from the physical violence of their expression be judged by any other standard than by the power they have when represented to control the will s movement Sidenote Injustice inherent in representation Here we come upon one of those initial irrationalities in the world theories of all sorts since they are attempts to find rationality in things are in serious danger of overlooking In estimating the value of any experience our endeavour our pretension is to weigh the value which that experience possesses when it is actual But to weigh is to compare and to compare is to represent since the transcendental isolation and self sufficiency of actual experience precludes its lying side by side with another datum like two objects given in a single consciousness Successive values to be compared must be represented but the conditions of representation are such that they rob objects of the values they had at their first appearance to substitute the values they possess at their recurrence For representation mirrors consciousness only by mirroring its objects and the emotional reaction upon those objects cannot be represented directly but is approached by indirect methods through an imitation or assimilation of will to will and emotion to emotion Only by the instrumentality of signs like gesture or language can we bring ourselves to reproduce in some measure an absent experience and to feel some premonition of its absolute value Apart from very elaborate and cumulative suggestions to the contrary we should always attribute to an event in every other experience the value which its image now had in our own But in that case the pathetic fallacy would be present for a volitional reaction upon an idea in one vital context is no index to what the volitional reaction would be in another vital context upon the situation which that idea represents Sidenote AEsthetic and speculative cruelty This divergence falsifies all representation of life and renders it initially cruel sentimental and mythical We dislike to trample on a flower because its form makes a kind of blossoming in our own fancy which we call beauty but we laugh at pangs we endured in childhood and feel no tremor at the incalculable sufferings of all mankind beyond our horizon because no imitable image is involved to start a contrite thrill in our own bosom The same cruelty appears in aesthetic pleasures in lust war and ambition in the illusions of desire and memory in the unsympathetic quality of theory everywhere which regards the uniformities of cause and effect and the beauties of law as a justification for the inherent evils in the experience described in the unjust judgments finally of mystical optimism that sinks so completely into its subjective commotion as to mistake the suspension of all discriminating and representative faculties for a true union in things and the blur of its own ecstasy for a universal glory These pleasures are all on the sensuous plane the plane of levity and unintentional wickedness but in their own sphere they have their own value AEsthetic and speculative emotions make an important contribution to the total worth of existence but they do not abolish the evils of that experience on which they reflect with such ruthless satisfaction The satisfaction is due to a private flood of emotion submerging the images present in fancy or to the exercise of a new intellectual function like that of abstraction synthesis or comparison Such a faculty when fully developed is capable of yielding pleasures as intense and voluminous as those proper to rudimentary animal functions wrongly supposed to be more vital The acme of vitality lies in truth in the most comprehensive and penetrating thought The rhythms the sweep the impetuosity of impassioned contemplation not only contain in themselves a great vitality and potency but they often succeed in engaging the lower functions in a sympathetic vibration and we see the whole body and soul rapt as we say and borne along by the harmonies of imagination and thought In these fugitive moments of intoxication the detail of truth is submerged and forgotten The emotions which would be suggested by the parts are replaced by the rapid emotion of transition between them and this exhilaration in survey this mountain top experience is supposed to be also the truest vision of reality Absorption in a supervening function is mistaken for comprehension of all fact and this inevitably since all consciousness of particular facts and of their values is then submerged in the torrent of cerebral excitement Sidenote Imputed values their inconstancy That luminous blindness which in these cases takes an extreme form is present in principle throughout all reflection We tend to regard our own past as good only when we still find some value in the memory of it Last year last week even the feelings of the last five minutes are not otherwise prized than by the pleasure we may still have in recalling them the pulsations of pleasure or pain which they contained we do not even seek to remember or to discriminate The period is called happy or unhappy merely as its ideal representation exercises fascination or repulsion over the present will Hence the revulsion after physical indulgence often most violent when the pleasure judged by its concomitant expression and by the desire that heralded it was most intense For the strongest passions are intermittent so that the unspeakable charm which their objects possess for a moment is lost immediately and becomes unintelligible to a chilled and cheated reflection The situation when yet unrealised irresistibly solicited the will and seemed to promise incomparable ecstasy and perhaps it yields an indescribable moment of excitement and triumph a moment only half appropriated into waking experience so fleeting is it and so unfit the mind to possess or retain its tenser attitudes The same situation if revived in memory when the system is in an opposite and relaxed state forfeits all power to attract and fills the mind rather with aversion and disgust For all violent pleasures as Shakespeare says are cruel and not to be trusted A bliss in proof and proved a very woe Before a joy proposed behind a dream Enjoyed no sooner but despised straight Past reason hunted and no sooner had Past reason hated Sidenote Methods of control Past reason indeed For although an impulsive injustice is inherent in the very nature of representation and cannot be overcome altogether yet reason by attending to all the evidences that can be gathered and by confronting the first pronouncement by others fetched from every quarter of experience has power to minimise the error and reach a practically just estimate of absent values This achieved rightness can be tested by comparing two experiences each when it is present with the same conventional permanent object chosen to be their expression A love song for instance can be pronounced adequate or false by various lovers and it can thus remain a sort of index to the fleeting sentiments once confronted with it Reason has to be sure no independent method of discovering values They must be rated as the sensitive balance of present inclination when completely laden shows them to stand In estimating values reason is reduced to data furnished by the mechanical processes of ideation and instinct as in framing all knowledge an absent joy can only be represented by a tinge of emotion dyeing an image that pictures the situation in which the joy was felt but the suggested value being once projected into the potential world that land of inferred being this projection may be controlled and corroborated by other suggestions and associations relevant to it which it is the function of reason to collect and compare A right estimate of absent values must be conventional and mediated by signs Direct sympathies which suffice for instinctive present company operation fail to transmit alien or opposite pleasures They over emphasise momentary relations while they necessarily ignore permanent bonds Therefore the same intellect that puts a mechanical reality behind perception must put a moral reality behind sympathy Sidenote Example of fame Fame for example is a good its value arises from a certain movement of will and emotion which is elicited by the thought that one s name might be associated with great deeds and with the memory of them The glow of this thought bathes the object it describes so that fame is felt to have a value quite distinct from that which the expectation of fame may have in the present moment Should this expectation be foolish and destined to prove false it would have no value and be indeed the more ludicrous and repulsive the more pleasure its dupe took in it and the longer his illusion lasted The heart is resolutely set on its object and despises its own phenomena not reflecting that its emotions have first revealed that object s worth and alone can maintain it For if a man cares nothing for fame what value has it This projection of interest into excellence takes place mechanically and is in the first instance irrational Did all glow die out from memory and expectation the events represented remaining unchanged we should be incapable of assigning any value to those events just as if eyes were lacking we should be incapable of assigning colour to the world which would notwithstanding remain as it is at present So fame could never be regarded as a good if the idea of fame gave no pleasure yet now because the idea pleases the reality is regarded as a good absolute and intrinsic This moral hypostasis involved in the love of fame could never be rationalised but would subsist unmitigated or die out unobserved were it not associated with other conceptions and other habits of estimating values For the passions are humanised only by being juxtaposed and forced to live together As fame is not man s only goal and the realisation of it comes into manifold relations with other interests no less vivid we are able to criticise the impulse to pursue it Fame may be the consequence of benefits conferred upon mankind In that case the abstract desire for fame would be reinforced and as it were justified by its congruity with the more voluminous and stable desire to benefit our fellow men Or again the achievements which insure fame and the genius that wins it probably involve a high degree of vitality and many profound inward satisfactions to the man of genius himself so that again the abstract love of fame would be reinforced by the independent and more rational desire for a noble and comprehensive experience On the other hand the minds of posterity whose homage is craved by the ambitious man will probably have very false conceptions of his thoughts and purposes What they will call by his name will be in a great measure a fiction of their own fancy and not his portrait at all Would Caesar recognise himself in the current notions of him drawn from some school history or perhaps from Shakespeare s satirical portrait Would Christ recognise himself upon our altars or in the romances about him constructed by imaginative critics And not only is remote experience thus hopelessly lost and misrepresented but even this nominal memorial ultimately disappears The love of fame if tempered by these and similar considerations would tend to take a place in man s ideal such as its roots in human nature and its functions in human progress might seem to justify It would be rationalised in the only sense in which any primary desire can be rationalised namely by being combined with all others in a consistent whole How much of it would survive a thorough sifting and criticism may well remain in doubt The result would naturally differ for different temperaments and in different states of society The wisest men perhaps while they would continue to feel some love of honour and some interest in their image in other minds would yet wish that posterity might praise them as Sallust praises Cato by saying Esse quam videri bonus maluit he preferred worth to reputation Sidenote Disproportionate interest in the aesthetic The fact that value is attributed to absent experience according to the value experience has in representation appears again in one of the most curious anomalies in human life the exorbitant interest which thought and reflection take in the form of experience and the slight account they make of its intensity or volume Sea sickness and child birth when they are over the pangs of despised love when that love is finally forgotten or requited the travail of sin when once salvation is assured all melt away and dissolve like a morning mist leaving a clear sky without a vestige of sorrow So also with merely remembered and not reproducible pleasures the buoyancy of youth when absurdity is not yet tedious the rapture of sport or passion the immense peace found in a mystical surrender to the universal all these generous ardours count for nothing when they are once gone The memory of them cannot cure a fit of the blues nor raise an irritable mortal above some petty act of malice or vengeance or reconcile him to foul weather An ode of Horace on the other hand a scientific monograph or a well written page of music is a better antidote to melancholy than thinking on all the happiness which one s own life or that of the universe may ever have contained Why should overwhelming masses of suffering and joy affect imagination so little while it responds sympathetically to aesthetic and intellectual irritants of very slight intensity objects that it must be confessed are of almost no importance to the welfare of mankind Why should we be so easily awed by artistic genius and exalt men whose works we know only by name perhaps and whose influence upon society has been infinitesimal like a Pindar or a Leonardo while we regard great merchants and inventors as ignoble creatures in comparison Why should we smile at the inscription in Westminster Abbey which calls the inventor of the spinning jenny one of the true benefactors of mankind Is it not probable on the whole that he has had a greater and less equivocal influence on human happiness than Shakespeare with all his plays and sonnets But the cheapness of cotton cloth produces no particularly delightful image in the fancy to be compared with Hamlet or Imogen There is a prodigious selfishness in dreams they live perfectly deaf and invulnerable amid the cries of the real world Sidenote Irrational religious allegiance The same aesthetic bias appears in the moral sphere Utilitarians have attempted to show that the human conscience commends precisely those actions which tend to secure general happiness and that the notions of justice and virtue prevailing in any age vary with its social economy and the prizes it is able to attain And if due allowance is made for the complexity of the subject we may reasonably admit that the precepts of obligatory morality bear this relation to the general welfare thus virtue means courage in a soldier probity in a merchant and chastity in a woman But if we turn from the morality required of all to the type regarded as perfect and ideal we find no such correspondence to the benefits involved The selfish imagination intervenes here and attributes an absolute and irrational value to those figures that entertain it with the most absorbing and dreamful emotions The character of Christ for instance which even the least orthodox among us are in the habit of holding up as a perfect model is not the character of a benefactor but of a martyr a spirit from a higher world lacerated in its passage through this uncomprehending and perverse existence healing and forgiving out of sheer compassion sustained by his inner affinities to the supernatural and absolutely disenchanted with all earthly or political goods Christ did not suffer like Prometheus for having bestowed or wished to bestow any earthly blessing the only blessing he bequeathed was the image of himself upon the cross whereby men might be comforted in their own sorrows rebuked in their worldliness driven to put their trust in the supernatural and united by their common indifference to the world in one mystic brotherhood As men learned these lessons or were inwardly ready to learn them they recognised more and more clearly in Jesus their heaven sent redeemer and in following their own conscience and desperate idealism into the desert or the cloister in ignoring all civic virtues and allowing the wealth art and knowledge of the pagan world to decay they began what they felt to be an imitation of Christ All natural impulses all natural ideals subsisted of course beneath this theoretic asceticism writhed under its unearthly control and broke out in frequent violent irruptions against it in the life of each man as well as in the course of history Yet the image of Christ remained in men s hearts and retained its marvellous authority so that even now when so many who call themselves Christians being pure children of nature are without the least understanding of what Christianity came to do in the world they still offer his person and words a sincere if inarticulate worship trying to transform that sacrificial and crucified spirit as much as their bungling fancy can into a patron of Philistia Felix Why this persistent adoration of a character that is the extreme negation of all that these good souls inwardly value and outwardly pursue Because the image of Christ and the associations of his religion apart from their original import remain rooted in the mind they remain the focus for such wayward emotions and mystic intuitions as their magnetism can still attract and the value which this hallowed compound possesses in representation is transferred to its nominal object and Christ is the conventional name for all the impulses of religion no matter how opposite to the Christian Sidenote Pathetic idealizations Symbols when their significance has been great outlive their first significance The image of Christ was a last refuge to the world it was a consolation and a new ground for hope from which no misfortune could drive the worshipper Its value as an idea was therefore immense as to the lover the idea of his untasted joys or to the dying man the idea of health and invigorating sunshine The votary can no more ask himself whether his deity in its total operation has really blessed him and deserved his praise than the lover can ask if his lady is worth pursuing or the expiring cripple whether it would be in very truth a benefit to be once more young and whole That life is worth living is the most necessary of assumptions and were it not assumed the most impossible of conclusions Experience by its passive weight of joy and sorrow can neither inspire nor prevent enthusiasm only a present ideal will avail to move the will and if realised to justify it A saint s halo is an optical illusion it glorifies his actions whatever their eventual influence in the world because they seem to have when rehearsed dramatically some tenderness or rapture or miracle about them Thus it appears that the great figures of art or religion together with all historic and imaginative ideals advance insensibly on the values they represent The image has more lustre than the original and is often the more important and influential fact Things are esteemed as they weigh in representation A memorable thing people say in their eulogies little thinking to touch the ground of their praise For things are called great because they are memorable they are not remembered because they were great The deepest pangs the highest joys the widest influences are lost to apperception in its haste and if in some rational moment reconstructed and acknowledged are soon forgotten again and cut off from living consideration But the emptiest experience even the most pernicious tendency if embodied in a picturesque image if reverberating in the mind with a pleasant echo is idolised and enshrined Fortunate indeed was Achilles that Homer sang of him and fortunate the poets that make a public titillation out of their sorrows and ignorance This imputed and posthumous fortune is the only happiness they have The favours of memory are extended to those feeble realities and denied to the massive substance of daily experience When life dies when what was present becomes a memory its ghost flits still among the living feared or worshipped not for the experience it once possessed but for the aspect it now wears Yet this injustice in representation speculatively so offensive is practically excusable for it is in one sense right and useful that all things whatever their original or inherent dignity should be valued at each moment only by their present function and utility Sidenote Inevitable impulsiveness in prophecy Sidenote The test a controlled present ideal The error involved in attributing value to the past is naturally aggravated when values are to be assigned to the future In the latter case imagination cannot be controlled by circumstantial evidence and is consequently the only basis for judgment But as the conception of a thing naturally evokes an emotion different from that involved in its presence ideals of what is desirable for the future contain no warrant that the experience desired would when actual prove to be acceptable and good An ideal carries no extrinsic assurance that its realisation would be a benefit To convince ourselves that an ideal has rational authority and represents a better experience than the actual condition it is contrasted with we must control the prophetic image by as many circumlocutions as possible As in the case of fame we must buttress or modify our spontaneous judgment with all the other judgments that the object envisaged can prompt we must make our ideal harmonise with all experience rather than with a part only The possible error remains even then but a practical mind will always accept the risk of error when it has made every possible correction A rational will is not a will that has reason for its basis or that possesses any other proof that its realisation would be possible or good than the oracle which a living will inspires and pronounces The rationality possible to the will lies not in its source but in its method An ideal cannot wait for its realisation to prove its validity To deserve adhesion it needs only to be adequate as an ideal that is to express completely what the soul at present demands and to do justice to all extant interests CHAPTER XI SOME ABSTRACT CONDITIONS OF THE IDEAL Sidenote The ultimate end a resultant Reason s function is to embody the good but the test of excellence is itself ideal therefore before we can assure ourselves that reason has been manifested in any given case we must make out the reasonableness of the ideal that inspires us And in general before we can convince ourselves that a Life of Reason or practice guided by science and directed toward spiritual goods is at all worth having we must make out the possibility and character of its ultimate end Yet each ideal is its own justification so that the only sense in which an ultimate end can be established and become a test of general progress is this that a harmony and company operation of impulses should be conceived leading to the maximum satisfaction possible in the whole community of spirits affected by our action Now without considering for the present any concrete Utopia such for instance as Plato s Republic or the heavenly beatitude described by theologians we may inquire what formal qualities are imposed on the ideal by its nature and function and by the relation it bears to experience and to desire Sidenote Demands the substance of ideals The ideal has the same relation to given demands that the reality has to given perceptions In the face of the ideal particular demands forfeit their authority and the goods to which a particular being may aspire cease to be absolute nay the satisfaction of desire comes to appear an indifferent or unholy thing when compared or opposed to the ideal to be realised So precisely in perception flying impressions come to be regarded as illusory when contrasted with a stable conception of reality Yet of course flying impressions are the only material out of which that conception can be formed Life itself is a flying impression and had we no personal and instant experience importuning us at each successive moment we should have no occasion to ask for a reality at all and no materials out of which to construct so gratuitous an idea In the same way present demands are the only materials and occasions for any ideal without demands the ideal would have no locus standi or foothold in the world no power no charm and no prerogative If the ideal can confront particular desires and put them to shame that happens only because the ideal is the object of a more profound and voluminous desire and embodies the good which they blindly and perhaps deviously pursue Demands could not be misdirected goods sought could not be false if the standard by which they are to be corrected were not constructed out of them Otherwise each demand would render its object a detached absolute and unimpeachable good But when each desire in turn has singed its wings and retired before some disillusion reflection may set in to suggest residual satisfactions that may still be possible or some shifting of the ground by which much of what was hoped for may yet be attained Sidenote Discipline of the will Sidenote Demands made practical and consistent The force for this new trial is but the old impulse renewed this new hope is a justified remnant of the old optimism Each passion in this second campaign takes the field conscious that it has indomitable enemies and ready to sign a reasonable peace and even to capitulate before superior forces Such tameness may be at first merely a consequence of exhaustion and prudence but a mortal will though absolute in its deliverances is very far from constant and its sacrifices soon constitute a habit its exile a new home The old ambition now proved to be unrealisable begins to seem capricious and extravagant the circle of possible satisfactions becomes the field of conventional happiness Experience which brings about this humbler and more prosaic state of mind has its own imaginative fruits Among those forces which compelled each particular impulse to abate its pretensions the most conspicuous were other impulses other interests active in oneself and in one s neighbours When the power of these alien demands is recognised they begin in a physical way to be respected when an adjustment to them is sought they begin to be understood for it is only by studying their expression and tendency that the degree of their hostility can be measured But to understand is more than to forgive it is to adopt and the passion that thought merely to withdraw into a sullen and maimed self indulgence can feel itself expanded by sympathies which in its primal vehemence it would have excluded altogether Experience in bringing humility brings intelligence also Personal interests begin to seem relative factors only in a general voluminous welfare expressed in many common institutions and arts moulds for whatever is communicable or rational in every passion Each original impulse when trimmed down more or less according to its degree of savageness can then inhabit the state and every good when sufficiently transfigured can be found again in the general ideal The factors may indeed often be unrecognisable in the result so much does the process of domestication transform them but the interests that animated them survive this discipline and the new purpose is really esteemed else the ideal would have no moral force An ideal representing no living interest would be irrelevant to practice just as a conception of reality would be irrelevant to perception which should not be composed of the materials that sense supplies or should not re embody actual sensations in an intelligible system Sidenote The ideal natural Here we have then one condition which the ideal must fulfil it must be a resultant or synthesis of impulses already afoot An ideal out of relation to the actual demands of living beings is so far from being an ideal that it is not even a good The pursuit of it would be not the acme but the atrophy of moral endeavour Mysticism and asceticism run into this danger when the intent to be faithful to a supreme good too symbolically presented breeds a superstitious repugnance toward everything naturally prized So also an artificial scepticism can regard all experience as deceptive by contrasting it with the chimera of an absolute reality As an absolute reality would be indescribable and without a function in the elucidation of phenomena so a supreme good which was good for nobody would be without conceivable value Respect for such an idol is a dialectical superstition and if zeal for that shibboleth should actually begin to inhibit the exercise of intelligent choice or the development of appreciation for natural pleasures it would constitute a reversal of the Life of Reason which if persistently indulged in could only issue in madness or revert to imbecility Sidenote Need of unity and finality Sidenote Ideals of nothing No less important however than this basis which the ideal must have in extant demands is the harmony with which reason must endow it If without the one the ideal loses its value without the other it loses its finality Human nature is fluid and imperfect its demands are expressed in incidental desires elicited by a variety of objects which perhaps cannot coexist in the world If we merely transcribe these miscellaneous demands or allow these floating desires to dictate to us the elements of the ideal we shall never come to a Whole or to an End One new fancy after another will seem an embodiment of perfection and we shall contradict each expression of our ideal by every other A certain school of philosophy if we may give that name to the systematic neglect of reason has so immersed itself in the contemplation of this sort of inconstancy which is indeed prevalent enough in the world that it has mistaken it for a normal and necessary process The greatness of the ideal has been put in its vagueness and in an elasticity which makes it wholly indeterminate and inconsistent The goal of progress beside being thus made to lie at every point of the compass in succession is removed to an infinite distance whereby the possibility of attaining it is denied and progress itself is made illusory For a progress must be directed to attaining some definite type of life the counterpart of a given natural endowment and nothing can be called an improvement which does not contain an appreciable benefit A victory would be a mockery that left us for some new reason as much impeded as before and as far removed from peace The picture of life as an eternal war for illusory ends was drawn at first by satirists unhappily with too much justification in the facts Some grosser minds too undisciplined to have ever pursued a good either truly attainable or truly satisfactory then proceeded to mistake that satire on human folly for a sober account of the whole universe and finally others were not ashamed to represent it as the ideal itself so soon is the dyer s hand subdued to what it works in A barbarous mind cannot conceive life like health as a harmony continually preserved or restored and containing those natural and ideal activities which disease merely interrupts Such a mind never having tasted order cannot conceive it and identifies progress with new conflicts and life with continual death Its deification of unreason instability and strife comes partly from piety and partly from inexperience There is piety in saluting nature in her perpetual flux and in thinking that since no equilibrium is maintained for ever none perhaps deserves to be There is inexperience in not considering that wherever interests and judgments exist the natural flux has fallen so to speak into a vortex and created a natural good a cumulative life and an ideal purpose Art science government human nature itself are self defining and self preserving by partly fixing a structure they fix an ideal But the barbarian can hardly regard such things for to have distinguished and fostered them would be to have founded a civilisation Sidenote Darwin on moral sense Reason s function in defining the ideal is in principle extremely simple although all time and all existence would have to be gathered in before the applications of that principle could be exhausted A better example of its essential working could hardly be found than one which Darwin gives to illustrate the natural origin of moral sense A swallow impelled by migratory instincts to leave a nest full of unfledged young would endure a moral conflict The more lasting impulse memory being assumed would prompt a moral judgment when it emerged again after being momentarily obscured by an intermittent passion While the mother bird is feeding or brooding over her nestlings the maternal instinct is probably stronger than the migratory but the instinct which is more persistent gains the victory and at last at a moment when her young ones are not in sight she takes flight and deserts them When arrived at the end of her long journey and the migratory instinct ceases to act what an agony of remorse each bird would feel if from being endowed with great mental activity she could not prevent the image continually passing before her mind of her young ones perishing in the bleak north from cold and hunger E She would doubtless upbraid herself like any sinner for a senseless perfidy to her own dearest good The perfidy however was not wholly senseless because the forgotten instinct was not less natural and necessary than the remembered one and its satisfaction no less true Temptation has the same basis as duty The difference is one of volume and permanence in the rival satisfactions and the attitude conscience will assume toward these depends more on the representability of the demands compared than on their original vehemence or ultimate results Sidenote Conscience and reason compared A passionate conscience may thus arise in the play of impulses differing in permanence without involving a judicial exercise of reason Nor does such a conscience involve a synthetic ideal but only the ideal presence of particular demands Conflicts in the conscience are thus quite natural and would continually occur but for the narrowness that commonly characterises a mind inspired by passion A life of sin and repentance is as remote as possible from a Life of Reason Yet the same situation which produces conscience and the sense of duty is an occasion for applying reason to action and for forming an ideal so soon as the demands and satisfactions concerned are synthesised and balanced imaginatively The stork might do more than feel the conflict of his two impulses he might do more than embody in alternation the eloquence of two hostile thoughts He might pass judgment upon them impartially and in the felt presence of both conceive what might be a union or compromise between them This resultant object of pursuit conceived in reflection and in itself the initial goal of neither impulse is the ideal of a mind occupied by the two it is the aim prescribed by reason under the circumstances It differs from the prescription of conscience in that conscience is often the spokesman of one interest or of a group of interests in opposition to other primary impulses which it would annul altogether while reason and the ideal are not active forces nor embodiments of passion at all but merely a method by which objects of desire are compared in reflection The goodness of an end is felt inwardly by conscience by reason it can be only taken upon trust and registered as a fact For conscience the object of an opposed will is an evil for reason it is a good on the same ground as any other good because it is pursued by a natural impulse and can bring a real satisfaction Conscience in fine is a party to moral strife reason an observer of it who however plays the most important and beneficent part in the outcome by suggesting the terms of peace This suggested peace inspired by sympathy and by knowledge of the world is the ideal which borrows its value and practical force from the irrational impulses which it embodies and borrows its final authority from the truth with which it recognises them all and the necessity by which it imposes on each such sacrifices as are requisite to a general harmony Sidenote Reason imposes no new sacrifice Could each impulse apart from reason gain perfect satisfaction it would doubtless laugh at justice The divine to exercise suasion must use an argumentum ad hominem reason must justify itself to the heart But perfect satisfaction is what an irresponsible impulse can never hope for all other impulses though absent perhaps from the mind are none the less present in nature and have possession of the field through their physical basis They offer effectual resistance to a reckless intruder To disregard them is therefore to gain nothing reason far from creating the partial renunciation and proportionate sacrifices which it imposes really minimises them by making them voluntary and fruitful The ideal which may seem to wear so severe a frown really fosters all possible pleasures what it retrenches is nothing to what blind forces and natural catastrophes would otherwise cut off while it sweetens what it sanctions adding to spontaneous enjoyments a sense of moral security and an intellectual light Sidenote Natural goods attainable and compatible in principle Those who are guided only by an irrational conscience can hardly understand what a good life would be Their Utopias have to be supernatural in order that the irresponsible rules which they call morality may lead by miracle to happy results But such a magical and undeserved happiness if it were possible would be unsavoury only one phase of human nature would be satisfied by it and so impoverished an ideal cannot really attract the will For human nature has been moulded by the same natural forces among which its ideal has to be fulfilled and apart from a certain margin of wild hopes and extravagances the things man s heart desires are attainable under his natural conditions and would not be attainable elsewhere The conflict of desires and interests in the world is not radical any more than man s dissatisfaction with his own nature can be for every particular ideal being an expression of human nature in operation must in the end involve the primary human faculties and cannot be essentially incompatible with any other ideal which involves them too To adjust all demands to one ideal and adjust that ideal to its natural conditions in other words to live the Life of Reason is something perfectly possible for those demands being akin to one another in spite of themselves can be better furthered by company operation than by blind conflict while the ideal far from demanding any profound revolution in nature merely expresses her actual tendency and forecasts what her perfect functioning would be Sidenote Harmony the formal and intrinsic demand of reason Reason as such represents or rather constitutes a single formal interest the interest in harmony When two interests are simultaneous and fall within one act of apprehension the desirability of harmonising them is involved in the very effort to realise them together If attention and imagination are steady enough to face this implication and not to allow impulse to oscillate between irreconcilable tendencies reason comes into being Henceforth things actual and things desired are confronted by an ideal which has both pertinence and authority FOOTNOTES Footnote E Descent of Man chapter iii CHAPTER XII FLUX AND CONSTANCY IN HUMAN NATURE Sidenote Respectable tradition that human nature is fixed A conception of something called human nature arises not unnaturally on observing the passions of men passions which under various disguises seem to reappear in all ages and countries The tendency of Greek philosophy with its insistence on general concepts was to define this idea of human nature still further and to encourage the belief that a single and identical essence present in all men determined their powers and ideal destiny Christianity while it transposed the human ideal and dwelt on the superhuman affinities of man did not abandon the notion of a specific humanity On the contrary such a notion was implied in the Fall and Redemption in the Sacraments and in the universal validity of Christian doctrine and precept For if human nature were not one there would be no propriety in requiring all men to preserve unanimity in faith or conformity in conduct Human nature was likewise the entity which the English psychologists set themselves to describe and Kant was so entirely dominated by the notion of a fixed and universal human nature that its constancy in his opinion was the source of all natural as well as moral laws Had he doubted for a moment the stability of human nature the foundations of his system would have fallen out the forms of perception and thought would at once have lost their boasted necessity since to morrow might dawn upon new categories and a modified a priori intuition of space or time and the avenue would also have been closed by which man was led through his unalterable moral sentiments to assumptions about metaphysical truths Sidenote Contrary currents of opinion Sidenote Evolution The force of this long tradition has been broken however by two influences of great weight in recent times the theory of evolution and the revival of pantheism The first has reintroduced flux into the conception of existence and the second into the conception of values If natural species are fluid and pass into one another human nature is merely a name for a group of qualities found by chance in certain tribes of animals a group to which new qualities are constantly tending to attach themselves while other faculties become extinct now in whole races now in sporadic individuals Human nature is therefore a variable and its ideal cannot have a greater constancy than the demands to which it gives expression Nor can the ideal of one man or one age have any authority over another since the harmony existing in their nature and interests is accidental and each is a transitional phase in an indefinite evolution The crystallisation of moral forces at any moment is consequently to be explained by universal not by human laws the philosopher s interest cannot be to trace the implications of present and unstable desires but rather to discover the mechanical law by which these desires have been generated and will be transformed so that they will change irrevocably both their basis and their objects Sidenote Pantheism To this picture of physical instability furnished by popular science are to be added the mystical self denials involved in pantheism These come to reinforce the doctrine that human nature is a shifting thing with the sentiment that it is a finite and unworthy one for every determination of being it is said has its significance as well as its origin in the infinite continuum of which it is a part Forms are limitations and limitations according to this philosophy would be defects so that man s only goal would be to escape humanity and lose himself in the divine nebula that has produced and must invalidate each of his thoughts and ideals As there would be but one spirit in the world and that infinite so there would be but one ideal and that indiscriminate The despair which the naturalist s view of human instability might tend to produce is turned by this mystical initiation into a sort of ecstasy and the deluge of conformity suddenly submerges that Life of Reason which science seemed to condemn to gradual extinction Sidenote Instability in existences does not dethrone their ideals Reason is a human function Though the name of reason has been applied to various alleged principles of cosmic life vital or dialectical these principles all lack the essence of rationality in that they are not conscious movements toward satisfaction not in other words moral and beneficent principles at all Be the instability of human nature what it may therefore the instability of reason is not less since reason is but a function of human nature However relative and subordinate in a physical sense human ideals may be these ideals remain the only possible moral standards for man the only tests which he can apply for value or authority in any other quarter And among unstable and relative ideals none is more relative and unstable than that which transports all value to a universal law itself indifferent to good and evil and worships it as a deity Such an idolatry would indeed be impossible if it were not partial and veiled arrived at in following out some human interest and clung to by force of moral inertia and the ambiguity of words In truth mystics do not practise so entire a renunciation of reason as they preach eternal validity and the capacity to deal with absolute reality are still assumed by them to belong to thought or at least to feeling Only they overlook in their description of human nature just that faculty which they exercise in their speculation their map leaves out the ground on which they stand The rest which they are not identified with for the moment they proceed to regard de haut en bas and to discredit as a momentary manifestation of universal laws physical or divine They forget that this faith in law this absorption in the blank reality this enthusiasm for the ultimate thought are mere human passions like the rest that they endure them as they might a fever and that the animal instincts are patent on which those spiritual yearnings repose Sidenote Absolutist philosophy human and halting This last fact would be nothing against the feelings in question if they were not made vehicles for absolute revelations On the contrary such a relativity in instincts is the source of their importance In virtue of this relativity they have some basis and function in the world for did they not repose on human nature they could never express or transform it Religion and philosophy are not always beneficent or important but when they are it is precisely because they help to develop human faculty and to enrich human life To imagine that by means of them we can escape from human nature and survey it from without is an ostrich like illusion obvious to all but to the victim of it Such a pretension may cause admiration in the schools where self hypnotisation is easy but in the world it makes its professors ridiculous For in their eagerness to empty their mind of human prejudices they reduce its rational burden to a minimum and if they still continue to dogmatise it is sport for the satirist to observe what forgotten accident of language or training has survived the crash of the universe and made the one demonstrable path to Absolute Truth Sidenote All science a deliverance of momentary thought Neither the path of abstraction followed by the mystics nor that of direct and as it avers unbiassed observation followed by the naturalists can lead beyond that region of common experience traditional feeling and conventional thought which all minds enter at birth and can elude only at the risk of inward collapse and extinction The fact that observation involves the senses and the senses their organs is one which a naturalist can hardly overlook and when we add that logical habits sanctioned by utility are needed to interpret the data of sense the humanity of science and all its constructions becomes clearer than day Superstition itself could not be more human The path of unbiassed observation is not a path away from conventional life it is a progress in conventions It improves human belief by increasing the proportion of two of its ingredients attentive perception and practical calculus The whole resulting vision as it is sustained from moment to moment by present experience and instinct has no value apart from actual ideals And if it proves human nature to be unstable it can build that proof on nothing more stable than human faculty as at the moment it happens to be Sidenote All criticism likewise Nor is abstraction a less human process as if by becoming very abstruse indeed we could hope to become divine Is it not a commonplace of the schools that to form abstract ideas is the prerogative of man s reason Is not abstraction a method by which mortal intelligence makes haste Is it not the makeshift of a mind overloaded with its experience the trick of an eye that cannot master a profuse and ever changing world Shall these diagrams drawn in fancy this system of signals in thought be the Absolute Truth dwelling within us Do we attain reality by making a silhouette of our dreams If the scientific world be a product of human faculties the metaphysical world must be doubly so for the material there given to human understanding is here worked over again by human art This constitutes the dignity and value of dialectic that in spite of appearances it is so human it bears to experience a relation similar to that which the arts bear to the same where sensible images selected by the artist s genius and already coloured by his aesthetic bias are redyed in the process of reproduction whenever he has a great style and saturated anew with his mind There can be no question then of eluding human nature or of conceiving it and its environment in such a way as to stop its operation We may take up our position in one region of experience or in another we may in unconsciousness of the interests and assumptions that support us criticise the truth or value of results obtained elsewhere Our criticism will be solid in proportion to the solidity of the unnamed convictions that inspire it that is in proportion to the deep roots and fruitful ramifications which those convictions may have in human life Ultimate truth and ultimate value will be reasonably attributed to those ideas and possessions which can give human nature as it is the highest satisfaction We may admit that human nature is variable but that admission if justified will be justified by the satisfaction which it gives human nature to make it We might even admit that human ideals are vain but only if they were nothing worth for the attainment of the veritable human ideal Sidenote Origins inessential The given constitution of reason with whatever a dialectical philosophy might elicit from it obviously determines nothing about the causes that may have brought reason to its present pass or the phases that may have preceded its appearance Certain notions about physics might no doubt suggest themselves to the moralist who never can be the whole man he might suspect for instance that the transitive intent of intellect and will pointed to their vital basis Transcendence in operation might seem appropriate only to a being with a history and with an organism subject to external influences whose mind should thus come to represent not merely its momentary state but also its constitutive past and its eventual fortunes Such suggestions however would be extraneous to dialectical self knowledge They would be tentative only and human nature would be freely admitted to be as variable as relative and as transitory as the natural history of the universe might make it Sidenote Ideals functional The error however would be profound and the contradiction hopeless if we should deny the ideal authority of human nature because we had discovered its origin and conditions Nature and evolution let us say have brought life to the present form but this life lives these organs have determinate functions and human nature here and now in relation to the ideal energies it unfolds is a fundamental essence a collection of activities with determinate limits relations and ideals The integration and determinateness of these faculties is the condition for any synthetic operation of reason As the structure of the steam engine has varied greatly since its first invention and its attributions have increased so the structure of human nature has undoubtedly varied since man first appeared upon the earth but as in each steam engine at each moment there must be a limit of mobility a unity of function and a clear determination of parts and tensions so in human nature as found at any time in any man there is a definite scope by virtue of which alone he can have a reliable memory a recognisable character a faculty of connected thought and speech a social utility and a moral ideal On man s given structure on his activity hovering about fixed objects depends the possibility of conceiving or testing any truth or making any progress in happiness Sidenote They are transferable to similar beings Thinkers of different experience and organisation have pro tanto different logics and different moral laws There are limits to communication even among beings of the same race and the faculties and ideals of one intelligence are not transferable without change to any other If this historic diversity in minds were complete so that each lived in its own moral world a science of each of these moral worlds would still be possible provided some inner fixity or constancy existed in its meanings In every human thought together with an immortal intent there is a mortal and irrecoverable perception something in it perishes instantly the part that can be materially preserved being proportionate to the stability or fertility of the organ that produced it If the function is imitable the object it terminates in will reappear and two or more moments having the same ideal will utter comparable messages and may perhaps be unanimous Unanimity in thought involves identity of functions and similarity in organs These conditions mark off the sphere of rational communication and society where they fail altogether there is no mutual intelligence no conversation no moral solidarity Sidenote Authority internal The inner authority of reason however is no more destroyed because it has limits in physical expression or because irrational things exist than the grammar of a given language is invalidated because other languages do not share it or because some people break its rules and others are dumb altogether Innumerable madmen make no difference to the laws of thought which borrow their authority from the inward intent and cogency of each rational mind Reason like beauty is its own excuse for being It is useful indeed for living well when to give reason satisfaction is made the measure of good The true philosopher who is not one chiefly by profession must be prepared to tread the winepress alone He may indeed flourish like the bay tree in a grateful environment but more often he will rather resemble a reed shaken by the wind Whether starved or fed by the accidents of fortune he must find his essential life in his own ideal In spiritual life heteronomy is suicide That universal soul sometimes spoken of which is to harmonise and correct individual demands if it were a will and an intelligence in act would itself be an individual like the others while if it possessed no will and no intelligence such as individuals may have it would be a physical force or law a dynamic system without moral authority and with a merely potential or represented existence For to be actual and self existent is to be individual The living mind cannot surrender its rights to any physical power or subordinate itself to any figment of its own art without falling into manifest idolatry Sidenote Reason autonomous Human nature in the sense in which it is the transcendental foundation of all science and morals is a functional unity in each man it is no general or abstract essence the average of all men s characters nor even the complex of the qualities common to all men It is the entelechy of the living individual be he typical or singular That his type should be odd or common is merely a physical accident If he can know himself by expressing the entelechy of his own nature in the form of a consistent ideal he is a rational creature after his own kind even if like the angels of Saint Thomas he be the only individual of his species What the majority of human animals may tend to or what the past or future variations of a race may be has nothing to do with determining the ideal of human nature in a living man or in an ideal society of men bound together by spiritual kinship Otherwise Plato could not have reasoned well about the republic without adjusting himself to the politics of Buddha or Rousseau and we should not be able to determine our own morality without making concessions to the cannibals or giving a vote to the ants Within the field of an anthropology that tests humanity by the skull s shape there might be room for any number of independent moralities and although as we shall see there is actually a similar foundation in all human and even in all animal natures which supports a rudimentary morality common to all yet a perfect morality is not really common to any two men nor to any two phases of the same man s life Sidenote Its distribution The distribution of reason though a subject irrelevant to pure logic or morals is one naturally interesting to a rational man for he is concerned to know how far beings exist with a congenial structure and an ideal akin to his own That circumstance will largely influence his happiness if being a man he is a gregarious and sympathetic animal His moral idealism itself will crave support from others if not to give it direction at least to give it warmth and courage The best part of wealth is to have worthy heirs and mind can be transmitted only to a kindred mind Hostile natures cannot be brought together by mutual invective nor harmonised by the brute destruction and disappearance of either party But when one or both parties have actually disappeared and the combat has ceased for lack of combatants natures not hostile to one another can fill the vacant place In proportion to their inbred unanimity these will cultivate a similar ideal and rejoice together in its embodiment Sidenote Natural selection of minds This has happened to some extent in the whole world on account of natural conditions which limit the forms of life possible in one region for nature is intolerant in her laxity and punishes too great originality and heresy with death Such moral integration has occurred very markedly in every good race and society whose members by adapting themselves to the same external forces have created and discovered their common soul Spiritual unity is a natural product There are those who see a great mystery in the presence of eternal values and impersonal ideals in a moving and animal world and think to solve that dualism as they call it by denying that nature can have spiritual functions or spirit a natural cause but nothing can be simpler if we make as we should existence the test of possibility Ab esse ad posse valet illatio Nature is a perfect garden of ideals and passion is the perpetual and fertile soil for poetry myth and speculation Nor is this origin merely imputed to ideals by a late and cynical observer it is manifest in the ideals themselves by their subject matter and intent For what are ideals about what do they idealise except natural existence and natural passions That would be a miserable and superfluous ideal indeed that was nobody s ideal of nothing The pertinence of ideals binds them to nature and it is only the worst and flimsiest ideals the ideals of a sick soul that elude nature s limits and belie her potentialities Ideals are forerunners or heralds of nature s successes not always followed indeed by their fulfilment for nature is but nature and has to feel her way but they are an earnest at least of an achieved organisation an incipient accomplishment that tends to maintain and root itself in the world To speak of nature s successes is of course to impute success retroactively but the expression may be allowed when we consider that the same functional equilibrium which is looked back upon as a good by the soul it serves first creates individual being and with it creates the possibility of preference and the whole moral world and it is more than a metaphor to call that achievement a success which has made a sense of success possible and actual That nature cannot intend or previously esteem those formations which are the condition of value or intention existing at all is a truth too obvious to demand repetition but when those formations arise they determine estimation and fix the direction of preference so that the evolution which produced them when looked back upon from the vantage ground thus gained cannot help seeming to have been directed toward the good now distinguished and partly attained For this reason creation is regarded as a work of love and the power that brought order out of chaos is called intelligence Sidenote Living stability These natural formations tending to generate and realise each its ideal are as it were eddies in the universal flux produced no less mechanically doubtless than the onward current yet seeming to arrest or to reverse it Inheritance arrests the flux by repeating a series of phases with a recognisable rhythm memory reverses it by modifying this rhythm itself by the integration of earlier phases into those that supervene Inheritance and memory make human stability This stability is relative being still a mode of flux and consists fundamentally in repetition Repetition marks some progress on mere continuity since it preserves form and disregards time and matter Inheritance is repetition on a larger scale not excluding spontaneous variations while habit and memory are a sort of heredity within the individual since here an old perception reappears by way of atavism in the midst of a forward march Life is thus enriched and reaction adapted to a wider field much as a note is enriched by its overtones and by the tensions inherited from the preceding notes which give it a new setting Sidenote Continuity necessary to progress Progress far from consisting in change depends on retentiveness When change is absolute there remains no being to improve and no direction is set for possible improvement and when experience is not retained as among savages infancy is perpetual Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it In the first stage of life the mind is frivolous and easily distracted it misses progress by failing in consecutiveness and persistence This is the condition of children and barbarians in whom instinct has learned nothing from experience In a second stage men are docile to events plastic to new habits and suggestions yet able to graft them on original instincts which they thus bring to fuller satisfaction This is the plane of manhood and true progress Last comes a stage when retentiveness is exhausted and all that happens is at once forgotten a vain because unpractical repetition of the past takes the place of plasticity and fertile readaptation In a moving world readaptation is the price of longevity The hard shell far from protecting the vital principle condemns it to die down slowly and be gradually chilled immortality in such a case must have been secured earlier by giving birth to a generation plastic to the contemporary world and able to retain its lessons Thus old age is as forgetful as youth and more incorrigible it displays the same inattentiveness to conditions its memory becomes self repeating and degenerates into an instinctive reaction like a bird s chirp Sidenote Limits of variation Spirit a heritage Not all readaptation however is progress for ideal identity must not be lost The Latin language did not progress when it passed into Italian It died Its amiable heirs may console us for its departure but do not remove the fact that their parent is extinct So every individual nation and religion has its limit of adaptation so long as the increment it receives is digestible so long as the organisation already attained is extended and elaborated without being surrendered growth goes on but when the foundation itself shifts when what is gained at the periphery is lost at the centre the flux appears again and progress is not real Thus a succession of generations or languages or religions constitutes no progress unless some ideal present at the beginning is transmitted to the end and reaches a better expression there without this stability at the core no common standard exists and all comparison of value with value must be external and arbitrary Retentiveness we must repeat is the condition of progress The variation human nature is open to is not then variation in any direction There are transformations that would destroy it So long as it endures it must retain all that constitutes it now all that it has so far gathered and worked into its substance The genealogy of progress is like that of man who can never repudiate a single ancestor It starts so to speak from a single point free as yet to take any direction When once however evolution has taken a single step say in the direction of vertebrates that step cannot be retraced without extinction of the species Such extinction may take place while progress in other lines is continued All that preceded the forking of the dead and the living branch will be as well represented and as legitimately continued by the surviving radiates as it could have been by the vertebrates that are no more but the vertebrate ideal is lost for ever and no more progress is possible along that line Sidenote Perfectibility The future of moral evolution is accordingly infinite but its character is more and more determinate at every step Mankind can never without perishing surrender its animal nature its need to eat and drink its sexual method of reproduction its vision of nature its faculty of speech its arts of music poetry and building Particular races cannot subsist if they renounce their savage instincts but die like wild animals in captivity and particular individuals die when not suffered any longer to retain their memories their bodies or even their master passions Thus human nature survives amid a continual fluctuation of its embodiments At every step twigs and leaves are thrown out that last but one season but the underlying stem may have meantime grown stronger and more luxuriant Whole branches sometimes wither but others may continue to bloom Spiritual unity runs like sap from the common root to every uttermost flower but at each forking in the growth the branches part company and what happens in one is no direct concern of the others The products of one age and nation may well be unintelligible to another the elements of humanity common to both may lie lower down So that the highest things are communicable to the fewest persons and yet among these few are the most perfectly communicable The more elaborate and determinate a man s heritage and genius are the more he has in common with his next of kin and the more he can transmit and implant in his posterity for ever Civilisation is cumulative The farther it goes the intenser it is substituting articulate interests for animal fumes and for enigmatic passions Such articulate interests can be shared and the infinite vistas they open up can be pursued for ever with the knowledge that a work long ago begun is being perfected and that an ideal is being embodied which need never be outworn Sidenote Nature and human nature So long as external conditions remain constant it is obvious that the greater organisation a being possesses the greater strength he will have If indeed primary conditions varied the finer creatures would die first for their adaptation is more exquisite and the irreversible core of their being much larger relatively but in a constant environment their equipment makes them irresistible and secures their permanence and multiplication Now man is a part of nature and her organisation may be regarded as the foundation of his own the word nature is therefore less equivocal than it seems for every nature is Nature herself in one of her more specific and better articulated forms Man therefore represents the universe that sustains him his existence is a proof that the cosmic equilibrium that fostered his life is a natural equilibrium capable of being long maintained Some of the ancients thought it eternal physics now suggests a different opinion But even if this equilibrium by which the stars are kept in their courses and human progress is allowed to proceed is fundamentally unstable it shows what relative stability nature may attain Could this balance be preserved indefinitely no one knows what wonderful adaptations might occur within it and to what excellence human nature in particular might arrive Nor is it unlikely that before the cataclysm comes time will be afforded for more improvement than moral philosophy has ever dreamed of For it is remarkable how inane and unimaginative Utopias have generally been This possibility is not uninspiring and may help to console those who think the natural conditions of life are not conditions that a good life can be lived in The possibility of essential progress is bound up with the tragic possibility that progress and human life should some day end together If the present equilibrium of forces were eternal all adaptations to it would have already taken place and while no essential catastrophe would need to be dreaded no essential improvement could be hoped for in all eternity I am not sure that a humanity such as we know were it destined to exist for ever would offer a more exhilarating prospect than a humanity having indefinite elasticity together with a precarious tenure of life Mortality has its compensations one is that all evils are transitory another that better times may come Sidenote Human nature formulated Human nature then has for its core the substance of nature at large and is one of its more complex formations Its determination is progressive It varies indefinitely in its historic manifestations and fades into what as a matter of natural history might no longer be termed human At each moment it has its fixed and determinate entelechy the ideal of that being s life based on his instincts summed up in his character brought to a focus in his reflection and shared by all who have attained or may inherit his organisation His perceptive and reasoning faculties are parts of human nature as embodied in him all objects of belief or desire with all standards of justice and duty which he can possibly acknowledge are transcripts of it conditioned by it and justifiable only as expressions of its inherent tendencies Sidenote Its concrete description reserved for the sequel This definition of human nature clear as it may be in itself and true to the facts will perhaps hardly make sufficiently plain how the Life of Reason having a natural basis has in the ideal world a creative and absolute authority A more concrete description of human nature may accordingly not come amiss especially as the important practical question touching the extension of a given moral authority over times and places depends on the degree of kinship found among the creatures inhabiting those regions To give a general picture of human nature and its rational functions will be the task of the following books The truth of a description which must be largely historical may not be indifferent to the reader and I shall study to avoid bias in the presentation in so far as is compatible with frankness and brevity yet even if some bias should manifest itself and if the picture were historically false the rational principles we shall be trying to illustrate will not thereby be invalidated Illustrations might have been sought in some fictitious world if imagination had not seemed so much less interesting than reality which besides enforces with unapproachable eloquence the main principle in view

REASON IN SOCIETY CHAPTER I LOVE Sidenote Fluid existences have none but ideal goals If man were a static or intelligible being such as angels are thought to be his life would have a single guiding interest under which all other interests would be subsumed His acts would explain themselves without looking beyond his given essence and his soul would be like a musical composition which once written out cannot grow different and once rendered can ask for nothing but at most to be rendered over again In truth however man is an animal a portion of the natural flux and the consequence is that his nature has a moving centre his functions an external reference and his ideal a true ideality What he strives to preserve in preserving himself is something which he never has been at any particular moment He maintains his equilibrium by motion His goal is in a sense beyond him since it is not his experience but a form which all experience ought to receive The inmost texture of his being is propulsive and there is nothing more intimately bound up with his success than mobility and devotion to transcendent aims If there is a transitive function in knowledge and an unselfish purpose in love that is only because at bottom there is a self reproductive flying essence in all existence If the equilibrium of man s being were stable he would need neither nutrition reproduction nor sense As it is sense must renew his ideas and guide his instincts otherwise than as their inner evolution would demand and regenerative processes must strive to repair beneath the constant irreparable lapse of his substance His business is to create and remodel those organisms in which ideals are bred In order to have a soul to save he must perpetually form it anew he must so to speak earn his own living In this vital labour we may ask is nutrition or reproduction the deeper function Or to put the corresponding moral question is the body or the state the primary good Sidenote Nutrition and reproduction If we view the situation from the individual s side as self consciousness might view it we may reply that nutrition is fundamental for if the body were not nourished every faculty would decay Could nutrition only succeed and keep the body young reproduction would be unnecessary with its poor pretence at maintaining the mobile human form in a series of examples On the other hand if we view the matter from above as science and philosophy should we may say that nutrition is but germination of a pervasive sort that the body is a tabernacle in which the transmissible human spirit is carried for a while a shell for the immortal seed that dwells in it and has created it This seed however for rational estimation is merely a means to the existence and happiness of individuals Transpersonal and continuous in its own fluid being the potential grows personal in its ideal fulfilments In other words this potentiality is material though called sometimes an idea and has its only value in the particular creatures it may produce Sidenote Priority of the latter Reproduction is accordingly primary and more completely instrumental than nutrition is since it serves a soul as yet non existent while nutrition is useful to a soul that already has some actuality Reproduction initiates life and remains at life s core a function without which no other in the end would be possible It is more central crucial and representative than nutrition which is in a way peripheral only it is a more typical and rudimentary act marking the ideal s first victory over the universal flux before any higher function than reproduction itself has accrued to the animal To nourish an existing being is to presuppose a pause in generation the nucleus before it dissolves into other individuals gathers about itself for its own glory certain temporal and personal faculties It lives for itself while in procreation it signs its own death warrant makes its will and institutes its heir Sidenote Love celebrates the initial triumph of form and is deeply ideal This situation has its counterpart in feeling Replenishment is a sort of delayed breathing as if the animal had to hunt for air it necessitates more activity than it contains it engages external senses in its service and promotes intelligence After securing a dumb satisfaction or even in preparing it it leaves the habits it employed free for observation and ideal exercise Reproduction on the contrary depletes it is an expense of spirit a drag on physical and mental life it entangles rather than liberates it fuses the soul again into the impersonal blind flux Yet since it constitutes the primary and central triumph of life it is in itself more ideal and generous than nutrition it fascinates the will in an absolute fashion and the pleasures it brings are largely spiritual For though the instrumentalities of reproduction may seem gross and trivial from a conventional point of view its essence is really ideal the perfect type indeed of ideality since form and an identical life are therein sustained successfully by a more rhythmical flux of matter It may seem fanciful even if not unmeaning to say that a man s soul more truly survives in his son s youth than in his own decrepitude but this principle grows more obvious as we descend to simpler beings in which individual life is less elaborated and has not intrenched itself in so many adventitious and somewhat permanent organs In vegetables soul and seed go forth together and leave nothing but a husk behind In the human individual love may seem a mere incident of youth and a sentimental madness but that episode if we consider the race is indispensable to the whole drama and if we look to the order in which ideal interests have grown up and to their superposition in moral experience love will seem the truly primitive and initiatory passion Consciousness amused ordinarily by the most superficial processes itself bears witness to the underlying claims of reproduction and is drawn by it for a moment into life s central vortex and love while it betrays its deep roots by the imperative force it exerts and the silence it imposes on all current passions betrays also its ideal mission by casting an altogether novel and poetic spell over the mind Sidenote Difficulty in describing love The conscious quality of this passion differs so much in various races and individuals and at various points in the same life that no account of it will ever satisfy everybody A Poets and novelists never tire of depicting it anew but although the experience they tell of is fresh and unparalleled in every individual their rendering suffers on the whole from a great monotony Love s gesture and symptoms are noted and unvarying its vocabulary is poor and worn Even a poet therefore can give of love but a meagre expression while the philosopher who renounces dramatic representation is condemned to be avowedly inadequate Love to the lover is a noble and immense inspiration to the naturalist it is a thin veil and prelude to the self assertion of lust This opposition has prevented philosophers from doing justice to the subject Two things need to be admitted by anyone who would not go wholly astray in such speculation one that love has an animal basis the other that it has an ideal object Since these two propositions have usually been thought contradictory no writer has ventured to present more than half the truth and that half out of its true relations Sidenote One sided or inverted theories about it Plato who gave eloquent expression to the ideal burden of the passion and divined its political and cosmic message passed over its natural history with a few mythical fancies and Schopenhauer into whose system a naturalistic treatment would have fitted so easily allowed his metaphysics to carry him at this point into verbal inanities while of course like all profane writers on the subject he failed to appreciate the oracles which Plato had delivered In popular feeling where sentiment and observation must both make themselves felt somehow or other the tendency is to imagine that love is an absolute non natural energy which for some unknown reason or for none at all lights upon particular persons and rests there eternally as on its ultimate goal In other words it makes the origin of love divine and its object natural which is the exact opposite of the truth If it were once seen however that every ideal expresses some natural function and that no natural function is incapable in its free exercise of evolving some ideal and finding justification not in some collateral animal but in an inherent operation like life or thought which being transmissible in its form is also eternal then the philosophy of love should not prove permanently barren For love is a brilliant illustration of a principle everywhere discoverable namely that human reason lives by turning the friction of material forces into the light of ideal goods There can be no philosophic interest in disguising the animal basis of love or in denying its spiritual sublimations since all life is animal in its origin and all spiritual in its possible fruits Sidenote Sexual functions its basis Plastic matter in transmitting its organisation takes various courses which it is the part of natural history to describe Even after reproduction has become sexual it will offer no basis for love if it does not require a union of the two parent bodies Did germinal substances unconsciously diffused meet by chance in the external medium and unite there it is obvious that whatever obsessions or pleasures maturity might bring they would not have the quality which men call love But when an individual of the opposite sex must be met with recognised and pursued and must prove responsive then each is haunted by the possible other Each feels in a generic way the presence and attraction of his fellows he vibrates to their touch he dreams of their image he is restless and wistful if alone When the vague need that solicits him is met by the presence of a possible mate it is extraordinarily kindled Then if it reaches fruition it subsides immediately and after an interval perhaps of stupor and vital recuperation the animal regains his independence his peace and his impartial curiosity You might think him on the way to becoming intelligent but the renewed nutrition and cravings of the sexual machinery soon engross his attention again all his sprightly indifference vanishes before nature s categorical imperative That fierce and turbid pleasure by which his obedience is rewarded hastens his dissolution every day the ensuing lassitude and emptiness give him a clearer premonition of death It is not figuratively only that his soul has passed into his offspring The vocation to produce them was a chief part of his being and when that function is sufficiently fulfilled he is superfluous in the world and becomes partly superfluous even to himself The confines of his dream are narrowed He moves apathetically and dies forlorn Some echo of the vital rhythm which pervades not merely the generations of animals but the seasons and the stars emerges sometimes in consciousness on reaching the tropics in the mortal ecliptic which the human individual may touch many times without much change in his outer fortunes the soul may occasionally divine that it is passing through a supreme crisis Passion when vehement may bring atavistic sentiments When love is absolute it feels a profound impulse to welcome death and even by a transcendental confusion to invoke the end of the universe B The human soul reverts at such a moment to what an ephemeral insect might feel buzzing till it finds its mate in the noon Its whole destiny was wooing and that mission accomplished it sings its Nunc dimittis renouncing heartily all irrelevant things now that the one fated and all satisfying good has been achieved Where parental instincts exist also nature soon shifts her loom a milder impulse succeeds and a satisfaction of a gentler sort follows in the birth of children The transcendental illusion is here corrected and it is seen that the extinction the lovers had accepted needed not to be complete The death they welcomed was not without its little resurrection The feeble worm they had generated bore their immortality within it The varieties of sexual economy are many and to each may correspond for all we know a special sentiment Sometimes the union established is intermittent sometimes it crowns the end of life and dissolves it altogether sometimes it remains while it lasts monogamous sometimes the sexual and social alertness is constant in the male only periodic in the female Sometimes the group established for procreation endures throughout the seasons and from year to year sometimes the males herd together as if normally they preferred their own society until the time of rut comes when war arises between them for the possession of what they have just discovered to be the fair Sidenote Structure the ground of faculty and faculty of duty A naturalist not ashamed to indulge his poetic imagination might easily paint for us the drama of these diverse loves It suffices for our purpose to observe that the varying passions and duties which life can contain depend upon the organic functions of the animal A fish incapable of coition absolved from all care for its young which it never sees or never distinguishes from the casual swimmers darting across its path such a fish being without social faculties or calls to company operation cannot have the instincts perceptions or emotions which belong to social beings A male of some higher species that feels only once a year the sudden solicitations of love cannot be sentimental in all the four seasons his head long passion exhausted upon its present object and dismissed at once without remainder leaves his senses perfectly free and colourless to scrutinise his residual world Whatever further fears or desires may haunt him will have nothing mystical or sentimental about them He will be a man of business all the year round and a lover only on May day A female that does not suffice for the rearing of her young will expect and normally receive her mate s aid long after the pleasures of love are forgotten by him Disinterested fidelity on his part will then be her right and his duty But a female that once pregnant needs like the hen no further company operation on the male s part will turn from him at once with absolute indifference to brood perpetually on her eggs undisturbed by the least sense of solitude or jealousy And the chicks that at first follow her and find shelter under her wings will soon be forgotten also and relegated to the mechanical landscape There is no pain in the timely snapping of the dearest bonds where society has not become a permanent organism and perpetual friendship is not one of its possible modes Transcendent and ideal passions may well judge themselves to have an incomparable dignity Yet that dignity is hardly more than what every passion were it articulate would assign to itself and to its objects The dumbness of a passion may accordingly from one point of view be called the index of its baseness for if it cannot ally itself with ideas its affinities can hardly lie in the rational mind nor its advocates be among the poets But if we listen to the master passion itself rather than to the loquacious arts it may have enlisted in its service we shall understand that it is not self condemned because it is silent nor an anomaly in nature because inharmonious with human life The fish s heartlessness is his virtue the male bee s lasciviousness is his vocation and if these functions were retrenched or encumbered in order to assimilate them to human excellence they would be merely dislocated We should not produce virtue where there was vice but defeat a possible arrangement which would have had its own vitality and order Sidenote Glory of animal love Animal love is a marvellous force and while it issues in acts that may be followed by a revulsion of feeling it yet deserves a more sympathetic treatment than art and morals have known how to accord it Erotic poets to hide their want of ability to make the dumb passion speak have played feebly with veiled insinuations and comic effects while more serious sonneteers have harped exclusively on secondary and somewhat literary emotions abstractly conjugating the verb to love Lucretius in spite of his didactic turns has been on this subject too the most ingenuous and magnificent of poets although he chose to confine his description to the external history of sexual desire It is a pity that he did not turn with his sublime sincerity to the inner side of it also and write the drama of the awakened senses the poignant suasion of beauty when it clouds the brain and makes the conventional earth seen through that bright haze seem a sorry fable Western poets should not have despised what the Orientals in their fugitive stanzas seem often to have sung most exquisitely the joy of gazing on the beloved of following or being followed of tacit understandings and avowals of flight together into some solitude to people it with those ineffable confidences which so naturally follow the outward proofs of love All this makes the brightest page of many a life the only bright page in the thin biography of many a human animal while if the beasts could speak they would give us no doubt endless versions of the only joy in which as we may fancy the blood of the universe flows consciously through their hearts The darkness which conventionally covers this passion is one of the saddest consequences of Adam s fall It was a terrible misfortune in man s development that he should not have been able to acquire the higher functions without deranging the lower Why should the depths of his being be thus polluted and the most delightful of nature s mysteries be an occasion not for communion with her as it should have remained but for depravity and sorrow Sidenote Its degradation when instincts become numerous and competitive This question asked in moral perplexity admits of a scientific answer Man in becoming more complex becomes less stably organised His sexual instinct instead of being intermittent but violent and boldly declared becomes practically constant but is entangled in many cross currents of desire in many other equally imperfect adaptations of structure to various ends Indulgence in any impulse can then easily become excessive and thwart the rest for it may be aroused artificially and maintained from without so that in turn it disturbs its neighbours Sometimes the sexual instinct may be stimulated out of season by example by a too wakeful fancy by language by pride for all these forces are now working in the same field and intermingling their suggestions At the same time the same instinct may derange others and make them fail at their proper and pressing occasions Sidenote Moral censure provoked In consequence of such derangements reflection and public opinion will come to condemn what in itself was perfectly innocent The corruption of a given instinct by others and of others by it becomes the ground for long attempts to suppress or enslave it With the haste and formalism natural to language and to law external and arbitrary limits are set to its operation As no inward adjustment can possibly correspond to these conventional barriers and compartments of life a war between nature and morality breaks out both in society and in each particular bosom a war in which every victory is a sorrow and every defeat a dishonour As one instinct after another becomes furious or disorganised cowardly or criminal under these artificial restrictions the public and private conscience turns against it all its forces necessarily without much nice discrimination the frank passions of youth are met with a grimace of horror on all sides with rumores senum severiorum with an insistence on reticence and hypocrisy Such suppression is favourable to corruption the fancy with a sort of idiotic ingenuity comes to supply the place of experience and nature is rendered vicious and overlaid with pruriency artifice and the love of novelty Hereupon the authorities that rule in such matters naturally redouble their vigilance and exaggerate their reasonable censure chastity begins to seem essentially holy and perpetual virginity ends by becoming an absolute ideal Thus the disorder in man s life and disposition when grown intolerable leads him to condemn the very elements out of which order might have been constituted and to mistake his total confusion for his total depravity Sidenote The heart alienated from the world Banished from the open day covered with mockery and publicly ignored this necessary pleasure flourishes none the less in dark places and in the secret soul Its familiar presence there its intimate habitation in what is most oneself helps to cut the world in two and to separate the inner from the outer life In that mysticism which cannot disguise its erotic affinities this disruption reaches an absolute and theoretic form but in many a youth little suspected of mysticism it produces estrangement from the conventional moralising world which he instinctively regards as artificial and alien It prepares him for excursions into a private fairy land in which unthought of joys will blossom amid friendlier magic forces The truly good then seems to be the fantastic the sensuous the prodigally unreal He gladly forgets the dreary world he lives in to listen for a thousand and one nights to his dreams Sidenote Childish ideals This is the region where those who have no conception of the Life of Reason place the ideal and an ideal is indeed there but the ideal of a single and inordinate impulse A rational mind on the contrary moves by preference in the real world cultivating all human interests in due proportion The love sick and luxurious dream land dear to irrational poets is a distorted image of the ideal world but this distortion has still an ideal motive since it is made to satisfy the cravings of a forgotten part of the soul and to make a home for those elements in human nature which have been denied overt existence If the ideal is meantime so sadly caricatured the fault lies with the circumstances of life that have not allowed the sane will adequate exercise Lack of strength and of opportunity makes it impossible for man to preserve all his interests in a just harmony and his conscious ideal springing up as it too often does in protest against suffering and tyranny has not scope and range enough to include the actual opportunities for action Nature herself by making a slave of the body has thus made a tyrant of the soul Sidenote Their light all focussed on the object of love Fairy land and a mystical heaven contain many other factors besides that furnished by unsatisfied and objectless love All sensuous and verbal images may breed after their own kind in an empty brain but these fantasies are often supported and directed by sexual longings and vaguely luxurious thoughts An Oriental Paradise with its delicate but mindless aestheticism is above everything a garden for love To brood on such an Elysium is a likely prelude and fertile preparation for romantic passion When the passion takes form it calls fancy back from its loose reveries and fixes it upon a single object Then the ideal seems at last to have been brought down to earth Its embodiment has been discovered amongst the children of men Imagination narrows her range Instead of all sorts of flatteries to sense and improbable delicious adventures the lover imagines but a single joy to be master of his love in body and soul Jealousy pursues him Even if he dreads no physical betrayal he suffers from terror and morbid sensitiveness at every hint of mental estrangement Sidenote Three environments for love This attachment is often the more absorbing the more unaccountable it seems and as in hypnotism the subject is dead to all influences but that of the operator so in love the heart surrenders itself entirely to the one being that has known how to touch it That being is not selected it is recognised and obeyed Pre arranged reactions in the system respond to whatever stimulus at a propitious moment happens to break through and arouse them pervasively Nature has opened various avenues to that passion in whose successful operation she has so much at stake Sometimes the magic influence asserts itself suddenly sometimes gently and unawares One approach which in poetry has usurped more than its share of attention is through beauty another less glorious but often more efficacious through surprised sense and premonitions of pleasure a third through social sympathy and moral affinities Contemplation sense and association are none of them the essence nor even the seed of love but any of them may be its soil and supply it with a propitious background It would be mere sophistry to pretend for instance that love is or should be nothing but a moral bond the sympathy of two kindred spirits or the union of two lives For such an effect no passion would be needed as none is needed to perceive beauty or to feel pleasure What Aristotle calls friendships of utility pleasure or virtue all resting on common interests of some impersonal sort are far from possessing the quality of love its thrill flutter and absolute sway over happiness and misery But it may well fall to such influences to awaken or feed the passion where it actually arises Whatever circumstances pave the way love does not itself appear until a sexual affinity is declared When a woman for instance contemplating marriage asks herself whether she really loves her suitor or merely accepts him the test is the possibility of awakening a sexual affinity For this reason women of the world often love their husbands more truly than they did their lovers because marriage has evoked an elementary feeling which before lay smothered under a heap of coquetries vanities and conventions Sidenote Subjectivity of the passion Man on the contrary is polygamous by instinct although often kept faithful by habit no less than by duty If his fancy is left free it is apt to wander We observe this in romantic passion no less than in a life of mere gallantry and pleasure Sentimental illusions may become a habit and the shorter the dream is the more often it is repeated so that any susceptible poet may find that he like Alfred de Musset must love incessantly who once has loved Love is indeed much less exacting than it thinks itself Nine tenths of its cause are in the lover for one tenth that may be in the object Were the latter not accidentally at hand an almost identical passion would probably have been felt for someone else for although with acquaintance the quality of an attachment naturally adapts itself to the person loved and makes that person its standard and ideal the first assault and mysterious glow of the passion is much the same for every object What really affects the character of love is the lover s temperament age and experience The objects that appeal to each man reveal his nature but those unparalleled virtues and that unique divinity which the lover discovers there are reflections of his own adoration things that ecstasy is very cunning in He loves what he imagines and worships what he creates Sidenote Machinery regulating choice Those who do not consider these matters so curiously may feel that to refer love in this way chiefly to inner processes is at once ignominious and fantastic But nothing could be more natural the soul accurately renders in this experience what is going on in the body and in the race Nature had a problem to solve in sexual reproduction which would have daunted a less ruthless experimenter She had to bring together automatically and at the dictation as they felt of their irresponsible wills just the creatures that by uniting might reproduce the species The complete sexual reaction had to be woven together out of many incomplete reactions to various stimuli reactions not specifically sexual The outer senses had to be engaged and many secondary characters found in bodies had to be used to attract attention until the deeper instinctive response should have time to gather itself together and assert itself openly Many mechanical preformations and reflexes must conspire to constitute a determinate instinct We name this instinct after its ultimate function looking forward to the uses we observe it to have and it seems to us in consequence an inexplicable anomaly that many a time the instinct is set in motion when its alleged purpose cannot be fulfilled as when love appears prematurely or too late or fixes upon a creature of the wrong age or sex These anomalies show us how nature is built up and far from being inexplicable are hints that tend to make everything clear when once a verbal and mythical philosophy has been abandoned Responses which we may call sexual in view of results to which they may ultimately lead are thus often quite independent and exist before they are drawn into the vortex of a complete and actually generative act External stimulus and present idea will consequently be altogether inadequate to explain the profound upheaval which may ensue if as we say we actually fall in love That the senses should be played upon is nothing if no deeper reaction is aroused All depends on the juncture at which so to speak the sexual circuit is completed and the emotional currents begin to circulate Whatever object at such a critical moment fills the field of consciousness becomes a signal and associate for the whole sexual mood It is breathlessly devoured in that pause and concentration of attention that rearrangement of the soul which love is conceived in and the whole new life which that image is engulfed in is foolishly supposed to be its effect For the image is in consciousness but not the profound predispositions which gave it place and power Sidenote The choice unstable This association between passion and its signals may be merely momentary or it may be perpetual a Don Juan and a Dante are both genuine lovers In a gay society the gallant addresses every woman as if she charmed him and perhaps actually finds any kind of beauty or mere femininity anywhere a sufficient spur to his desire These momentary fascinations are not necessarily false they may for an instant be quite absorbing and irresistible they may genuinely suffuse the whole mind Such mercurial fire will indeed require a certain imaginative temperament and there are many persons who short of a life long domestic attachment can conceive of nothing but sordid vice But even an inconstant flame may burn brightly if the soul is naturally combustible Indeed these sparks and glints of passion just because they come and vary so quickly offer admirable illustrations of it in which it may be viewed so to speak under the microscope and in its formative stage Thus Plato did not hesitate to make the love of all wines under whatever guise excuse or occasion the test of a true taste for wine and an unfeigned adoration of Bacchus and like Lucretius after him he wittily compiled a list of names by which the lover will flatter the most opposite qualities if they only succeed in arousing his inclination To be omnivorous is one pole of true love to be exclusive is the other A man whose heart if I may say so lies deeper hidden under a thicker coat of mail will have less play of fancy and will be far from finding every charm charming or every sort of beauty a stimulus to love Yet he may not be less prone to the tender passion and when once smitten may be so penetrated by an unimagined tenderness and joy that he will declare himself incapable of ever loving again and may actually be so Having no rivals and a deeper soil love can ripen better in such a constant spirit it will not waste itself in a continual patter of little pleasures and illusions But unless the passion of it is to die down it must somehow assert its universality what it loses in diversity it must gain in applicability It must become a principle of action and an influence colouring everything that is dreamt of otherwise it would have lost its dignity and sunk into a dead memory or a domestic bond Sidenote Instinctive essence of love True love it used to be said is love at first sight Manners have much to do with such incidents and the race which happens to set at a given time the fashion in literature makes its temperament public and exercises a sort of contagion over all men s fancies If women are rarely seen and ordinarily not to be spoken to if all imagination has to build upon is a furtive glance or casual motion people fall in love at first sight For they must fall in love somehow and any stimulus is enough if none more powerful is forthcoming When society on the contrary allows constant and easy intercourse between the sexes a first impression if not reinforced will soon be hidden and obliterated by others Acquaintance becomes necessary for love when it is necessary for memory But what makes true love is not the information conveyed by acquaintance not any circumstantial charms that may be therein discovered it is still a deep and dumb instinctive affinity an inexplicable emotion seizing the heart an influence organising the world like a luminous crystal about one magic point So that although love seldom springs up suddenly in these days into anything like a full blown passion it is sight it is presence that makes in time a conquest over the heart for all virtues sympathies confidences will fail to move a man to tenderness and to worship unless a poignant effluence from the object envelop him so that he begins to walk as it were in a dream Not to believe in love is a great sign of dulness There are some people so indirect and lumbering that they think all real affection must rest on circumstantial evidence But a finely constituted being is sensitive to its deepest affinities This is precisely what refinement consists in that we may feel in things immediate and infinitesimal a sure premonition of things ultimate and important Fine senses vibrate at once to harmonies which it may take long to verify so sight is finer than touch and thought than sensation Well bred instinct meets reason half way and is prepared for the consonances that may follow Beautiful things when taste is formed are obviously and unaccountably beautiful The grounds we may bring ourselves to assign for our preferences are discovered by analysing those preferences and articulate judgments follow upon emotions which they ought to express but which they sometimes sophisticate So too the reasons we give for love either express what it feels or else are insincere attempting to justify at the bar of reason and convention something which is far more primitive than they and underlies them both True instinct can dispense with such excuses It appeals to the event and is justified by the response which nature makes to it It is of course far from infallible it cannot dominate circumstances and has no discursive knowledge but it is presumably true and what it foreknows is always essentially possible Unrealisable it may indeed be in the jumbled context of this world where the Fates like an absent minded printer seldom allow a single line to stand perfect and unmarred The profoundest affinities are those most readily felt and though a thousand later considerations may overlay and override them they remain a background and standard for all happiness If we trace them out we succeed If we put them by although in other respects we may call ourselves happy we inwardly know that we have dismissed the ideal and all that was essentially possible has not been realised Love in that case still owns a hidden and potential object and we sanctify perhaps whatever kindnesses or partialities we indulge in by a secret loyalty to something impersonal and unseen Such reserve such religion would not have been necessary had things responded to our first expectations We might then have identified the ideal with the object that happened to call it forth The Life of Reason might have been led instinctively and we might have been guided by nature herself into the ways of peace Sidenote Its ideality As it is circumstances false steps or the mere lapse of time force us to shuffle our affections and take them as they come or as we are suffered to indulge them A mother is followed by a boyish friend a friend by a girl a girl by a wife a wife by a child a child by an idea A divinity passes through these various temples they may all remain standing and we may continue our cult in them without outward change long after the god has fled from the last into his native heaven We may try to convince ourselves that we have lost nothing when we have lost all We may take comfort in praising the mixed and perfunctory attachments which cling to us by force of habit and duty repeating the empty names of creatures that have long ceased to be what we once could love and assuring ourselves that we have remained constant without admitting that the world which is in irreparable flux has from the first been betraying us Ashamed of being so deeply deceived we may try to smile cynically at the glory that once shone upon us and call it a dream But cynicism is wasted on the ideal There is indeed no idol ever identified with the ideal which honest experience even without cynicism will not some day unmask and discredit Every real object must cease to be what it seemed and none could ever be what the whole soul desired Yet what the soul desires is nothing arbitrary Life is no objectless dream but continually embodies with varying success the potentialities it contains and that prompt desire Everything that satisfies at all even if partially and for an instant justifies aspiration and rewards it Existence however cannot be arrested and only the transmissible forms of things can endure to match the transmissible faculties which living beings hand down to one another The ideal is accordingly significant perpetual and as constant as the nature it expresses but it can never itself exist nor can its particular embodiments endure Sidenote Its universal scope Love is accordingly only half an illusion the lover but not his love is deceived His madness as Plato taught is divine for though it be folly to identify the idol with the god faith in the god is inwardly justified That egregious idolatry may therefore be interpreted ideally and given a symbolic scope worthy of its natural causes and of the mystery it comes to celebrate The lover knows much more about absolute good and universal beauty than any logician or theologian unless the latter too be lovers in disguise Logical universals are terms in discourse without vital ideality while traditional gods are at best natural existences more or less indifferent facts What the lover comes upon on the contrary is truly persuasive and witnesses to itself so that he worships from the heart and beholds what he worships That the true object is no natural being but an ideal form essentially eternal and capable of endless embodiments is far from abolishing its worth on the contrary this fact makes love ideally relevant to generation by which the human soul and body may be for ever renewed and at the same time makes it a thing for large thoughts to be focussed upon a thing representing all rational aims Whenever this ideality is absent and a lover sees nothing in his mistress but what everyone else may find in her loving her honestly in her unvarnished and accidental person there is a friendly and humorous affection admirable in itself but no passion or bewitchment of love she is a member of his group not a spirit in his pantheon Such an affection may be altogether what it should be it may bring a happiness all the more stable because the heart is quite whole and no divine shaft has pierced it It is hard to stanch wounds inflicted by a god The glance of an ideal love is terrible and glorious foreboding death and immortality together Love could not be called divine without platitude if it regarded nothing but its nominal object to be divine it must not envisage an accidental good but the principle of goodness that which gives other goods their ultimate meaning and makes all functions useful Love is a true natural religion it has a visible cult it is kindled by natural beauties and bows to the best symbol it may find for its hope it sanctifies a natural mystery and finally when understood it recognises that what it worshipped under a figure was truly the principle of all good The loftiest edifices need the deepest foundations Love would never take so high a flight unless it sprung from something profound and elementary It is accordingly most truly love when it is irresistible and fatal The substance of all passion if we could gather it together would be the basis of all ideals to which all goods would have to refer Love actually accomplishes something of the sort being primordial it underlies other demands and can be wholly satisfied only by a happiness which is ultimate and comprehensive Lovers are vividly aware of this fact their ideal apparently so inarticulate seems to them to include everything It shares the mystical quality of all primitive life Sophisticated people can hardly understand how vague experience is at bottom and how truly that vagueness supports whatever clearness is afterward attained They cling to the notion that nothing can have a spiritual scope that does not spring from reflection But in that case life itself which brings reflection about would never support spiritual interests and all that is moral would be unnatural and consequently self destructive In truth all spiritual interests are supported by animal life in this the generative function is fundamental and it is therefore no paradox but something altogether fitting that if that function realised all it comprises nothing human would remain outside Such an ultimate fulfilment would differ of course from a first satisfaction just as all that reproduction reproduces differs from the reproductive function itself and vastly exceeds it All organs and activities which are inherited in a sense grow out of the reproductive process and serve to clothe it so that when the generative energy is awakened all that can ever be is virtually called up and so to speak made consciously potential and love yearns for the universe of values Sidenote Its euthanasia This secret is gradually revealed to those who are inwardly attentive and allow love to teach them something A man who has truly loved though he may come to recognise the thousand incidental illusions into which love may have led him will not recant its essential faith He will keep his sense for the ideal and his power to worship The further objects by which these gifts will be entertained will vary with the situation A philosopher a soldier and a courtesan will express the same religion in different ways In fortunate cases love may glide imperceptibly into settled domestic affections giving them henceforth a touch of ideality for when love dies in the odour of sanctity people venerate his relics In other cases allegiance to the ideal may appear more sullenly breaking out in whims or in little sentimental practices which might seem half conventional Again it may inspire a religious conversion charitable works or even artistic labours In all these ways people attempt more or less seriously to lead the Life of Reason expressing outwardly allegiance to whatever in their minds has come to stand for the ideal If to create was love s impulse originally to create is its effort still after it has been chastened and has received some rational extension The machinery which serves reproduction thus finds kindred but higher uses as every organ does in a liberal life and what Plato called a desire for birth in beauty may be sublimated even more until it yearns for an ideal immortality in a transfigured world a world made worthy of that love which its children have so often lavished on it in their dreams FOOTNOTES Footnote A The wide uses of the English word love add to the difficulty I shall take the liberty of limiting the term here to imaginative passion to being in love excluding all other ways of loving It follows that love like its shadow jealousy will often be merely an ingredient in an actual state of feeling friendship and confidence with satisfaction at being liked in return will often be mingled with it We shall have to separate physiologically things which in consciousness exist undivided since a philosophic description is bound to be analytic and cannot render everything at once Where a poet might conceive a new composite making it live a moralist must dissect the experience and rest in its eternal elements Footnote B One example among a

Geschlecht CHAPTER II THE FAMILY Sidenote The family arises spontaneously Love is but a prelude to life an overture in which the theme of the impending work is exquisitely hinted at but which remains nevertheless only a symbol and a promise What is to follow if all goes well begins presently to appear Passion settles down into possession courtship into partnership pleasure into habit A child half mystery and half plaything comes to show us what we have done and to make its consequences perpetual We see that by indulging our inclinations we have woven about us a net from which we cannot escape our choices bearing fruit begin to manifest our destiny That life which once seemed to spread out infinitely before us is narrowed to one mortal career We learn that in morals the infinite is a chimera and that in accomplishing anything definite a man renounces everything else He sails henceforth for one point of the compass Sidenote It harmonises natural interests The family is one of nature s masterpieces It would be hard to conceive a system of instincts more nicely adjusted where the constituents should represent or support one another better The husband has an interest in protecting the wife she in serving the husband The weaker gains in authority and safety the wilder and more unconcerned finds a help mate at home to take thought for his daily necessities Parents lend children their experience and a vicarious memory children endow their parents with a vicarious immortality Sidenote Capacity to be educated goes with immaturity at birth The long childhood in the human race has made it possible and needful to transmit acquired experience possible because the child s brain being immature allows instincts and habits to be formed after birth under the influence of that very environment in which they are to operate and also needful since children are long incapable of providing for themselves and compel their parents if the race is not to die out to continue their care and to diversify it To be born half made is an immense advantage Structure performed is formed blindly the a priori is as dangerous in life as in philosophy Only the cruel workings of compulsion and extermination keep what is spontaneous in any creature harmonious with the world it is called upon to live in Nothing but casual variations could permanently improve such a creature and casual variations will seldom improve it But if experience can company operate in forming instincts and if human nature can be partly a work of art mastery can be carried quickly to much greater lengths This is the secret of man s pre eminence His liquid brain is unfit for years to control action advantageously He has an age of play which is his apprenticeship and he is formed unawares by a series of selective experiments of curious gropings while he is still under tutelage and suffers little by his mistakes Sidenote The naturally dull achieve intelligence Had all intelligence been developed in the womb as it might have been nothing essential could have been learned afterward Mankind would have contained nothing but doctrinaires and the arts would have stood still for ever Capacity to learn comes with dependence on education and as that animal which at birth is most incapable and immature is the most teachable so too those human races which are most precocious are most incorrigible and while they seem the cleverest at first prove ultimately the least intelligent They depend less on circumstances but do not respond to them so well In some nations everybody is by nature so astute versatile and sympathetic that education hardly makes any difference in manners or mind and it is there precisely that generation follows generation without essential progress and no one ever remakes himself on a better plan It is perhaps the duller races with a long childhood and a brooding mind that bear the hopes of the world within them if only nature avails to execute what she has planned on so great a scale Sidenote It is more blessed to save than to create Generation answers no actual demand except that existing in the parents and it establishes a new demand without guaranteeing its satisfaction Birth is a benefit only problematically and by anticipation on the presumption that the faculties newly embodied are to be exercised successfully The second function of the family to rear is therefore higher than the first To foster and perfect a life after it has been awakened to company operate with a will already launched into the world is a positive good work It has a moral quality and is not mere vegetation for in expressing the agent and giving him ideal employment it helps the creature affected to employ itself better too and to find expression In propagating and sowing broadcast precarious beings there is fertility only such as plants and animals may have but there is charity in furthering what is already rooted in existence and is striving to live This principle is strikingly illustrated in religion When the Jews had become spiritual they gave the name of Father to Jehovah who had before been only the Lord of Armies or the architect of the cosmos A mere source of being would not deserve to be called father unless it shared its creatures nature and therefore their interests A deity not so much responsible for men s existence or situation as solicitous for their welfare who pitied a weakness he could not have intended and was pleased by a love he could not command might appropriately be called a father It then becomes possible to conceive moral intercourse and mutual loyalty between God and man such as Hebrew religion so earnestly insisted on for both then have the same interests in the world and look toward the same consummations So the natural relations subsisting between parents and children become moral when it is not merely derivation that unites them but community of purpose The father then represents his children while they are under his tutelage and afterward they represent him carrying on his arts and inheriting his mind Sidenote Parental instinct regards childhood only These arts in some cases are little more than retarded instincts faculties that ripen late and that manifest themselves without special instruction when the system is mature So a bird feeds her young until they are fledged and can provide for themselves Parental functions in such cases are limited to nursing the extremely young This phase of the instinct being the most primitive and fundamental is most to be relied upon even in man Especially in the mother care for the children s physical well being is unfailing to the end She understands the vegetative soul and the first lispings of sense and sentiment in the child have an absorbing interest for her In that region her skill and delights are miracles of nature but her insight and keenness gradually fade as the children grow older Seldom is the private and ideal life of a young son or daughter a matter in which the mother shows particular tact or for which she has instinctive respect Even rarer is any genuine community in life and feeling between parents and their adult children Often the parent s influence comes to be felt as a dead constraint the more cruel that it cannot be thrown off without unkindness and what makes the parents claim at once unjust and pathetic is that it is founded on passionate love for a remembered being the child once wholly theirs that no longer exists in the man To train character and mind would seem to be a father s natural office but as a matter of fact he commonly delegates that task to society The fledgling venturing for the first time into the air may learn of his father and imitate his style of flight but once launched into the open it will find the whole sky full of possible masters The one ultimately chosen will not necessarily be the nearest in reason it should be the most congenial from whom most can be learned To choose an imitable hero is the boy s first act of freedom his heart grows by finding its elective affinities and it grows most away from home It will grow also by returning there when home has become a part of the world or a refuge from it but even then the profoundest messages will come from religion and from solitary dreams A consequence is that parental influence to be permanent requires that the family should be hedged about with high barriers and that the father he endowed with political and religious authority He can then exercise the immense influence due to all tradition which he represents and all law which he administers but it is not his bare instincts as a father that give him this ascendency It is a social system that has delegated to him most of its functions so that all authority flows through him and he retails justice and knowledge besides holding all wealth in his hand When the father apart from these official prerogatives is eager and able to mould his children s minds a new relation half natural and half ideal which is friendship springs up between father and son In this ties of blood merely furnish the opportunity and what chiefly counts is a moral impulse on the one side to beget children in the spirit and on the other a youthful hunger for experience and ideas Sidenote Handing on the torch of life If Nunc dimittis is a psalm for love to sing it is even more appropriate for parental piety On seeing heirs and representatives of ours already in the world we are inclined to give them place and trust them to realise our foiled ambitions They we fancy will be more fortunate than we we shall have screened them from whatever has most maimed our own lives Their purer souls as we imagine will reach better things than are now possible to ours distracted and abused so long We commit the blotted manuscript of our lives more willingly to the flames when we find the immortal text already half engrossed in a fairer copy In all this there is undoubtedly a measure of illusion since little clear improvement is ordinarily possible in the world and while our children may improve upon us in some respects the devil will catch them unprepared in another quarter Yet the hope in question is a transcript of primary impersonal functions to which nature at certain levels limits the animal will To keep life going was in the beginning the sole triumph of life Even when nothing but reproduction was aimed at or attained existence was made possible and ideally stable by securing so much and when the ideal was enlarged so as to include training and rearing the new generation life was even better intrenched and protected Though further material progress may not be made easier by this development since more dangers become fatal as beings grow complex and mutually dependent a great step in moral progress has at any rate been taken In itself a desire to see a child grow and prosper is just as irrational as any other absolute desire but since the child also desires his own happiness the child s will sanctions and supports the father s Thus two irrationalities when they conspire make one rational life The father s instinct and sense of duty are now vindicated experimentally in the child s progress while the son besides the joy of living has the pious function of satisfying his parent s hopes Even if life could achieve nothing more than this it would have reached something profoundly natural and perfectly ideal In patriarchal ages men feel it is enough to have inherited their human patrimony to have enjoyed it and to hand it down unimpaired He who is not childless goes down to his grave in peace Reason may afterward come to larger vistas and more spiritual aims but the principle of love and responsibility will not be altered It will demand that wills be made harmonious and satisfactions compatible Sidenote Adventitious functions assumed by the family Life is experimental and whatever performs some necessary function and cannot be discarded is a safe nucleus for many a parasite a starting point for many new experiments So the family in serving to keep the race alive becomes a point of departure for many institutions It assumes offices which might have been allotted to some other agency had not the family pre empted them profiting by its established authority and annexing them to its domain In no civilised community for instance has the union of man and wife been limited to its barely necessary period It has continued after the family was reared and has remained life long it has commonly involved a common dwelling and religion and often common friends and property Again the children s emancipation has been put off indefinitely The Roman father had a perpetual jurisdiction and such absolute authority that in the palmy days of the Roman family no other subsisted over it He alone was a citizen and responsible to the state while his household were subject to him in law as well as in property and religion In simple rural communities the family has often been also the chief industrial unit almost all necessaries being produced under domestic economy Sidenote Inertia in human nature Now the instincts and delights which nature associates with reproduction cannot stretch so far Their magic fails and the political and industrial family which still thinks itself natural is in truth casual and conventional There is no real instinct to protect those who can already protect themselves nor have they any profit in obeying nor in the end any duty to do so A patria potestas much prolonged or extended is therefore an abuse and prolific in abuses The chieftain s mind not being ruled by paternal instincts will pursue arbitrary personal ends and it is hardly to be expected that his own wealth or power or ideal interests will correspond with those of his subjects The government and supervision required by adults is what we call political it should stretch over all families alike To annex this political control to fatherhood is to confess that social instinct is singularly barren and that the common mind is not plastic enough to devise new organs appropriate to the functions which a large society involves After all the family is an early expedient and in many ways irrational If the race had developed a special sexless class to be nurses pedagogues and slaves like the workers among ants and bees and if lovers had never been tied together by a bond less ethereal than ideal passion then the family would have been unnecessary Such a division of labour would doubtless have involved evils of its own but it would have obviated some drags and vexations proper to the family For we pay a high price for our conquests in this quarter and the sweets of home are balanced not only by its tenderer sorrows but by a thousand artificial prejudices enmities and restrictions It takes patience to appreciate domestic bliss volatile spirits prefer unhappiness Young men escape as soon as they can at least in fancy into the wide world all prophets are homeless and all inspired artists philosophers think out some communism or other and monks put it in practice There is indeed no more irrational ground for living together than that we have sprung from the same loins They say blood is thicker than water yet similar forces easily compete while dissimilar forces may perhaps company operate It is the end that is sacred not the beginning A common origin unites reasonable creatures only if it involves common thoughts and purposes and these may bind together individuals of the most remote races and ages when once they have discovered one another It is difficulties of access ignorance and material confinement that shut in the heart to its narrow loyalties and perhaps greater mobility science and the mingling of nations will one day reorganise the moral world It was a pure spokesman of the spirit who said that whosoever should do the will of his Father who was in heaven the same was his brother and sister and mother Sidenote Family tyrannies The family also perpetuates accidental social differences exaggerating and making them hereditary it thus defeats that just moiety of the democratic ideal which demands that all men should have equal opportunities In human society chance only decides what education a man shall receive what wealth and influence he shall enjoy even what religion and profession he shall adopt People shudder at the system of castes which prevails in India but is not every family a little caste Was a man assigned to his family because he belonged to it in spirit or can he choose another Half the potentialities in the human race are thus stifled half its incapacities fostered and made inveterate The family too is largely responsible for the fierce prejudices that prevail about women about religion about seemly occupations about war death and honour In all these matters men judge in a blind way inspired by a feminine passion that has no mercy for anything that eludes the traditional household not even for its members souls Sidenote Difficulty in abstracting from the family At the same time there are insuperable difficulties in proposing any substitute for the family In the first place all society at present rests on this institution so that we cannot easily discern which of our habits and sentiments are parcels of it and which are attached to it adventitiously and have an independent basis A reformer hewing so near to the tree s root never knows how much he may be felling Possibly his own ideal would lose its secret support if what it condemns had wholly disappeared For instance it is conceivable that a communist abolishing the family in order to make opportunities equal and remove the more cruel injustices of fortune might be drying up that milk of human kindness which had fed his own enthusiasm for the foundlings which he decreed were to people the earth might at once disown all socialism and prove a brood of inhuman egoists Or as not wholly contemptible theories have maintained it might happen that if fathers were relieved of care for their children and children of all paternal suasion human virtue would lose its two chief stays Sidenote Possibility of substitutes On the other hand an opposite danger is present in this sort of speculation Things now associated with the family may not depend upon it but might flourish equally well in a different soil The family being the earliest and closest society into which men enter it assumes the primary functions which all society can exercise Possibly if any other institution had been first in the field it might have had a comparable moral influence One of the great lessons for example which society has to teach its members is that society exists The child like the animal is a colossal egoist not from a want of sensibility but through his deep transcendental isolation The mind is naturally its own world and its solipsism needs to be broken down by social influence The child must learn to sympathise intelligently to be considerate rather than instinctively to love and hate his imagination must become cognitive and dramatically just instead of remaining as it naturally is sensitively selfishly fanciful To break down transcendental conceit is a function usually confided to the family and yet the family is not well fitted to perform it To mothers and nurses their darlings are always exceptional even fathers and brothers teach a child that he is very different from other creatures and of infinitely greater consequence since he lies closer to their hearts and may expect from them all sorts of favouring services The whole household in proportion as it spreads about the child a brooding and indulgent atmosphere nurses wilfulness and illusion For this reason the noblest and happiest children are those brought up as in Greece or England under simple general conventions by persons trained and hired for the purpose The best training in character is found in very large families or in schools where boys educate one another Priceless in this regard is athletic exercise for here the test of ability is visible the comparison not odious the need of company operation clear and the consciousness of power genuine and therefore ennobling Socratic dialectic is not a better means of learning to know oneself Such self knowledge is objective and free from self consciousness it sees the self in a general medium and measures it by a general law Even the tenderer associations of home might under other circumstances attach to other objects Consensus of opinion has a distorting effect sometimes on ideal values A thing which almost everyone agrees in prizing because it has played some part in every life tends to be valued above more important elements in personal happiness that may not have been shared So wealth religion military victory have more rhetorical than efficacious worth The family might well be to some extent a similar idol of the tribe Everyone has had a father and a mother but how many have had a friend Everyone likes to remember many a joy and even sorrow of his youth which was linked with family occasions but to name a man s more private memories attached to special surroundings would awaken no response in other minds Yet these other surroundings may have been no less stimulating to emotion and if familiar to all might be spoken of with as much conventional effect This appears so soon as any experience is diffused enough to enable a tradition to arise so that the sentiment involved can find a social echo Thus there is a loyalty very powerful in certain quarters toward school college club regiment church and country Who shall say that such associations had they sprung up earlier and been more zealously cultivated or were they now reinforced by more general sympathy would not breed all the tenderness and infuse all the moral force which most men now derive from the family Sidenote Plato s heroic communism Nevertheless no suggested substitute for the family is in the least satisfactory Plato s is the best grounded in reason but to succeed it would have to count on a degree of virtue absolutely unprecedented in man To be sure the Platonic regimen if it demands heroism for its inception provides in its scientific breeding and education a means of making heroism perpetual But to submit to such reforming regulations men would first have to be reformed it would not suffice as Plato suggested merely to enslave them and to introduce scientific institutions by despotic decrees For in such a case there would be all manner of evasions rebellions and corruptions If marriage founded on inclination and mutual consent is so often broken surreptitiously or by open divorce what should we expect amongst persons united and separated by governmental policy The love of home is a human instinct Princes who marry for political reasons often find a second household necessary to their happiness although every motive of honour policy religion and patriotism makes with overwhelming force against such irregularities and the celibate priesthood presumably taking its vows freely and under the influence of religious zeal often revert in practice to a sort of natural marriage It is true that Plato s citizens were not to be celibates and the senses would have had no just cause for rebellion but would the heart have been satisfied Could passion or habit submit to such regulation Even when every concession is made to the god like simplicity and ardour which that Platonic race was to show a greater difficulty appears Apparently the guardians and auxiliaries a small minority in the state were alone to submit to this regimen the rest of the people slaves tradesmen and foreigners were to live after their own devices and were we may suppose to retain the family So that after all Plato in this matter proposes little more than what military and monastic orders have actually done among Christians to institute a privileged unmarried class in the midst of an ordinary community Such a proposal therefore does not abolish the family Sidenote Opposite modern tendencies Those forms of free love or facile divorce to which radical opinion and practice incline in these days tend to transform the family without abolishing it Many unions might continue to be lasting and the children in any case would remain with one or the other parent The family has already suffered greater transformations than that suggested by this sect Polygamy persists involving its own type of morals and sentiment and savage tribes show even more startling conventions Nor is it reasonable to dismiss all ideals but the Christian and then invoke Christian patience to help us endure the consequent evils which are thus declared to be normal No evil is normal Of course virtue is the cure for every abuse but the question is the true complexion of virtue and the regimen needful to produce it Christianity with its non political and remedial prescriptions in the form of prayer penance and patience has left the causes of every evil untouched It has so truly come to call the sinner to repentance that its occupation would be gone if once the sin could be abolished Sidenote Individualism in a sense rational While a desirable form of society entirely without the family is hard to conceive yet the general tendency in historic times and the marked tendency in periods of ripe development has been toward individualism Individualism is in one sense the only possible ideal for whatever social order may be most valuable can be valuable only for its effect on conscious individuals Man is of course a social animal and needs society first that he may come safely into being and then that he may have something interesting to do But society itself is no animal and has neither instincts interests nor ideals To talk of such things is either to speak metaphorically or to think mythically and myths the more currency they acquire pass the more easily into superstitions It would be a gross and pedantic superstition to venerate any form of society in itself apart from the safety breadth or sweetness which it lent to individual happiness If the individual may be justly subordinated to the state not merely for the sake of a future freer generation but permanently and in the ideal society the reason is simply that such subordination is a part of man s natural devotion to things rational and impersonal in the presence of which alone he can be personally happy Society in its future and its past is a natural object of interest like art or science it exists like them because only when lost in such rational objects can a free soul be active and immortal But all these ideals are terms in some actual life not alien ends important to nobody to which notwithstanding everybody is to be sacrificed Individualism is therefore the only ideal possible The excellence of societies is measured by what they provide for their members A cumbrous and sanctified social order manifests dulness and cannot subsist without it It immerses man in instrumentalities weighs him down with atrophied organs and by subjecting him eternally to fruitless sacrifices renders him stupid and superstitious and ready to be himself tyrannical when the opportunity occurs A sure sign of having escaped barbarism is therefore to feel keenly the pragmatic values belonging to all institutions to look deep into the human sanctions of things Greece was on this ground more civilised than Rome and Athens more than Sparta Ill governed communities may be more intelligent than well governed ones when people feel the motive and partial advantage underlying the abuses they tolerate as happens where slavery or nepotism is prevalent but when on the other hand no reason is perceived for the good laws which are established as when law is based on revelation The effort to adjust old institutions suddenly to felt needs may not always be prudent because the needs most felt may not be the deepest yet so far as it goes the effort is intelligent Sidenote The family tamed The family in a barbarous age remains sacrosanct and traditional nothing in its law manners or ritual is open to amendment The unhappiness which may consequently overtake individuals is hushed up or positively blamed with no thought of tinkering with the holy institutions which are its cause Civilised men think more and cannot endure objectless tyrannies It is inevitable therefore that as barbarism recedes the family should become more sensitive to its members personal interests Husband and wife when they are happily matched are in liberal communities more truly united than before because such closer friendship expresses their personal inclination Children are still cared for because love of them is natural but they are ruled less and sooner suffered to choose their own associations They are more largely given in charge to persons not belonging to the family especially fitted to supply their education The whole in a word exists more and more for the sake of the parts and the closeness duration and scope of family ties comes to vary greatly in different households Barbaric custom imposed in all cases alike without respect of persons yields to a regimen that dares to be elastic and will take pains to be just Sidenote Possible readjustments and reversions How far these liberties should extend and where they would pass into license and undermine rational life is another question The pressure of circumstances is what ordinarily forces governments to be absolute Political liberty is a sign of moral and economic independence The family may safely weaken its legal and customary authority so long as the individual can support and satisfy himself Children evidently never can consequently they must remain in a family or in some artificial substitute for it which would be no less coercive But to what extent men and women in a future age may need to rely on ties of consanguinity or marriage in order not to grow solitary purposeless and depraved is for prophets only to predict If changes continue in the present direction much that is now in bad odour may come to be accepted as normal It might happen for instance as a consequence of woman s independence that mothers alone should be their children s guardians and sole mistresses in their houses the husband if he were acknowledged at all having at most a pecuniary responsibility for his offspring Such an arrangement would make a stable home for the children while leaving marriage dissoluble at the will of either party It may well be doubted however whether women if given every encouragement to establish and protect themselves would not in the end fly again into man s arms and prefer to be drudges and mistresses at home to living disciplined and submerged in some larger community Indeed the effect of women s emancipation might well prove to be the opposite of what was intended Really free and equal competition between men and women might reduce the weaker sex to such graceless inferiority that deprived of the deference and favour they now enjoy they should find themselves entirely without influence In that case they would have to begin again at the bottom and appeal to arts of seduction and to men s fondness in order to regain their lost social position Sidenote The ideal includes generation There is a certain order in progress which it is impossible to retract An advance must not subvert its own basis nor revoke the interest which it furthers While hunger subsists the art of ploughing is rational had agriculture abolished appetite it would have destroyed its own rationality Similarly no state of society is to be regarded as ideal in which those bodily functions are supposed to be suspended which created the ideal by suggesting their own perfect exercise If old age and death were abolished reproduction indeed would become unnecessary its pleasures would cease to charm the mind and its results pregnancy child birth infancy would seem positively horrible But so long as reproduction is necessary the ideal of life must include it Otherwise we should be constructing not an ideal of life but some dream of non human happiness a dream whose only remnant of ideality would be borrowed from such actual human functions as it still expressed indirectly The true ideal must speak for all necessary and compatible functions Man being an inevitably reproductive animal his reproductive function must be included in his perfect life Sidenote Inner values already lodged in this function Now any function to reach perfection it must fulfil two conditions it must be delightful in itself endowing its occasions and results with ideal interest and it must also company operate harmoniously with all other functions so that life may be profitable and happy In the matter of reproduction nature has already fulfilled the first of these conditions in its essentials It has indeed super abundantly fulfilled them and not only has love appeared in man s soul the type and symbol of all vital perfection but a tenderness and charm a pathos passing into the frankest joy has been spread over pregnancy birth and childhood If many pangs and tears still prove how tentative and violent even here are nature s most brilliant feats science and kindness may strive not unsuccessfully to diminish or abolish those profound traces of evil But reproduction will not be perfectly organised until the second condition is fulfilled as well and here nature has as yet been more remiss Family life as Western nations possess it is still regulated in a very bungling painful and unstable manner Hence in the first rank of evils prostitution adultery divorce improvident and unhappy marriages and in the second rank a morality compacted of three inharmonious parts with incompatible ideals each in its way legitimate I mean the ideals of passion of convention and of reason add besides genius and religion thwarted by family ties single lives empty wedded lives constrained a shallow gallantry and a dull virtue Sidenote Outward beneficence might be secured by experiment How to surround the natural sanctities of wedlock with wise custom and law how to combine the maximum of spiritual freedom with the maximum of moral cohesion is a problem for experiment to solve It cannot be solved even ideally in a Utopia For each interest in play has its rights and the prophet neither knows what interests may at a given future time subsist in the world nor what relative force they may have nor what mechanical conditions may control their expression The statesman in his sphere and the individual in his must find as they go the best practical solutions All that can be indicated beforehand is the principle which improvements in this institution would comply with if they were really improvements They would reform and perfect the function of reproduction without discarding it they would maintain the family unless they could devise some institution that combined intrinsic and representative values better than does that natural artifice and they would recast either the instincts or the laws concerned or both simultaneously until the family ceased to clash seriously with any of these three things natural affection rational nurture and moral freedom CHAPTER III INDUSTRY GOVERNMENT AND WAR Sidenote Patriarchal economy We have seen that the family an association useful in rearing the young may become a means of further maintenance and defence It is the first economic and the first military group Children become servants and servants being adopted and brought up in the family become like other children and supply the family s growing wants It was no small part of the extraordinary longing for progeny shown by patriarchal man that children were wealth and that by continuing in life long subjection to their father they lent prestige and power to his old age The daughters drew water the wives and concubines spun wove and prepared food A great family was a great estate It was augmented further by sheep goats asses and cattle This numerous household bound together by personal authority and by common fortunes was sufficient to carry on many rude industries It wandered from pasture to pasture practised hospitality watched the stars and seems at least in poetic retrospect to have been not unhappy A Roman adage has declared that to know the world one household suffices and one patriarchal family in its simplicity and grandeur seems to have given scope enough for almost all human virtues And those early men as Vico says were sublime poets Sidenote Origin of the state Nevertheless such a condition can only subsist in deserts where those who try to till the soil cannot grow strong enough to maintain themselves against marauding herdsmen Whenever agriculture yields better returns and makes the husbandman rich enough to support a protector patriarchal life disappears The fixed occupation of land turns a tribe into a state Plato has given the classic account of such a passage from idyllic to political conditions Growth in population and in requirements forces an Arcadian community to encroach upon its neighbours this encroachment means war and war when there are fields and granaries to protect and slaves and artisans to keep at their domestic labours means fortifications an army and a general And to match the army in the field another must be maintained at home composed of judges priests builders cooks barbers and doctors Such is the inception of what in the literal sense of the word may be called civilisation Sidenote Three uses of civilisation Civilisation secures three chief advantages greater wealth greater safety and greater variety of experience Whether in spite of this there is a real that is a moral advance is a question impossible to answer off hand because wealth safety and variety are not absolute goods and their value is great or small according to the further values they may help to secure This is obvious in the case of riches But safety also is only good when there is something to preserve better than courage and when the prolongation of life can serve to intensify its excellence An animal s existence is not improved when made safe by imprisonment and domestication it is only degraded and rendered passive and melancholy The human savage likewise craves a freedom and many a danger inconsistent with civilisation because independent of reason He does not yet identify his interests with any persistent and ideal harmonies created by reflection And when reflection is absent length of life is no benefit a quick succession of generations with a small chance of reaching old age is a beautiful thing in purely animal economy where vigour is the greatest joy propagation the highest function and decrepitude the sorriest woe The value of safety accordingly hangs on the question whether life has become reflective and rational But the fact that a state arises does not in itself imply rationality It makes rationality possible but leaves it potential Sidenote Its rationality contingent Similar considerations apply to variety To increase the number of instincts and functions is probably to produce confusion and to augment that secondary and reverberating kind of evil which consists in expecting pain and regretting misfortune On the other hand a perfect life could never be accused of monotony All desirable variety lies within the circle of perfection Thus we do not tire of possessing two legs nor wish for the sake of variety to be occasionally lunatics Accordingly an increase in variety of function is a good only if a unity can still be secured embracing that variety otherwise it would have been better that the irrelevant function should have been developed by independent individuals or should not have arisen at all The function of seeing double adds more to the variety than to the spice of life Whether civilisation is a blessing depends then on its ulterior uses Judged by those interests which already exist when it arises it is very likely a burden and oppression The birds instinctive economy would not be benefited by a tax gatherer a recruiting sergeant a sect or two of theologians and the other usual organs of human polity For the Life of Reason however civilisation is a necessary condition Although animal life within man and beyond him has its wild beauty and mystic justifications yet that specific form of life which we call rational and which is no less natural than the rest would never have arisen without an expansion of human faculty an increase in mental scope for which civilisation is necessary Wealth safety variety of pursuits are all requisite if memory and purpose are to be trained increasingly and if a steadfast art of living is to supervene upon instinct and dream Sidenote Sources of wealth Wealth is itself expressive of reason for it arises whenever men instead of doing nothing or beating about casually in the world take to gathering fruits of nature which they may have uses for in future or fostering their growth or actually contriving their appearance Such is man s first industrial habit seen in grazing agriculture and mining Among nature s products are also those of man s own purposeless and imitative activity results of his idle ingenuity and restlessness Some of these like nature s other random creations may chance to have some utility They may then become conspicuous to reflection be strengthened by the relations which they establish in life and be henceforth called works of human art They then constitute a second industrial habit and that other sort of riches which is supplied by manufacture Sidenote Excess of it possible The amount of wealth man can produce is apparently limited only by time invention and the material at hand It can very easily exceed his capacity for enjoyment As the habits which produce wealth were originally spontaneous and only crystallised into reasonable processes by mutual checks and the gradual settling down of the organism into harmonious action so also the same habits may outrun their uses The machinery to produce wealth of which man s own energies have become a part may well work on irrespective of happiness Indeed the industrial ideal would be an international community with universal free trade extreme division of labour and no unproductive consumption Such an arrangement would undoubtedly produce a maximum of riches and any objections made to it if intelligent must be made on other than universal economic grounds Free trade may be opposed for instance while patriotism takes the invidious form of jealousy and while peace is not secure on the ground that it interferes with vested interests and settled populations or with national completeness and self sufficiency or that absorption in a single industry is unfavourable to intellectual life The latter is also an obvious objection to any great division of labour even in liberal fields while any man with a tender heart and traditional prejudices might hesitate to condemn the irresponsible rich to extinction together with all paupers mystics and old maids living on annuities Such attacks on industrialism however are mere skirmishes and express prejudices of one sort or another The formidable judgment industrialism has to face is that of reason which demands that the increase and specification of labour be justified by benefits somewhere actually realised and integrated in individuals Wealth must justify itself in happiness Someone must live better for having produced or enjoyed these possessions And he would not live better even granting that the possessions were in themselves advantages if these advantages were bought at too high a price and removed other greater opportunities or benefits The belle must not sit so long prinking before the glass as to miss the party and man must not work so hard and burden himself with so many cares as to have no breath or interest left for things free and intellectual Work and life too often are contrasted and complementary things but they would not be contrasted nor even separable if work were not servile for of course man can have no life save in occupation and in the exercise of his faculties contemplation itself can deal only with what practice contains or discloses But the pursuit of wealth is a pursuit of instruments The division of labour when extreme does violence to natural genius and obliterates natural distinctions in capacity What is properly called industry is not art or self justifying activity but on the contrary a distinctly compulsory and merely instrumental labour which if justified at all must be justified by some ulterior advantage which it secures In regard to such instrumental activities the question is always pertinent whether they do not produce more than is useful or prevent the existence of something that is intrinsically good Sidenote Irrational industry Occidental society has evidently run in this direction into great abuses complicating life prodigiously without ennobling the mind It has put into rich men s hands facilities and luxuries which they trifle with without achieving any dignity or true magnificence in living while the poor if physically more comfortable than formerly are not meantime notably wiser or merrier Ideal distinction has been sacrificed in the best men to add material comforts to the worst Things as Emerson said are in the saddle and ride mankind The means crowd out the ends and civilisation reverts when it least thinks it to barbarism Sidenote Its jovial and ingenious side The acceptable side of industrialism which is supposed to be inspired exclusively by utility is not utility at all but pure achievement If we wish to do such an age justice we must judge it as we should a child and praise its feats without inquiring after its purposes That is its own spirit a spirit dominant at the present time particularly in America where industrialism appears most free from alloy There is a curious delight in turning things over changing their shape discovering their possibilities making of them some new contrivance Use in these experimental minds as in nature is only incidental There is an irrational creative impulse a zest in novelty in progression in beating the other man or as they say in breaking the record There is also a fascination in seeing the world unbosom itself of ancient secrets obey man s coaxing and take on unheard of shapes The highest building the largest steamer the fastest train the book reaching the widest circulation have in America a clear title to respect When the just functions of things are as yet not discriminated the superlative in any direction seems naturally admirable Again many possessions if they do not make a man better are at least expected to make his children happier and this pathetic hope is behind many exertions An experimental materialism spontaneous and divorced from reason and from everything useful is also confused in some minds with traditional duties and a school of popular hierophants is not lacking that turns it into a sort of religion and perhaps calls it idealism Impulse is more visible in all this than purpose imagination more than judgment but it is pleasant for the moment to abound in invention and effort and to let the future cash the account Sidenote Its tyranny Wealth is excessive when it reduces a man to a middleman and a jobber when it prevents him in his preoccupation with material things from making his spirit the measure of them There are Nibelungen who toil underground over a gold they will never use and in their obsession with production begrudge themselves all holidays all concessions to inclination to merriment to fancy nay they would even curtail as much as possible the free years of their youth when they might see the blue before rendering up their souls to the Leviathan Visible signs of such unreason soon appear in the relentless and hideous aspect which life puts on for those instruments which somehow emancipate themselves from their uses soon become hateful In nature irresponsible wildness can be turned to beauty because every product can be recomposed into some abstract manifestation of force or form but the monstrous in man himself and in his works immediately offends for here everything is expected to symbolise its moral relations The irrational in the human has something about it altogether repulsive and terrible as we see in the maniac the miser the drunkard or the ape A barbaric civilisation built on blind impulse and ambition should fear to awaken a deeper detestation than could ever be aroused by those more beautiful tyrannies chivalrous or religious against which past revolutions have been directed Sidenote An impossible remedy Both the sordidness and the luxury which industrialism may involve could be remedied however by a better distribution of the product The riches now created by labour would probably not seriously debauch mankind if each man had only his share and such a proportionate return would enable him to perceive directly how far his interests required him to employ himself in material production and how far he could allow himself leisure for spontaneous things religion play art study conversation In a world composed entirely of philosophers an hour or two a day of manual labour a very welcome quantity would provide for material wants the rest could then be all the more competently dedicated to a liberal life for a healthy soul needs matter quite as much for an object of interest as for a means of sustenance But philosophers do not yet people nor even govern the world and so simple a Utopia which reason if it had direct efficacy would long ago have reduced to act is made impossible by the cross currents of instinct tradition and fancy which variously deflect affairs Sidenote Basis of government What are called the laws of nature are so many observations made by man on a way things have of repeating themselves by replying always to their old causes and never as reason s prejudice would expect to their new opportunities This inertia which physics registers in the first law of motion natural history and psychology call habit Habit is a physical law It is the basis and force of all morality but is not morality itself In society it takes the form of custom which when codified is called law and when enforced is called government Government is the political representative of a natural equilibrium of custom of inertia it is by no means a representative of reason But like any mechanical complication it may become rational and many of its forms and operations may be defended on rational grounds All natural organisms from protoplasm to poetry can exercise certain ideal functions and symbolise in their structure certain ideal relations Protoplasm tends to propagate itself and in so doing may turn into a conscious ideal the end it already tends to realise but there could be no desire for self preservation were there not already a self preserved So government can by its existence define the commonwealth it tends to preserve and its acts may be approved from the point of view of those eventual interests which they satisfy But government neither subsists nor arises because it is good or useful but solely because it is inevitable It becomes good in so far as the inevitable adjustment of political forces which it embodies is also a just provision for all the human interests which it creates or affects Sidenote How rationality accrues Suppose a cold and hungry savage failing to find berries and game enough in the woods should descend into some meadow where a flock of sheep were grazing and pounce upon a lame lamb which could not run away with the others tear its flesh suck up its blood and dress himself in its skin All this could not be called an affair undertaken in the sheep s interest And yet it might well conduce to their interest in the end For the savage finding himself soon hungry again and insufficiently warm in that scanty garment might attack the flock a second time and thereby begin to accustom himself and also his delighted family to a new and more substantial sort of raiment and diet Suppose now a pack of wolves or a second savage or a disease should attack those unhappy sheep Would not their primeval enemy defend them Would he not have identified himself with their interests to this extent that their total extinction or discomfiture would alarm him also And in so far as he provided for their well being would he not have become a good shepherd If now some philosophic wether a lover of his kind reasoned with his fellows upon the change in their condition he might shudder indeed at those early episodes and at the contribution of lambs and fleeces which would not cease to be levied by the new government but he might also consider that such a contribution was nothing in comparison with what was formerly exacted by wolves diseases frosts and casual robbers when the flock was much smaller than it had now grown to be and much less able to withstand decimation And he might even have conceived an admiration for the remarkable wisdom and beauty of that great shepherd dressed in such a wealth of wool and he might remember pleasantly some occasional caress received from him and the daily trough filled with water by his providential hand And he might not be far from maintaining not only the rational origin but the divine right of shepherds Such a savage enemy incidentally turned into a useful master is called a conqueror or king Only in human experience the case is not so simple and harmony is seldom established so quickly The history of Asia is replete with examples of conquest and extortion in which a rural population living in comparative plenty is attacked by some more ferocious neighbour who after a round of pillage establishes a quite unnecessary government raising taxes and soldiers for purposes absolutely remote from the conquered people s interests Such a government is nothing but a chronic raid mitigated by the desire to leave the inhabitants prosperous enough to be continually despoiled afresh Even this modicum of protection however can establish a certain moral bond between ruler and subject an intelligent government and an intelligent fealty become conceivable Sidenote Ferocious but useful despotisms Not only may the established regime be superior to any other that could be substituted for it at the time but some security against total destruction and a certain opportunity for the arts and for personal advancement may follow subjugation A moderate decrease in personal independence may be compensated by a novel public grandeur palace and temple may make amends for hovels somewhat more squalid than before Hence those who cannot conceive a rational polity or a company operative greatness in the state especially if they have a luxurious fancy can take pleasure in despotism for it does not after all make so much difference to an ordinary fool whether what he suffers from is another s oppression or his own lazy improvidence and he can console himself by saying with Goldsmith How small of all that human hearts endure The part which laws or kings can cause or cure At the same time a court and a hierarchy with their interesting pomp and historic continuity with their combined appeal to greed and imagination redeem human existence from pervasive vulgarity and allow somebody at least to strut proudly over the earth Serfs are not in a worse material condition than savages and their spiritual opportunities are infinitely greater for their eye and fancy are fed with visions of human greatness and even if they cannot improve their outward estate they can possess a poetry and a religion It suffices to watch an Oriental rabble at prayer or listening in profound immobility to some wandering story teller or musician to feel how much such a people may have to ruminate upon and how truly Arabian days and Arabian Nights go together The ideas evolved may be wild and futile and the emotions savagely sensuous yet they constitute a fund of inner experience a rich soil for better imaginative growths To such Oriental cogitations for instance carried on under the shadow of uncontrollable despotisms mankind owes all its greater religions A government s origin has nothing to do with its legitimacy that is with its representative operation An absolutism based on conquest or on religious fraud may wholly lose its hostile function It may become the nucleus of a national organisation expressing justly enough the people s requirements Such a representative character is harder to attain when the government is foreign for diversity in race language and local ties makes the ruler less apt involuntarily to represent his subjects his measures must subserve their interests intentionally out of sympathy policy and a sense of duty virtues which are seldom efficacious for any continuous period A native government even if based on initial outrage can more easily drift into excellence for when a great man mounts the throne he has only to read his own soul and follow his instinctive ambitions in order to make himself the leader and spokesman of his nation An Alexander an Alfred a Peter the Great are examples of persons who with varying degrees of virtue were representative rulers their policy however irrationally inspired happened to serve their subjects and the world Besides a native government is less easily absolute Many influences control the ruler in his aims and habits such as religion custom and the very language he speaks by which praise and blame are assigned automatically to the objects loved or hated by the people He cannot unless he be an intentional monster oppose himself wholly to the common soul Sidenote Occasional advantage of being conquered For this very reason however native governments are little fitted to redeem or transform a people and all great upheavals and regenerations have been brought about by conquest by the substitution of one race and spirit for another in the counsels of the world What the Orient owes to Greece the Occident to Rome India to England native America to Spain is a civilisation incomparably better than that which the conquered people could ever have provided for themselves Conquest is a good means of recasting those ideals perhaps impracticable and ignorant which a native government at its best would try to preserve Such inapt ideals it is true would doubtless remodel themselves if they could be partly realised Progress from within is possible otherwise no progress would be possible for humanity at large But conquest gives at once a freer field to those types of polity which since they go with strength presumably represent the better adjustment to natural conditions and therefore the better ideal Though the substance of ideals is the will their mould must be experience and a true discernment of opportunity so that while all ideals regarded in vacuo are equal in ideality they are under given circumstances very diverse in worth Sidenote Origin of free governments When not founded on conquest which is the usual source of despotism government is ordinarily based on traditional authority vested in elders or patriarchal kings This is the origin of the classic state and of all aristocracy and freedom The economic and political unit is a great household with its lord his wife and children clients and slaves In the interstices of these households there may be a certain floating residuum freedmen artisans merchants strangers These people while free are without such rights as even slaves possess they have no share in the religion education and resources of any established family For purposes of defence and religion the heads of houses gather together in assemblies elect or recognise some chief and agree upon laws usually little more than extant customs regulated and formally sanctioned Sidenote Their democratic tendencies Such a state tends to expand in two directions In the first place it becomes more democratic that is it tends to recognise other influences than that which heads of families patres conscripti possess The people without such fathers those who are not patricians also have children and come to imitate on a smaller scale the patriarchal economy These plebeians are admitted to citizenship But they have no such religious dignity and power in their little families as the patricians have in theirs they are scarcely better than loose individuals representing nothing but their own sweet wills This individualism and levity is not however confined to the plebeians it extends to the patrician houses Individualism is the second direction in which a patriarchal society yields to innovation As the state grows the family weakens and while in early Rome for instance only the pater familias was responsible to the city and his children and slaves only to him in Greece we find from early times individuals called to account before public judges A federation of households thus became a republic The king that chief who enjoyed a certain hereditary precedence in sacrifices or in war yields to elected generals and magistrates whose power while it lasts is much greater for no other comparable power now subsists in the levelled state Modern Europe has seen an almost parallel development of democracy and individualism together with the establishment of great artificial governments Though the feudal hierarchy was originally based on conquest or domestic subjection it came to have a fanciful or chivalrous or political force But gradually the plebeian classes the burghers grew in importance and military allegiance was weakened by being divided between a number of superposed lords up to the king emperor or pope The stronger rulers grew into absolute monarchs representatives of great states and the people became in a political sense a comparatively level multitude Where parliamentary government was established it became possible to subordinate or exclude the monarch and his court but the government remains an involuntary institution and the individual must adapt himself to its exigencies The church which once overshadowed the state has now lost its coercive authority and the single man stands alone before an impersonal written law a constitutional government and a widely diffused and contagious public opinion characterised by enormous inertia incoherence and blindness Contemporary national units are strongly marked and stimulate on occasion a perfervid artificial patriotism but they are strangely unrepresentative of either personal or universal interests and may yield in turn to new combinations if the industrial and intellectual solidarity of mankind every day more obvious ever finds a fit organ to express and to defend it Sidenote Imperial peace A despotic military government founded on alien force and aiming at its own magnificence is often more efficient in defending its subjects than is a government expressing only the people s energies as the predatory shepherd and his dog prove better guardians for a flock than its own wethers The robbers that at their first incursion brought terror to merchant and peasant may become almost immediately representative organs of society an army and a judiciary Disputes between subjects are naturally submitted to the invader under whose laws and good will alone a practical settlement can now be effected and this alien tribunal being exempt from local prejudices and interested in peace that taxes may be undiminished may administer a comparatively impartial justice until corrupted by bribes The constant compensation tyranny brings which keeps it from at once exhausting its victims is the silence it imposes on their private squabbles One distant universal enemy is less oppressive than a thousand unchecked pilferers and plotters at home For this reason the reader of ancient history so often has occasion to remark what immense prosperity Asiatic provinces enjoyed between the periods when their successive conquerors devastated them They flourished exceedingly the moment peace and a certain order were established in them Sidenote Nominal and real status of armies Tyranny not only protects the subject against his kinsmen thus taking on the functions of law and police but it also protects him against military invasion and thus takes on the function of an army An army considered ideally is an organ for the state s protection but it is far from being such in its origin since at first an army is nothing but a ravenous and lusty horde quartered in a conquered country yet the cost of such an incubus may come to be regarded as an insurance against further attack and so what is in its real basis an inevitable burden resulting from a chance balance of forces may be justified in after thought as a rational device for defensive purposes Such an ulterior justification has nothing to do however with the causes that maintain armies or military policies and accordingly those virginal minds that think things originated in the uses they may have acquired have frequent cause to be pained and perplexed at the abuses and over development of militarism An insurance capitalised may exceed the value of the property insured and the drain caused by armies and navies may be much greater than the havoc they prevent The evils against which they are supposed to be directed are often evils only in a cant and conventional sense since the events deprecated like absorption by a neighbouring state might be in themselves no misfortune to the people but perhaps a singular blessing And those dreaded possibilities even if really evil may well be less so than is the hateful actuality of military taxes military service and military arrogance Sidenote Their action irresponsible Nor is this all the military classes since they inherit the blood and habits of conquerors naturally love war and their irrational combativeness is reinforced by interest for in war officers can shine and rise while the danger of death to a brave man is rather a spur and a pleasing excitement than a terror A military class is therefore always recalling foretelling and meditating war it fosters artificial and senseless jealousies toward other governments that possess armies and finally as often as not it precipitates disaster by bringing about the objectless struggle on which it has set its heart Sidenote Pugnacity human These natural phenomena unintelligently regarded as anomalies and abuses are the appanage of war in its pristine and proper form To fight is a radical instinct if men have nothing else to fight over they will fight over words fancies or women or they will fight because they dislike each other s looks or because they have met walking in opposite directions To knock a thing down especially if it is cocked at an arrogant angle is a deep delight to the blood To fight for a reason and in a calculating spirit is something your true warrior despises even a coward might screw his courage up to such a reasonable conflict The joy and glory of fighting lie in its pure spontaneity and consequent generosity you are not fighting for gain but for sport and for victory Victory no doubt has its fruits for the victor If fighting were not a possible means of livelihood the bellicose instinct could never have established itself in any long lived race A few men can live on plunder just as there is room in the world for some beasts of prey other men are reduced to living on industry just as there are diligent bees ants and herbivorous kine But victory need have no good fruits for the people whose army is victorious That it sometimes does so is an ulterior and blessed circumstance hardly to be reckoned upon Sidenote Barrack room philosophy Since barbarism has its pleasures it naturally has its apologists There are panegyrists of war who say that without a periodical bleeding a race decays and loses its manhood Experience is directly opposed to this shameless assertion It is war that wastes a nation s wealth chokes its industries kills its flower narrows its sympathies condemns it to be governed by adventurers and leaves the puny deformed and unmanly to breed the next generation Internecine war foreign and civil brought about the greatest set back which the Life of Reason has ever suffered it exterminated the Greek and Italian aristocracies Instead of being descended from heroes modern nations are descended from slaves and it is not their bodies only that show it After a long peace if the conditions of life are propitious we observe a people s energies bursting their barriers they become aggressive on the strength they have stored up in their remote and unchecked development It is the unmutilated race fresh from the struggle with nature in which the best survive while in war it is often the best that perish that descends victoriously into the arena of nations and conquers disciplined armies at the first blow becomes the military aristocracy of the next epoch and is itself ultimately sapped and decimated by luxury and battle and merged at last into the ignoble conglomerate beneath Then perhaps in some other virgin country a genuine humanity is again found capable of victory because unbled by war To call war the soil of courage and virtue is like calling debauchery the soil of love Sidenote Military virtues Military institutions adventitious and ill adapted excrescences as they usually are can acquire rational values in various ways Besides occasional defence they furnish a profession congenial to many and a spectacle and emotion interesting to all Blind courage is an animal virtue indispensable in a world full of dangers and evils where a certain insensibility and dash are requisite to skirt the precipice without vertigo Such animal courage seems therefore beautiful rather than desperate or cruel and being the lowest and most instinctive of virtues it is the one most widely and sincerely admired In the form of steadiness under risks rationally taken and perseverance so long as there is a chance of success courage is a true virtue but it ceases to be one when the love of danger a useful passion when danger is unavoidable begins to lead men into evils which it was unnecessary to face Bravado provocativeness and a gambler s instinct with a love of hitting hard for the sake of exercise is a temper which ought already to be counted among the vices rather than the virtues of man To delight in war is a merit in the soldier a dangerous quality in the captain and a positive crime in the statesman Discipline or the habit of obedience is a better sort of courage which military life also requires Discipline is the acquired faculty of surrendering an immediate personal good for the sake of a remote and impersonal one of greater value This difficult wisdom is made easier by training in an army because the great forces of habit example and social suasion are there enlisted in its service But these natural aids make it lose its conscious rationality so that it ceases to be a virtue except potentially for to resist an impulse by force of habit or external command may or may not be to follow the better course Besides fostering these rudimentary virtues the army gives the nation s soul its most festive and flaunting embodiment Popular heroes stirring episodes obvious turning points in history commonly belong to military life Sidenote They are splendid vices Nevertheless the panegyrist of war places himself on the lowest level on which a moralist or patriot can stand and shows as great a want of refined feeling as of right reason For the glories of war are all blood stained delirious and infected with crime the combative instinct is a savage prompting by which one man s good is found in another s evil The existence of such a contradiction in the moral world is the original sin of nature whence flows every other wrong He is a willing accomplice of that perversity in things who delights in another s discomfiture or in his own and craves the blind tension of plunging into danger without reason or the idiot s pleasure in facing a pure chance To find joy in another s trouble is as man is constituted not unnatural though it is wicked and to find joy in one s own trouble though it be madness is not yet impossible for man These are the chaotic depths of that dreaming nature out of which humanity has to grow Sidenote Absolute value in strife If war could be abolished and the defence of all interests intrusted to courts of law there would remain unsatisfied a primary and therefore ineradicable instinct a love of conflict of rivalry and of victory If we desire to abolish war because it tries to do good by doing harm we must not ourselves do an injury to human nature while trying to smooth it out Now the test and limit of all necessary reform is vital harmony No impulse can be condemned arbitrarily or because some other impulse or group of interests is in a Platonic way out of sympathy with it An instinct can be condemned only if it prevents the realisation of other instincts and only in so far as it does so War which has instinctive warrant must therefore be transformed only in so far as it does harm to other interests The evils of war are obvious enough could not the virtues of war animal courage discipline and self knowledge together with gaiety and enthusiasm find some harmless occasion for their development Sidenote Sport a civilised way of preserving it Such a harmless simulacrum of war is seen in sport The arduous and competitive element in sport is not harmful if the discipline involved brings no loss of faculty or of right sensitiveness and the rivalry no rancour In war states wish to be efficient in order to conquer but in sport men wish to prove their excellence because they wish to have it If this excellence does not exist the aim is missed and to discover that failure is no new misfortune To have failed unwittingly would have been worse and to recognise superiority in another is consistent with a relatively good and honourable performance so that even nominal failure may be a substantial success And merit in a rival should bring a friendly delight even to the vanquished if they are true lovers of sport and of excellence Sport is a liberal form of war stripped of its compulsions and malignity a rational art and the expression of a civilised instinct Sidenote Who shall found the universal commonwealth The abolition of war like its inception can only be brought about by a new collocation of material forces As the suppression of some nest of piratical tribes by a great emperor substitutes judicial for military sanctions among them so the conquest of all warring nations by some imperial people could alone establish general peace The Romans approached this ideal because their vast military power stood behind their governors and praetors Science and commerce might conceivably resume that lost imperial function If at the present day two or three powerful governments could so far forget their irrational origin as to renounce the right to occasional piracy and could unite in enforcing the decisions of some international tribunal they would thereby constitute that tribunal the organ of a universal government and render war impossible between responsible states But on account of their irrational basis all governments largely misrepresent the true interests of those who live under them They pursue conventional and captious ends to which alone public energies can as yet be efficiently directed CHAPTER IV THE ARISTOCRATIC IDEAL Sidenote Eminence once existing grows by its own To him that hath shall be given says the Gospel representing as a principle of divine justice 
7012-75354-0000	train-other-500	one that undoubtedly holds in earthly economy A not dissimilar observation is made in the proverb Possession is nine tenths of the law Indeed some trifling acquisition often gives an animal
7012-75354-0001	train-other-500	an initial advantage which may easily roll up and increase prodigiously becoming the basis of prolonged good fortune Sometimes this initial advantage is a matter of natural structure like talent strength or goodness sometimes an accidental accretion like breeding
7012-75354-0002	train-other-500	instruction or wealth Such advantages grow by the opportunities they make and it is possible for a man launched into the world at the right moment with the right equipment to mount easily from eminence to eminence
7012-75354-0003	train-other-500	and accomplish very great things without doing more than genially follow his instincts and respond with ardour like an Alexander or a Shakespeare to his opportunities A great endowment
none	none	 doubled by great good fortune raises men like these into supreme representatives of mankind Sidenote Its causes natural and its privileges just 
7012-75354-0004	train-other-500	It is no loss of liberty to subordinate ourselves to a natural leader On the contrary we thereby seize an opportunity to exercise our freedom availing ourselves of the best instrument obtainable to accomplish our ends
7012-75354-0005	train-other-500	A man may be a natural either by his character or by his position The advantages a man draws from that peculiar structure of his brain which renders him for instance a ready speaker or an ingenious mathematician
7012-75354-0006	train-other-500	are by common consent regarded as legitimate advantages The public will use and reward such ability without jealousy and with positive delight
7012-75354-0007	train-other-500	In an unsophisticated age the same feeling prevails in regard to those advantages which a man may draw from more external circumstances If a traveller having been shipwrecked in some expedition
7012-75354-0008	train-other-500	should learn the secrets of an unknown land its arts and resources his fellow citizens on his return would not hesitate to follow his direction in respect to those novel matters It would be senseless folly on their part to begrudge him his adventitious eminence
7012-75354-0009	train-other-500	and refuse to esteem him of more consequence than their uninitiated selves Yet when people ignoring the natural causes of all that is called artificial think that but for an unlucky chance they too might have enjoyed the advantages
7012-75354-0010	train-other-500	which raise other men above them they sometimes affect not to recognise actual distinctions and abilities or study enviously the means of annulling them
none	none	 So long however as by the operation of any causes whatever 
7012-75354-0011	train-other-500	some real competence accrues to anyone it is for the general interest that this competence should bear its natural fruits diversifying the face of society
none	none	 and giving its possessor a corresponding distinction Sidenote Advantage of inequality 
7012-75354-0012	train-other-500	Variety in the world is an unmixed blessing so long as each distinct function can be exercised without hindrance to any other There is no greater stupidity or meanness than to take uniformity for an ideal as if it were not a benefit and a joy to a man being what he is
7012-75354-0013	train-other-500	to know that many are have been and will be better than he Grant that no one is positively degraded by the great man s greatness and it follows that everyone is exalted by it Beauty genius holiness even power and extraordinary wealth
none	none	 radiate their virtue and make the world in which they exist a better and a more joyful place to live in 
7012-75354-0014	train-other-500	Hence the insatiable vulgar curiosity about great people and the strange way in which the desire for fame by which the distinguished man sinks to the common level is met and satisfied by the universal interest in whatever is extraordinary This
7012-75354-0015	train-other-500	avidity not to miss knowledge of things notable and to enact vicariously all singular roles shows the need men have of distinction and the advantage they find even in conceiving it
none	none	 For it is the presence of variety and a nearer approach somewhere to just and ideal achievement that gives men perspective in their judgments and opens vistas from the dull foreground of their lives to sea mountain and stars No merely idle curiosity shows itself in this instinct rather a mark of human potentiality 
7012-75354-0016	train-other-500	that recognises in what is yet attained a sad caricature of
none	none	 what is essentially attainable For man s spirit is intellectual and naturally demands dominion and science it craves in all things friendliness and beauty The least hint of attainment in these directions fills it with satisfaction and the sense of realised expectation So much so that when no inkling of a supreme fulfilment is found in the world or in the heart men still cling to the notion of it in God or the hope of it in heaven and religion when it entertains them with that ideal seems to have reached its highest height Love of uniformity would quench the thirst for new outlets for perfect even if alien achievements and this so long as perfection had not been actually attained would indicate a mind dead to the ideal Sidenote Fable of the belly and the members Sidenote Fallacy in it Menenius Agrippa expressed very well the aristocratic theory of society when he compared the state to a human body in which the common people were the hands and feet and the nobles the belly The people when they forgot the conditions of their own well being might accuse themselves of folly and the nobles of insolent idleness for the poor spent their lives in hopeless labour that others who did nothing might enjoy all But there was a secret circulation of substance in the body politic and the focussing of all benefits in the few was the cause of nutrition and prosperity to the many Perhaps the truth might be even better expressed in a physiological figure somewhat more modern by saying that the brain which consumes much blood well repays its obligations to the stomach and members for it company ordinates their motions and prepares their satisfactions Yet there is this important difference between the human body and the state 
7012-75354-0017	train-other-500	a difference which renders Agrippa s fable wholly misleading the hands and feet have no separate consciousness and if they are ill used it is the common self that feels the weariness and the bruises
7012-75354-0018	train-other-500	But in the state the various members have a separate sensibility
7012-75354-0019	train-other-500	and although their ultimate interests lie no doubt in company operation and justice their immediate instinct and passion may lead them to oppress one another perpetually At one time the brain forgetting the members may feast on opiates and unceasing music and again the members
7012-75354-0020	train-other-500	thinking they could more economically shift for themselves may starve the brain and reduce the body politic to a colony of vegetating microbes In a word the consciousness inhabiting the brain
none	none	 embodies the functions of all the body s organs and responds in a general way to all their changes of fortune 
7012-75354-0021	train-other-500	but in the state every cell has a separate brain and the greatest citizen by his existence realises only his own
none	none	 happiness Sidenote Theism expresses better the aristocratic ideal For an ideal aristocracy we should not look to Plato s Republic for that Utopia is avowedly the ideal only for fallen and corrupt states 
7012-75354-0022	train-other-500	since luxury and injustice we are told first necessitated war and the guiding idea of all the Platonic regimen is military efficiency
none	none	 Aristocracy finds a more ideal expression in theism for theism imagines the values of existence to be divided into two unequal parts on the one hand the infinite value of God s life 
7012-75354-0023	train-other-500	on the other the finite values of all the created hierarchy According to theistic cosmology there was a metaphysical necessity if creatures were to exist at all that they should be in some measure inferior to godhead otherwise they would have been indistinguishable
7012-75354-0024	train-other-500	from the godhead itself according to the principle called the identity of indiscernibles which declares that two beings exactly alike cannot exist without collapsing into an undivided unit The propagation of life involved then
7012-75354-0025	train-other-500	declension from pure vitality and to diffuse being meant to dilute it with nothingness This declension might take place in infinite degrees each retaining some vestige of perfection mixed as it were
none	none	 with a greater and greater proportion of impotence and nonentity Below God stood the angels below them man and below man the brute 
7012-75354-0026	train-other-500	and inanimate creation Each sphere as it receded contained a paler adumbration of the central perfection
none	none	 yet even at the last confines of existence some feeble echo of divinity would still resound This inequality in dignity would be not only a beauty in the whole to whose existence and order such inequalities would be essential 
7012-75354-0027	train-other-500	but also no evil to the creature and no injustice for a modicum of good is not made evil simply because a greater good is elsewhere possible
none	none	 On the contrary by accepting that appointed place and that specific happiness each servant of the universal harmony could feel its infinite value and could thrill the more profoundly to a music which he helped to intone Sidenote A heaven with many mansions 
7012-75354-0028	train-other-500	Dante has expressed this thought with great simplicity and beauty He asks a friend s spirit which he finds lodged in the lowest circle of paradise if a desire to mount higher does not sometimes visit him
7012-75354-0029	train-other-500	and the spirit replies Brother the force of charity quiets our will making us wish only for what we have and thirst for nothing more If we desired to be in a sublimer sphere our desires would be discordant with the will of him who here
7012-75354-0030	train-other-500	allots us our divers stations something which you will see there is no room for in these circles if to dwell in charity be needful here and if you consider
none	none	 duly the nature of charity For it belongs to the essence of that blessed state to keep within the divine purposes 
7012-75354-0031	train-other-500	that our own purposes may become one also Thus the manner in which we are ranged from step to step in this kingdom pleases the whole kingdom as it does the king who gives us will to will with him And his will is our peace it is that sea toward which all things move
none	none	 that his will creates and that nature fashions C Sidenote If God is defined as the human ideal apotheosis 
7012-75354-0032	train-other-500	the only paradise Such pious resignation has in it something pathetic and constrained
none	none	 which Dante could not or would not disguise 
7012-75354-0033	train-other-500	For a theism which like Aristotle s and Dante s has a Platonic essence God is really nothing but the goal of human aspiration embodied imaginatively This fact makes these philosophers feel that whatever falls short of divinity has something imperfect about it
none	none	 God is what man ought to be and man while he is still himself 
7012-75354-0034	train-other-500	must yearn for ever like Aristotle s cosmos making in his perpetual round a vain imitation of deity and an eternal prayer Hence a latent minor strain in Aristotle s philosophy the hopeless note of paganism and in Dante an undertone of sorrow and sacrifice
7012-75354-0035	train-other-500	inseparable from Christian feeling In both virtue implies a certain sense of defeat a fatal unnatural limitation as if a pristine ideal had been
none	none	 surrendered 
7012-75354-0036	train-other-500	and what remained were at best a compromise Accordingly we need not be surprised if aspiration in all these men finally takes a mystical turn and Dante s ghostly friends after propounding their aristocratic philosophy to justify God in other men s eyes
7012-75354-0037	train-other-500	are themselves on the point of quitting the lower sphere to which God had assigned them and plunging into the sea of his absolute ecstasy
none	none	 For if the word God stands for man s spiritual ideal 
7012-75354-0038	train-other-500	heaven can consist only in apotheosis This the Greeks knew very well They instinctively ignored or feared any immortality which fell short of deification and the Christian mystics reached the same goal by less overt courses
7012-75354-0039	train-other-500	They merged the popular idea of a personal God in their foretaste of peace and perfection
none	none	 and their whole religion was an effort to escape humanity Sidenote When natures differ 
7012-75354-0040	train-other-500	perfections differ too It is true that the theistic cosmology might hear a different interpretation If by deity we mean not man s ideal intellectual or sensuous but the total cosmic order
none	none	 then the universal hierarchy may be understood naturalistically so that each sphere gives scope for one sort of good 
7012-75354-0041	train-other-500	God or the highest being would then be simply the life of nature as a whole if nature has a conscious life or that of its noblest portion The supposed metaphysical evil involved in finitude would then be no evil at all
7012-75354-0042	train-other-500	but the condition of every good In realising his own will in his own way each creature would be perfectly happy without yearning or pathetic regrets for other forms of being Such forms of being would all be unpalatable to him
7012-75354-0043	train-other-500	even if conventionally called higher because their body was larger and their soul more complex
none	none	 Nor would divine perfection itself be in any sense perfection unless it gave expression to some definite nature the entelechy either of the celestial spheres or of scientific thought or of some other actual existence 
7012-75354-0044	train-other-500	Under these circumstances inhabitants even of the lowest heaven
none	none	 would be unreservedly happy 
7012-75354-0045	train-other-500	as happy in their way as those of the seventh heaven could be in theirs No pathetic note would any longer disquiet their finitude They would not have to renounce in sad conformity to an alien will
none	none	 what even for them would have been a deeper joy They would be asked to renounce nothing but what for them would be an evil The overruling providence would then in truth be fatherly by providing for each being that which it inwardly craved 
7012-75354-0046	train-other-500	Persons of one rank would not be improved by passing into the so called higher sphere any more than the ox would be improved by being
none	none	 transformed into a lark or a king into a poet 
7012-75354-0047	train-other-500	Man in such a system could no more pine to be God than he could pine to be the law of gravity or Spinoza s substance or Hegel s dialectical idea
none	none	 Such naturalistic abstractions while they perhaps express some element of reality or its total form are not objects corresponding to man s purposes and are morally inferior to his humanity Every man s ideal lies within the potentialities of his nature for only by expressing his nature can ideals possess authority or attraction over him Heaven accordingly has really many mansions each truly heavenly to him who would inhabit it and there is really no room for discord in those rounds One ideal can no more conflict with another than truth can jostle truth but men or the disorganised functions within a given individual may be in physical conflict as opinion may wrestle with opinion in the world s arena or in an ignorant brain Among ideals themselves infinite variety is consistent with perfect harmony but matter that has not yet developed or discovered its organic affinities may well show groping and contradictory tendencies When however these embryonic disorders are once righted each possible life knows its natural paradise and what some unintelligent outsider might say in dispraise of that ideal will never wound or ruffle the self justified creature whose ideal it is any more than a cat s aversion to water will disturb a fish s plan of life Sidenote Theory that stations actually correspond to faculty 
6286_75355_000001_000000	train-clean-360	An aristocratic society might accordingly be a perfect heaven if the variety and superposition of functions in it expressed a corresponding diversity in its members faculties and ideals 
6286_75355_000001_000001	train-clean-360	And indeed what aristocratic philosophers have always maintained is that men really differ so much in capacity that one is happier for being a slave another for being a shopkeeper and a third for being a king 
6286_75355_000001_000002	train-clean-360	All professions they say even the lowest are or may be vocations 
6286_75355_000001_000003	train-clean-360	Some men Aristotle tells us are slaves by nature only physical functions are spontaneous in them 
6286_75355_000001_000004	train-clean-360	So long as they are humanely treated it is we may infer a benefit for them to be commanded and the contribution their labour makes toward rational life in their betters is the highest dignity they can attain and should be prized by them as a sufficient privilege 
6286_75355_000002_000000	train-clean-360	Such assertions coming from lordly lips have a suspicious optimism about them yet the faithful slave such as the nurse we find in the tragedies may sometimes have corresponded to that description 
none	none	In other regions it is surely true that to advance in conventional station would often entail a loss in true dignity and happiness 
6286_75355_000002_000002	train-clean-360	It would seldom benefit a musician to be appointed admiral or a housemaid to become a prima donna 
none	none	Scientific breeding might conceivably develop much more sharply the various temperaments and faculties needed in the state and then each caste or order of citizens would not be more commonly dissatisfied with its lot than men or women now are with their sex 
6286_75355_000002_000004	train-clean-360	One tribe would run errands as persistently as the ants another would sing like the lark a third would show a devil s innate fondness for stoking a fiery furnace 
none	none	Sidenote Its falsity 
6286_75355_000004_000000	train-clean-360	Aristocracy logically involves castes 
6286_75355_000004_000001	train-clean-360	But such castes as exist in India and the social classes we find in the western world are not now based on any profound difference in race capacity or inclination 
6286_75355_000004_000002	train-clean-360	They are based probably on the chances of some early war reinforced by custom and perpetuated by inheritance 
6286_75355_000004_000003	train-clean-360	A certain circulation corresponding in part to proved ability or disability takes place in the body politic and since the French Revolution has taken place increasingly 
6286_75355_000004_000004	train-clean-360	Some by energy and perseverance rise from the bottom some by ill fortune or vice fall from the top 
6286_75355_000004_000005	train-clean-360	But these readjustments are insignificant in comparison with the social inertia that perpetuates all the classes and even such shifts as occur at once re establish artificial conditions for the next generation 
6286_75355_000004_000006	train-clean-360	As a rule men s station determines their occupation without their gifts determining their station 
6286_75355_000004_000007	train-clean-360	Thus stifled ability in the lower orders and apathy or pampered incapacity in the higher unite to deprive society of its natural leaders 
none	none	Sidenote Feeble individuality the rule It would be easy however to exaggerate the havoc wrought by such artificial conditions The monotony we observe in mankind must not be charged to the oppressive influence of circumstances crushing the individual soul 
6286_75355_000006_000002	train-clean-360	It is not society s fault that most men seem to miss their vocation 
6286_75355_000006_000003	train-clean-360	Most men have no vocation and society in imposing on them some chance language some chance religion and some chance career first plants an ideal in their bosoms and insinuates into them a sort of racial or professional soul 
6286_75355_000006_000004	train-clean-360	Their only character is composed of the habits they have been led to acquire 
none	none	Some little propensities betrayed in childhood may very probably survive one man may prove by his dying words that he was congenitally witty another tender another brave But these native qualities will simply have added an ineffectual tint to some typical existence or other and the vast majority will remain as Schopenhauer said Fabrikwaaren der Natur 
6286_75355_000007_000000	train-clean-360	Variety in human dreams like personality among savages may indeed be inwardly very great but it is not efficacious 
6286_75355_000007_000001	train-clean-360	To be socially important and expressible in some common medium initial differences in temper must be organised into custom and become cumulative by being imitated and enforced 
6286_75355_000007_000002	train-clean-360	The only artists who can show great originality are those trained in distinct and established schools for originality and genius must be largely fed and raised on the shoulders of some old tradition 
6286_75355_000007_000003	train-clean-360	A rich organisation and heritage while they predetermine the core of all possible variations increase their number since every advance opens up new vistas and growth in extending the periphery of the substance organised multiplies the number of points at which new growths may begin 
none	none	Thus it is only in recent times that discoveries in science have been frequent because natural science until lately possessed no settled method and no considerable fund of acquired truths 
6286_75355_000007_000005	train-clean-360	So too in political society statesmanship is made possible by traditional policies generalship by military institutions great financiers by established commerce 
none	none	If we ventured to generalise these observations we might say that such an unequal distribution of capacity as might justify aristocracy should be looked for only in civilised states 
6286_75355_000008_000001	train-clean-360	Savages are born free and equal but wherever a complex and highly specialised environment limits the loose freedom of those born into it it also stimulates their capacity Under forced culture remarkable growths will appear bringing to light possibilities in men which might perhaps not even have been possibilities had they been left to themselves for mulberry leaves do not of themselves develop into brocade 
6286_75355_000008_000002	train-clean-360	A certain personal idiosyncrasy must be assumed at bottom else cotton damask would be as good as silk and all men having like opportunities would be equally great 
6286_75355_000008_000003	train-clean-360	This idiosyncrasy is brought out by social pressure while in a state of nature it might have betrayed itself only in trivial and futile ways as it does among barbarians 
none	none	Sidenote Sophistical envy 
6286_75355_000010_000000	train-clean-360	Distinction is thus in one sense artificial since it cannot become important or practical unless a certain environment gives play to individual talent and preserves its originality but distinction nevertheless is perfectly real and not merely imputed 
none	none	In vain does the man in the street declare that he too could have been a king if he had been born in the purple for that potentiality does not belong to him as he is but only as he might have been if per impossibile he had not been himself There is a strange metaphysical illusion in imagining that a man might change his parents his body his early environment and yet retain his personality In its higher faculties his personality is produced by his special relations 
6286_75355_000010_000004	train-clean-360	If Shakespeare had been born in Italy he might if you will have been a great poet but Shakespeare he could never have been 
6286_75355_000010_000005	train-clean-360	Nor can it be called an injustice to all of us who are not Englishmen of Queen Elizabeth s time that Shakespeare had that advantage and was thereby enabled to exist 
6286_75355_000011_000000	train-clean-360	The sense of injustice at unequal opportunities arises only when the two environments compared are really somewhat analogous so that the illusion of a change of roles without a change of characters may retain some colour 
6286_75355_000011_000001	train-clean-360	It was a just insight for instance in the Christian fable to make the first rebel against God the chief among the angels the spirit occupying the position nearest to that which he tried to usurp Lucifer s fallacy consisted in thinking natural inequality artificial His perversity lay in rebelling against himself and rejecting the happiness proper to his nature 
none	none	This was the maddest possible way of rebelling against his true creator for it is our particular finitude that creates us and makes us be 
6286_75355_000011_000003	train-clean-360	No one except in wilful fancy would envy the peculiar advantages of a whale or an ant of an Inca or a Grand Lama 
6286_75355_000011_000004	train-clean-360	An exchange of places with such remote beings would too evidently leave each creature the very same that it was before for after a nominal exchange of places each office would remain filled and no trace of a change would be perceptible 
6286_75355_000011_000005	train-clean-360	But the penny that one man finds and another misses would not had fortune been reversed have transmuted each man into the other 
none	none	So adventitious a circumstance seems easily transferable without undermining that personal distinction which it had come to embitter 
6286_75355_000011_000007	train-clean-360	Yet the incipient fallacy lurking even in such suppositions becomes obvious when we inquire whether so blind an accident for instance as sex is also adventitious and ideally transferable and whether Jack and Jill remaining themselves could have exchanged genders 
none	none	What extends these invidious comparisons beyond all tolerable bounds is the generic and vague nature proper to language and its terms 
6286_75355_000012_000001	train-clean-360	The first personal pronoun I is a concept so thoroughly universal that it can accompany any experience whatever yet it is used to designate an individual who is really definable not by the formal selfhood which he shares with every other thinker but by the special events that make up his life 
none	none	Each man s memory embraces a certain field and if the landscape open to his vision is sad and hateful he naturally wishes it to shift and become like that paradise in which as he fancies other men dwell A legitimate rebellion against evil in his own experience becomes an unthinkable supposition about what his experience might have been had he enjoyed those other men s opportunities or even so far can unreason wander had he possessed their character The wholly different creature a replica of that envied ideal which would have existed in that case would still have called itself I and so the dreamer imagines that creature would have been himself in a different situation 
6286_75355_000013_000000	train-clean-360	If a new birth could still be called by a man s own name the reason would be that the concrete faculties now present in him are the basis for the ideal he throws out and if these particular faculties came to fruition in a new being he would call that being himself inasmuch as it realised his ideal 
none	none	The poorer the reality therefore the meaner and vaguer the ideal it is able to project Man is so tied to his personal endowment essential to him though an accident in the world that even his uttermost ideal into which he would fly out of himself and his finitude can be nothing but the fulfilment of his own initial idiosyncrasies Whatever other wills and other glories may exist in heaven lie not within his universe of aspiration 
6286_75355_000013_000004	train-clean-360	Even his most perversely metaphysical envy can begrudge to others only what he instinctively craves for himself 
none	none	Sidenote Inequality is not a grievance suffering is 
6286_75355_000015_000000	train-clean-360	It is not mere inequality therefore that can be a reproach to the aristocratic or theistic ideal 
6286_75355_000015_000001	train-clean-360	Could each person fulfil his own nature the most striking differences in endowment and fortune would trouble nobody s dreams 
6286_75355_000015_000002	train-clean-360	The true reproach to which aristocracy and theism are open is the thwarting of those unequal natures and the consequent suffering imposed on them all 
6286_75355_000015_000003	train-clean-360	Injustice in this world is not something comparative the wrong is deep clear and absolute in each private fate 
6286_75355_000015_000004	train-clean-360	A bruised child wailing in the street his small world for the moment utterly black and cruel before him does not fetch his unhappiness from sophisticated comparisons or irrational envy nor can any compensations and celestial harmonies supervening later ever expunge or justify that moment s bitterness 
6286_75355_000015_000005	train-clean-360	The pain may be whistled away and forgotten the mind may be rendered by it only a little harder a little coarser a little more secretive and sullen and familiar with unrightable wrong 
none	none	But ignoring that pain will not prevent its having existed it must remain for ever to trouble God s omniscience and be a part of that hell which the creation too truly involves Sidenote 
7189-75356-0000	train-other-500	Mutilation by crowding The same curse of suffering vitiates Agrippa s ingenious parable and the joyful humility of Dante s celestial friends and renders both equally irrelevant to human conditions
7189-75356-0001	train-other-500	Nature may arrange her hierarchies as she chooses
none	none	 and make her creatures instrumental to one another s life 
7189-75356-0002	train-other-500	That interrelation is no injury to any part and an added beauty in the whole
none	none	 It would have been a truly admirable arrangement to have enabled every living being 
7189-75356-0003	train-other-500	in attaining its own end to make the attainments of the others ends possible to them also An approach to such an equilibrium has actually been reached in some respects by the rough sifting of miscellaneous organisms
7189-75356-0004	train-other-500	until those that were compatible alone remained But nature in her haste to be fertile wants to produce everything at once and her distracted industry has brought about terrible confusion and waste and terrible injustice
7189-75356-0005	train-other-500	She has been led to punish her ministers for the services they render and her favourites for the honours they receive She has imposed suffering on her creatures together with life she has defeated her own objects and vitiated her bounty
7189-75356-0006	train-other-500	by letting every good do harm and bring evil in its train to some unsuspecting creature This oppression is the moral stain that attaches to aristocracy and makes it truly unjust Every privilege that imposes suffering involves a wrong
7189-75356-0007	train-other-500	Not only does aristocracy lay on the world a tax in labour and privation that its own splendours intellectual and worldly may arise
none	none	 but by so doing 
7189-75356-0008	train-other-500	it infects intelligence and grandeur with inhumanity and renders corrupt and odious that pre eminence which should have been divine The lower classes in submitting to the hardship and meanness of their lives
7189-75356-0009	train-other-500	which to be sure might have been harder and meaner had no aristocracy existed must upbraid their fellow men for profiting by their ill fortune and therefore having an interest in perpetuating it Instead of the brutal but innocent injustice of nature
7189-75356-0010	train-other-500	what they suffer from is the sly injustice of men and though the suffering be less for the worst of men is human the injury is more sensible The inclemencies and dangers men must endure in a savage state in scourging them
7189-75356-0011	train-other-500	would not have profited by that cruelty But suffering has an added sting when it enables others to be exempt from care and to live like the gods in irresponsible ease the inequality which would have been innocent and even beautiful in a happy world
7189-75356-0012	train-other-500	becomes in a painful world a bitter wrong
none	none	 or at best a criminal beauty Sidenote A hint to optimists 
7189-75356-0013	train-other-500	It would be a happy relief to the aristocrat s conscience when he possesses one could he learn from some yet bolder Descartes that common people were nothing
none	none	 but betes machines 
7189-75356-0014	train-other-500	and that only a groundless prejudice had hitherto led us to suppose that life could exist where evidently nothing good could be attained by living If all unfortunate people could be proved to be unconscious automata what a brilliant justification
7189-75356-0015	train-other-500	that would be for the ways of both God and man Philosophy would not lack arguments to support such an agreeable conclusion Beginning with the axiom that whatever is is right
none	none	 a metaphysician might adduce the truth 
7189-75356-0016	train-other-500	that consciousness is something self existent and indubitably real therefore he would contend it must be self justifying and indubitably good And he might continue by saying that a slave s life was not its own excuse for being
7189-75356-0017	train-other-500	nor were the labours of a million drudges otherwise justified than by the conveniences which they supplied their masters with Ergo those servile operations could come to consciousness only where they attained their end
7189-75356-0018	train-other-500	and the world could contain nothing but perfect and universal happiness A divine omniscience and joy shared by finite minds in so far as they might attain perfection would be the only life in existence and the notion that such a thing as pain
none	none	 sorrow or hatred could exist at all 
7189-75356-0019	train-other-500	would forthwith vanish like the hideous and ridiculous illusion that it was This argument may be recommended to apologetic writers as no weaker than those they commonly rely on
none	none	 and infinitely more consoling Sidenote How aristocracies might do good 
7189-75356-0020	train-other-500	But so long as people remain on what such an invaluable optimist might call the low level of sensuous thought and so long as we imagine that we exist and suffer an aristocratic regimen can only be justified
7189-75356-0021	train-other-500	by radiating benefit and by proving that were less given to those above less would be attained by those beneath them Such reversion of benefit might take a material form as when by commercial guidance and military protection
7189-75356-0022	train-other-500	a greater net product is secured to labour even after all needful taxes have been levied upon it to support greatness An industrial and political oligarchy might defend itself on that ground Or the return might take the less positive form of opportunity
7189-75356-0023	train-other-500	as it does when an aristocratic society has a democratic government Here the people neither accept guidance nor require protection but the existence of a rich and irresponsible class offers them an ideal such as it is
7189-75356-0024	train-other-500	in their ambitious struggles For they too may grow rich exercise financial ascendancy educate their sons like gentlemen and launch their daughters into fashionable society Finally
7189-75356-0025	train-other-500	if the only aristocracy recognised were an aristocracy of achievement and if public rewards followed personal merit the reversion to the people might take the form of participation by them in the ideal interests of eminent men Holiness
7189-75356-0026	train-other-500	genius and knowledge can reverberate through all society The fruits of art and science are in themselves cheap and not to be monopolised or consumed in enjoyment On the contrary their wider diffusion stimulates their growth
7189-75356-0027	train-other-500	and makes their cultivation more intense and successful When an ideal interest is general the share which falls to the private person is the more apt to be efficacious The saints have usually had companions
7189-75356-0028	train-other-500	and artists and philosophers have flourished in schools At the same time ideal goods cannot be assimilated without some training and leisure Like education and religion they are degraded by popularity
7189-75356-0029	train-other-500	and reduced from what the master intended to what the people are able and willing to receive So pleasing an idea then as this of diffused ideal possessions has little application in a society aristocratically framed
7189-75356-0030	train-other-500	for the greater eminence the few attain the less able are the many to follow them Great thoughts require a great mind and pure beauties a profound sensibility To attempt to give such things a wide currency
none	none	 is to be willing to denaturalise them 
7189-75356-0031	train-other-500	in order to boast that they have been propagated Culture is on the horns of this dilemma if profound and noble it must remain rare if common it must become mean These alternatives can never be eluded
7189-75356-0032	train-other-500	until some purified and high bred race succeeds the promiscuous bipeds
none	none	 that now blacken the planet Sidenote Man adds wrong to nature s injury Aristocracy 
7189-75356-0034	train-other-500	like everything else has no practical force save that which mechanical causes endow it with Its privileges are fruits of inevitable advantages Its oppressions are simply new forms and vehicles
7189-75356-0035	train-other-500	for nature s primeval cruelty while the benefits it may also confer are only further examples of her nice equilibrium and necessary harmony For it lies in the essence of a mechanical world where the interests of its products
7189-75356-0036	train-other-500	are concerned to be fundamentally kind since it has formed and on the whole maintains those products and yet continually cruel since it forms and maintains them blindly without considering difficulties or probable failures
7189-75356-0037	train-other-500	Now the most tyrannical government like the best is a natural product maintained by an equilibrium of natural forces It is simply a new mode of mechanical energy to which the philosopher living under it must adjust himself
7189-75356-0038	train-other-500	as he would to the weather But when the vehicle of nature s inclemency is a heartless man even if the harm done be less it puts on a new and a moral aspect The source of injury is then not only natural but criminal as well
7189-75356-0039	train-other-500	and the result is a sense of wrong added to misfortune It must needs be that offence come but woe to him by whom the offence cometh He justly arouses indignation
none	none	 and endures remorse Sidenote Conditions of a just inequality 
7189-75356-0040	train-other-500	Now civilisation cannot afford to entangle its ideals with the causes of remorse and of just indignation In the first place nature in her slow and ponderous way
7189-75356-0041	train-other-500	levels her processes and rubs off her sharp edges by perpetual friction Where there is maladjustment there is no permanent physical stability Therefore the ideal of society
7189-75356-0042	train-other-500	can never involve the infliction of injury on anybody for any purpose Such an ideal would propose for a goal something out of equilibrium a society which even if established could not maintain itself
7189-75356-0043	train-other-500	but an ideal life must not tend to destroy its ideal by abolishing its own existence In the second place it is impossible on moral grounds that injustice should subsist in the ideal The ideal means the perfect
7189-75356-0044	train-other-500	and a supposed ideal in which wrong still subsisted would be the denial of perfection The ideal state and the ideal universe should be a family where all are not equal but where all are happy
7189-75356-0045	train-other-500	So that an aristocratic or theistic system in order to deserve respect must discard its sinister apologies for evil and clearly propose such an order of existences one superposed upon the other as should involve no suffering on any of its levels
7189-75356-0046	train-other-500	The services required of each must involve no injury to any to perform them should be made the servant s spontaneous and specific ideal
none	none	 The privileges the system bestows on some must involve no outrage on the rest and must not be paid for by mutilating other lives or thwarting their natural potentialities For the humble to give their labour would then be blessed in reality and not merely by imputation while for the great to receive those benefits would be blessed also not in fact only but in justice FOOTNOTES Footnote C

democratic government The two differ widely both in origin and in moral principle Genetically considered social democracy is something primitive unintended proper to communities where there is general competence and no marked personal eminence It is the democracy of Arcadia Switzerland and the American pioneers Such a community might be said to have also a democratic government for everything in it is naturally democratic There will be no aristocracy no prestige but instead an intelligent readiness to lend a hand and to do in unison whatever is done not so much under leaders as by a kind of conspiring instinct and contagious sympathy In other words there will be that most democratic of governments no government at all But when pressure of circumstances danger or inward strife makes recognised and prolonged guidance necessary to a social democracy the form its government takes is that of a rudimentary monarchy established by election or general consent A natural leader presents himself and he is instinctively obeyed He may indeed be freely criticised and will not be screened by any pomp or traditional mystery he will be easy to replace and every citizen will feel himself radically his equal Yet such a state is at the beginnings of monarchy and aristocracy close to the stage depicted in Homer where pre eminences are still obviously natural although already over emphasised by the force of custom and wealth and by the fission of society into divergent classes Sidenote Artificial democracy is an extension of privilege Political democracy on the other hand is a late and artificial product It arises by a gradual extension of aristocratic privileges through rebellion against abuses and in answer to restlessness on the people s part Its principle is not the absence of eminence but the discovery that existing eminence is no longer genuine and representative It is compatible with a very complex government great empire and an aristocratic society it may retain as notably in England and in all ancient republics many vestiges of older and less democratic institutions For under democratic governments the people have not created the state they merely control it Their suspicions and jealousies are quieted by assigning to them a voice perhaps only a veto in the administration but the state administered is a prodigious self created historical engine Popular votes never established the family private property religious practices or international frontiers Institutions ideals and administrators may all be such as the popular classes could never have produced but these products of natural aristocracy are suffered to subsist so long as no very urgent protest is raised against them The people s liberty consists not in their original responsibility for what exists for they are guiltless of it but merely in the faculty they have acquired of abolishing any detail that may distress or wound them and of imposing any new measure which seen against the background of existing laws may commend itself from time to time to their instinct and mind Sidenote Ideals and expedients If we turn from origins to ideals the contrast between social and political democracy is no less marked Social democracy is a general ethical ideal looking to human equality and brotherhood and inconsistent in its radical form with such institutions as the family and hereditary property Democratic government on the contrary is merely a means to an end an expedient for the better and smoother government of certain states at certain junctures It involves no special ideals of life it is a question of policy namely whether the general interest will be better served by granting all men and perhaps all women an equal voice in elections For political democracy arising in great and complex states must necessarily be a government by deputy and the questions actually submitted to the people can be only very large rough matters of general policy or of confidence in party leaders We may now add a few reflections about each kind of democracy regarding democratic government chiefly in its origin and phases for its function is that of all government and social democracy chiefly as an ideal since its origin is simply that of society itself Sidenote Well founded distrust of rulers Yet experts if rational would serve common interests The possibility of intelligent selfishness and the prevalence of a selfishness far from intelligent unite to make men wary in intrusting their interests to one another s keeping If passion never overcame prudence and if private prudence always counselled what was profitable also to others no objection could arise to an aristocratic policy For if we assume a certain variety in endowments and functions among men it would evidently conduce to the general convenience that each man should exercise his powers uncontrolled by the public voice The government having facilities for information and ready resources might be left to determine all matters of policy for its members private interests would coincide with those of the public and even if prejudices and irrational habits prevented them from pursuing their own advantage they would surely not err more frequently or more egregiously in that respect than would the private individual to whose ignorant fancy every decision would otherwise have to be referred Thus in monarchy every expedient is seized upon to render the king s and the country s interests coincident public prosperity fills his treasury the arts adorn his court justice rendered confirms his authority If reason were efficacious kings might well be left to govern alone Theologians under the same hypothesis might be trusted to draw up creeds and codes of morals and in fact everyone with a gift for management or creation might be authorised to execute his plans It is in this way perhaps that some social animals manage their affairs for they seem to company operate without external control That their instinctive system is far from perfect we may safely take for granted but government too is not always adequate or wise What spoils such a spontaneous harmony is that people neither understand their own interests nor have the constancy to pursue them systematically and further that their personal or animal interests may actually clash in so far as they have not been harmonised by reason To rationalise an interest is simply to correlate it with every other interest which it at all affects In proportion as rational interests predominate in a man and he esteems rational satisfactions above all others it becomes impossible that he should injure another by his action and unnecessary that he should sacrifice himself But the worse and more brutal his nature is and the less satisfaction he finds in justice the more need he has to do violence to himself lest he should be doing it to others This is the reason why preaching conscious effort and even education are such feeble agencies for moral reform only selection and right breeding could produce that genuine virtue which would not need to find goodness unpalatable nor to say in expressing its own perversities that a distaste for excellence is a condition of being good But when a man is ill begotten and foolish and hates the means to his own happiness he naturally is not well fitted to secure that of other people Those who suffer by his folly are apt to think him malicious whereas he is the first to suffer himself and knows that it was the force of circumstances and a certain pathetic helplessness in his own soul that led him into his errors Sidenote People jealous of eminence These errors when they are committed by a weak and passionate ruler are not easily forgiven His subjects attribute to him an intelligence he probably lacks they call him treacherous or cruel when he is very likely yielding to lazy habits and to insidious traditions They see in every calamity that befalls them a proof that his interests are radically hostile to theirs whereas it is only his conduct that is so Accordingly in proportion to their alertness and self sufficiency they clamour for the right to govern themselves and usually secure it Democratic government is founded on the decay of representative eminence It indicates that natural leaders are no longer trusted merely because they are rich enterprising learned or old Their spontaneous action would go awry They must not be allowed to act without control Men of talent may be needed and used in a democratic state they may be occasionally hired but they will be closely watched and directed by the people who fear otherwise to suffer the penalty of foolishly intrusting their affairs to other men s hands A fool says a Spanish proverb knows more at home than a wise man at his neighbour s So democratic instinct assumes that unless all those concerned keep a vigilant eye on the course of public business and frequently pronounce on its conduct they will before long awake to the fact that they have been ignored and enslaved The implication is that each man is the best judge of his own interests and of the means to advance them or at least that by making himself his own guide he can in the end gain the requisite insight and thus not only attain his practical aims but also some political and intellectual dignity Sidenote It is representative All just government pursues the general good the choice between aristocratic and democratic forms touches only the means to that end One arrangement may well be better fitted to one place and time and another to another Everything depends on the existence or non existence of available practical eminence The democratic theory is clearly wrong if it imagines that eminence is not naturally representative Eminence is synthetic and represents what it synthesises An eminence not representative would not constitute excellence but merely extravagance or notoriety Excellence in anything whether thought action or feeling consists in nothing but representation in standing for many diffuse constituents reduced to harmony so that the wise moment is filled with an activity in which the upshot of the experience concerned is mirrored and regarded an activity just to all extant interests and speaking in their total behalf But anything approaching such true excellence is as rare as it is great and a democratic society naturally jealous of greatness may be excused for not expecting true greatness and for not even understanding what it is A government is not made representative or just by the mechanical expedient of electing its members by universal suffrage It becomes representative only by embodying in its policy whether by instinct or high intelligence the people s conscious and unconscious interests Sidenote But subject to decay Democratic theory seems to be right however about the actual failure of theocracies monarchies and oligarchies to remain representative and to secure the general good The true eminence which natural leaders may have possessed in the beginning usually declines into a conventional and baseless authority The guiding powers which came to save and express humanity fatten in office and end by reversing their function The government reverts to the primeval robber the church stands in the way of all wisdom Under such circumstances it is a happy thing if the people possess enough initiative to assert themselves and after clearing the ground in a more or less summary fashion allow some new organisation more representative of actual interests to replace the old encumbrances and tyrannies Sidenote Ancient citizenship a privilege In the heroic ages of Greece and Rome patriotism was stimulated in manifold ways The city was a fatherland a church an army and almost a family It had its own school of art its own dialect its own feasts its own fables Every possible social interest was either embodied in the love of country or like friendship and fame closely associated with it Patriotism could then be expected to sway every mind at all capable of moral enthusiasm Furthermore only the flower of the population were citizens In rural districts the farmer might be a freeman but he probably had slaves whose work he merely superintended The meaner and more debasing offices mining sea faring domestic service and the more laborious part of all industries were relegated to slaves The citizens were a privileged class Military discipline and the street life natural in Mediterranean countries kept public events and public men always under everybody s eyes the state was a bodily presence Democracy when it arose in such communities was still aristocratic it imposed few new duties upon the common citizens while it diffused many privileges and exemptions among them Sidenote Modern democracy industrial The social democracy which is the ideal of many in modern times on the other hand excludes slavery unites whole nations and even all mankind into a society of equals and admits no local or racial privileges by which the sense of fellowship may be stimulated Public spirit could not be sustained in such a community by exemptions rivalries or ambitions No one indeed would be a slave everyone would have an elementary education and a chance to demonstrate his capacity but he would be probably condemned to those occupations which in ancient republics were assigned to slaves At least at the opening of his career he would find himself on the lowest subsisting plane of humanity and he would probably remain on it throughout his life In other words the citizens of a social democracy would be all labourers for even those who rose to be leaders would in a genuine democracy rise from the ranks and belong in education and habits to the same class as all the others Sidenote Dangers to current civilisation Under such circumstances the first virtue which a democratic society would have to possess would be enthusiastic diligence The motives for work which have hitherto prevailed in the world have been want ambition and love of occupation in a social democracy after the first was eliminated the last alone would remain efficacious Love of occupation although it occasionally accompanies and cheers every sort of labour could never induce men originally to undertake arduous and uninteresting tasks nor to persevere in them if by chance or waywardness such tasks had been once undertaken Inclination can never be the general motive for the work now imposed on the masses Before labour can be its own reward it must become less continuous more varied more responsive to individual temperament and capacity Otherwise it would not cease to repress and warp human faculties A state composed exclusively of such workmen and peasants as make up the bulk of modern nations would be an utterly barbarous state Every liberal tradition would perish in it and the rational and historic essence of patriotism itself would be lost The emotion of it no doubt would endure for it is not generosity that the people lack They possess every impulse it is experience that they cannot gather for in gathering it they would be constituting those higher organs that make up an aristocratic society Civilisation has hitherto consisted in diffusion and dilution of habits arising in privileged centres It has not sprung from the people it has arisen in their midst by a variation from them and it has afterward imposed itself on them from above All its founders in antiquity passed for demi gods or were at least inspired by an oracle or a nymph The vital genius thus bursting forth and speaking with authority gained a certain ascendency in the world it mitigated barbarism without removing it This is one fault among others which current civilisation has it is artificial If social democracy could breed a new civilisation out of the people this new civilisation would be profounder than ours and more pervasive But it doubtless cannot What we have rests on conquest and conversion on leadership and imitation on mastership and service To abolish aristocracy in the sense of social privilege and sanctified authority would be to cut off the source from which all culture has hitherto flowed Sidenote Is current civilisation a good Civilisation however although we are wont to speak the word with a certain unction is a thing whose value may be questioned One way of defending the democratic ideal is to deny that civilisation is a good In one sense indeed social democracy is essentially a reversion to a more simple life more Arcadian and idyllic than that which aristocracy has fostered Equality is more easily attained in a patriarchal age than in an age of concentrated and intense activities Possessions ideal and material may be fewer in a simple community but they are more easily shared and bind men together in moral and imaginative bonds instead of dividing them as do all highly elaborate ways of living or thinking The necessaries of life can be enjoyed by a rural people living in a sparsely settled country and among these necessaries might be counted not only bread and rags which everyone comes by in some fashion even in our society but that communal religion poetry and fellowship which the civilised poor are so often without If social democracy should triumph and take this direction it would begin by greatly diminishing the amount of labour performed in the world All instruments of luxury many instruments of vain knowledge and art would no longer be produced We might see the means of communication lately so marvellously developed again disused the hulks of great steamers rusting in harbours the railway bridges collapsing and the tunnels choked while a rural population with a few necessary and perfected manufactures would spread over the land and abandon the great cities to ruin calling them seats of Babylonian servitude and folly Such anticipations may seem fantastic and of course there is no probability that a reaction against material progress should set in in the near future since as yet the tide of commercialism and population continues everywhere to rise but does any thoughtful man suppose that these tendencies will be eternal and that the present experiment in civilisation is the last the world will see Sidenote Horrors of materialistic democracy If social democracy however refused to diminish labour and wealth and proposed rather to accelerate material progress and keep every furnace at full blast it would come face to face with a serious problem By whom would the product be enjoyed By those who created it What sort of pleasures arts and sciences would those grimy workmen have time and energy for after a day of hot and unremitting exertion What sort of religion would fill their Sabbaths and their dreams We see how they spend their leisure to day when a strong aristocratic tradition and the presence of a rich class still profoundly influence popular ideals Imagine those aristocratic influences removed and would any head be lifted above a dead level of infinite dulness and vulgarity Would mankind be anything but a trivial sensuous superstitious custom ridden herd There is no tyranny so hateful as a vulgar and anonymous tyranny It is all permeating all thwarting it blasts every budding novelty and sprig of genius with its omnipresent and fierce stupidity Such a headless people has the mind of a worm and the claws of a dragon Anyone would be a hero who should quell the monster A foreign invader or domestic despot would at least have steps to his throne possible standing places for art and intelligence his supercilious indifference would discountenance the popular gods and allow some courageous hand at last to shatter them Social democracy at high pressure would leave no room for liberty The only freeman in it would be one whose whole ideal was to be an average man Sidenote Timocracy or socialistic democracy Perhaps however social democracy might take a more liberal form It might allow the benefits of civilisation to be integrated in eminent men whose influence in turn should direct and temper the general life This would be timocracy a government by men of merit The same abilities which raised these men to eminence would enable them to apprehend ideal things and to employ material resources for the common advantage They would formulate religion cultivate the arts and sciences provide for government and all public conveniences and inspire patriotism by their discourse and example At the same time a new motive would be added to common labour I mean ambition For there would be not only a possibility of greater reward but a possibility of greater service The competitive motive which socialism is supposed to destroy would be restored in timocracy and an incentive offered to excellence and industry The country s resources would increase for the very reason that somebody might conceivably profit by them and everyone would have at least an ideal interest in ministering to that complete life which he or his children or whoever was most capable of appreciation was actually to enjoy Such a timocracy of which the Roman Church is a good example would differ from the social aristocracy that now exists only by the removal of hereditary advantages People would be born equal but they would grow unequal and the only equality subsisting would be equality of opportunity If power remained in the people s hands the government would be democratic but a full development of timocracy would allow the proved leader to gain great ascendancy The better security the law offered that the men at the top should be excellent the less restraint would it need to put upon them when once in their places Their eminence would indeed have been factitious and their station undeserved if they were not able to see and do what was requisite better than the community at large An assembly has only the lights common to the majority of its members far less therefore than its members have when added together and less even than the wiser part of them A timocracy would therefore seem to unite the advantages of all forms of government and to avoid their respective abuses It would promote freedom scientifically It might be a monarchy if men existed fit to be kings but they would have to give signs of their fitness and their honours would probably not be hereditary Like aristocracy it would display a great diversity of institutions and superposed classes a stimulating variety in ways of living it would be favourable to art and science and to noble idiosyncrasies Among its activities the culminating and most conspicuous ones would be liberal Yet there would be no isolation of the aristocratic body its blood would be drawn from the people and only its traditions from itself Like social democracy finally it would be just and open to every man but it would not depress humanity nor wish to cast everybody in a common mould Sidenote The difficulty the same as in all Socialism There are immense difficulties however in the way of such a Utopia some physical and others moral Timocracy would have to begin by uprooting the individual from his present natural soil and transplanting him to that in which his spirit might flourish best This proposed transfer is what makes the system ideally excellent since nature is a means only but it makes it also almost impossible to establish since nature is the only efficacious power Timocracy can arise only in the few fortunate cases where material and social forces have driven men to that situation in which their souls can profit most and where they find no influences more persuasive than those which are most liberating It is clear for instance that timocracy would exclude the family or greatly weaken it Soul and body would be wholly transferred to that medium where lay the creature s spiritual affinities his origins would be disregarded on principle except where they might help to forecast his disposition Life would become heartily civic corporate conventual otherwise opportunities would not be equal in the beginning nor culture and happiness perfect in the end and identical We have seen however what difficulties and dangers surround any revolution in that ideal direction Even less perfect polities that leave more to chance would require a moral transformation in mankind if they were to be truly successful A motive which now generates political democracy impatience of sacrifice must in a good social democracy be turned into its opposite Men must be glad to labour unselfishly in the spirit of art or of religious service for if they labour selfishly the higher organs of the state would perish since only a few can profit by them materially while if they neglect their work civilisation loses that intensive development which it was proposed to maintain Each man would need to forget himself and not to chafe under his natural limitations He must find his happiness in seeing his daily task grow under his hands and when in speculative moments he lifts his eyes from his labour he must find an ideal satisfaction in patriotism in love for that complex society to which he is contributing an infinitesimal service He must learn to be happy without wealth fame or power and with no reward save his modest livelihood and an ideal participation in his country s greatness It is a spirit hardly to be maintained without a close organisation and much training and as military and religious timocracies have depended on discipline and a minute rule of life so an industrial timocracy would have to depend on guilds and unions which would make large inroads upon personal freedom Sidenote The masses would have to be plebeian in position and patrician in feeling The question here suggests itself whether such a citizen once having accepted his humble lot would be in a different position from the plebeians in an aristocracy The same subordination would be imposed upon him only the ground assigned for his submission would be no longer self interest and necessity but patriotic duty This patriotism would have to be of an exalted type Its end would not be as in industrial society to secure the private interests of each citizen its end would be the glory and perfection of the state as imagination or philosophy might conceive them This glory and perfection would not be a benefit to anyone who was not in some degree a philosopher and a poet They would seem then to be the special interests of an aristocracy not indeed an aristocracy of wealth or power but an aristocracy of noble minds Those whose hearts could prize the state s ideal perfection would be those in whom its benefits would be integrated And the common citizen would find in their existence and in his own participation in their virtue the sole justification for his loyalty Ideal patriotism is not secured when each man although without natural eminence pursues his private interests What renders man an imaginative and moral being is that in society he gives new aims to his life which could not have existed in solitude the aims of friendship religion science and art All these aims in a well knit state are covered by the single passion of patriotism and then a conception of one s country its history and mission becomes the touchstone of every ideal impulse Timocracy requires this kind of patriotism in everybody so that if public duty is not to become a sacrifice imposed on the many for the sake of the few as in aristocracy the reason can only be that the many covet appreciate and appropriate their country s ideal glories quite as much as the favoured class ever could in any aristocracy Sidenote Organisation for ideal ends breeds fanaticism Is this possible What might happen if the human race were immensely improved and exalted there is as yet no saying but experience has given no example of efficacious devotion to communal ideals except in small cities held together by close military and religious bonds and having no important relations to anything external Even this antique virtue was short lived and sadly thwarted by private and party passion Where public spirit has held best as at Sparta or to take a very different type of communal passion among the Jesuits it has been paid for by a notable lack of spontaneity and wisdom such inhuman devotion to an arbitrary end has made these societies odious We may say therefore that a zeal sufficient to destroy selfishness is as men are now constituted worse than selfishness itself In pursuing prizes for themselves people benefit their fellows more than in pursuing such narrow and irrational ideals as alone seem to be powerful in the world To ambition to the love of wealth and honour to love of a liberty which meant opportunity for experiment and adventure we owe whatever benefits we have derived from Greece and Rome from Italy and England It is doubtful whether a society which offered no personal prizes would inspire effort and it is still more doubtful whether that effort if actually stimulated by education would be beneficent For an indoctrinated and collective virtue turns easily to fanaticism it imposes irrational sacrifices prompted by some abstract principle or habit once perhaps useful but that convention soon becomes superstitious and ceases to represent general human excellence Sidenote Public spirit the life of democracy Now it is in the spirit of social democracy to offer no prizes Office in it being the reward of no great distinction brings no great honour and being meanly paid it brings no great profit at least while honestly administered All wealth in a true democracy would be the fruit of personal exertion and would come too late to be nobly enjoyed or to teach the art of liberal living It would be either accumulated irrationally or given away outright And if fortunes could not be transmitted or used to found a great family they would lose their chief imaginative charm The pleasures a democratic society affords are vulgar and not even by an amiable illusion can they become an aim in life A life of pleasure requires an aristocratic setting to make it interesting or really conceivable Intellectual and artistic greatness does not need prizes but it sorely needs sympathy and a propitious environment Genius like goodness which can stand alone would arise in a democratic society as frequently as elsewhere but it might not be so well fed or so well assimilated There would at least be no artificial and simulated merit everybody would take his ease in his inn and sprawl unbuttoned without respect for any finer judgment or performance than that which he himself was inclined to The only excellence subsisting would be spontaneous excellence inwardly prompted sure of itself and inwardly rewarded For such excellence to grow general mankind must be notably transformed If a noble and civilised democracy is to subsist the common citizen must be something of a saint and something of a hero We see therefore how justly flattering and profound and at the same time how ominous was Montesquieu s saying that the principle of democracy is virtue CHAPTER VI FREE SOCIETY

7139_75360_000004_000001	train-clean-360	Nature s values are imputed to her retroactively by spirit which in its material dependence has a logical and moral primacy of its own

7139_75360_000004_000003	train-clean-360	And so they would always have remained in crude experience if no cumulative reflection no art and no science had come to dominate and foreshorten that equable flow of substance arresting it ideally in behalf of some rational interest 
7139_75360_000005_000000	train-clean-360	Thus it comes to pass that rational interests have a certain ascendancy in the world as well as an absolute authority over it for they arise where an organic equilibrium has naturally established itself 
7139_75360_000005_000001	train-clean-360	Such an equilibrium maintains itself by virtue of the same necessity that produced it without arresting the flux or introducing any miracle it sustains in being an ideal form

7139_75360_000011_000003	train-clean-360	From this relative substantiality they fade into notions of country posterity humanity and the gods 
7139_75360_000011_000004	train-clean-360	These figures all represent some circle of events or forces in the real world but such representation besides being mythical is usually most inadequate 
7139_75360_000011_000005	train-clean-360	The boundaries of that province which each spirit presides over are vaguely drawn the spirit itself being correspondingly indefinite 
7139_75360_000011_000006	train-clean-360	This ambiguity is most conspicuous perhaps in the most absorbing of the personages which a man constructs in this imaginative fashion his idea of himself 
7139_75360_000011_000007	train-clean-360	 There is society where none intrudes and for most men sympathy with their imaginary selves is a powerful and dominant emotion True memory offers but a meagre and interrupted vista of past experience yet even that picture is far too rich a term for mental discourse to bandy about a name with a few physical and social connotations is what must represent the man to his own thinkings 
7139_75360_000011_000008	train-clean-360	Or rather it is no memory however eviscerated that fulfils that office

7139_75360_000018_000006	train-clean-360	They often identified fame with immortality a subject on which they had far more rational sentiments than have since prevailed 
none	none	Sidenote Its possible ideality Fame as a noble mind conceives and desires it is not embodied in a monument a biography or the repetition of a strange name by strangers it consists in the immortality of a man s work his spirit his efficacy in the perpetual rejuvenation of his soul in the world When Horace no model of magnanimity wrote his exegi monumentum he was not thinking that the pleasure he would continue to give would remind people of his trivial personality which indeed he never particularly celebrated and which had much better lie buried with his bones He was thinking of course of that pleasure itself thinking that the delight half lyric half sarcastic which those delicate cameos had given him to carve would be perennially renewed in all who retraced them Nay perhaps we may not go too far in saying that even that impersonal satisfaction was not the deepest he felt the deepest very likely flowed from the immortality not of his monument but of the subject and passion it commemorated that tenderness I mean and that disillusion with mortal life which rendered his verse immortal He had expressed and in expressing appropriated some recurring human moods some mocking renunciations and he knew that his spirit was immortal being linked and identified with that portion of the truth He had become a little spokesman of humanity uttering what all experience repeats more or less articulately and even if he should cease to be honoured in men s memories he would continue to be unwittingly honoured and justified in their lives What we may conceive to have come in this way even within a Horace s apprehension is undoubtedly what has attached many nobler souls to fame With an inversion of moral derivations which all mythical expression involves we speak of fame as the reward of genius whereas in truth genius the imaginative dominion of experience is its own reward and fame is but a foolish image by which its worth is symbolised When the Virgin in the Magnificat says Behold from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed the psalmist surely means to express a spiritual exaltation exempt from vanity he merely translates into a rhetorical figure the fact that what had been first revealed to Mary would also bless all generations That the Church should in consequence deem and pronounce her blessed is an incident describing but not creating the unanimity in their religious joys Fame is thus the outward sign or recognition of an inward representative authority residing in genius or good fortune an authority in which lies the whole worth of fame Those will substantially remember and honour us who keep our ideals and we shall live on in those ages whose experience we have anticipated Free society differs from that which is natural and legal precisely in this that it does not cultivate relations which in the last analysis are experienced and material but turns exclusively to unanimities in meanings to collaborations in an ideal world The basis of free society is of course natural as we said but free society has ideal goals Spirits cannot touch save by becoming unanimous At the same time public opinion reputation and impersonal sympathy reinforce only very general feelings and reinforce them vaguely and as the inner play of sentiment becomes precise it craves more specific points of support or comparison It is in creatures of our own species that we chiefly scent the aroma of inward sympathy because it is they that are visibly moved on the same occasions as ourselves and it is to those among our fellow men who share our special haunts and habits that we feel more precise affinities Though the ground for such feeling is animal contact and contagion its deliverance does not revert to those natural accidents but concerns a represented sympathy in represented souls Friendship springing from accidental association terminates in a consciousness of ideal and essential agreement Sidenote Comradeship Comradeship is a form of friendship still akin to general sociability and gregariousness When men are in the same boat together when a common anxiety occupation or sport unites them they feel their human kinship in an intensified form without any greater personal affinity subsisting between them The same effect is produced by a common estrangement from the rest of society For this reason comradeship lasts no longer than the circumstances that bring it about Its constancy is proportionate to the monotony of people s lives and minds There is a lasting bond among schoolfellows because no one can become a boy again and have a new set of playmates There is a persistent comradeship with one s countrymen especially abroad because seldom is a man pliable and polyglot enough to be at home among foreigners or really to understand them There is an inevitable comradeship with men of the same breeding or profession however bad these may be because habits soon monopolise the man Nevertheless a greater buoyancy a longer youth a richer experience would break down all these limits of fellowship Such clingings to the familiar are three parts dread of the unfamiliar and want of resource in its presence for one part in them of genuine loyalty Plasticity loves new moulds because it can fill them but for a man of sluggish mind and bad manners there is decidedly no place like home Sidenote External conditions of friendship Though comradeship is an accidental bond it is the condition of ideal friendship for the ideal in all spheres is nothing but the accidental confirming itself and generating its own standard Men must meet to love and many other accidents besides conjunction must conspire to make a true friendship possible In order that friendship may fulfil the conditions even of comradeship it is requisite that the friends have the same social status so that they may live at ease together and have congenial tastes They must further have enough community of occupation and gifts to give each an appreciation of the other s faculty for qualities are not complementary unless they are qualities of the same substance Nothing must be actual in either friend that is not potential in the other Sidenote Identity in sex required For this reason among others friends are generally of the same sex for when men and women agree it is only in their conclusions their reasons are always different So that while intellectual harmony between men and women is easily possible its delightful and magic quality lies precisely in the fact that it does not arise from mutual understanding but is a conspiracy of alien essences and a kissing as it were in the dark As man s body differs from woman s in sex and strength so his mind differs from hers in quality and function they can company operate but can never fuse The human race in its intellectual life is organised like the bees the masculine soul is a worker sexually atrophied and essentially dedicated to impersonal and universal arts the feminine is a queen infinitely fertile omnipresent in its brooding industry but passive and abounding in intuitions without method and passions without justice Friendship with a woman is therefore apt to be more or less than friendship less because there is no intellectual parity more because even when the relation remains wholly dispassionate as in respect to old ladies there is something mysterious and oracular about a woman s mind which inspires a certain instinctive deference and puts it out of the question to judge what she says by masculine standards She has a kind of sibylline intuition and the right to be irrationally a propos There is a gallantry of the mind which pervades all conversation with a lady as there is a natural courtesy toward children and mystics but such a habit of respectful concession marking as it does an intellectual alienation as profound as that which separates us from the dumb animals is radically incompatible with friendship Sidenote and in age Friends moreover should have been young together Much difference in age defeats equality and forbids frankness on many a fundamental subject it confronts two minds of unlike focus one near sighted and without perspective the other seeing only the background of present things While comparisons in these respects may be interesting and borrowings sometimes possible lending the older mind life and the younger mind wisdom such intercourse has hardly the value of spontaneous sympathy in which the spark of mutual intelligence flies as it should almost without words Contagion is the only source of valid mind reading you must imitate to understand and where the plasticity of two minds is not similar their mutual interpretations are necessarily false They idealise in their friends whatever they do not invent or ignore and the friendship which should have lived on energies conspiring spontaneously together dies into conscious appreciation Sidenote Constituents of friendship All these are merely permissive conditions for friendship its positive essence is yet to find How we may ask does the vision of the general socius humanity become specific in the vision of a particular friend without losing its ideality or reverting to practical values Of course individuals might be singled out for the special benefits they may have conferred but a friend s only gift is himself and friendship is not friendship it is not a form of free or liberal society if it does not terminate in an ideal possession in an object loved for its own sake Such objects can be ideas only not forces for forces are subterranean and instrumental things having only such value as they borrow from their ulterior effects and manifestations To praise the utility of friendship as the ancients so often did and to regard it as a political institution justified like victory or government by its material results is to lose one s moral bearings The value of victory or good government is rather to be found in the fact that among other things it might render friendship possible We are not to look now for what makes friendship useful but for whatever may be found in friendship that may lend utility to life Sidenote Personal liking The first note that gives sociability a personal quality and raises the comrade into an incipient friend is doubtless sensuous affinity Whatever reaction we may eventually make on an impression after it has had time to soak in and to merge in some practical or intellectual habit its first assault is always on the senses and no sense is an indifferent organ Each has so to speak its congenial rate of vibration and gives its stimuli a varying welcome Little as we may attend to these instinctive hospitalities of sense they betray themselves in unjustified likes and dislikes felt for casual persons and things in the je ne sais quoi that makes instinctive sympathy Voice manner aspect hints of congenial tastes and judgments a jest in the right key a gesture marking the right aversions all these trifles leave behind a pervasive impression We reject a vision we find indigestible and without congruity to our inner dream we accept and incorporate another into our private pantheon where it becomes a legitimate figure however dumb and subsidiary it may remain In a refined nature these sensuous premonitions of sympathy are seldom misleading Liking cannot of course grow into friendship over night as it might into love the pleasing impression even if retained will lie perfectly passive and harmless in the mind until new and different impressions follow to deepen the interest at first evoked and to remove its centre of gravity altogether from the senses In love if the field is clear a single glimpse may like Tristan s potion produce a violent and irresistible passion but in friendship the result remains more proportionate to the incidental causes discrimination is preserved jealousy and exclusiveness are avoided That vigilant besetting insatiable affection so full of doubts and torments with which the lover follows his object is out of place here for the friend has no property in his friend s body or leisure or residual ties he accepts what is offered and what is acceptable and the rest he leaves in peace He is distinctly not his brother s keeper for the society of friends is free

social idea most potent over practical minds is perhaps the idea of country When a tribe enlarged and domiciled has become a state much social feeling that was before evoked by things visible loses its sensuous object Yet each man remains no less dependent than formerly on his nation although less swayed by its visible presence and example he is no less concerned materially and ideally in the fortunes of the community If a sense for social relations is to endure some symbol must take the place of the moving crowd the visible stronghold and the outspread fields and orchards that once made up his country some intellectual figment must arise to focus political interests no longer confined to the crops and the priest s medicinal auguries It is altogether impossible that the individual should have a discursive and adequate knowledge of statecraft and economy Whatever idea then he frames to represent his undistinguished political relations becomes the centre of his patriotism When intelligence is not keen this idea may remain sensuous The visible instruments of social life chieftains armies monuments the dialect and dress of the district with all customs and pleasures traditional there these are what a sensuous man may understand by his country Bereft of these sensations he would feel lost and incapable the habits formed in that environment would be galled by any other This fondness for home this dread of change and exile is all the love of country he knows If by chance without too much added thought he could rise to a certain poetic sentiment he might feel attachment also to the landscape to the memorable spots and aspects of his native land These objects which rhetoric calls sacred might really have a certain sanctity for him a wave of pious emotion might run over him at the sight of them a pang when in absence they were recalled These very things however like the man who prizes them are dependent on a much larger system and if patriotism is to embrace ideally what really produces human well being it should extend over a wider field and to less picturable objects Sidenote Ambiguous limits of a native country geographical and moral To define one s country is not so simple a matter as it may seem The habitat of a man s youth to which actual associations may bind him is hardly his country until he has conceived the political and historical forces that include that habitat in their sphere of influence and have determined its familiar institutions Such forces are numerous and their spheres include one another like concentric rings France for instance is an uncommonly distinct and self conscious nation with a long historic identity and a compact territory Yet what is the France a Frenchman is to think of and love Paris itself has various quarters and moral climates one of which may well be loved while another is detested The provinces have customs temperaments political ideals and even languages of their own Is Alsace Lorraine beyond the pale of French patriotism And if not why utterly exclude French speaking Switzerland the Channel Islands Belgium or Quebec Or is a Frenchman rather to love the colonies by way of compensation Is an Algerian Moor or a native of Tonquin his true fellow citizen Is Tahiti a part of his country The truth is if we look at the heart of the matter a Protestant born in Paris is less a Frenchman than is a Catholic born in Geneva If we pass from geography to institutions the same vagueness exists France to one man represents the Revolution to another the Empire to a third the Church and the vestiges of the ancien regime Furthermore how far into the past is patriotism to look Is Charlemagne one of the glories of French history Is it Julius Caesar or Vicingetorix that is to warm the patriotic heart Want of reflection and a blind subservience to the colours of the map has led some historians to call Roman victories defeats suffered by their country even when that country is essentially so Roman for instance as Spain With as good reason might a Sicilian or a Florentine chafe under the Latin conquest or an American blush at the invasion of his country by the Pilgrim Fathers Indeed even geographically the limits and the very heart of a man s country are often ambiguous Was Alexander s country Macedon or Greece Was General Lee s the United States or Virginia The ancients defined their country from within outward its heart was the city and its limits those of that city s dominion or affinities Moderns generally define their country rather stupidly by its administrative frontiers and yet an Austrian would have some difficulty in applying even this conventional criterion Sidenote Sentimental and political patriotism The object of patriotism is in truth something ideal a moral entity definable only by the ties which a man s imagination and reason can at any moment recognise If he has insight and depth of feeling he will perceive that what deserves his loyalty is the entire civilisation to which he owes his spiritual life and into which that life will presently flow back with whatever new elements he may have added Patriotism accordingly has two aspects it is partly sentiment by which it looks back upon the sources of culture and partly policy or allegiance to those ideals which being suggested by what has already been attained animate the better organs of society and demand further embodiment To love one s country unless that love is quite blind and lazy must involve a distinction between the country s actual condition and its inherent ideal and this distinction in turn involves a demand for changes and for effort Party allegiance is a true form of patriotism For a party at least in its intent is an association of persons advocating the same policy Every thoughtful man must advocate some policy and unless he has the misfortune to stand quite alone in his conception of public welfare he will seek to carry out that policy by the aid of such other persons as advocate it also Sidenote The earth and the race the first objects of rational loyalty The springs of culture which retrospective patriotism regards go back in the last instance to cosmic forces The necessity that marshals the stars makes possible the world men live in and is the first general and law giver to every nation The earth s geography its inexorable climates with their flora and fauna make a play ground for the human will which should be well surveyed by any statesman who wishes to judge and act not fantastically but with reference to the real situation Geography is a most enlightening science In describing the habitat of man it largely explains his history Animal battles give the right and only key to human conflicts for the superadded rational element in man is not partisan but on the contrary insinuates into his economy the novel principle of justice and peace As this leaven however can mingle only with elements predisposed to receive it the basis of reason itself in so far as it attains expression must be sought in the natural world The fortunes of the human family among the animals thus come to concern reason and to be the background of progress Within humanity the next sphere of interest for a patriot is the race from which he is descended with its traditional languages and religions Blood is the ground of character and intelligence The fruits of civilisation may indeed be transmitted from one race to another and consequently a certain artificial homogeneity may be secured amongst different nations yet unless continual intermarriage takes place each race will soon recast and vitiate the common inheritance The fall of the Roman Empire offered such a spectacle when various types of barbarism with a more or less classic veneer re established themselves everywhere Perhaps modern cosmopolitanism if not maintained by commerce or by permanent conquest may break apart in the same way and yield to local civilisations no less diverse than Christendom and Islam Sidenote Race when distinct the greatest of distinctions Community of race is a far deeper bond than community of language education or government Where one political system dominates various races it forces their common culture to be external merely This is perhaps the secret of that strange recrudescence of national feeling apart often from political divisions which has closely followed the French Revolution and the industrial era The more two different peoples grow alike in externals the more conscious and jealous they become of diversity in their souls and where individuals are too insignificant to preserve any personality or distinction of their own they flock together into little intentional societies and factious groups in the hope of giving their imagination in its extremity some little food and comfort Private nationalities and private religions are luxuries at such a time in considerable demand The future may possibly see in the Occident that divorce between administrative and ideal groups which is familiar in the Orient so that under no matter what government and with utter cosmopolitanism in industry and science each race may guard its own poetry religion and manners Such traditions however would always be survivals or revivals rather than genuine expressions of life because mind must either represent nature and the conditions of action or else be content to persist precariously and without a function like a sort of ghost Sidenote Pure races may be morally sterile Some races are obviously superior to others A more thorough adjustment to the conditions of existence has given their spirit victory scope and a relative stability It is therefore of the greatest importance not to obscure this superiority by intermarriage with inferior stock and thus nullify the progress made by a painful evolution and a prolonged sifting of souls Reason protests as much as instinct against any fusion for instance of white and black peoples Mixture is in itself no evil if the two nations being approximately equal but having complementary gifts can modify them without ultimate loss and possibly to advantage Indeed the so called pure races since their purity has gone with isolation and inexperience have borne comparatively little spiritual fruit Large contact and concentrated living bring out native genius but mixture with an inferior stock can only tend to obliterate it The Jews the Greeks the Romans the English were never so great as when they confronted other nations reacting against them and at the same time perhaps adopting their culture but this greatness fails inwardly whenever contact leads to amalgamation There is something unmistakably illiberal almost superstitious in standing on race for its own sake as if origins and not results were of moral value It matters nothing what blood a man has if he has the right spirit and if there is some ground for identifying the two since monkeys however educated are monkeys still it is only when blood means character and capacity and is tested by them that it becomes important Nor is it unjust to level the individual in his political and moral status with the race to which he belongs if this race holds an approved position Individual gifts and good intentions have little efficacy in the body politic if they neither express a great tradition nor can avail to found one and this tradition as religion shows will falsify individual insights so soon as they are launched into the public medium The common soul will destroy a noble genius in absorbing it and therefore to maintain progress a general genius has to be invoked and a general genius means an exceptional and distinct race Sidenote True nationality direction on a definite ideal Environment education fashion may be all powerful while they last and may make it seem a prejudice to insist on race turning its assumed efficacy into a sheer dogma with fanatical impulses behind it yet in practice the question will soon recur What shall sustain that omnipotent fashion education or environment Nothing is more treacherous than tradition when insight and force are lacking to keep it warm Under Roman dominion the inhabitants of Sparta still submitted to the laws of Lycurgus and their life continued to be a sort of ritualistic shadow of the past Those enfranchised helots thought they were maintaining a heroic state when in fact they were only turning its forms into a retrospective religion The old race was practically extinct ephors gymnasia and common meals could do nothing to revive it The ways of the Roman world a kindred promiscuous population prevailed over that local ritual and rendered it perfunctory because there were no longer any living souls to understand that a man might place his happiness in his country s life and care nothing for Oriental luxury or Oriental superstition things coming to flatter his personal lusts and make him useless and unhappy Institutions without men are as futile as men without institutions Before race can be a rational object for patriotism there must exist a traditional genius handed down by inheritance or else by adoption when the persons adopted can really appreciate the mysteries they are initiated into Blood could be disregarded if only the political ideal remained constant and progress was sustained the laws being modified only to preserve their spirit A state lives in any case by exchanging persons and all spiritual life is maintained by exchanging expressions Life is a circulation it can digest whatever materials will assume a form already determined ideally and enable that form to come forth more clearly and be determined in more particulars Stagnant matter necessarily decays and in effect is false to the spirit no less than a spirit that changes is false to itself Sidenote Country well represented by domestic and civic religion The spirit of a race is a mythical entity expressing the individual soul in its most constant and profound instincts and expanding it in the direction in which correct representation is most easily possible in the direction of ancestors kinsmen and descendants In ancient cities where patriotism was intense it was expressed in a tribal and civic religion The lares the local gods the deified heroes associated with them were either ancestors idealised or ideals of manhood taking the form of patrons and supernatural protectors Jupiter Capitolinus and the Spirit of Rome were a single object To worship Jupiter in that Capitol was to dedicate oneself to the service of Rome A foreigner could no more share that devotion than a neighbour could share the religion of the hearth without sharing by adoption the life of the family Paganism was the least artificial of religions and the most poetical its myths were comparatively transparent and what they expressed was comparatively real In that religion patriotism and family duties could take imaginable forms and those forms apart from the inevitable tinge of superstition which surrounded them did not materially vitiate the allegiance due to the actual forces on which human happiness depends Sidenote Misleading identification of country with government Sidenote Sporting or belligerent patriotism What has driven patriotism as commonly felt and conceived so far from rational courses and has attached it to vapid objects has been the initial illegitimacy of all governments Under such circumstances patriotism is merely a passion for ascendency Properly it animates the army the government the aristocracy from those circles it can percolate not perhaps without the help of some sophistry and intimidation into the mass of the people who are told that their government s fortunes are their own Now the rabble has a great propensity to take sides promptly and passionately in any spectacular contest the least feeling of affinity the slightest emotional consonance will turn the balance and divert in one direction sympathetic forces which for every practical purpose might just as well have rushed the other way Most governments are in truth private societies pitted against one another in the international arena and giving meantime at home exhibitions of eloquence and more rarely of enterprise but the people s passions are easily enlisted in such a game of course on the side of their own government just as each college or region backs its own athletes even to the extent of paying their bills Nations give the same kind of support to their fighting governments and the sporting passions and illusions concerned are what in the national game is called patriotism Where parties and governments are bad as they are in most ages and countries it makes practically no difference to a community apart from local ravages whether its own army or the enemy s is victorious in war nor does it really affect any man s welfare whether the party he happens to belong to is in office or not These issues concern in such cases only the army itself whose lives and fortunes are at stake or the official classes who lose their places when their leaders fall from power The private citizen in any event continues in such countries to pay a maximum of taxes and to suffer in all his private interests a maximum of vexation and neglect Nevertheless because he has some son at the front some cousin in the government or some historical sentiment for the flag and the nominal essence of his country the oppressed subject will glow like the rest with patriotic ardour and will decry as dead to duty and honour anyone who points out how perverse is this helpless allegiance to a government representing no public interest Sidenote Exclusive patriotism rational only when the government supported is universally beneficent In proportion as governments become good and begin to operate for the general welfare patriotism itself becomes representative and an expression of reason but just in the same measure does hostility to that government on the part of foreigners become groundless and perverse A competitive patriotism involves ill will toward all other states and a secret and constant desire to see them thrashed and subordinated It follows that a good government while it justifies this governmental patriotism in its subjects disallows it in all other men For a good government is an international benefit and the prosperity and true greatness of any country is a boon sooner or later to the whole world it may eclipse alien governments and draw away local populations or industries but it necessarily benefits alien individuals in so far as it is allowed to affect them at all Animosity against a well governed country is therefore madness A rational patriotism would rather take the form of imitating and supporting that so called foreign country and even if practicable of fusing with it The invidious and aggressive form of patriotism though inspired generally only by local conceit would nevertheless be really justified if such conceit happened to be well grounded A dream of universal predominance visiting a truly virtuous and intelligent people would be an aspiration toward universal beneficence For every man who is governed at all must be governed by others the point is that the others in ruling him shall help him to be himself and give scope to his congenial activities When coerced in that direction he obeys a force which in the best sense of the word represents him and consequently he is truly free nor could he be ruled by a more native and rightful authority than by one that divines and satisfies his true necessities Sidenote Accidents of birth and training affect the ideal A man s nature is not however a quantity or quality fixed unalterably and a priori As breeding and selection improve a race so every experience modifies the individual and offers a changed basis for future experience The language religion education and prejudices acquired in youth bias character and predetermine the directions in which development may go on A child might possibly change his country a man can only wish that he might change it Therefore among the true interests which a government should represent nationality itself must be included Sidenote They are conditions and may contribute something Mechanical forces we must not weary of repeating do not come merely to vitiate the ideal they come to create it The historical background of life is a part of its substance and the ideal can never grow independently of its spreading roots A sanctity hangs about the sources of our being whether physical social or imaginative The ancients who kissed the earth on returning to their native country expressed nobly and passionately what every man feels for those regions and those traditions whence the sap of his own life has been sucked in There is a profound friendliness in whatever revives primordial habits however they may have been overlaid with later sophistications For this reason the homelier words of a mother tongue the more familiar assurances of an ancestral religion and the very savour of childhood s dishes remain always a potent means to awaken emotion Such ingrained influences in their vague totality make a man s true nationality A government in order to represent the general interests of its subjects must move in sympathy with their habits and memories it must respect their idiosyncrasy for the same reason that it protects their lives If parting from a single object of love be as it is true dying how much more would a shifting of all the affections be death to the soul Sidenote They are not ends Tenderness to such creative influences is a mark of profundity it has the same relation to political life that transcendentalism has to science and morals it shrinks back into radical facts into centres of vital radiation and quickens the sense for inner origins Nationality is a natural force and a constituent in character which should be reckoned with and by no means be allowed to miss those fruits which it alone might bear but like the things it venerates it is only a starting point for liberal life Just as to be always talking about transcendental points of reference primordial reality and the self to which everything appears though at first it might pass for spiritual insight is in the end nothing but pedantry and impotence so to be always harping on nationality is to convert what should be a recognition of natural conditions into a ridiculous pride in one s own oddities Nature has hidden the roots of things and though botany must now and then dig them up for the sake of comprehension their place is still under ground if flowers and fruits are to be expected The private loyalties which a man must have toward his own people grounding as they alone can his morality and genius need nevertheless to be seldom paraded Attention when well directed turns rather to making immanent racial forces blossom out in the common medium and express themselves in ways consonant with practical reason and universal progress A man s feet must be planted in his country but his eyes should survey the world What a statesman might well aim at would be to give the special sentiments and gifts of his countrymen such a turn that while continuing all vital traditions they might find less and less of what is human alien to their genius Differences in nationality founded on race and habitat must always subsist but what has been superadded artificially by ignorance and bigotry may be gradually abolished in view of universal relations better understood There is a certain plane on which all races if they reach it at all must live in common the plane of morals and science which is not to say that even in those activities the mind betrays no racial accent What is excluded from science and morals is not variety but contradiction Any community which had begun to cultivate the Life of Reason in those highest fields would tend to live rationally on all subordinate levels also for with science and morality rationally applied the best possible use would be made of every local and historical accident Where traditions had some virtue or necessity about them they would be preserved where they were remediable prejudices they would be superseded Sidenote The symbol for country may be a man and may become an idol At the birth of society instincts existed needful to the animal and having a certain glorious impetuosity about them which prompted common action and speech and a public morality and men were led to construct myths that might seem to justify this company operation Paternal authority could easily suggest one symbol for social loyalty the chief probably a venerable and imperious personage could be called a father and obeyed as a natural master His command might by convention be regarded as an expression of the common voice just as the father s will is by nature the representative of his children s interests Again the members of each community were distinguished from their enemies by many a sign and custom these signs and customs might also become a graphic symbol for the common life Both these cases suggest how easily a symbol takes the place of its object and becomes an idol If the symbol happens to be a man there are natural human sentiments awakened by him and whatever respect his character or gifts may inspire whatever charm there may be in his person whatever graciousness he may add to his official favours or commands increase immensely his personal ascendency 
1025_75365_000002_000002	train-clean-360	A king has a great opportunity to make himself loved 
none	none	This scope given to private inclination is what to ordinary fancy makes royalty enviable few envy its impersonal power and historic weight Yet if a king were nothing but a man surrounded by flatterers who was cheered when he drove abroad there would be little stability in monarchy A king is really the state s hinge and centre of gravity the point where all private and party ambitions meet and in a sense are neutralised It is not easy for factions to overturn him for every other force in the state will instinctively support him against faction His elevation above everyone the identity of his sober interests with those of the state at large is calculated to make him the people s natural representative his word has therefore a genuine authority and his ascendency not being invidious is able to secure internal peace even when not enlightened enough to insure prosperity or to avoid foreign wars Accordingly whenever a monarchy is at all representative time has an irresistible tendency to increase its prestige the king is felt to be the guardian as well as the symbol of all public greatness Meantime a double dislocation is possible here patriotism may be wholly identified with personal loyalty to the sovereign while the sovereign himself instead of making public interests his own may direct his policy so as to satisfy his private passions The first confusion leads to a conflict between tradition and reason the second to the ruin of either the state or the monarchy In a word a symbol needs to remain transparent and to become adequate failing in either respect it misses its function Sidenote Feudal representation sensitive but partial The feudal system offers perhaps the best illustration of a patriotism wholly submerged in loyalty The sense of mutual obligation and service was very clear in this case the vassal in swearing fealty knew perfectly well what sort of a bargain he was striking A feudal government while it lasted was accordingly highly responsive and responsible If false to its calling it could be readily disowned for it is easy to break an oath and to make new military associations especially where territorial units are small and their links accidental But this personal conscious and jealous subordination of man to man constituted a government of insignificant scope Military functions were alone considered and the rest was allowed to shift for itself Feudalism could have been possible only in a barbarous age when the arts existed on sufferance and lived on by little tentative resurrections The feudal lord was a genuine representative of a very small part of his vassal s interests This slight bond sufficed however to give him a great prestige and to stimulate in him all the habits and virtues of a responsible master so that in England where vestiges of feudalism abound to this day there is an aristocracy not merely titular Sidenote Monarchical representation comprehensive but treacherous A highly concentrated monarchy presents the exactly opposite phenomenon Here subordination is involuntary and mutual responsibility largely unconscious On the other hand the scope of representation is very wide and the monarch may well embody the whole life of the nation A great court with officers of state and a standing army is sensitive to nothing so much as to general appearances and general results The invisible forces of industry morality and personal ambition that really sustain the state are not studied or fomented by such a government so that when these resources begin to fail the ensuing catastrophes are a mystery to everybody The king and his ministers never cease wondering how they can be so constantly unfortunate So long however as the nation s vital force is unspent and taxes and soldiers are available in plenty a great monarchy tends to turn those resources to notable results The arts and sciences are encouraged by the patronage of men of breeding and affairs they are disciplined into a certain firmness and amplitude which artists and scholars if left to themselves are commonly incapable of Life is refined religion itself unless fanaticism be too hopelessly in the ascendant is company ordinated with other public interests and compelled to serve mankind a liberal life is made possible the imagination is stimulated and set free by that same brilliant concentration of all human energies which defeats practical liberty At the same time luxury and all manner of conceits are part and parcel of such a courtly civilisation and its best products are the first to be lost so that very likely the dumb forces of society hunger conscience and malice will not do any great harm when they destroy those treacherous institutions which after giving the spirit a momentary expression had become an offence to both spirit and flesh Observers at the time may lament the collapse of so much elegance and greatness but nature has no memory and brushes away without a qualm her card castle of yesterday if a new constructive impulse possesses her to day Sidenote Impersonal symbols no advantage Where no suitable persons are found to embody the state s unity other symbols have to be chosen Besides the gods and their temples there are the laws which may as among the Jews and Mohammedans become as much a fetich as any monarch and one more long lived or else some traditional policy of revenge or conquest or even the country s name or flag may serve this symbolic purpose A trivial emblem which no thinking man can substitute for the thing signified is not so great an advantage as at first sight it might seem for in the first place men are often thoughtless and adore words and symbols with a terrible earnestness while on the other hand an abstract token because of its natural insipidity can be made to stand for anything so that patriotism when it uses pompous words alone for its stimulus is very apt to be a cloak for private interests which the speaker may sincerely conceive to be the only interests in question Sidenote Patriotism not self interest save to the social man whose aims are ideal The essence of patriotism is thus annulled for patriotism does not consist in considering the private and sordid interests of others as well as one s own by a kind of sympathy which is merely vicarious or epidemic selfishness patriotism consists rather in being sensitive to a set of interests which no one could have had if he had lived in isolation but which accrue to men conscious of living in society and in a society having the scope and history of a nation It was the vice of liberalism to believe that common interests covered nothing but the sum of those objects which each individual might pursue alone whereby science religion art language and nationality itself would cease to be matters of public concern and would appeal to the individual merely as instruments The welfare of a flock of sheep is secured if each is well fed and watered but the welfare of a human society involves the partial withdrawal of every member from such pursuits to attend instead to memory and to ideal possessions these involve a certain conscious continuity and organisation in the state not necessary for animal existence It is not for man s interest to live unless he can live in the spirit because his spiritual capacity when unused will lacerate and derange even his physical life The brutal individualist falls into the same error into which despots fall when they declare war out of personal pique or tax the people to build themselves a pyramid not discerning their country s interests which they might have appropriated from interests of their own which no one else can share Democracies too are full of patriots of this lordly stripe men whose patriotism consists in joy at their personal possessions and in desire to increase them The resultant of general selfishness might conceivably be a general order but though intelligent selfishness if universal might suffice for good government it could not suffice for nationality Patriotism is an imaginative passion and imagination is ingenuous The value of patriotism is not utilitarian but ideal It belongs to the free forms of society and ennobles a man not so much because it nerves him to work or to die which the basest passions may also do but because it associates him in working or dying with an immortal and friendly companion the spirit of his race This he received from his ancestors tempered by their achievements and may transmit to posterity qualified by his own CHAPTER VIII IDEAL SOCIETY Sidenote The gregarious instinct all social instincts in suspense To many beings to almost all that people the earth and sky each soul is not attached by any practical interest Some are too distant to be perceived the proximity of others passes unnoticed It is far from requisite in pursuing safety that every strange animal be regarded as either a friend or an enemy Wanton hostilities would waste ammunition and idle attachments would waste time Yet it often happens that some of these beings having something in common with creatures we are wont to notice since we stand to them in sexual parental or hostile relations cannot well go unobserved Their presence fills us with a vague general emotion the arrested possibility at once of sexual of parental and of hostile actions This emotion is gregarious or impersonally social The flock it commonly regards may be described as an aggregate in which parents and children have been submerged in which mates are not yet selected and enemies not yet descried Gregarious sentiment is passive watchful expectant at once powerful and indistinct troubled and fascinated by things merely possible It renders solitude terrible without making society particularly delightful A dull feeling of familiarity and comfort is all we can reasonably attribute to uninterrupted trooping together Yet banishment from an accustomed society is often unbearable A creature separated from his group finds all his social instincts bereft of objects and of possible exercise the sexual if by chance the sexual be at the time active the parental with all its extensions and the combative with all its supports He is helpless and idle deprived of all resource and employment Yet when restored to his tribe he merely resumes a normal existence All particular feats and opportunities are still to seek Company is not occupation Society is like the air necessary to breathe but insufficient to live on Similar beings herding together in the same places are naturally subject to simultaneous reactions and the sense of this common reaction makes possible the conception of many minds having a common experience The elements of this experience they express to one another by signs For when spontaneous reactions occur together in many animals each knowing well his own emotion will inevitably take the perceived attitude and gesture of his fellows for its expression for his own attitude and gesture he knows nothing of and he will thus possess without further instruction the outward sign for his inner experience Sidenote It gives rise to conscience or sympathy with the public voice It is see how a moral world can grow out of these primary intuitions Knowing for instance the expression of anger a man may come to find anger directed against himself together with physical fear in the presence of attack he will feel the contagion of his enemy s passion especially if his enemy be the whole group whose reactions he is wont to share and something in him will strive to be angry together with the rest of the world He will perfectly understand that indignation against himself which in fact he instinctively shares This self condemning emotion will be his sense of shame and his conscience Words soon come to give definition to such a feeling which without expression in language would have but little stability For when a man is attracted to an act even if it be condemned by others he views it as delightful and eligible in itself but when he is forced by the conventional use of words to attach to that act an opprobrious epithet an epithet which he himself has always applied with scorn he finds himself unable to suppress the emotion connoted by the word he cannot defend his rebellious intuition against the tyranny of language he is inwardly confused and divided against himself and out of his own mouth convicted of wickedness A proof of the notable influence that language has on these emotions may be found in their transformations The connivance of a very few persons is sufficient to establish among them a new application of eulogistic terms it will suffice to suppress all qualms in the pursuance of their common impulse and to consecrate a new ideal of character It is accordingly no paradox that there should be honour among thieves kindness among harlots and probity among fanatics They have not lost their conscience they have merely introduced a flattering heresy into the conventional code to make room for the particular passion indulged in their little world Sidenote Guises of public opinion Sympathy with the general mind may also take other forms Public opinion in a vivacious and clear headed community may be felt to be the casual and irresponsible thing which in truth it is Homer for instance has no more solemn vehicle for it than the indefinite and unaccountable Greek tis So he tells us somebody or anybody said In the Greek tragedians this unauthoritative entity was replaced by the chorus an assemblage of conventional persons incapable of any original perception but possessing a fund of traditional lore a just if somewhat encumbered conscience and the gift of song This chorus was therefore much like the Christian Church and like that celestial choir of which the church wishes to be the earthly echo Like the church the tragic chorus had authority because it represented a wide if ill digested experience and it had solemnity because it spoke in archaic tropes emotional and obscure symbols of prehistoric conflicts These sacramental forms retained their power to move in spite of their little pertinence to living issues partly on account of the mystery which enshrouded their forgotten passion and partly on account of the fantastic interpretations which that pregnant obscurity allowed Sidenote Oracles and revelations Far more powerful however are those embodiments of the general conscience which religion furnishes in its first and spontaneous phase as when the Hebrew prophets dared to cry So saith the Lord Such faith in one s own inspiration is a more pliable oracle than tradition or a tragic chorus and more responsive to the needs and changes of the hour Occidental philosophers in their less simple and less eloquent manner have often repeated that arrogant Hebraic cry they have told us in their systems what God thinks about the world Such pretensions would be surprising did we not remind ourselves of the obvious truth that what men attribute to God is nothing but the ideal they value and grope for in themselves and that the commandments mythically said to come from the Most High flow in fact from common reason and local experience If history did not enable us to trace this derivation the ever present practical standard for faith would sufficiently indicate it for no one would accept as divine a revelation which he felt to be immoral or found to be pernicious And yet such a deviation into the maleficent is always possible when a code is uprooted from its rational soil and transplanted into a realm of imagination where it is subject to all sorts of arbitrary distortions If the sexual instinct should attach us as in its extensions and dislocations it sometimes does to beings incapable of satisfying it or of uniting with us in propagating the race we should of course study to correct that aberration so that our joys and desires might march in step with the possible progress of the world In the same way if the gregarious instinct should bring us into the imagined presence of companions that really did not exist or on whose attitude and company operation our successes in no way depended we should try to lead back our sense of fellowship to its natural foundations and possible sanctions Society exists so far as does analogous existence and community of ends We may in refining the social instinct find some fellowship in the clouds and in the stars for these though remote are companions of our career By poetic analogy we may include in the social world whatever helps or thwarts our development and is auxiliary to the energies of the soul even if that object be inanimate Whatever spirit in the past or future or in the remotest regions of the sky shares our love and pursuit say of mathematics or of music or of any ideal object becomes if we can somehow divine his existence a partner in our joys and sorrows and a welcome friend Sidenote The ideal a measure for all existences and no existence itself Those ideal objects however for whose sake all revolutions in space and time may be followed with interest are not themselves members of our society The ideal to which all forces should minister is itself no force or factor in its own realisation Such a possible disposition of things is a mere idea eternal and inert a form life might possibly take on and the one our endeavours if they were consistent would wish to impose on it This ideal itself however has often been expressed in some mythical figure or Utopia So to express it is simply to indulge an innocent instinct for prophecy and metaphor but unfortunately the very innocence of fancy may engage it all the more hopelessly in a tangle of bad dreams If we once identify our Utopia or other ideal with the real forces that surround us or with any one of them we have fallen into an illusion from which we shall emerge only after bitter disappointments and even when we have come out again into the open we shall long carry with us the desolating sense of wasted opportunities and vitiated characters For to have taken our purposes for our helpers is to have defeated the first and ignored the second it is to have neglected rational labour and at the same time debauched social sense The religious extensions of society should therefore be carefully watched for while sometimes as with the Hebrew prophets religion gives dramatic expression to actual social forces and helps to intensify moral feeling it often as in mystics of all creeds and ages deadens the consciousness of real ties by feigning ties which are purely imaginary This self deception is the more frequent because there float before men who live in the spirit ideals which they look to with the respect naturally rendered to whatever is true beautiful or good and the symbolic rendering of these ideals which is the rational function of religion may be confused with its superstitious or utilitarian part with exploiting occult forces to aid us in the work of life Occult forces may indeed exist and they may even be so disposed that the ideal is served by their agency but the most notable embodiment of a principle is not itself a principle being only an instance and the most exact fulfilment of a law is not a law being simply an event To discover a law may meantime be the most interesting of events and the image or formula that expresses a principle may be the most welcome of intellectual presences These symbols weighted with their wide significance may hold the mind and attract its energies into their vortex and human genius is certainly not at its worst when employed in framing a good myth or a good argument The lover of representation be he thinker or dramatist moves by preference in an ideal society His communion with the world is half a soliloquy for the personages in his dialogue are private symbols and being symbols they stand for what is not themselves the language he imputes to them is his own though it is their ways that prompt him to impute that language to them Plastic images of his own making and shifting are his sole means of envisaging eternal principles and ultimate substances things ideal and potential which can never become phenomenal in their own persons Sidenote Contrast between natural and intellectual bonds It is an inspiring thought and a true one that in proportion as a man s interests become humane and his efforts rational he appropriates and expands a common life which reappears in all individuals who reach the same impersonal level of ideas a level which his own influence may help them to maintain Patriotism envisages this ideal life in so far as it is locally coloured and grounded in certain racial aptitudes and traditions but the community recognised in patriotism is imbedded in a larger one embracing all living creatures While in some respects we find sympathy more complete the nearer home we remain in another sense there is no true companionship except with the universe Instinctive society with its compulsory affections is of course deeper and more elementary than any free or intellectual union Love is at once more animal than friendship and more divine and the same thing may be said of family affection when compared with patriotism What lies nearer the roots of our being must needs enjoy a wider prevalence and engage the soul more completely being able to touch its depths and hush its primordial murmurs On the other hand the free spirit the political and speculative genius in man chafes under those blind involutions and material bonds Natural beneficent sacred as in a sense they may be they somehow oppress the intellect and like a brooding mother half stifle what they feed Something drives the youth afield into solitude into alien friendships only in the face of nature and an indifferent world can he become himself Such a flight from home and all its pieties grows more urgent when there is some real conflict of temper or conscience between the young man and what is established in his family and this happens often because after all the most beneficent conventions are but mechanisms which must ignore the nicer sensibilities and divergences of living souls Sidenote Appeal from man to God from real to ideal society Common men accept these spiritual tyrannies weak men repine at them and great men break them down But to defy the world is a serious business and requires the greatest courage even if the defiance touch in the first place only the world s ideals Most men s conscience habits and opinions are borrowed from convention and gather continual comforting assurances from the same social consensus that originally suggested them To reverse this process to consult one s own experience and elicit one s own judgment challenging those in vogue seems too often audacious and futile but there are impetuous minds born to disregard the chances against them even to the extent of denying that they are taking chances at all For in the first instance it never occurs to the inventor that he is the source of his new insight he thinks he has merely opened his eyes and seen what by an inconceivable folly the whole world had grown blind to Wise men in antiquity he imagines saw the facts as he sees them as the gods see them now and as all sane men shall see them henceforward Thus if the innovator be a religious soul grown conscious of some new spiritual principle he will try to find support for his inspiration in some lost book of the law or in some early divine revelation corrupted as he will assert by wicked men or even in some direct voice from heaven no delusion will be too obvious no re interpretation too forced if it can help him to find external support somewhere for his spontaneous conviction To denounce one authority he needs to invoke another and if no other be found he will invent or as they say he will postulate one His courage in facing the actual world is thus supported by his ability to expand the world in imagination In separating himself from his fellow men he has made a new companion out of his ideal An impetuous spirit when betrayed by the world will cry I know that my redeemer liveth and the antiphonal response will come more wistfully after reflection It fortifies my soul to know That though I wander Truth is so Sidenote Significant symbols revert to the concrete The deceptions which nature practises on men are not always cruel These are also kindly deceptions which prompt him to pursue or expect his own good when though not destined to come in the form he looks for this good is really destined to come in some shape or other Such for instance are the illusions of romantic love which may really terminate in a family life practically better than the absolute and chimerical unions which that love had dreamed of Such again are those illusions of conscience which attach unspeakable vague penalties and repugnances to acts which commonly have bad results though these are impossible to forecast with precision When disillusion comes while it may bring a momentary shock it ends by producing a settled satisfaction unknown before a satisfaction which the coveted prize could it have been attained would hardly have secured When on the day of judgment or earlier a man perceives that what he thought he was doing for the Lord s sake he was really doing for the benefit of the least perhaps of the Lord s creatures his satisfaction after a moment s surprise will certainly be very genuine Sidenote Nature a symbol for destiny Such kindly illusions are involved in the symbolic method by which general relations and the inconceivably diffuse reality of things have to be apprehended The stars are in human thought a symbol for the silent forces of destiny really embodied in forms beyond our apprehension for who shall say what actual being may or may not correspond to that potentiality of life or sensation which is all that the external world can be to our science When astrology invented the horoscope it made an absurdly premature translation of celestial hieroglyphics into that language of universal destiny which in the end they may be made to speak The perfect astronomer when he understood at last exactly what pragmatic value the universe has and what fortunes the stars actually forebode would be pleasantly surprised to discover that he was nothing but an astrologer grown competent and honest Sidenote Representative notions have also inherent values Ideal society belongs entirely to this realm of kindly illusion for it is the society of symbols Whenever religion art or science presents us with an image or a formula involving no matter how momentous a truth there is something delusive in the representation It needs translation into the detailed experience which it sums up in our own past or prophecies elsewhere This eventual change in form far from nullifying our knowledge can alone legitimise it A conception not reducible to the small change of daily experience is like a currency not exchangeable for articles of consumption it is not a symbol but a fraud And yet there is another aspect to the matter Symbols are presences and they are those particularly congenial presences which we have inwardly evoked and cast in a form intelligible and familiar to human thinking Their function is to give flat experience a rational perspective translating the general flux into stable objects and making it representable in human discourse They are therefore precious not only for their representative or practical value implying useful adjustments to the environing world but even more sometimes for their immediate or aesthetic power for their kinship to the spirit they enlighten and exercise This is prevailingly true in the fine arts which seem to express man even more than they express nature although in art also the symbol would lose all its significance and much of its inward articulation if natural objects and eventual experience could be disregarded in constructing it In music indeed this ulterior significance is reduced to a minimum yet it persists since music brings an ideal object before the mind which needs to some extent translation into terms no longer musical terms for instance of skill dramatic passion or moral sentiment But in music pre eminently and very largely in all the arts external propriety is adventitious so much can the mere presence and weight of a symbol fill the mind and constitute an absolute possession Sidenote Religion and science indirectly cognitive and directly ideal In religion and science the overt purpose of symbols is to represent external truths The inventors of these symbols think they are merely uncovering a self existent reality having in itself the very form seen in their idea They do not perceive that the society of God or Nature is an ideal society nor that these phantoms looming in their imagination are but significant figments whose existent basis is a minute and indefinite series of ordinary perceptions They consequently attribute whatever value their genial syntheses may have to the object as they picture it The gods have they fancy the aspect and passions the history and influence which their myth unfolds nature in its turn contains hypostatically just those laws and forces which are described by theory Consequently the presence of God or Nature seems to the mythologist not an ideal but a real and mutual society as if collateral beings endowed with the conceived characters actually existed as men exist But this opinion is untenable As Hobbes said in a phrase which ought to be inscribed in golden letters over the head of every talking philosopher No discourse whatsoever can end in absolute knowledge of fact Absolute knowledge of fact is immediate it is experiential We should have to become God or Nature in order to know for a fact that they existed Intellectual knowledge on the other hand where it relates to existence is faith only a faith which in these matters means trust For the forces of Nature or the gods if they had crude existence so that we might conceivably become what they are would lose that causal and that religious function which are their essence respectively They would be merely collateral existences loaded with all sorts of irrelevant properties parts of the universal flux members of a natural society and while as such they would have their relative importance they would be embraced in turn within an intelligible system of relations while their rights and dignities would need to be determined by some supervening ideal A nature existing in act would require metaphysics the account of a deeper nature to express its relation to the mind that knew and judged it Any actual god would need to possess a religion of his own in order to fix his ideal of conduct and his rights in respect to his creatures or rather as we should then be to his neighbours This situation may have no terrors for the thoughtless but it evidently introduces something deeper than Nature and something higher than God depriving these words of the best sense in which a philosopher might care to use them Sidenote Their opposite outlook The divine and the material are contrasted points of reference required by the actual Reason working on the immediate flux of appearances reaches these ideal realms and resting in them perforce calls them realities One the realm of causes supplies appearances with a basis and calculable order the other the realm of truth and felicity supplies them with a standard and justification Natural society may accordingly be contrasted with ideal society not because Nature is not logically speaking ideal too but because in natural society we ally ourselves consciously with our origins and surroundings in ideal society with our purposes There is an immense difference in spirituality in ideality of the moral sort between gathering or conciliating forces for action and fixing the ends which action should pursue Both fields are ideal in the sense that intelligence alone could discover or exploit them yet to call nature ideal is undoubtedly equivocal since its ideal function is precisely to be the substance and cause of the given flux a ground work for experience which while merely inferred and potential is none the less mechanical and material The ideality of nature is indeed of such a sort as to be forfeited if the trusty instrument and true antecedent of human life were not found there We should be frivolous and inconstant taking our philosophy for a game and not for method in living if having set out to look for the causes and practical order of things and having found them we should declare that they were not really casual or efficient on the strange ground that our discovery of them had been a feat of intelligence and had proved a priceless boon The absurdity could not be greater if in moral science after the goal of all effort had been determined and happiness defined we declared that this was not really the good Those who are shocked at the assertion that God and Nature are ideal and that their contrasted prerogatives depend on that fact may of course use the same words in a different way making them synonymous and may readily prove that God or Nature exists materially and has absolute being We need but agree to designate by those terms the sum of existences whatever they or it may be to their own feeling Then the ontological proof asserts its rights unmistakably Science and religion however are superfluous if what we wish to learn is that there is Something and that All there is must assuredly be All there is Ecstasies may doubtless ensue upon considering that Being is and Non Being is not as they are said to ensue upon long enough considering one s navel but the Life of Reason is made of more variegated stuff Science when it is not dialectical describes an ideal order of existences in space and time such that all incidental facts as they come may fill it in and lend it body Religion when pure contemplates some pertinent ideal of intelligence and goodness Both religion and science live in imaginative discourse one being an aspiration and the other a hypothesis Both introduce into the mind an ideal society The Life of Reason is no fair reproduction of the universe but the expression of man alone A theory of nature is nothing but a mass of observations made with a hunter s and an artist s eye A mortal has no time for sympathy with his victim or his model and beyond a certain range he has no capacity for such sympathy As in order to live he must devour one half the world and disregard the other so in order to think and practically to know he must deal summarily and selfishly with his materials otherwise his intellect would melt again into endless and irrevocable dreams The law of gravity because it so notably unifies the motions of matter is something which these motions themselves know nothing of it is a description of them in terms of human discourse Such discourse can never assure us absolutely that the motions it forecasts will occur the sensible proof must ensue spontaneously in its own good time In the interval our theory remains pure presumption and hypothesis Reliable as it may be in that capacity it is no replica of anything on its own level existing beyond It creates like all intelligence a secondary and merely symbolic world Sidenote In translating existence into human terms they give human nature its highest exercise When this diversity between the truest theory and the simplest fact between potential generalities and actual particulars has been thoroughly appreciated it becomes clear that much of what is valued in science and religion is not lodged in the miscellany underlying these creations of reason but is lodged rather in the rational activity itself and in the intrinsic beauty of all symbols bred in a genial mind Of course if these symbols had no real points of reference if they were symbols of nothing they could have no great claim to consideration and no rational character at most they would be agreeable sensations They are however at their best good symbols for a diffused experience having a certain order and tendency they render that reality with a difference reducing it to a formula or a myth in which its tortuous length and trivial detail can be surveyed to advantage without undue waste or fatigue Symbols may thus become eloquent vivid important being endowed with both poetic grandeur and practical truth The facts from which this truth is borrowed if they were rehearsed unimaginatively in their own flat infinity would be far from arousing the same emotions The human eye sees in perspective its glory would vanish were it reduced to a crawling exploring antenna Not that it loves to falsify anything That to the worm the landscape might possess no light and shade that the mountain s atomic structure should be unpicturable cannot distress the landscape gardener nor the poet what concerns them is the effect such things may produce in the human fancy so that the soul may live in a congenial world Naturalist and prophet are landscape painters on canvases of their own each is interested in his own perception and perspective which if he takes the trouble to reflect need not deceive him about what the world would be if not foreshortened in that particular manner This special interpretation is nevertheless precious and shows up the world in that light in which it interests naturalists or prophets to see it Their figments make their chosen world as the painter s apperceptions are the breath of his nostrils Sidenote Science should be mathematical and religion anthropomorphic While the symbol s applicability is essential to its worth since otherwise science would be useless and religion demoralising its power and fascination lie in its acquiring a more and more profound affinity to the human mind so long as it can do so without surrendering its relevance to practice Thus natural science is at its best when it is most thoroughly mathematical since what can be expressed mathematically can speak a human language In such science only the ultimate material elements remain surds all their further movement and complication can be represented in that kind of thought which is most intimately satisfactory and perspicuous And in like manner religion is at its best when it is most anthropomorphic indeed the two most spiritual religions Buddhism and Christianity have actually raised a man overflowing with utterly human tenderness and pathos to the place usually occupied only by cosmic and thundering deities The human heart is lifted above misfortune and encouraged to pursue unswervingly its inmost ideal when no compromise is any longer attempted with what is not moral or human and Prometheus is honestly proclaimed to be holier than Zeus At that moment religion ceases to be superstitious and becomes a rational discipline an effort to perfect the spirit rather than to intimidate it Sidenote Summary of this book We have seen that society has three stages the natural the free and the ideal In the natural stage its function is to produce the individual and equip him with the prerequisites of moral freedom When this end is attained society can rise to friendship to unanimity and disinterested sympathy where the ground of association is some ideal interest while this association constitutes at the same time a personal and emotional bond Ideal society on the contrary transcends accidental conjunctions altogether Here the ideal interests themselves take possession of the mind its companions are the symbols it breeds and possesses for excellence beauty and truth Religion art and science are the chief spheres in which ideal companionship is found It remains for us to traverse these provinces in turn and see to what extent the Life of Reason may flourish there End of Volume Two REASON

The Life of Reason or The Phases of Human Progress originally published by Charles Scribner s Sons N Y in nineteen oh five CONTENTS REASON IN RELIGION CHAPTER I HOW RELIGION MAY BE AN EMBODIMENT OF REASON Religion is certainly significant but not literally true All religion is positive and particular It aims at the Life of Reason but largely fails to attain it Its approach imaginative When its poetic method is denied its value is jeopardised It precedes science rather than hinders it It is merely symbolic and thoroughly human Pages three fourteen CHAPTER II RATIONAL ELEMENTS IN SUPERSTITION Felt causes not necessary causes Mechanism and dialectic ulterior principles Early selection of categories Tentative rational worlds Superstition a rudimentary philosophy A miracle though unexpected more intelligible than a regular process Superstitions come of haste to understand Inattention suffers them to spread Genius may use them to convey an inarticulate wisdom Pages fifteen twenty seven CHAPTER III MAGIC SACRIFICE AND PRAYER Fear created the gods Need also contributed The real evidences of God s existence Practice precedes theory in religion Pathetic tentative nature of religious practices Meanness and envy in the gods suggesting sacrifice Ritualistic arts Thank offerings The sacrifice of a contrite heart Prayer is not utilitarian in essence Its supposed efficacy magical Theological puzzles A real efficacy would be mechanical True uses of prayer It clarifies the ideal It reconciles to the inevitable It fosters spiritual life by conceiving it in its perfection Discipline and contemplation are their own reward Pages twenty eight forty eight CHAPTER IV MYTHOLOGY Status of fable in the mind It requires genius It only half deceives Its interpretative essence Contrast with science Importance of the moral factor Its submergence Myth justifies magic Myths might be metaphysical They appear ready made like parts of the social fabric They perplex the conscience Incipient myth in the Vedas Natural suggestions soon exhausted They will be carried out in abstract fancy They may become moral ideals The Sun god moralised The leaven of religion is moral idealism Pages forty nine sixty eight CHAPTER V THE HEBRAIC TRADITION Phases of Hebraism Israel s tribal monotheism Problems involved The prophets put new wine in old bottles Inspiration and authority Beginnings of the Church Bigotry turned into a principle Penance accepted Christianity combines optimism and asceticism Reason smothered between the two Religion made an institution Pages sixty nine eighty two CHAPTER VI THE CHRISTIAN EPIC The essence of the good not adventitious but expressive A universal religion must interpret the whole world Double appeal of Christianity Hebrew metaphors become Greek myths Hebrew philosophy of history identified with Platonic cosmology The resulting orthodox system The brief drama of things Mythology is a language and must be understood to convey something by symbols Pages eighty three ninety eight CHAPTER VII PAGAN CUSTOM AND BARBARIAN GENIUS INFUSED INTO CHRISTIANITY Need of paganising Christianity Catholic piety more human than the liturgy Natural pieties Refuge taken in the supernatural The episodes of life consecrated mystically Paganism chastened Hebraism liberalised The system post rational and founded on despair External conversion of the barbarians Expression of the northern genius within Catholicism Internal discrepancies between the two Tradition and instinct at odds in Protestantism The Protestant spirit remote from that of the gospel Obstacles to humanism The Reformation and counter reformation Protestantism an expression of character It has the spirit of life and of courage but the voice of inexperience Its emancipation from Christianity Pages ninety nine one hundred twenty six CHAPTER VIII CONFLICT OF MYTHOLOGY WITH MORAL TRUTH Myth should dissolve with the advance of science But myth is confused with the moral values it expresses Neo Platonic revision It made mythical entities of abstractions Hypostasis ruins ideals The Stoic revision The ideal surrendered before the physical Parallel movements in Christianity Hebraism if philosophical must be pantheistic Pantheism even when psychic ignores ideals Truly divine action limited to what makes for the good Need of an opposing principle The standard of value is human Hope for happiness makes belief in God Pages one hundred twenty seven one hundred forty seven CHAPTER IX THE CHRISTIAN COMPROMISE Suspense between hope and disillusion Superficial solution But from what shall we be redeemed Typical attitude of saint Augustine He achieves Platonism He identifies it with Christianity God the good Primary and secondary religion Ambiguous efficacy of the good in Plato Ambiguous goodness of the creator in Job The Manicheans All things good by nature The doctrine of creation demands that of the fall Original sin Forced abandonment of the ideal The problem among the Protestants Pantheism accepted Plainer scorn for the ideal The price of mythology is superstition Pages one hundred forty eight one hundred seventy seven CHAPTER X PIETY The core of religion not theoretical Loyalty to the sources of our being The pious AEneas An ideal background required Piety accepts natural conditions and present tasks The leadership of instinct is normal Embodiment essential to spirit Piety to the gods takes form from current ideals The religion of humanity Cosmic piety Pages one hundred seventy eight one hundred ninety two CHAPTER XI SPIRITUALITY AND ITS CORRUPTIONS To be spiritual is to live in view of the ideal Spirituality natural Primitive consciousness may be spiritual Spirit crossed by instrumentalities One foe of the spirit is worldliness The case for and against pleasure Upshot of worldly wisdom Two supposed escapes from vanity fanaticism and mysticism Both are irrational Is there a third course Yes for experience has intrinsic inalienable values For these the religious imagination must supply an ideal standard Pages one hundred ninety three two hundred thirteen CHAPTER XII CHARITY Possible tyranny of reason Everything has its rights Primary and secondary morality Uncharitable pagan justice is not just The doom of ancient republics Rational charity Its limits Its mythical supports There is intelligence in charity Buddhist and Christian forms of it Apparent division of the spiritual and the natural Pages two hundred fourteen two hundred twenty eight CHAPTER XIII THE BELIEF IN A FUTURE LIFE The length of life a subject for natural science Psychical phenomena Hypertrophies of sense These possibilities affect physical existence only Moral grounds for the doctrine The necessary assumption of a future An assumption no evidence A solipsistic argument Absoluteness and immortality transferred to the gods Or to a divine principle in all beings In neither case is the individual immortal Possible forms of survival Arguments from retribution and need of opportunity Ignoble temper of both False optimistic postulate involved Transition to ideality Pages two hundred twenty nine two hundred fifty CHAPTER XIV IDEAL IMMORTALITY Olympian immortality the first ideal Its indirect attainment by reproduction Moral acceptance of this compromise Even vicarious immortality intrinsically impossible Intellectual victory over change The glory of it Reason makes man s divinity and his immortality It is the locus of all truths Epicurean immortality through the truth of existence Logical immortality through objects of thought Ethical immortality through types of excellence Pages two hundred fifty one two hundred seventy three CHAPTER XV CONCLUSION The failure of magic and of mythology Their imaginative value Piety and spirituality justified Mysticism a primordial state of feeling It may recur at any stage of culture Form gives substance its life and value Pages two hundred seventy four two hundred seventy nine REASON IN RELIGION CHAPTER I HOW RELIGION MAY BE AN EMBODIMENT OF REASON Sidenote Religion certainly significant Experience has repeatedly confirmed that well known maxim of Bacon s that a little philosophy inclineth man s mind to atheism but depth in philosophy bringeth men s minds about to religion In every age the most comprehensive thinkers have found in the religion of their time and country something they could accept interpreting and illustrating that religion so as to give it depth and universal application Even the heretics and atheists if they have had profundity turn out after a while to be forerunners of some new orthodoxy What they rebel against is a religion alien to their nature they are atheists only by accident and relatively to a convention which inwardly offends them but they yearn mightily in their own souls after the religious acceptance of a world interpreted in their own fashion So it appears in the end that their atheism and loud protestation were in fact the hastier part of their thought since what emboldened them to deny the poor world s faith was that they were too impatient to understand it Indeed the enlightenment common to young wits and worm eaten old satirists who plume themselves on detecting the scientific ineptitude of religion something which the blindest half see is not nearly enlightened enough it points to notorious facts incompatible with religious tenets literally taken but it leaves unexplored the habits of thought from which those tenets sprang their original meaning and their true function Such studies would bring the sceptic face to face with the mystery and pathos of mortal existence They would make him understand why religion is so profoundly moving and in a sense so profoundly just There must needs be something humane and necessary in an influence that has become the most general sanction of virtue the chief occasion for art and philosophy and the source perhaps of the best human happiness If nothing as Hooker said is so malapert as a splenetic religion a sour irreligion is almost as perverse Sidenote But not literally true At the same time when Bacon penned the sage epigram we have quoted he forgot to add that the God to whom depth in philosophy brings back men s minds is far from being the same from whom a little philosophy estranges them It would be pitiful indeed if mature reflection bred no better conceptions than those which have drifted down the muddy stream of time where tradition and passion have jumbled everything together Traditional conceptions when they are felicitous may be adopted by the poet but they must be purified by the moralist and disintegrated by the philosopher Each religion so dear to those whose life it sanctifies and fulfilling so necessary a function in the society that has adopted it necessarily contradicts every other religion and probably contradicts itself What religion a man shall have is a historical accident quite as much as what language he shall speak In the rare circumstances where a choice is possible he may with some difficulty make an exchange but even then he is only adopting a new convention which may be more agreeable to his personal temper but which is essentially as arbitrary as the old Sidenote All religion is positive and particular The attempt to speak without speaking any particular language is not more hopeless than the attempt to have a religion that shall be no religion in particular A courier s or a dragoman s speech may indeed be often unusual and drawn from disparate sources not without some mixture of personal originality but that private jargon will have a meaning only because of its analogy to one or more conventional languages and its obvious derivation from them So travellers from one religion to another people who have lost their spiritual nationality may often retain a neutral and confused residuum of belief which they may egregiously regard as the essence of all religion so little may they remember the graciousness and naturalness of that ancestral accent which a perfect religion should have Yet a moment s probing of the conceptions surviving in such minds will show them to be nothing but vestiges of old beliefs creases which thought even if emptied of all dogmatic tenets has not been able to smooth away at its first unfolding Later generations if they have any religion at all will be found either to revert to ancient authority or to attach themselves spontaneously to something wholly novel and immensely positive to some faith promulgated by a fresh genius and passionately embraced by a converted people Thus every living and healthy religion has a marked idiosyncrasy Its power consists in its special and surprising message and in the bias which that revelation gives to life The vistas it opens and the mysteries propounds are another world to live in and another world to live in whether we expect ever to pass wholly into it or no is what we mean by having a religion Sidenote It aims at the Life of Reason What relation then does this great business of the soul which we call religion bear to the Life of Reason That the relation between the two is close seems clear from several circumstances The Life of Reason is the seat of all ultimate values Now the history of mankind will show us that whenever spirits at once lofty and intense have seemed to attain the highest joys they have envisaged and attained them in religion Religion would therefore seem to be a vehicle or a factor in rational life since the ends of rational life are attained by it Moreover the Life of Reason is an ideal to which everything in the world should be subordinated it establishes lines of moral cleavage everywhere and makes right eternally different from wrong Religion does the same thing It makes absolute moral decisions It sanctions unifies and transforms ethics Religion thus exercises a function of the Life of Reason And a further function which is common to both is that of emancipating man from his personal limitations In different ways religions promise to transfer the soul to better conditions A supernaturally favoured kingdom is to be established for posterity upon earth or for all the faithful in heaven or the soul is to be freed by repeated purgations from all taint and sorrow or it is to be lost in the absolute or it is to become an influence and an object of adoration in the places it once haunted or wherever the activities it once loved may be carried on by future generations of its kindred Now reason in its way lays before us all these possibilities it points to common objects political and intellectual in which an individual may lose what is mortal and accidental in himself and immortalise what is rational and human it teaches us how sweet and fortunate death may be to those whose spirit can still live in their country and in their ideas it reveals the radiating effects of action and the eternal objects of thought Yet the difference in tone and language must strike us so soon as it is philosophy that speaks That change should remind us that even if the function of religion and that of reason coincide this function is performed in the two cases by very different organs Religions are many reason one Religion consists of conscious ideas hopes enthusiasms and objects of worship it operates by grace and flourished by prayer Reason on the other hand is a mere principle or potential order on which indeed we may come to reflect but which exists in us ideally only without variation or stress of any kind We conform or do not conform to it it does not urge or chide us nor call for any emotions on our part other than those naturally aroused by the various objects which it unfolds in their true nature and proportion Religion brings some order into life by weighting it with new materials Reason adds to the natural materials only the perfect order which it introduces into them Rationality is nothing but a form an ideal constitution which experience may more or less embody Religion is a part of experience itself a mass of sentiments and ideas The one is an inviolate principle the other a changing and struggling force And yet this struggling and changing force of religion seems to direct man toward something eternal It seems to make for an ultimate harmony within the soul and for an ultimate harmony between the soul and all the soul depends upon So that religion in its intent is a more conscious and direct pursuit of the Life of Reason than is society science or art For these approach and fill out the ideal life tentatively and piecemeal hardly regarding the goal or caring for the ultimate justification of their instinctive aims Religion also has an instinctive and blind side and bubbles up in all manner of chance practices and intuitions soon however it feels its way toward the heart of things and from whatever quarter it may come veers in the direction of the ultimate Sidenote But largely fails to attain it Nevertheless we must confess that this religious pursuit of the Life of Reason has been singularly abortive Those within the pale of each religion may prevail upon themselves to express satisfaction with its results thanks to a fond partiality in reading the past and generous draughts of hope for the future but any one regarding the various religions at once and comparing their achievements with what reason requires must feel how terrible is the disappointment which they have one and all prepared for mankind Their chief anxiety has been to offer imaginary remedies for mortal ills some of which are incurable essentially while others might have been really cured by well directed effort The Greek oracles for instance pretended to heal our natural ignorance which has its appropriate though difficult cure while the Christian vision of heaven pretended to be an antidote to our natural death the inevitable correlate of birth and of a changing and conditioned existence By methods of this sort little can be done for the real betterment of life To confuse intelligence and dislocate sentiment by gratuitous fictions is a short sighted way of pursuing happiness Nature is soon avenged An unhealthy exaltation and a one sided morality have to be followed by regrettable reactions When these come the real rewards of life may seem vain to a relaxed vitality and the very name of virtue may irritate young spirits untrained in any natural excellence Thus religion too often debauches the morality it comes to sanction and impedes the science it ought to fulfil Sidenote Its approach imaginative What is the secret of this ineptitude Why does religion so near to rationality in its purpose fall so far short of it in its texture and in its results The answer is easy Religion pursues rationality through the imagination When it explains events or assigns causes it gives imaginative substitute for science When it gives precepts insinuates ideals or remoulds aspiration it is an imaginative substitute for wisdom I mean for the deliberate and impartial pursuit of all good The conditions and the aims of life are both represented in religion poetically but this poetry tends to arrogate to itself literal truth and moral authority neither of which it possesses Hence the depth and importance of religion become intelligible no less than its contradictions and practical disasters Its object is the same as that of reason but its method is to proceed by intuition and by unchecked poetical conceits These are repeated and vulgarised in proportion to their original fineness and significance till they pass for reports of objective truth and come to constitute a world of faith superposed upon the world of experience and regarded as materially enveloping it if not in space at least in time and in existence The only truth of religion comes from its interpretation of life from its symbolic rendering of that moral experience which it springs out of and which it seeks to elucidate Its falsehood comes from the insidious misunderstanding which clings to it to the effect that these poetic conceptions are not merely representations of experience as it is or should be but are rather information about experience or reality elsewhere an experience and reality which strangely enough supply just the defects betrayed by reality and experience here Sidenote When its poetic method is denied its value is jeopardised Thus religion has the same original relation to life that poetry has only poetry which never pretends to literal validity adds a pure value to existence the value of a liberal imaginative exercise The poetic value of religion would initially be greater than that of poetry itself because religion deals with higher and more practical themes with sides of life which are in greater need of some imaginative touch and ideal interpretation than are those pleasant or pompous things which ordinary poetry dwells upon But this initial advantage is neutralised in part by the abuse to which religion is subject whenever its symbolic rightness is taken for scientific truth Like poetry it improves the world only by imagining it improved but not content with making this addition to the mind s furniture an addition which might be useful and ennobling it thinks to confer a more radical benefit by persuading mankind that in spite of appearances the world is really such as that rather arbitrary idealisation has painted it This spurious satisfaction is naturally the prelude to many a disappointment and the soul has infinite trouble to emerge again from the artificial problems and sentiments into which it is thus plunged The value of religion becomes equivocal Religion remains an imaginative achievement a symbolic representation of moral reality which may have a most important function in vitalising the mind and in transmitting by way of parables the lessons of experience But it becomes at the same time a continuous incidental deception and this deception in proportion as it is strenuously denied to be such can work indefinite harm in the world and in the conscience Sidenote It precedes science rather than hinders it On the whole however religion should not be conceived as having taken the place of anything better but rather as having come to relieve situations which but for its presence would have been infinitely worse In the thick of active life or in the monotony of practical slavery there is more need to stimulate fancy than to control it Natural instinct is not much disturbed in the human brain by what may happen in that thin superstratum of ideas which commonly overlays it We must not blame religion for preventing the development of a moral and natural science which at any rate would seldom have appeared we must rather thank it for the sensibility the reverence the speculative insight which it has introduced into the world Sidenote It is merely symbolic and thoroughly human We may therefore proceed to analyse the significance and the function which religion has had at its different stages and without disguising or in the least condoning its confusion with literal truth we may allow ourselves to enter as sympathetically as possible into its various conceptions and emotions They have made up the inner life of many sages and of all those who without great genius or learning have lived steadfastly in the spirit The feeling of reverence should itself be treated with reverence although not at a sacrifice of truth with which alone in the end reverence is compatible Nor have we any reason to be intolerant of the partialities and contradictions which religions display Were we dealing with a science such contradictions would have to be instantly solved and removed but when we are concerned with the poetic interpretation of experience contradiction means only variety and variety means spontaneity wealth of resource and a nearer approach to total adequacy If we hope to gain any understanding of these matters we must begin by taking them out of that heated and fanatical atmosphere in which the Hebrew tradition has enveloped them The Jews had no philosophy and when their national traditions came to be theoretically explicated and justified they were made to issue in a puerile scholasticism and a rabid intolerance The question of monotheism for instance was a terrible question to the Jews Idolatry did not consist in worshipping a god who not being ideal might be unworthy of worship but rather in recognising other gods than the one worshipped in Jerusalem To the Greeks on the contrary whose philosophy was enlightened and ingenuous monotheism and polytheism seemed perfectly innocent and compatible To say God or the gods was only to use different expressions for the same influence now viewed in its abstract unity and correlation with all existence now viewed in its various manifestations in moral life in nature or in history So that what in Plato Aristotle and the Stoics meets us at every step the combination of monotheism with polytheism is no contradiction but merely an intelligent variation of phrase to indicate various aspects or functions in physical and moral things When religion appears to us in this light its contradictions and controversies lose all their bitterness Each doctrine will simply represent the moral plane on which they live who have devised or adopted it Religions will thus be better or worse never true or false We shall be able to lend ourselves to each in turn and seek to draw from it the secret of its inspiration CHAPTER II RATIONAL ELEMENTS IN SUPERSTITION We need not impose upon ourselves the endless and repulsive task of describing all the superstitions that have existed in the world In his impotence and laziness the natural man unites any notion with any other in a loose causal relation A single instance of juxtaposition nay the mere notion and dream of such a combination will suffice to arouse fear or to prompt experimental action Sidenote Felt causes not necessary causes When philosophers have objected to Hume s account of causation that he gave no sufficient basis for the necessary influence of cause on effect they have indulged in a highly artificial supposition They have assumed that people actually regard causes as necessary They suppose that before we can feel the interdependence of two things in experience we must have an unshakable conviction that their connection is necessary and universal But causation in such an absolute sense is no category of practical thinking It appears if at all only in dialectic in ideal applications of given laws to cases artificially simplified where the terms are so defined that their operation upon one another is involved in the notion of them So if we say that an unsupported weight must fall to the ground we have included in the word weight the notion of a downward strain The proposition is really trifling and identical It merely announces that things which tend to fall to the ground tend to fall to the ground and that heavy things are heavy So when we have called a thing a cause we have defined it as that which involves an effect and if the effect did not follow the title of cause would no longer belong to the antecedent But the necessity of this sequence is merely verbal We have never in the presence of the antecedent the assurance that the title of cause will accrue to it Our expectation is empirical and we feel and assert nothing in respect to the necessity of the expected sequence Sidenote Mechanism and dialectic ulterior principles A cause in real life means a justifying circumstance We are absolutely without insight into the machinery of causation notably in the commonest cases like that of generation nutrition or the operation of mind on matter But we are familiar with the more notable superficial conditions in each case and the appearance in part of any usual phenomenon makes us look for the rest of it We do not ordinarily expect virgins to bear children nor prophets to be fed by ravens nor prayers to remove mountains but we may believe any of these things at the merest suggestion of fancy or report without any warrant from experience so loose is the bond and so external the relation between the terms most constantly associated A quite unprecedented occurrence will seem natural and intelligible enough if it falls in happily with the current of our thoughts Interesting and significant events however are so rare and so dependent on mechanical conditions irrelevant to their value that we come at last to wonder at their self justified appearance apart from that cumbrous natural machinery and to call them marvels miracles and things to gape at We come to adopt scientific hypotheses at least in certain provinces of our thought and we lose our primitive openness and simplicity of mind Then with an unjustified haste we assert that miracles are impossible i e that nothing interesting and fundamentally natural can happen unless all the usual though adventitious mise en scene has been prepared behind the curtain The philosopher may eventually discover that such machinery is really needed and that even the actors themselves have a mechanism within them so that not only their smiles and magnificent gestures but their heated fancy itself and their conception of their roles are but outer effects and dramatic illusions produced by the natural stage carpentry in their brains Yet such eventual scientific conclusions have nothing to do with the tentative first notions of men when they begin to experiment in the art of living As the seeds of lower animals have to be innumerable so that in a chance environment a few may grow to maturity so the seeds of rational thinking the first categories of reflection have to be multitudinous in order that some lucky principle of synthesis may somewhere come to light and find successful application Science which thinks to make belief in miracles impossible is itself belief in miracles in the miracles best authenticated by history and by daily life Sidenote Early selection of categories When men begin to understand things when they begin to reflect and to plan they divide the world into the hateful and the delightful the avoidable and the attainable And in feeling their way toward what attracts them or in escaping what they fear they at first follow passively the lead of instinct they watch themselves live or rather sink without reserve into their living their reactions are as little foreseen and as naturally accepted as their surroundings Their ideas are incidents in their perpetual oscillation between apathy and passion The stream of animal life leaves behind a little sediment of knowledge the sand of that auriferous river a few grains of experience remain to mark the path traversed by the flood These residual ideas and premonitions these first categories of thought are of any and every sort All the contents of the mind and all the threads of relation that weave its elements together are alike fitted for all we can then see to give the clue to the labyrinth in which we find ourselves wandering There is prima facie no ground for not trying to apply to experience such categories for instance as that of personal omnipotence as if everything were necessarily arranged as we may command or require On this principle children often seem to conceive a world in which they are astonished not to find themselves living Or we may try aesthetic categories and allow our reproductive imagination by which memory is fed to bring under the unity of apperception only what can fall within it harmoniously completely and delightfully Such an understanding impervious to anything but the beautiful might be a fine thing in itself but would not chronicle the fortunes of that organism to which it was attached It would yield an experience doubtless a highly interesting and elaborate experience but one which could never serve as an index to successful action It would totally fail to represent its conditions and consequently would imply nothing about its continued existence It would be an experience irrelevant to conduct no part therefore of a Life of Reason but a kind of lovely vapid music or parasitic dream Now such dreams are in fact among the first and most absorbing formations in the human mind If we could penetrate into animal consciousness we should not improbably find that what there accompanies instinctive motions is a wholly irrelevant fancy whose flaring up and subsidence no doubt coincide with the presence of objects interesting to the organism and causing marked reactions within it yet this fancy may in no way represent the nature of surrounding objects nor the eventual results for the animal s consciousness of its own present experience Sidenote Tentative rational worlds The unlimited number of possible categories their arbitrariness and spontaneity may however have this inconvenience that the categories may be irrelevant to one another no less than to the natural life they ought to express The experience they respectively synthesise may therefore be no single experience One pictured world may succeed another in the sphere of sensibility while the body whose sensibility they compose moves in a single and constant physical cosmos Each little mental universe may be intermittent or if any part of it endures while a new group of ideas comes upon the stage there may arise contradictions discords and a sense of lurking absurdity which will tend to disrupt thought logically at the same time that the processes of nutrition and the oncoming of new dreams tend to supplant it mechanically Such drifting categories have no mutual authority They replace but do not dominate one another and the general conditions of life by conceiving which life itself might be surveyed remain entirely unrepresented What we mean indeed by the natural world in which the conditions of consciousness are found and in reference to which mind and its purposes can attain practical efficacy is simply the world constructed by categories found to yield a constant sufficient and consistent object Having attained this conception we justly call it the truth and measure the intellectual value of all other constructions by their affinity to that rational vision Such a rational vision has not yet been attained by mankind but it would be absurd to say that because we have not fully nor even proximately attained it we have not gained any conception whatever of a reliable and intelligible world The modicum of rationality achieved in the sciences gives us a hint of a perfect rationality which if unattainable in practice is not inconceivable in idea So in still more inchoate moments of reflection our ancestors nursed even more isolated less compatible less adequate conceptions than those which leave our philosophers still unsatisfied The categories they employed dominated smaller regions of experience than do the categories of history and natural science they had far less applicability to the conduct of affairs and to the happy direction of life as a whole Yet they did yield vision and flashes of insight They lighted men a step ahead in the dark places of their careers and gave them at certain junctures a sense of creative power and moral freedom So that the necessity of abandoning one category in order to use a better need not induce us to deny that the worse category could draw the outlines of a sort of world and furnish men with an approach to wisdom If our ancestors by such means could not dominate life as a whole neither can we in spite of all progress If literal truth or final applicability cannot be claimed for their thought who knows how many and how profound the revolutions might be which our own thought would have to suffer if new fields of perception or new powers of synthesis were added to our endowment Sidenote Superstition a rudimentary philosophy Sidenote A miracle though unexpected more intelligible than a regular process We sometimes speak as if superstition or belief in the miraculous was disbelief in law and was inspired by a desire to disorganise experience and defeat intelligence No supposition could be more erroneous Every superstition is a little science inspired by the desire to understand to foresee or to control the real world No doubt its hypothesis is chimerical arbitrary and founded on a confusion of efficient causes with ideal results But the same is true of many a renowned philosophy To appeal to what we call the supernatural is really to rest in the imaginatively obvious in what we ought to call the natural if natural meant easy to conceive and originally plausible Moral and individual forces are more easily intelligible than mechanical universal laws The former domesticate events in the mind more readily and more completely than the latter A miracle is so far from being a contradiction to the causal principle which the mind actually applies in its spontaneous observations that it is primarily a better illustration of that principle than an event happening in the ordinary course of nature For the ground of the miracle is immediately intelligible we see the mercy or the desire to vindicate authority or the intention of some other sort that inspired it A mechanical law on the contrary is only a record of the customary but reasonless order of things A merely inexplicable event manifesting no significant purpose would be no miracle What surprises us in the miracle is that contrary to what is usually the case we can see a real and just ground for it Thus if the water of Lourdes bottled and sold by chemists cured all diseases there would be no miracle but only a new scientific discovery In such a case we should no more know why we were cured than we now know why we were created But if each believer in taking the water thinks the effect morally conditioned if he interprets the result should it be favourable as an answer to his faith and prayers then the cure becomes miraculous because it becomes intelligible and manifests the obedience of nature to the exigencies of spirit Were there no known ground for such a scientific anomaly were it a meaningless irregularity in events we should not call it a miracle but an accident and it would have no relation to religion Sidenote Superstitions come of haste to understand What establishes superstitions is haste to understand rash confidence in the moral intelligibility of things It turns out in the end as we have laboriously discovered that understanding has to be circuitous and cannot fulfil its function until it applies mechanical categories to existence A thorough philosophy will become aware that moral intelligibility can only be an incidental ornament and partial harmony in the world For moral significance is relative to particular interests and to natures having a constitutional and definite bias and having consequently special preferences which it is chimerical to expect the rest of the world to be determined by The attempt to subsume the natural order under the moral is like attempts to establish a government of the parent by the child something children are not averse to But such follies are the follies of an intelligent and eager creature restless in a world it cannot at once master and comprehend They are the errors of reason wanderings in the by paths of philosophy not due to lack of intelligence or of faith in law but rather to a premature vivacity in catching at laws a vivacity misled by inadequate information The hunger for facile wisdom is the root of all false philosophy The mind s reactions anticipate in such cases its sufficient nourishment it has not yet matured under the rays of experience so that both materials and guidance are lacking for its precocious organising force Superstitious minds are penetrating and narrow deep and ignorant They apply the higher categories before the lower an inversion which in all spheres produces the worst and most pathetic disorganisation because the lower functions are then deranged and the higher contaminated Poetry anticipates science on which it ought to follow and imagination rushes in to intercept memory on which it ought to feed Hence superstition and the magical function of religion hence the deceptions men fall into by cogitating on things they are ignorant of and arrogating to themselves powers which they have never learned to exercise Sidenote Inattention suffers them to spread It is now generally acknowledged that workers of miracles prophets soothsayers and inspired or divinely appointed men may like metaphysicians be quite sincere and fully believe they possess the powers which they pretend to display In the case of the more intelligent however this sincerity was seldom complete but mixed with a certain pitying or scornful accommodation to the vulgar mind Something unusual might actually have happened in which case the reference of it to the will that welcomed it without of course being able to command it unconditionally might well seem reasonable Or something normal might have been interpreted fancifully but to the greater glory of God and edification of the faithful in which case the incidental error might be allowed to pass unchallenged out of respect for the essential truths thus fortified in pious minds The power of habit and convention by which the most crying inconsistencies and hypocrisies are soon put to sleep would facilitate these accommodations and render them soon instinctive while the world at large entirely hypnotised by the ceremonious event and its imaginative echoes could never come to close quarters with the facts at all but could view them only through accepted preconceptions Thus elaborate machinery can arise and long endure for the magical service of man s interests How deeply rooted such conventions are how natural it is that they should have dominated even civilised society may best be understood if we consider the remnants of such habits in our midst not among gypsies or professional wonder workers but among reflecting men Sidenote Genius may use them to convey an inarticulate wisdom Some men of action like Caesar and Napoleon are said to have been superstitious about their own destiny The phenomenon if true would be intelligible They were masterful men men who in a remarkable degree possessed in their consciousness the sign and sanction of what was happening in the world This endowment which made them dominate their contemporaries could also reveal the sources and conditions of their own will They might easily come to feel that it was destiny the total movement of things that inspired crowned and ruined them But as they could feel this only instinctively not by a systematic view of all the forces in play they would attach their voluminous sense of fatality to some chance external indication or to some ephemeral impulse within themselves so that what was essentially a profound but inarticulate science might express itself in the guise of a superstition In like manner Socrates Demon if not actually a playful fable by which the sage expressed the negative stress of conscience the thou shalt not of all awe inspiring precepts might be a symbol for latent wisdom Socrates turned a trick played upon him by his senses into a message from heaven He taught a feeble voice senseless like all ghostly voices to sanction precepts dictated by the truly divine element within himself It was characteristic of his modest piety to look for some external sign to support reason his philosophy was so human and man is obviously so small a part of the world that he could reasonably subordinate reason at certain junctures Its abdication however was half playful for he could always find excellent grounds for what the demon commanded In much the same manner the priests at Delphi when they were prudent made of the Pythia s ravings oracles not without elevation of tone and with an obvious political tendency Occasions for superstition which baser minds would have turned to sheer lunacy or silly fears or necromantic clap trap were seized by these nobler natures for a good purpose A benevolent man not inclined to scepticism can always argue that the gods must have commanded what he himself knows to be right and he thinks it religion on his part to interpret the oracle accordingly or even to prompt it In such ways the most arbitrary superstitions take a moral colour in a moral mind something which can come about all the more easily since the roots of reason and superstition are intertwined in the mind and society has always expressed and cultivated them together CHAPTER III MAGIC SACRIFICE AND PRAYER Sidenote Fear created the gods That fear first created the gods is perhaps as true as anything so brief could be on so great a subject To recognise an external power it is requisite that we should find the inner stream and tendency of life somehow checked or disturbed if all went well and acceptably we should attribute divinity only to ourselves The external is therefore evil rather than good to early apprehension a sentiment which still survives in respect to matter for it takes reflection to conceive that external forces form a necessary environment creating as well as limiting us and offering us as many opportunities as rebuffs The first things which a man learns to distinguish and respect are things with a will of their own things which resist his casual demands and so the first sentiment with which he confronts reality is a certain animosity which becomes cruelty toward the weak and fear and fawning before the powerful Toward men and animals and the docile parts of nature these sentiments soon become defined accurately representing the exact degree of friendliness or use which we discover in these beings and it is in practical terms expressing this relation to our interests that we define their characters Much remains over however which we cannot easily define indomitable ambiguous regions of nature and consciousness which we know not how to face yet we cannot ignore them since it is thence that comes what is most momentous in our fortunes luck disease tempest death victory Thence come also certain mysterious visitations to the inner mind dreams apparitions warnings To perceive these things is not always easy nor is it easy to interpret them while the great changes in nature which perhaps they forebode may indeed be watched but cannot be met intelligently much less prevented The feeling with which primitive man walks the earth must accordingly be for the most part apprehension and what he meets beyond the well conned ways of his tribe and habitat can be nothing but formidable spirits Sidenote Need also contributed Impotence however has a more positive side If the lightning and thunder startling us in our peace suddenly reveal unwelcome powers before which we must tremble hunger on the contrary will torment us with floating ideas intermittent impulses to act suggesting things which would be wholly delightful if only we could find them but which it becomes intolerable to remain without In this case our fear if we still choose to call it so would be lest our cravings should remain unsatisfied or rather fear has given place to need we recognise our dependence on external powers not because they threaten but because they forsake us Sidenote The real evidences of God s existence Obvious considerations like these furnish the proof of God s existence not as philosophers have tried to express it after the fact and in relation to mythical conceptions of God already current but as mankind originally perceived it and where religion is spontaneous perceives it still There is such an order in experience that we find our desires doubly dependent on something which because it disregards our will we call an external power Sometimes it overwhelms us with scourges and wonders so that we must marvel at it and fear sometimes it removes or after removing restores a support necessary to our existence and happiness so that we must cling to it hope for it and love it Whatever is serious in religion whatever is bound up with morality and fate is contained in those plain experiences of dependence and of affinity to that on which we depend The rest is poetry or mythical philosophy in which definitions not warranted in the end by experience are given to that power which experience reveals To reject such arbitrary definitions is called atheism by those who frame them but a man who studies for himself the ominous and the friendly aspects of reality and gives them the truest and most adequate expression he can is repeating what the founders of religion did in the beginning He is their companion and follower more truly than are the apologists for second hand conceptions which these apologists themselves have never compared with the facts and which they prize chiefly for misrepresenting actual experience and giving it imaginary extensions Religion is not essentially an imposture though it might seem so if we consider it as its defenders present it to us rather than as its discoverers and original spokesmen uttered it in the presence of nature and face to face with unsophisticated men Religion is an interpretation of experience honestly made and made in view of man s happiness and its empirical conditions That this interpretation is poetical goes without saying since natural and moral science even to day are inadequate for the task But the mythical form into which men cast their wisdom was not chosen by them because they preferred to be imaginative it was not embraced as its survivals are now defended out of sentimental attachment to grandiloquent but inaccurate thoughts Mythical forms were adopted because none other were available nor could the primitive mind discriminate at all between the mythical and the scientific Whether it is the myth or the wisdom it expresses that we call religion is a matter of words Certain it is that the wisdom is alone what gives the myth its dignity and what originally suggested it God s majesty lies in his operation not in his definition or his image Sidenote Practice precedes theory in religion Fear and need then bring us into the presence of external powers conceived mythically whose essential character is to be now terrible now auspicious The influence is real and directly felt the gods function is unmistakable and momentous while their name and form the fabulous beings to which that felt influence is imputed vary with the resources of the worshipper s mind and his poetic habits The work of expression the creation of a fabulous environment to derive experience from is not however the first or most pressing operation employing the religious mind Its first business is rather the work of propitiation before we stop to contemplate the deity we hasten to appease it to welcome it or to get out of its way Cult precedes fable and helps to frame it because the feeling of need or fear is a practical feeling and the ideas it may awaken are only incidental to the reactions it prompts Worship is therefore earlier and nearer to the roots of religion than dogma is Sidenote Pathetic tentative nature of religious practices At the same time since those reactions which are directly efficacious go to form arts and industrial habits and eventually put before us the world of science and common sense religious practice and thought are confined to the sphere in which direct manipulation of things is impossible Cultus is always distinguishable from industry even when the worshipper s motives are most sordid and his notions most material for in religious operations the changes worked or expected can never be traced consecutively There is a break often a complete diversity and disproportion between effort and result Religion is a form of rational living more empirical looser more primitive than art Man s consciousness in it is more immersed in nature nearer to a vegetative union with the general life it bemoans division and celebrates harmony with a more passive and lyrical wonder The element of action proper to religion is extremely arbitrary and we are often at a loss to see in what way the acts recommended conduce at all to the result foretold As theoretical superstition stops at any cause so practical superstition seizes on any means Religion arises under high pressure in the last extremity every one appeals to God But in the last extremity all known methods of action have proved futile when resources are exhausted and ideas fail if there is still vitality in the will it sends a supreme appeal to the supernatural This appeal is necessarily made in the dark it is the appeal of a conscious impotence of an avowed perplexity What a man in such a case may come to do to propitiate the deity or to produce by magic a result he cannot produce by art will obviously be some random action He will be driven back to the place where instinct and reason begin His movement will be absolutely experimental altogether spontaneous He will have no reason for what he does save that he must do something Sidenote Meanness and envy in the gods suggesting sacrifice What he will do however will not be very original a die must fall on some one of its six faces shake it as much as you please When Don Quixote seeking to do good absolutely at a venture let the reins drop on Rocinante s neck the poor beast very naturally followed the highway and a man wondering what will please heaven can ultimately light on nothing but what might please himself It is pathetic to observe how lowly the motives are that religion even the highest attributes to the deity and from what a hard pressed and bitter existence they have been drawn To be given the best morsel to be remembered to be praised to be obeyed blindly and punctiliously these have been thought points of honour with the gods for which they would dispense favours and punishments on the most exorbitant scale Indeed the widespread practice of sacrifice like all mutilations and penances suggests an even meaner jealousy and malice in the gods for the disciplinary functions which these things may have were not aimed at in the beginning and would not have associated them particularly with religion In setting aside the fat for the gods pleasure in sacrificing the first born in a thousand other cruel ceremonies the idea apparently was that an envious onlooker lurking unseen might poison the whole or revenge himself for not having enjoyed it unless a part possibly sufficient for his hunger were surrendered to him voluntarily This onlooker was a veritable demon treated as a man treats a robber to whom he yields his purse that his life may be spared To call the gods envious has a certain symbolic truth in that earthly fortunes are actually precarious and such an observation might inspire detachment from material things and a kind of philosophy But what at first inspires sacrifice is a literal envy imputed to the gods a spirit of vengeance and petty ill will so that they grudge a man even the good things which they cannot enjoy themselves If the god is a tyrant the votary will be a tax payer surrendering his tithes to secure immunity from further levies or from attack by other potentates God and man will be natural enemies living in a sort of politic peace Sidenote Ritualistic arts Sacrifices are far from having merely this sinister meaning Once inaugurated they suggest further ideas and from the beginning they had happier associations The sacrifice was incidental to a feast and the plenty it was to render safe existed already What was a bribe offered in the spirit of barter to see if the envious power could not be mollified by something less than the total ruin of his victims could easily become a genial distribution of what custom assigned to each so much to the chief so much to the god so much to the husbandman There is a certain openness and as it were the form of justice in giving each what is conventionally his due however little he may really deserve it In religious observances this sentiment plays an important part and men find satisfaction in fulfilling in a seemly manner what is prescribed and since they know little about the ground or meaning of what they do they feel content and safe if at least they have done it properly Sacrifices are often performed in this spirit and when a beautiful order and religious calm have come to dignify the performance the mind having meantime very little to occupy it may embroider on the given theme It is then that fable and new religious sentiments suggested by fable appear prominently on the scene Sidenote Thank offerings In agricultural rites for instance sacrifice will naturally be offered to the deity presiding over germination that is the deity that might perhaps withdraw his favour with disastrous results He commonly proves however a kindly and responsive being and in offering to him a few sheaves of corn some barley cakes or a libation from the vintage the public is grateful rather than calculating the sacrifice has become an act of thanksgiving So in Christian devotion which often follows primitive impulses and repeats the dialectic of paganism in a more speculative region the redemption did not remain merely expiatory It was not merely a debt to be paid off and a certain quantum of suffering to be endured which had induced the Son of God to become man and to take up his cross It was so the subtler theologians declared an act of affection as much as of pity and the spell of the doctrine over the human heart lay in feeling that God wished to assimilate himself to man rather than simply from above to declare him forgiven so that the incarnation was in effect a rehabilitation of man a redemption in itself and a forgiveness Men like to think that God has sat at their table and walked among them in disguise The idea is flattering it suggests that the courtesy may some day be returned and for those who can look so deep it expresses pointedly the philosophic truth of the matter For are not the gods too in eternal travail after their ideal and is not man a part of the world and his art a portion of the divine wisdom If the incarnation was a virtual redemption the truest incarnation was the laborious creation itself Sidenote The sacrifice of a contrite heart If sacrifice in its more amiable aspect can become thanksgiving and an expression of profitable dependence it can suffer an even nobler transformation while retaining all its austerity Renunciation is the corner stone of wisdom the condition of all genuine achievement The gods in asking for a sacrifice may invite us to give up not a part of our food or of our liberty but the foolish and inordinate part of our wills The sacrifice may be dictated to us not by a jealous enemy needing to be pacified but by a far seeing friend wishing we may not be deceived If what we are commanded to surrender is only what is doing us harm the god demanding the sacrifice is our own ideal He has no interests in the case other than our own he is no part of the environment he is the goal that determines for us how we should proceed in order to realise as far as possible our inmost aspirations When religion reaches this phase it has become thoroughly moral It has ceased to represent or misrepresent material conditions and has learned to embody spiritual goods Sacrifice is a rite and rites can seldom be made to embody ideas exclusively moral Something dramatic or mystical will cling to the performance and even when the effect of it is to purify it will bring about an emotional catharsis rather than a moral improvement The mass is a ritual sacrifice and the communion is a part of it having the closest resemblance to what sacrifices have always been Among the devout these ceremonies and the lyric emotions they awaken have a quite visible influence but the spell is mystic the god soon recedes and it would be purely fanciful to maintain that any permanent moral effect comes from such an exercise The Church has felt as much and introduced the confession where a man may really be asked to consider what sacrifices he should make for his part and in what practical direction he should imagine himself to be drawn by the vague Dionysiac influences to which the ritual subjects him Sidenote Prayer is not utilitarian in essence As sacrifice expresses fear prayer expresses need Common sense thinks of language as something meant to be understood by another and to produce changes in his disposition and behaviour but language has pre rational uses of which poetry and prayer are perhaps the chief A man overcome by passion assumes dramatic attitudes surely not intended to be watched and interpreted like tears gestures may touch an observer s heart but they do not come for that purpose So the fund of words and phrases latent in the mind flow out under stress of emotion they flow because they belong to the situation because they fill out and complete a perception absorbing the mind they do not flow primarily to be listened to The instinct to pray is one of the chief avenues to the deity and the form prayer takes helps immensely to define the power it is addressed to indeed it is in the act of praying that men formulate to themselves what God must be and tell him at great length what they believe and what they expect of him The initial forms of prayer are not so absurd as the somewhat rationalised forms of it Unlike sacrifice prayer seems to be justified by its essence and to be degraded by the transformations it suffers in reflection when men try to find a place for it in their cosmic economy for its essence is poetical expressive contemplative and it grows more and more nonsensical the more people insist on making it a prosaic commercial exchange of views between two interlocutors Prayer is a soliloquy but being a soliloquy expressing need and being furthermore like sacrifice a desperate expedient which men fly to in their impotence it looks for an effect to cry aloud to make vows to contrast eloquently the given with the ideal situation is certainly as likely a way of bringing about a change for the better as it would be to chastise one s self severely or to destroy what one loves best or to perform acts altogether trivial and arbitrary Prayer also is magic and as such it is expected to do work The answer looked for or one which may be accepted instead very often ensues and it is then that mythology begins to enter in and seeks to explain by what machinery of divine passions and purposes that answering effect was produced Sidenote Its supposed efficacy magical Magic is in a certain sense the mother of art art being the magic that succeeds and can establish itself For this very reason mere magic is never appealed to when art has been found and no unsophisticated man prays to have that done for him which he knows how to do for himself When his art fails if his necessity still presses he appeals to magic and he prays when he no longer can control the event provided this event is momentous to him Prayer is not a substitute for work it is a desperate effort to work further and to be efficient beyond the range of one s powers It is not the lazy who are most inclined to prayer those pray most who care most and who having worked hard find it intolerable to be defeated Sidenote Theological puzzles No chapter in theology is more unhappy than that in which a material efficacy is assigned to prayer In the first place the facts contradict the notion that curses can bring evil or blessings can cure and it is not observed that the most orthodox and hard praying army wins the most battles The facts however are often against theology which has to rely on dialectical refinements to explain them away but unfortunately in this instance dialectic is no less hostile than experience God must know our necessities before we ask and if he is good must already have decided what he would do for us Prayer like every other act becomes in a providential world altogether perfunctory and histrionic we are compelled to go through it it is set down for us in the play but it lacks altogether that moral value which we assign to it When our prayers fail it must be better than if they had succeeded so that prayer with all free preference whatsoever becomes an absurdity The trouble is much deeper than that which so many people find in determinism A physical predetermination in making all things necessary leaves all values entire and my preferences though they cannot be efficacious unless they express preformed natural forces are not invalidated ideally It is still true that the world would have been better to all eternity if my will also could have been fulfilled A providential optimism on the contrary not merely predetermines events but discounts values and it reduces every mortal aspiration every pang of conscience every wish that things should be better than they are to a blind impertinence nay to a sacrilege Thus you may not pray that God s kingdom may come but only what is not a prayer but a dogma that it has come already The mythology that pretends to justify prayer by giving it a material efficacy misunderstands prayer completely and makes it ridiculous for it turns away from the heart which prayer expresses pathetically to a fabulous cosmos where aspirations have been turned into things and have thereby stifled their own voices Sidenote A real efficacy would be mechanical The situation would not be improved if we surrendered that mystical optimism and maintained that prayer might really attract super human forces to our aid by giving them a signal without which they would not have been able to reach us If experience lent itself to such a theory there would be nothing in it more impossible than in ordinary telepathy prayer would then be an art like conversation and the exact personages and interests would be discoverable to which we might appeal A celestial diplomacy might then be established not very unlike primitive religions Religion would have reverted to industry and science to which the grosser spirits that take refuge under it have always wished to assimilate it But is it really the office of religion to work upon external powers and extract from them certain calculable effects Is it an art like empiric medicine and merely a dubious and mystic industry If so it exists only by imperfection were it better developed it would coincide with those material and social arts with which it is identical in essence Successful religion like successful magic would have passed into the art of exploiting the world Sidenote True uses of prayer What successful religion really should pass into is contemplation ideality poetry in the sense in which poetry includes all imaginative moral life That this is what religion looks to is very clear in prayer and in the efficacy which prayer consistently can have In rational prayer the soul may be said to accomplish three things important to its welfare it withdraws within itself and defines its good it accommodates itself to destiny and it grows like the ideal which it conceives Sidenote It clarifies the ideal If prayer springs from need it will naturally dwell on what would satisfy that necessity sometimes indeed it does nothing else but articulate and eulogise what is most wanted and prized This object will often be particular and so it should be since Socrates prayer for the best would be perfunctory and vapid indeed in a man whose life had not been spent like Socrates in defining what the best was Yet any particular good lies in a field of relations it has associates and implications so that the mind dwelling on it and invoking its presence will naturally be enticed also into its background and will wander there perhaps to come upon greater goods or upon evils which the coveted good would make inevitable An earnest consideration therefore of anything desired is apt to enlarge and generalise aspiration till it embraces an ideal life for from almost any starting point the limits and contours of mortal happiness are soon descried Prayer inspired by a pressing need already relieves its importunity by merging it in the general need of the spirit and of mankind It therefore calms the passions in expressing them like all idealisation and tends to make the will conformable with reason and justice Sidenote It reconciles to the inevitable A comprehensive ideal however is harder to realise than a particular one the rain wished for may fall the death feared may be averted but the kingdom of heaven does not come It is in the very essence of prayer to regard a denial as possible There would be no sense in defining and begging for the better thing if that better thing had at any rate to be The possibility of defeat is one of the circumstances with which meditation must square the ideal seeing that my prayer may not be granted what in that case should I pray for next Now the order of nature is in many respects well known and it is clear that all realisable ideals must not transgress certain bounds The practical ideal that which under the circumstances it is best to aim at and pray for will not rebel against destiny Conformity is an element in all religion and submission in all prayer not because what must be is best but because the best that may be pursued rationally lies within the possible and can be hatched only in the general womb of being The prayer Thy will be done if it is to remain a prayer must not be degraded from its original meaning which was that an unfulfilled ideal should be fulfilled it expressed aspiration after the best not willingness to be satisfied with anything Yet the inevitable must be accepted and it is easier to change the human will than the laws of nature To wean the mind from extravagant desires and teach it to find excellence in what life affords when life is made as worthy as possible is a part of wisdom and religion Prayer by confronting the ideal with experience and fate tends to render that ideal humble practical and efficacious Sidenote It fosters spiritual life by conceiving it in its perfection A sense for human limitations however has its foil in the ideal of deity which is nothing but the ideal of man freed from those limitations which a humble and wise man accepts for himself but which a spiritual man never ceases to feel as limitations Man for instance is mortal and his whole animal and social economy is built on that fact so that his practical ideal must start on that basis and make the best of it but immortality is essentially better and the eternal is in many ways constantly present to a noble mind the gods therefore are immortal and to speak their language in prayer is to learn to see all things as they do and as reason must under the form of eternity The gods are furthermore no respecters of persons they are just for it is man s ideal to be so Prayer since it addresses deity will in the end blush to be selfish and partial the majesty of the divine mind envisaged and consulted will tend to pass into the human mind This use of prayer has not been conspicuous in Christian times because instead of assimilating the temporal to the eternal men have assimilated the eternal to the temporal being perturbed fanatics in religion rather than poets and idealists Pagan devotion on the other hand was full of this calmer spirit The gods being frankly natural could be truly ideal They embodied what was fairest in life and loved men who resembled them so that it was delightful and ennobling to see their images everywhere and to keep their names and story perpetually in mind They did not by their influence alienate man from his appropriate happiness but they perfected it by their presence Peopling all places changing their forms as all living things must according to place and circumstance they showed how all kinds of being if perfect in their kind might be perfectly good They asked for a reverence consistent with reason and exercised prerogatives that let man free Their worship was a perpetual lesson in humanity moderation and beauty Something pre rational and monstrous often peeped out behind their serenity as it does beneath the human soul and there was certainly no lack of wildness and mystic horror in their apparitions The ideal must needs betray those elemental forces on which after all it rests but reason exists to exorcise their madness and win them over to a steady expression of themselves and of the good Sidenote Discipline and contemplation are their own reward Prayer in fine though it accomplishes nothing material constitutes something spiritual It will not bring rain but until rain comes it may cultivate hope and resignation and may prepare the heart for any issue opening up a vista in which human prosperity will appear in its conditioned existence and conditional value A candle wasting itself before an image will prevent no misfortune but it may bear witness to some silent hope or relieve some sorrow by expressing it it may soften a little the bitter sense of impotence which would consume a mind aware of physical dependence but not of spiritual dominion Worship supplication reliance on the gods express both these things in an appropriate parable Physical impotence is expressed by man s appeal for help moral dominion by belief in God s omnipotence This belief may afterwards seem to be contradicted by events It would be so in truth if God s omnipotence stood for a material magical control of events by the values they were to generate But the believer knows in his heart in spite of the confused explanations he may give of his feelings that a material efficacy is not the test of his faith His faith will survive any outward disappointment In fact it will grow by that discipline and not become truly religious until it ceases to be a foolish expectation of improbable things and rises on stepping stones of its material disappointments into a spiritual peace What would sacrifice be but a risky investment if it did not redeem us from the love of those things which it asks us to surrender What would be the miserable fruit of an appeal to God which after bringing us face to face with him left us still immersed in what we could have enjoyed without him The real use and excuse for magic is this that by enticing us in the service of natural lusts into a region above natural instrumentalities it accustoms us to that rarer atmosphere so that we may learn to breathe it for its own sake By the time we discover the mechanical futility of religion we may have begun to blush at the thought of using religion mechanically for what should be the end of life if friendship with the gods is a means only When thaumaturgy is discredited the childish desire to work miracles may itself have passed away Before we weary of the attempt to hide and piece out our mortality our concomitant immortality may have dawned upon us While we are waiting for the command to take up our bed and walk we may hear a voice saying Thy sins are forgiven thee CHAPTER IV MYTHOLOGY Sidenote Status of fable in the mind Primitive thought has the form of poetry and the function of prose Being thought it distinguishes objects from the experience that reveals them and it aspires to know things as they are but being poetical it attributes to those objects all the qualities which the experience of them contains and builds them out imaginatively in all directions without distinguishing what is constant and efficacious in them This primitive habit of thought survives in mythology which is an observation of things encumbered with all they can suggest to a dramatic fancy It is neither conscious poetry nor valid science but the common root and raw material of both Free poetry is a thing which early man is too poor to indulge in his wide open eyes are too intently watching this ominous and treacherous world For pure science he has not enough experience no adequate power to analyse remember and abstract his soul is too hurried and confused too thick with phantoms to follow abstemiously the practical threads through the labyrinth His view of things is immensely overloaded what he gives out for description is more than half soliloquy but his expression of experience is for that very reason adequate and quite sincere Belief which we have come to associate with religion belongs really to science myths are not believed in they are conceived and understood To demand belief for an idea is already to contrast interpretation with knowledge it is to assert that that idea has scientific truth Mythology cannot flourish in that dialectical air it belongs to a deeper and more ingenuous level of thought when men pored on the world with intense indiscriminate interest accepting and recording the mind s vegetation no less than that observable in things and mixing the two developments together in one wayward drama Sidenote It requires genius A good mythology cannot be produced without much culture and intelligence Stupidity is not poetical Nor is mythology essentially a half way house between animal vagueness in the soul and scientific knowledge It is conceivable that some race not so dreamful as ours should never have been tempted to use psychic and passionate categories in reading nature but from the first should have kept its observations sensuous and pure elaborating them only on their own plane mathematically and dialectically Such a race however could hardly have had lyric or dramatic genius and even in natural science which requires imagination they might never have accomplished anything The Hebrews denying themselves a rich mythology remained without science and plastic art the Chinese who seem to have attained legality and domestic arts and a tutored sentiment without passing through such imaginative tempests as have harassed us remain at the same time without a serious science or philosophy The Greeks on the contrary precisely the people with the richest and most irresponsible myths first conceived the cosmos scientifically and first wrote rational history and philosophy So true it is that vitality in any mental function is favourable to vitality in the whole mind Illusions incident to mythology are not dangerous in the end because illusion finds in experience a natural though painful cure Extravagant error is unstable unless it be harmless and confined to a limbo remote from all applications if it touches experience it is stimulating and brief while the equipoise of dulness may easily render dulness eternal A developed mythology shows that man has taken a deep and active interest both in the world and in himself and has tried to link the two and interpret the one by the other Myth is therefore a natural prologue to philosophy since the love of ideas is the root of both Both are made up of things admirable to consider Sidenote It only half deceives Nor is the illusion involved in fabulous thinking always so complete and opaque as convention would represent it In taking fable for fact good sense and practice seldom keep pace with dogma There is always a race of pedants whose function it is to materialise everything ideal but the great world half shrewdly half doggedly manages to escape their contagion Language may be entirely permeated with myth since the affinities of language have much to do with men gliding into such thoughts yet the difference between language itself and what it expresses is not so easily obliterated In spite of verbal traditions people seldom take a myth in the same sense in which they would take an empirical truth All the doctrines that have flourished in the world about immortality have hardly affected men s natural sentiment in the face of death a sentiment which those doctrines if taken seriously ought wholly to reverse Men almost universally have acknowledged a Providence but that fact has had no force to destroy natural aversions and fears in the presence of events and yet if Providence had ever been really trusted those preferences would all have lapsed being seen to be blind rebellious and blasphemous Prayer among sane people has never superseded practical efforts to secure the desired end a proof that the sphere of expression was never really confused with that of reality Indeed such a confusion if it had passed from theory to practice would have changed mythology into madness With rare exceptions this declension has not occurred and myths have been taken with a grain of salt which not only made them digestible but heightened their savour It is always by its applicability to things known not by its revelation of things unknown and irrelevant that a myth at its birth appeals to mankind When it has lost its symbolic value and sunk to the level of merely false information only an inert and stupid tradition can keep it above water Parables justify themselves but dogmas call for an apologist The genial offspring of prophets and poets then has to be kept alive artificially by professional doctors A thing born of fancy moulded to express universal experience and its veritable issues has to be hedged about by misrepresentation sophistry and party spirit The very apologies and unintelligent proofs offered in its defence in a way confess its unreality since they all strain to paint in more plausible colours what is felt to be in itself extravagant and incredible Sidenote Its interpretative essence Yet if the myth was originally accepted it could not be for this falsity plainly written on its face it was accepted because it was understood because it was seen to express reality in an eloquent metaphor Its function was to show up some phase of experience in its totality and moral issue as in a map we reduce everything geographically in order to overlook it better in its true relations Had those symbols for a moment descended to the plane of reality they would have lost their meaning and dignity they would tell us merely that they themselves existed bodily which would be false while about the real configuration of life they would no longer tell us anything Such an error if carried through to the end would nullify all experience and arrest all life Men would be reacting on expressions and meeting with nothing to express They would all be like word eating philosophers or children learning the catechism The true function of mythical ideas is to present and interpret events in terms relative to spirit Things have uses in respect to the will which are direct and obvious while the inner machinery of these same things is intricate and obscure We therefore conceive things roughly and superficially by their eventual practical functions and assign to them in our game some counterpart of the interest they affect in us This counterpart to our thinking constitutes their inward character and soul So conceived soul and character are purely mythical being arrived at by dramatising events according to our own fancy and interest Such ideas may be adequate in their way if they cover all the uses we may eventually find in the objects they transcribe for us dramatically But the most adequate mythology is mythology still it does not like science set things before us in the very terms they will wear when they are gradually revealed to experience Myth is expression it is not prophecy For this reason myth is something on which the mind rests it is an ideal interpretation in which the phenomena are digested and transmuted into human energy into imaginative tissue Sidenote Contrast with science Scientific formulas on the contrary cry aloud for retranslation into perceptual terms they are like tight ropes on which a man may walk but on which he cannot stand still These unstable symbols lead however to real facts and define their experimental relations while the mind reposing contentedly in a myth needs to have all observation and experience behind it for it will not be driven to gather more The perfect and stable myth would rest on a complete survey and steady focussing of all interests really affecting the one from whose point of view the myth was framed Then each physical or political unit would be endowed with a character really corresponding to all its influence on the thinker This symbol would render the diffuse natural existences which it represented in an eloquent figure and since this figure would not mislead practically it might be called true But truth in a myth means a sterling quality and standard excellence not a literal or logical truth It will not save by a singular accident represent their proper internal being as a forthright unselfish intellect would wish to know it It will translate into the language of a private passion the smiles and frowns which that passion meets with in the world Sidenote Importance of the moral factor There are accordingly two factors in mythology a moral consciousness and a corresponding poetic conception of things Both factors are variable and variations in the first if more hidden are no less important than variations in the second Had fable started with a clear perception of human values it would have gained immensely in significance because its pictures however wrong the external notions they built upon would have shown what in the world so conceived would have been the ideals and prizes of life Thus Dante s bad cosmography and worse history do not detract from the spiritual penetration of his thought though they detract from its direct applicability Had nature and destiny been what Dante imagined his conception of the values involved would have been perfect for the moral philosophy he brought into play was Aristotelian and rational So his poem contains a false instance or imaginary rehearsal of true wisdom It describes the Life of Reason in a fantastic world We need only change man s situation to that in which he actually finds himself and let the soul fathomed and chastened as Dante left it ask questions and draw answers from this steadier dream Sidenote Its submergence Myth travels among the people and in their hands its poetic factor tends to predominate It is easier to carry on the dialectic or drama proper to a fable than to confront it again with the facts and give them a fresh and more genial interpretation The poet makes the fable the sophist carries it on Therefore historians and theologians discuss chiefly the various forms which mythical beings have received and the internal logical or moral implications of those hypostases They would do better to attend instead to the moral factor However interesting a fable may be in itself its religious value lies wholly in its revealing some function which nature has in human life Not the beauty of the god makes him adorable but his dispensing benefits and graces Side by side with Apollo a god having moral functions and consequently inspiring a fervent cult and tending himself to assume a moral character there may be a Helios or a Phaethon poetic figures expressing just as well the sun s physical operation and no less capable if the theologian took hold of them of suggesting psychological problems The moral factor however was not found in these minor deities Only a verbal and sensuous poetry had been employed in defining them the needs and hopes of mankind had been ignored Apollo on the contrary in personifying the sun had embodied also the sun s relations to human welfare The vitality the healing the enlightenment the lyric joy flowing into man s heart from that highest source of his physical being are all beautifully represented in the god s figure and fable The religion of Apollo is therefore a true religion as religions may be true the mythology which created the god rested on a deep observant sense for moral values and drew a vivid if partial picture of the ideal attaching it significantly to its natural ground Sidenote Myth justifies magic The first function of mythology is to justify magic The weak hope on which superstition hangs the gambler s instinct which divines in phenomena a magic solicitude for human fortunes can scarcely be articulated without seeking to cover and justify itself by some fable A magic function is most readily conceived and defined by attributing to the object intentions hostile or favourable to men together with human habits of passion and discourse For lack of resources and observations reason is seldom able to discredit magic altogether Reasonable men are forced therefore in order to find some satisfaction to make magic as intelligible as possible by assimilating it to such laws of human action as may be already mastered and familiar Magic is thus reduced to a sort of system regulated by principles of its own and naturalised as it were in the commonwealth of science Sidenote Myths might be metaphysical Such an avowed and defended magic usually takes one of two forms When the miracle is interpreted dramatically by analogy to human life we have mythology when it is interpreted rationalistically by analogy to current logic or natural science we have metaphysics or theosophy The metaphysical sort of superstition has never taken deep root in the western world Pythagorean mysteries and hypnotisations although periodically fashionable have soon shrivelled in our too salubrious and biting air Even such charming exotics as Plato s myths have not been able to flourish without changing their nature and passing into ordinary dramatic mythology into a magic system in which all the forces once terms in moral experience became personal angels and demons Similarly with the Christian sacraments these magic rites had they been established in India among a people theosophically minded might have furnished cues to high transcendental mysteries Baptism might have been interpreted as a symbol for the purged and abolished will and Communion as a symbol for the escape from personality But European races though credulous enough are naturally positivistic so that when they were called upon to elucidate their ceremonial mysteries what they lit upon was no metaphysical symbolism but a material and historical drama Communion became a sentimental interview between the devout soul and the person of Christ baptism became the legal execution of a mythical contract once entered into between the first and second persons of the Trinity Thus instead of a metaphysical interpretation the extant magic received its needful justification through myths Sidenote They appear ready made like parts of the social fabric When mythology first appears in western literature it already possesses a highly articulate form The gods are distinct personalities with attributes and histories which it is hard to divine the source of and which suggest no obvious rational interpretation The historian is therefore in the same position as a child who inherits a great religion The gods and their doings are prima facie facts in his world like any other facts objective beings that convention puts him in the presence of and with which he begins by having social relations He envisages them with respect and obedience or with careless defiance long before he thinks of questioning or proving their existence The attitude he assumes towards them makes them in the first instance factors in his moral world Much subsequent scepticism and rationalising philosophy will not avail to efface the vestiges of that early communion with familiar gods It is hard to reduce to objects of science what are essentially factors in moral intercourse All thoughts on religion remain accordingly coloured with passion and are felt to be above all a test of loyalty and an index to virtue The more derivative unfathomable and opaque is the prevalent idea of the gods the harder it is for a rational feeling to establish itself in their regard Sometimes the most complete historical enlightenment will not suffice to dispel the shadow which their moral externality casts over the mind In vain do we discard their fable and the thin proofs of their existence when in spite of ourselves we still live in their presence Sidenote They perplex the conscience This pathetic phenomenon is characteristic of religious minds that have outgrown their traditional faith without being able to restate the natural grounds and moral values of that somehow precious system in which they no longer believe The dead gods in such cases leave ghosts behind them because the moral forces which the gods once expressed and which of course remain remain inarticulate and therefore in their dumbness these moral forces persistently suggest their only known but now discredited symbols To regain moral freedom without which knowledge cannot be put to its rational use in the government of life we must rediscover the origin of the gods reduce them analytically to their natural and moral constituents and then proceed to rearrange those materials without any quantitative loss in forms appropriate to a maturer reflection Of the innumerable and rather monotonous mythologies that have flourished in the world only the Graeco Roman and the Christian need concern us here since they are by far the best known to us and the best defined in themselves as well as the only two likely to have any continued influence on the western mind Both these systems pre suppose a long prior development The gods of Greece and of Israel have a full blown character when we first meet them in literature In both cases however we are fortunate in being able to trace somewhat further back the history of mythology and do not depend merely on philosophic analysis to reach the elements which we seek Sidenote Incipient myth in the Vedas In the Vedic hymns there survives the record of a religion remarkably like the Greek in spirit but less dramatic and articulate in form The gods of the Vedas are unmistakably natural elements Vulcan is there nothing but fire Jupiter nothing but the sky This patriarchal people fresh from the highlands had not yet been infected with the manias and diseases of the jungle It lived simply rationally piously loving all natural joys and delighted with all the instruments of a rude but pure civilisation It saluted without servility the forces of nature which ministered to its needs It burst into song in the presence of the magnificent panorama spread out before it day sky and night sky dawn and gloaming clouds thunder and rain rivers cattle and horses grain fruit fire and wine Nor were the social sanctities neglected Commemoration was made of the stages of mortal life of the bonds of love and kinship of peace of battle and of mourning for the dead By a very intelligible figure and analogy the winds became shepherds the clouds flocks the day a conqueror the dawn a maid the night a wise sibyl and mysterious consort of heaven These personifications were tentative and vague and the consequent mythology was a system of rhetoric rather than of theology The various gods had interchangeable attributes and by a voluntary confusion quite in the manner of later Hindu poetry each became on occasion any or all of the others Here the Indian pantheistic vertigo begins to appear Many dark superstitions no doubt bubbled up in the torrent of that plastic reverie for this people clean and natural as on the whole it appears cannot have been without a long and ignoble ancestry The Greeks themselves heirs to kindred general traditions retained some childish and obscene practices in their worship But such hobgoblins naturally vanish under a clear and beneficent sun and are scattered by healthy mountain breezes A cheerful people knows how to take them lightly play with them laugh at them and turn them again into figures of speech Among the early speakers of Sanskrit even more than among the Greeks the national religion seems to have been nothing but a poetic naturalism Such a mythology however is exceedingly plastic and unstable If the poet is observant and renews his impressions his myths will become more and more accurate descriptions of the facts and his hypotheses about phenomena will tend to be expressed more and more in terms of the phenomena themselves that is will tend to become scientific If on the contrary and as usually happens the inner suggestions and fertility of his fables absorb his interest and he neglects to consult his external perceptions any further or even forgets that any such perceptions originally inspired the myth he will tend to become a dramatic poet guided henceforth in his fictions only by his knowledge and love of human life Sidenote Natural suggestions soon exhausted Sidenote They will be carried out in abstract fancy When we transport ourselves in fancy to patriarchal epochs and Arcadian scenes we can well feel the inevitable tendency of the mind to mythologise and give its myths a more and more dramatic character The phenomena of nature unintelligible rationally but immensely impressive must somehow be described and digested But while they compel attention they do not after a while enlarge experience Husbandmen s lore is profound practical poetic superstitious but it is singularly stagnant The cycle of natural changes goes its perpetual round and the ploughman s mind caught in that narrow vortex plods and plods after the seasons Apart from an occasional flood drought or pestilence nothing breaks his laborious torpor The most cursory inspection of field and sky yields him information enough for his needs Practical knowledge with him is all instinct and tradition His mythology can for that very reason ride on nature with a looser rein If at the same time however his circumstances are auspicious and he feels practically secure he will have much leisure to ripen inwardly and to think He hasten to unfold in meditation the abstract potentialities of his mind His social and ideal passions his aptitude for art and fancy will arouse within him a far keener and more varied experience than his outer life can supply Yet all his fortunes continue to be determined by external circumstances and to have for their theatre this given and uncontrollable world Some conception of nature and the gods that is in his case some mythology must therefore remain before him always and stand in his mind for the real forces controlling experience His moral powers and interests have meantime notably developed His sense for social relations has grown clear and full in proportion as his observation of nature has sunk into dull routine Consequently the myths by which reality is represented lose so to speak their birthright and first nationality They pass under the empire of abstract cogitation and spontaneous fancy They become naturalised in the mind The poet cuts loose from nature and works out instead whatever hints of human character or romantic story the myth already supplies Analogies drawn from moral and passionate experience replace the further portraiture of outer facts Human tastes habits and dreams enter the fable expanding it into some little drama or some mystic anagram of mortal life While in the beginning the sacred poet had transcribed nothing but joyous perceptions and familiar industrial or martial actions he now introduces intrigue ingenious adventures and heroic passions Sidenote They may become moral ideals When we turn from the theology of the Vedas to that of Homer we see this revolution already accomplished The new significance of mythology has obscured the old and was a symbol for material facts has become a drama an apologue and an ideal Thus one function of mythology has been nothing less than to carry religion over from superstition into wisdom from an excuse and apology for magic into an ideal representation of moral goods In his impotence and sore need a man appeals to magic this appeal he justifies by imagining a purpose and a god behind the natural agency But after his accounts with the phenomena are settled by his own labour and patience he continues to be fascinated by the invisible spirit he has evoked He cherishes this image it becomes his companion his plastic and unaccountable witness and refuge in all the exigencies of life Dwelling in the mind continually the deity becomes acclimated there the worship it receives endows it with whatever powers and ideal faculties are most feared or honoured by its votary Now the thunder and the pestilence which were once its essence come to be regarded as its disguises and its foils Faith comes to consist in disregarding what it was once religion to regard namely the ways of fortune and the conditions of earthly happiness Thus the imagination sets up its ideals over against the world that occasioned them and mythology instead of cheating men with false and magic aids to action moralises them by presenting an ideal standard for action and a perfect object for contemplation Sidenote The sun god moralised If we consider again for instance Apollo s various attributes and the endless myths connected with his name we shall find him changing his essence and forgetting to be the material sun in order to become the light of a cultivated spirit At first he is the sky s child and has the moon for twin sister His mother is an impersonation of darkness and mystery He travels yearly from the hyperborean regions toward the south and daily he traverses the firmament in a chariot He sleeps in a sea nymph s bosom or rises from the dawn s couch In all this we see clearly a scarcely figurative description of the material sun and its motions A quasi scientific fancy spins these fables almost inevitably to fill the vacuum not yet occupied by astronomy Such myths are indeed compacted out of wonders not indeed to add wonder to them for the original and greatest marvel persists always in the sky but to entertain us with pleasant consideration of them and with their assimilation to our own fine feats This assimilation is unavoidable in a poet ignorant of physics whom human life must supply with all his vocabulary and similes Fortunately in this need of introducing romance into phenomena lies the leaven that is to leaven the lump the subtle influence that is to moralise religion For presently Apollo becomes a slayer of monsters a function no god can perform until he has ceased to be a monster himself he becomes the lovely and valorous champion of humanity the giver of prophecy of music of lyric song even the patron of medicine and gymnastics Sidenote The leaven of religion is moral idealism What a humane and rational transformation The spirit of Socrates was older than the man and had long been at work in the Greeks Interest had been transferred from nature to art from the sources to the fruits of life We in these days are accustomed as a matter of course to associate religion with ideal interests Our piety unlike our barbarous pantheistic theology has long lost sight of its rudimentary material object and habituated us to the worship of human sanctity and human love We have need all the more to remember how slowly and reluctantly religion has suffered spiritualisation how imperfectly as yet its superstitious origin has been outgrown We have need to retrace with the greatest attention the steps by which a moral value has been insinuated into what would otherwise be nothing but a medley of magic rites and poetic physics It is this submerged idealism which alone in an age that should have finally learned how to operate in nature and how to conceive her processes could still win for religion a philosopher s attention or a legislator s mercy CHAPTER V THE HEBRAIC TRADITION Sidenote Phases of Hebraism As the Vedas offer a glimpse into the antecedents of Greek mythology so Hebrew studies open up vistas into the antecedents of Christian dogma Christianity in its Patristic form was an adaptation of Hebrew religion to the Graeco Roman world and later in the Protestant movement a readaptation of the same to what we may call the Teutonic spirit In the first adaptation Hebrew positivism was wonderfully refined transformed into a religion of redemption and endowed with a semi pagan mythology a pseudo Platonic metaphysics and a quasi Roman organisation In the second adaptation Christianity received a new basis and standard in the spontaneous faith of the individual and as the traditions thus undermined in principle gradually dropped away it was reduced by the German theologians to a romantic and mystical pantheism Throughout its transformations however Christianity remains indebted to the Jews not only for its founder but for the nucleus of its dogma cult and ethical doctrine If the religion of the Jews therefore should disclose its origin the origin of Christianity would also be manifest Now the Bible when critically studied clearly reveals the source if not of the earliest religion of Israel at least of those elements in later Jewish faith which have descended to us and formed the kernel of Christian revelation The earlier Hebrews as their own records depict them had a mythology and cultus extremely like that of other Semitic peoples It was natural religion I mean that religion which naturally expresses the imaginative life of a nation according to the conceptions there current about the natural world and to the interest then uppermost in men s hearts It was a religion without a creed or scripture or founder or clergy It consisted in local rites in lunar feasts in soothsayings and oracles in legends about divine apparitions commemorated in the spots they had made holy These spots as in all the rest of the world were tombs wells great trees and above all the tops of mountains Sidenote Israel s tribal monotheism A wandering tribe at once oppressed and aggressive as Israel evidently was from the beginning is conscious of nothing so much as of its tribal unity To protect the tribe is accordingly the chief function of its god Whatever character Jehovah may originally have had whether a storm god of Sinai or of Ararat or a sacred bull or each of these by affinity and confusion with the other when the Israelites had once adopted him as their god they could see nothing essential in him but his power to protect them in the lands they had conquered To this exclusive devotion of Jehovah to Israel Israel responded by a devotion to Jehovah no less exclusive They neglected when at home the worship of every other divinity and later even while travelling abroad and they tended to deny altogether first the comparable power and finally even the existence of other gods Sidenote Problems involved Israel was a small people overshadowed by great empires and its political situation was always highly precarious After a brief period of comparative vigour under David and Solomon a period afterward idealised with that oriental imagination which creating so few glories dreams of so many they declined visibly toward an inevitable absorption by their neighbours But according to the significance which religion then had in Israel the ruin of the state would have put Jehovah s honour and power in jeopardy The nation and its god were like body and soul it occurred to no one as yet to imagine that the one could survive the other A few sceptical and unpatriotic minds despairing of the republic might turn to the worship of Baal or of the stars invoked by the Assyrians hoping thus to save themselves and their private fortunes by a timely change of allegiance But the true Jew had a vehement and unshakable spirit He could not allow the waywardness of events to upset his convictions or the cherished habits of his soul Accordingly he bethought himself of a new way of explaining and meeting the imminent catastrophe The prophets for to them the revolution in question was due conceived that the cause of Israel s misfortunes might be not Jehovah s weakness but his wrath a wrath kindled against the immorality lukewarmness and infidelity of the people Repentance and a change of life together with a purification of the cultus would bring back prosperity It was too late perhaps to rescue the whole state But a remnant might be saved like a brand from the burning to be the nucleus of a great restoration the seed of a mighty people that should live for ever in godliness and plenty Jehovah s power would thus be vindicated even if Israel were ruined nay his power would be magnified beyond anything formerly conceived since now the great powers of Asia would be represented as his instruments in the chastisement of his people Sidenote The prophets put new wine in old bottles These views if we regarded them from the standpoint common in theology as attempts to re express the primitive faith would have to be condemned as absolutely heretical and spurious But the prophets were not interpreting documents or traditions they were publishing their own political experience They were themselves inspired They saw the identity of virtue and happiness the dependence of success upon conduct This new truth they announced in traditional language by saying that Jehovah s favour was to be won only by righteousness and that vice and folly alienated his goodwill Their moral insight was genuine yet by virtue of the mythical expression they could not well avoid and in respect to the old orthodoxy their doctrine was a subterfuge the first of those after thoughts and ingenious reinterpretations by which faith is continually forced to cover up its initial blunders For the Jews had believed that with such a God they were safe in any case but now they were told that to retain his protection they must practice just those virtues by which the heathen also might have been made prosperous and great It was a true doctrine and highly salutary but we need not wonder that before being venerated the prophets were stoned The ideal of this new prophetic religion was still wholly material and political The virtues emphasised and made the chief mark of a religious life were recommended merely as magic means to propitiate the deity and consequently to insure public prosperity The thought that virtue is a natural excellence the ideal expression of human life could not be expected to impress those vehement barbarians any more than it has impressed their myriad descendants and disciples Jewish Christian or Moslem Yet superstitious as the new faith still remained and magical as was the efficacy it attributed to virtue the fact that virtue rather than burnt offerings was now endowed with miraculous influence and declared to win the favour of heaven proved two things most creditable to the prophets in the first place they themselves loved virtue else they would hardly have imagined that Jehovah loved it or have believed it to be the only path to happiness and in the second place they saw that public events depend on men s character and conduct not on omens sacrifices or intercessions There was accordingly a sense for both moral and political philosophy in these inspired orators By assigning a magic value to morality they gave a moral value to religion The immediate aim of this morality to propitiate Jehovah was indeed imaginary and its ultimate aim to restore the kingdom of Israel was worldly yet that imaginary aim covered in the form of a myth a sincere consecration to the ideal while the worldly purpose led to an almost scientific conception of the principles and movement of earthly things Sidenote Inspiration and authority To this transformation in the spirit of the law another almost as important corresponded in the letter Scripture was codified proclaimed and given out formally to be inspired by Jehovah and written by Moses That all traditions legends and rites were inspired and sacred was a matter of course in antiquity Nature was full of gods and the mind with its unaccountable dreams and powers could not be without them Its inventions could not be less oracular than the thunder or the flight of birds Israel like every other nation thought its traditions divine These traditions however had always been living and elastic the prophets themselves gave proof that inspiration was still a vital and human thing It is all the more remarkable therefore that while the prophets were preparing their campaign under pressure of the same threatened annihilation the same puritanical party should have edited a new code of laws and attributed it retroactively to Moses While the prophet s lips were being touched by the coal of fire the priests and king in their conclave were establishing the Bible and the Church It is easy to suspect from the accounts we have that a pious fraud was perpetrated on this occasion but perhaps the finding of a forgotten book of the Law and its proclamation by Josiah after consulting a certain prophetess were not so remote in essence from prophetic sincerity In an age when every prophet seeing what was needful politically could cry So saith the Lord it could hardly be illegitimate for the priests seeing what was expedient legally to declare So said Moses Conscience in a primitive and impetuous people may express itself in an apocryphal manner which in a critical age conscience would altogether exclude It would have been hardly conceivable that what was obviously right and necessary should not be the will of Jehovah manifested of old to the fathers in the desert and now again whispered in their children s hearts To contrive a stricter observance was an act at once of experimental prudence a means of making destiny perhaps less unfavourable and an act of more fervent worship a renewal of faith in Jehovah to whose hands the nation was intrusted more solemnly and irrevocably than ever Sidenote Beginnings of the Church This pious experiment failed most signally Jerusalem was taken the Temple destroyed and the flower of the people carried into exile The effect of failure however was not to discredit the Law and the Covenant now once for all adopted by the unshakable Jews On the contrary when they returned from exile they re established the theocracy with greater rigour than ever adding all the minute observances ritualistic and social enshrined in Leviticus Israel became an ecclesiastical community The Temple half fortress half sanctuary resounded with perpetual psalms Piety was fed on a sense at once of consecration and of guidance All was prescribed and to fulfil the Law precisely because it involved so complete and as the world might say so arbitrary a regimen became a precious sacrifice a continual act of religion Sidenote Bigotry turned into a principle Dogmas are at their best when nobody denies them for then their falsehood sleeps like that of an unconscious metaphor and their moral function is discharged instinctively They count and are not defined and the side of them that is not deceptive is the one that comes forward What was condemnable in the Jews was not that they asserted the divinity of their law for that they did with substantial sincerity and truth Their crime is to have denied the equal prerogative of other nations laws and deities for this they did not from critical insight or intellectual scruples but out of pure bigotry conceit and stupidity They did not want other nations also to have a god The moral government of the world which the Jews are praised for having first asserted did not mean for them that nature shows a generic benevolence toward life and reason wherever these arise Such a moral government might have been conceived by a pagan philosopher and was not taught in Israel until selfishness having been outgrown the birds and the heathen were also placed under divine protection What the moral government of things meant when it was first asserted was that Jehovah expressly directed the destinies of heathen nations and the course of nature itself for the final glorification of the Jews No civilised people had ever had such pretensions before They all recognised one another s religions if not as literally true for some familiarity is needed to foster that illusion certainly as more or less sacred and significant Had the Jews not rendered themselves odious to mankind by this arrogance and taught Christians and Moslems the same fanaticism the nature of religion would not have been falsified among us and we should not now have so much to apologise for and to retract Sidenote Penance accepted Israel s calamities of which the prophets saw only the beginning worked a notable spiritualisation in its religion The happy thought of attributing misfortune to wickedness remained a permanent element in the creed but as no scrupulous administration of rites no puritanism no good conscience could avail to improve the political situation it became needful for the faithful to reconsider their idea of happiness Since holiness must win divine favour and Israel was undoubtedly holy the marks of divine favour must be looked for in Israel s history To have been brought in legendary antiquity out of Egypt was something to have been delivered from captivity in Babylon was more yet these signs of favour could not suffice unless they were at the same time emblems of hope But Jewish life had meantime passed into a new phase it had become pietistic priestly almost ascetic Such is the might of suffering that a race whose nature and traditions were alike positivistic could for the time being find it sweet to wash its hands among the innocent to love the beauty of the Lord s house and to praise him for ever and ever It was agreed and settled beyond cavil that God loved his people and continually blessed them and yet in the world of men tribulation after tribulation did not cease to fall upon them There was no issue but to assert what so chastened a spirit could now understand that tribulation endured for the Lord was itself blessedness and the sign of some mystical election Whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth so the chosen children of God were without paradox to be looked for among the most unfortunate of earth s children Sidenote Christianity combines optimism and asceticism The prophets and psalmists had already shown some beginnings of this asceticism or inverted worldliness The Essenes and the early Christians made an explicit reversal of ancient Jewish conceptions on this point the corner stone of their morality True the old positivism remained in the background Tribulation was to be short lived Very soon the kingdom of God would be established and a dramatic exchange of places would ensue between the proud and the humble The mighty would be hurled from their seat the lowly filled with good things Yet insensibly the conception of a kingdom of God of a theocracy receded or became spiritualised The joys of it were finally conceived as immaterial altogether contemplative and reserved for a life after death Although the official and literal creed still spoke of a day of judgment a resurrection of the body and a New Jerusalem these things were instinctively taken by Christian piety in a more or less symbolic sense A longing for gross spectacular greatness prolonged life and many children after the good old Hebraic fashion had really nothing to do with the Christian notion of salvation Salvation consisted rather in having surrendered all desire for such things and all expectation of happiness to be derived from them Thus the prophet s doctrine that not prosperity absolutely and unconditionally but prosperity merited by virtue was the portion of God s people changed by insensible gradations to an ascetic belief that prosperity was altogether alien to virtue and that a believer s true happiness would be such as Saint Francis paints it upon some blustering winter s night after a long journey to have the convent door shut in one s face with many muttered threats and curses Sidenote Reason smothered between the two In the history of Jewish and Christian ethics the pendulum has swung between irrational extremes without ever stopping at that point of equilibrium at which alone rest is possible Yet this point was sometimes traversed and included in the gyrations of our tormented ancestral conscience It was passed for example at the moment when the prophets saw that it was human interest that governed right and wrong and conduct that created destiny But the mythical form in which this novel principle naturally presented itself to the prophets minds and the mixture of superstition and national bigotry which remained in their philosophy contaminated its truth and were more prolific and contagious than its rational elements Hence the incapacity of so much subsequent thinking to reach clear ideas and the failure of Christianity with its prolonged discipline and opportunities to establish a serious moral education The perpetual painful readjustments of the last twenty centuries have been adjustments to false facts and imaginary laws so that neither could a worthy conception of prosperity and of the good be substituted for heathen and Hebrew crudities on that subject nor could the natural goals of human endeavour come to be recognised and formulated but all was left to blind impulse or chance tradition Sidenote Religion made an institution These defeats of reason are not to be wondered at if we may indeed speak of the defeat of what never has led an army The primitive naturalism of the Hebrews was not yet superseded by prophetic doctrines when a new form of materialism arose to stifle and denaturalise what was rational in those doctrines Even before hope of earthly empire to be secured by Jehovah s favour had quite vanished claims had arisen to supernatural knowledge founded on revelation Mythology took a wholly new shape and alliance with God acquired a new meaning and implication For mythology grew so to speak double moral or naturalistic myths were now reinforced by others of a historical character to the effect that the former myths had been revealed supernaturally At the same time the sign of divine protection and favour ceased to be primarily political Religion now chiefly boasted to possess the Truth and with the Truth to possess the secret of a perfectly metaphysical and posthumous happiness Revelation enigmatically contained in Scripture found its necessary explication in theology while the priests now guardians of the keys of heaven naturally enlarged their authority over the earth In fine the poetic legends and patriarchal worship that had formerly made up the religion of Israel were transformed into two concrete and formidable engines the Bible and the Church CHAPTER VI THE CHRISTIAN EPIC Sidenote The essence of the good not adventitious but expressive Revolutions are ambiguous things Their success is generally proportionate to their power of adaptation and to the reabsorption within them of what they rebelled against A thousand reforms have left the world as corrupt as ever for each successful reform has founded a new institution and this institution has bred its new and congenial abuses What is capable of truly purifying the world is not the mere agitation of its elements but their organisation into a natural body that shall exude what redounds and absorb or generate what is lacking to the perfect expression of its soul Whence fetch this seminal force and creative ideal It must evidently lie already in the matter it is to organise otherwise it would have no affinity to that matter no power over it and no ideality or value in respect to the existences whose standard and goal it was to be There can be no goods antecedent to the natures they benefit no ideals prior to the wills they define A revolution must find its strength and legitimacy not in the reformer s conscience and dream but in the temper of that society which he would transform for no transformation is either permanent or desirable which does not forward the spontaneous life of the world advancing those issues toward which it is already inwardly directed How should a gospel bring glad tidings save by announcing what was from the beginning native to the heart Sidenote A universal religion must interpret the whole world No judgment could well be shallower therefore than that which condemns a great religion for not being faithful to that local and partial impulse which may first have launched it into the world A great religion has something better to consider the conscience and imagination of those it ministers to The prophet who announced it first was a prophet only because he had a keener sense and clearer premonition than other men of their common necessities and he loses his function and is a prophet no longer when the public need begins to outrun his intuitions Could Hebraism spread over the Roman Empire and take the name of Christianity without adding anything to its native inspiration Is it to be lamented that we are not all Jews Yet what makes the difference is not the teaching of Jesus which is pure Hebraism reduced to its spiritual essence but the worship of Christ something perfectly Greek Christianity would have remained a Jewish sect had it not been made at once speculative universal and ideal by the infusion of Greek thought and at the same time plastic and devotional by the adoption of pagan habits The incarnation of God in man and the divinisation of man in God are pagan conceptions expressions of pagan religious sentiment and philosophy Yet what would Christianity be without them It would have lost not only its theology which might be spared but its spiritual aspiration its artistic affinities and the secret of its metaphysical charity and joy It would have remained unconscious as the Gospel is that the hand or the mind of man can ever construct anything Among the Jews there were no liberal interests for the ideal to express They had only elementary human experience the perpetual Oriental round of piety and servitude in the bosom of a scorched exhausted country A disillusioned eye surveying such a world could find nothing there to detain it religion when wholly spiritual could do nothing but succour the afflicted understand and forgive the sinful and pass through the sad pageant of life unspotted and resigned Its pity for human ills would go hand in hand with a mystic plebeian insensibility to natural excellence It would breathe what Tacitus thinking of the liberal life could call odium generis humani it would be inimical to human genius Sidenote Double appeal of Christianity There were we may say two things in Apostolic teaching which rendered it capable of converting the world One was the later Jewish morality and mysticism beautifully expressed in Christ s parables and maxims and illustrated by his miracles those cures and absolutions which he was ready to dispense whatever their sins to such as called upon his name This democratic and untrammelled charity could powerfully appeal to an age disenchanted with the world and especially to those lower classes which pagan polity had covered with scorn and condemned to hopeless misery The other point of contact which early Christianity had with the public need was the theme it offered to contemplation the philosophy of history which it introduced into the western world and the delicious unfathomable mysteries into which it launched the fancy Here too the figure of Christ was the centre for all eyes Its lowliness its simplicity its humanity were indeed for a while obstacles to its acceptance they did not really lend themselves to the metaphysical interpretation which was required Yet even Greek fable was not without its Apollo tending flocks and its Demeter mourning for her lost child and serving in meek disguise the child of another Feeling was ripe for a mythology loaded with pathos The humble life the homilies the sufferings of Jesus could be felt in all their incomparable beauty all the more when the tenderness and tragedy of them otherwise too poignant were relieved by the story of his miraculous birth his glorious resurrection and his restored divinity Sidenote Hebrew metaphors become Greek myths The gospel thus grown acceptable to the pagan mind was however but a grain of mustard seed destined to branch and flower in its new soil in a miraculous manner Not only was the Greek and Roman to refresh himself under its shade but birds of other climates were to build their nests at least for a season in its branches Hebraism when thus expanded and paganised showed many new characteristics native to the minds which had now adopted and transformed it The Jews for instance like other Orientals had a figurative way of speaking and thinking their poetry and religion were full of the most violent metaphors Now to the classic mind violent and improper metaphors were abhorrent Uniting as it did clear reason with lively fancy it could not conceive one thing to be another nor relish the figure of speech that so described it hoping by that unthinkable phrase to suggest its affinities But the classic mind could well conceive transformation of which indeed nature is full and in Greek fables anything might change its form become something else and display its plasticity not by imperfectly being many things at once but by being the perfection of many things in succession While metaphor was thus unintelligible and confusing to the Greek metamorphosis was perfectly familiar to him Wherever Hebrew tradition accordingly used violent metaphors puzzling to the Greek Christian he rationalised them by imagining a metamorphosis instead thus for instance the metaphors of the Last Supper so harmless and vaguely satisfying to an Oriental audience became the doctrine of transubstantiation a doctrine where images are indeed lacking to illustrate the concepts but where the concepts themselves are not confused For that bread should become flesh and wine blood is not impossible seeing that the change occurs daily in digestion what the assertion in this case contradicts is merely the evidence of sense Thus at many a turn in Christian tradition a metaphysical mystery takes the place of a poetic figure the former now expressing by a little miraculous drama the emotion which the latter expressed by a tentative phrase And the emotion is thereby immensely clarified and strengthened it is in fact for the first time really expressed For the idea that Christ stands upon the altar and mingles still with our human flesh is an explicit assertion that his influence and love are perpetual whereas the original parable revealed at most the wish and aspiration contrary to fact that they might have been so By substituting embodiment for allegory the Greek mind thus achieved something very congenial to its habits it imagined the full and adequate expression not in words but in existences of the emotion to be conveyed The Eucharist is to the Last Supper what a centaur is to a horseman or a tragedy to a song Similarly a Dantesque conception of hell and paradise embodies in living detail the innocent apologue in the gospel about a separation of the sheep from the goats The result is a chimerical metaphysics containing much which in reference to existing facts is absurd but that metaphysics when taken for what it truly is a new mythology utters the subtler secrets of the new religion not less ingeniously and poetically than pagan mythology reflected the daily shifts in nature and in human life Sidenote Hebrew philosophy of history identified with Platonic cosmology Metaphysics became not only a substitute for allegory but at the same time a background for history Neo Platonism had enlarged in a way suited to the speculative demands of the time the cosmos conceived by Greek science In an intelligible region unknown to cosmography and peopled at first by the Platonic ideas and afterward by Aristotle s solitary God there was now the Absolute One too exalted for any predicates but manifesting its essence in the first place in a supreme Intelligence the second hypostasis of a Trinity and in the second place in the Soul of the World the third hypostasis already relative to natural existence Now the Platonists conceived these entities to be permanent and immutable the physical world itself had a meaning and an expressive value like a statue but no significant history When the Jewish notion of creation and divine government of the world presented itself to the Greeks they hastened to assimilate it to their familiar notions of imitation expression finality and significance And when the Christians spoke of Christ as the Son of God who now sat at his right hand in the heavens their Platonic disciples immediately thought of the Nous or Logos the divine Intelligence incarnate as they had always believed in the whole world and yet truly the substance and essence of divinity To say that this incarnation had taken place pre eminently or even exclusively in Christ was not an impossible concession to make to pious enthusiasm at least if the philosophy involved in the old conception could be retained and embodied in the new orthodoxy Sacred history could thus be interpreted as a temporal execution of eternal decrees and the plan of salvation as an ideal necessity Cosmic scope and metaphysical meaning were given to Hebrew tenets so unspeculative in their original intention and it became possible even for a Platonic philosopher to declare himself a Christian Sidenote The resulting orthodox system The eclectic Christian philosophy thus engendered constitutes one of the most complete elaborate and impressive products of the human mind The ruins of more than one civilisation and of more than one philosophy were ransacked to furnish materials for this heavenly Byzantium It was a myth circumstantial and sober enough in tone to pass for an account of facts and yet loaded with enough miracle poetry and submerged wisdom to take the place of a moral philosophy and present what seemed at the time an adequate ideal to the heart Many a mortal in all subsequent ages perplexed and abandoned in this ungovernable world has set sail resolutely for that enchanted island and found there a semblance of happiness its narrow limits give so much room for the soul and its penitential soil breeds so many consolations True the brief time and narrow argument into which Christian imagination squeezes the world must seem to a speculative pantheist childish and poor involving as it does a fatuous perversion of nature and history and a ridiculous emphasis laid on local events and partial interests Yet just this violent reduction of things to a human stature this half innocent half arrogant assumption that what is important for a man must control the whole universe is what made Christian philosophy originally appealing and what still arouses in certain quarters enthusiastic belief in its beneficence and finality Nor should we wonder at this enduring illusion Man is still in his childhood for he cannot respect an ideal which is not imposed on him against his will nor can he find satisfaction in a good created by his own action He is afraid of a universe that leaves him alone Freedom appals him he can apprehend in it nothing but tedium and desolation so immature is he and so barren does he think himself to be He has to imagine what the angels would say so that his own good impulses which create those angels may gain in authority and none of the dangers that surround his poor life make the least impression upon him until he hears that there are hobgoblins hiding in the wood His moral life to take shape at all must appear to him in fantastic symbols The history of these symbols is therefore the history of his soul Sidenote The brief drama of things There was in the beginning so runs the Christian story a great celestial King wise and good surrounded by a court of winged musicians and messengers He had existed from all eternity but had always intended when the right moment should come to create temporal beings imperfect copies of himself in various degrees These of which man was the chief began their career in the year four thousand four B C and they would live on an indefinite time possibly that chronological symmetry might not be violated until A D four thousand four The opening and close of this drama were marked by two magnificent tableaux In the first in obedience to the word of God sun moon and stars and earth with all her plants and animals assumed their appropriate places and nature sprang into being with all her laws The first man was made out of clay by a special act of God and the first woman was fashioned from one of his ribs extracted while he lay in a deep sleep They were placed in an orchard where they often could see God its owner walking in the cool of the evening He suffered them to range at will and eat of all the fruits he had planted save that of one tree only But they incited by a devil transgressed this single prohibition and were banished from that paradise with a curse upon their head the man to live by the sweat of his brow and the woman to bear children in labour These children possessed from the moment of conception the inordinate natures which their parents had acquired They were born to sin and to find disorder and death everywhere within and without them At the same time God lest the work of his hands should wholly perish promised to redeem in his good season some of Adam s children and restore them to a natural life This redemption was to come ultimately through a descendant of Eve whose foot should bruise the head of the serpent But it was to be prefigured by many partial and special redemptions Thus Noah was to be saved from the deluge Lot from Sodom Isaac from the sacrifice Moses from Egypt the captive Jews from Babylon and all faithful souls from heathen forgetfulness and idolatry For a certain tribe had been set apart from the beginning to keep alive the memory of God s judgments and promises while the rest of mankind abandoned to its natural depravity sank deeper and deeper into crimes and vanities The deluge that came to punish these evils did not avail to cure them The world was renewed A and the earth rose again above the bosom of the waters but in this renovation there remained eternally some trace of divine vengeance Until the deluge all nature had been exceedingly hardy and vigorous but by that vast flood of water which God had spread out over the earth and by its long abiding there all saps were diluted the air charged with too dense and heavy a moisture bred ranker principles of corruption The early constitution of the universe was weakened and human life from stretching as it had formerly done to near a thousand years grew gradually briefer Herbs and roots lost their primitive potency and stronger food had to be furnished to man by the flesh of other animals Death gained upon life and men felt themselves overtaken by a speedier chastisement As day by day they sank deeper in their wickedness it was but right they should daily as it were stick faster in their woe The very change in nourishment made manifest their decline and degradation since as they became feebler they became also more voracious and blood thirsty Henceforth there were two spirits two parties or as Saint Augustine called them two cities in the world The City of Satan whatever its artifices in art war or philosophy was essentially corrupt and impious Its joy was but a comic mask and its beauty the whitening of a sepulchre It stood condemned before God and before man s better conscience by its vanity cruelty and secret misery by its ignorance of all that it truly behoved a man to know who was destined to immortality Lost as it seemed within this Babylon or visible only in its obscure and forgotten purlieus lived on at the same time the City of God the society of all the souls God predestined to salvation a city which however humble and inconspicuous it might seem on earth counted its myriad transfigured citizens in heaven and had its destinies like its foundations in eternity To this City of God belonged in the first place the patriarchs and the prophets who throughout their plaintive and ardent lives were faithful to what echoes still remained of a primeval revelation and waited patiently for the greater revelation to come To the same city belonged the magi who followed a star till it halted over the stable in Bethlehem Simeon who divined the present salvation of Israel John the Baptist who bore witness to the same and made straight its path and Peter to whom not flesh and blood but the spirit of the Father in heaven revealed the Lord s divinity For salvation had indeed come with the fulness of time not as the carnal Jews had imagined it in the form of an earthly restoration but through the incarnation of the Son of God in the Virgin Mary his death upon a cross his descent into hell and his resurrection at the third day according to the Scriptures To the same city belonged finally all those who believing in the reality and efficacy of Christ s mission relied on his merits and followed his commandment of unearthly love All history was henceforth essentially nothing but the conflict between these two cities two moralities one natural the other supernatural two philosophies one rational the other revealed two beauties one corporeal the other spiritual two glories one temporal the other eternal two institutions one the world the other the Church These whatever their momentary alliances or compromises were radically opposed and fundamentally alien to one another Their conflict was to fill the ages until when wheat and tares had long flourished together and exhausted between them the earth for whose substance they struggled the harvest should come the terrible day of reckoning when those who had believed the things of religion to be imaginary would behold with dismay the Lord visibly coming down through the clouds of heaven the angels blowing their alarming trumpets all generations of the dead rising from their graves and judgment without appeal passed on every man to the edification of the universal company and his own unspeakable joy or confusion Whereupon the blessed would enter eternal bliss with God their master and the wicked everlasting torments with the devil whom they served The drama of history was thus to close upon a second tableau long robed and beatified cohorts passing above amid various psalmodies into an infinite luminous space while below the damned howling writhing and half transformed into loathsome beasts should be engulfed in a fiery furnace The two cities always opposite in essence should thus be finally divided in existence each bearing its natural fruits and manifesting its true nature Let the reader fill out this outline for himself with its thousand details let him remember the endless mysteries arguments martyrdoms consecrations that carried out the sense and made vital the beauty of the whole Let him pause before the phenomenon he can ill afford if he wishes to understand history or the human mind to let the apparition float by unchallenged without delivering up its secret What shall we say of this Christian dream Sidenote Mythology is a language and must be understood to convey something by symbols Those who are still troubled by the fact that this dream is by many taken for a reality and who are consequently obliged to defend themselves against it as against some dangerous error in science or in philosophy may be allowed to marshal arguments in its disproof Such however is not my intention Do we marshal arguments against the miraculous birth of Buddha or the story of Cronos devouring his children We seek rather to honour the piety and to understand the poetry embodied in those fables If it be said that those fables are believed by no one I reply that those fables are or have been believed just as unhesitatingly as the Christian theology and by men no less reasonable or learned than the unhappy apologists of our own ancestral creeds Matters of religion should never be matters of controversy We neither argue with a lover about his taste nor condemn him if we are just for knowing so human a passion That he harbours it is no indication of a want of sanity on his part in other matters But while we acquiesce in his experience and are glad he has it we need no arguments to dissuade us from sharing it Each man may have his own loves but the object in each case is different And so it is or should be in religion Before the rise of those strange and fraudulent Hebraic pretensions there was no question among men about the national personal and poetic character of religious allegiance It could never have been a duty to adopt a religion not one s own any more than a language a coinage or a costume not current in one s own country The idea that religion contains a literal not a symbolic representation of truth and life is simply an impossible idea Whoever entertains it has not come within the region of profitable philosophising on that subject His science is not wide enough to cover all existence He has not discovered that there can be no moral allegiance except to the ideal His certitude and his arguments are no more pertinent to the religious question than would be the insults blows and murders to which if he could he would appeal in the next instance Philosophy may describe unreason as it may describe force it cannot hope to refute them FOOTNOTES Footnote A Bossuet Discours sur l histoire universelle Part II Chap I CHAPTER VII PAGAN CUSTOM AND BARBARIAN GENIUS INFUSED INTO CHRISTIANITY Sidenote Need of paganising Christianity The western intellect in order to accept the gospel had to sublimate it into a neo Platonic system of metaphysics In like manner the western heart had to render Christianity congenial and adequate by a rich infusion of pagan custom and sentiment This adaptation was more gentle and facile than might be supposed We are too much inclined to impute an abstract and ideal Christianity to the polyglot souls of early Christians and to ignore that mysterious and miraculous side of later paganism from which Christian cultus and ritual are chiefly derived In the third century Christianity and devout paganism were in a religious sense closely akin each differed much less from the other than from that religion which at other epochs had borne or should bear its own name Had Julian the Apostate succeeded in his enterprise he would not have rescued anything which the admirers of classic paganism could at all rejoice in a disciple of Iamblichus could not but plunge headlong into the same sea of superstition and dialectic which had submerged Christianity In both parties ethics were irrational and morals corrupt The political and humane religion of antiquity had disappeared and the question between Christians and pagans amounted simply to a choice of fanaticisms Reason had suffered a general eclipse but civilisation although decayed still subsisted and a certain scholastic discipline a certain speculative habit and many an ancient religious usage remained in the world The people could change their gods but not the spirit in which they worshipped them Christianity had insinuated itself almost unobserved into a society full of rooted traditions The first disciples had been disinherited Jews with religious habits which men of other races and interests could never have adopted intelligently the Church was accordingly wise enough to perpetuate in its practice at least an indispensable minimum of popular paganism How considerable this minimum was a glance at Catholic piety will suffice to convince us Sidenote Catholic piety more human than the liturgy The Graeco Jewish system of theology constructed by the Fathers had its liturgical counterpart in the sacraments and in a devout eloquence which may be represented to us fairly enough by the Roman missal and breviary This liturgy transfused as it is with pagan philosophy and removed thereby from the Oriental directness and formlessness of the Bible keeps for the most part its theological and patristic tone Psalms abound Virgin and saints are barely mentioned a certain universalism and concentration of thought upon the Redemption and its speculative meaning pervades the Latin ritual sung behind the altar rails But any one who enters a Catholic church with an intelligent interpreter will at once perceive the immense distance which separates that official and impersonal ritual from the daily prayers and practices of Catholic people The latter refer to the real exigences of daily life and serve to express or reorganise personal passions While mass is being celebrated the old woman will tell her beads lost in a vague rumination over her own troubles while the priests chant something unintelligible about Abraham or Nebuchadnezzar the housewife will light her wax candles duly blessed for the occasion before Saint Barbara to be protected thereby from the lightning and while the preacher is repeating by rote dialectical subtleties about the union of the two natures in Christ s person a listener s fancy may float sadly over the mystery of love and of life and being himself without resources in the premises he may order a mass to be said for the repose of some departed soul In a Catholic country every spot and every man has a particular patron These patrons are sometimes local worthies canonised by tradition or by the Roman see but no less often they are simply local appellations of Christ or the Virgin appellations which are known theoretically to refer all to the same numen but which practically possess diverse religious values for the miracles and intercessions attributed to the Virgin under one title are far from being miracles and intercessions attributable to her under another He who has been all his life devout to Loreto will not place any special reliance on the Pillar at Saragossa A bereaved mother will not fly to the Immaculate Conception for comfort but of course to Our Lady of the Seven Sorrows Each religious order and all the laity more or less affiliated to it will cultivate special saints and special mysteries There are also particular places and days on which graces are granted as not on others and the quantity of such graces is measurable by canonic standards So many days of remitted penance correspond to a work of a certain merit for there is a celestial currency in which mulcts and remissions may be accurately summed and subtracted by angelic recorders One man s spiritual earnings may by gift be attributed and imputed to another a belief which may seem arbitrary and superstitious but which is really a natural corollary to fundamental doctrines like the atonement the communion of saints and intercession for the dead and living Sidenote Natural pieties Another phase of the same natural religion is seen in frequent festivals in the consecration of buildings ships fields labours and seasons in intercessions by the greater dead for the living and by the living for the lesser dead a perfect survival of heroes and penates on the one hand and of pagan funeral rites and commemorations on the other Add Lent with its carnival ember days all saints and all souls Christmas with its magi or its Saint Nicholas Saint Agnes s and Saint Valentine s days with their profane associations a saint for finding lost objects and another for prospering amourettes since all great and tragic loves have their inevitable patrons in Christ and the Virgin in Mary Magdalene and in the mystics innumerable This with what more could easily be rehearsed makes a complete paganism within Christian tradition a paganism for which little basis can be found in the gospel the mass the breviary or the theologians Yet these accretions were as well authenticated as the substructure for they rested on human nature To feel for instance the special efficacy of your village Virgin or of the miraculous Christ whose hermitage is perched on the overhanging hill is a genuine experience The principle of it is clear and simple Those shrines those images the festivals associated with them have entered your mind together with your earliest feelings Your first glimpses of mortal vicissitudes have coincided with the awe and glitter of sacramental moments in which those numina were invoked and on that deeper level of experience in those lower reaches of irrationalism in which such impressions lie they constitute a mystic resource subsisting beneath all conventions and overt knowledge When the doctors blunder as they commonly do the saints may find a cure after all the saints success in medicine seems to a crude empiricism almost as probable as the physicians Special and local patrons are the original gods and whatever religious value speculative and cosmic deities retain they retain surreptitiously by virtue of those very bonds with human interests and passionate desires which ancestral demons once borrowed from the hearth they guarded the mountain they haunted or the sacrifice they inhaled with pleasure until their hearts softened toward their worshippers In itself and as a minimised and retreating theology represents it a universal power has no specific energy no determinate interest at heart there is nothing friendly about it nor allied to your private necessities no links of place and time fortify and define its influence Nor is it rational to appeal for a mitigation of evils or for assistance against them to the very being that has decreed and is inflicting them for some fixed purpose of its own Sidenote Refuge taken in the supernatural Paganism or natural religion was at first like so many crude religious notions optimistic and material the worshipper expected his piety to make his pot boil to cure his disease to prosper his battles and to render harmless his ignorance of the world in which he lived But such faith ran up immediately against the facts it was discountenanced at every turn by experience and reflection The whole of nature and life when they are understood at all have to be understood on an opposite principle on the principle that fate having naturally furnished us with a determinate will and a determinate endowment gives us a free field and no favour in a natural world Hence the retreat of religion to the supernatural a region to which in its cruder forms it was far from belonging Now this retreat in the case of classic paganism took place with the decay of military and political life and would have produced an ascetic popular system some compound of Oriental and Greek traditions even if Christianity had not intervened at that juncture and opportunely pre empted the ground Sidenote The episodes of life consecrated mystically Christianity as we have seen had elements in it which gave it a decisive advantage its outlook was historical not cosmic and consequently admitted a non natural future for the individual and for the Church it was anti political and looked for progress only in that region in which progress was at that time possible in the private soul it was democratic feminine and unworldly its Oriental deity and prophets had a primitive simplicity and pathos not found in pagan heroes or polite metaphysical entities its obscure Hebrew poetry opened like music an infinite field for brooding fancy and presumption The consequence was a doubling of the world so that every Christian led a dual existence one full of trouble and vanity on earth which it was piety in him to despise and neglect another full of hope and consolation in a region parallel to earth and directly above it every part of which corresponded to something in earthly life and could be reached so to speak by a Jacob s ladder upon which aspiration and grace ascended and descended continually Birth had its sacramental consecration to the supernatural in baptism growth in confirmation self consciousness in confession puberty in communion effort in prayer defeat in sacrifice sin in penance speculation in revealed wisdom art in worship natural kindness in charity poverty in humility death in self surrender and resurrection When the mind grew tired of contemplation the lips could still echo some pious petition keeping the body s attitude and habit expressive of humility and propitious to receiving grace and when the knees and lips were themselves weary a candle might be left burning before the altar to witness that the desire momentarily forgotten was not extinguished in the heart Through prayer and religious works the absent could be reached and the dead helped on their journey and amid earthly estrangements and injustices there always remained the church open to all and the society of heaven Sidenote Paganism chastened Hebraism liberalised Nothing is accordingly more patent than that Christianity was paganised by the early Church indeed the creation of the Church was itself what to a Hebraising mind must seem a corruption namely a mixing of pagan philosophy and ritual with the Gospel But this sort of constitutive corruption would more properly be called an adaptation an absorption or even a civilisation of Hebraism for by this marriage with paganism Christianity fitted itself to live and work in the civilised world By this corruption it was completed and immensely improved like Anglo Saxon by its corruption through French and Latin for it is always an improvement in religion whose business is to express and inspire spiritual sentiment that it should learn to express and inspire that sentiment more generously Paganism was nearer than Hebraism to the Life of Reason because its myths were more transparent and its temper less fanatical and so a paganised Christianity approached more closely that ideality which constitutes religious truth than a bare and intense Hebraism in its hostility to human genius could ever have done if isolated and unqualified Sidenote The system post rational and founded on despair The Christianity which the pagans adopted in becoming itself pagan remained a religion natural to their country and their heart It constituted a paganism expressive of their later and calamitous experience a paganism acquainted with sorrow a religion that had passed through both civilisation and despair and had been reduced to translating the eclipsed values of life into supernatural symbols It became a post rational religion Of course to understand such a system it is necessary to possess the faculties it exercises and the experience it represents Where life has not reached the level of reflection religion and philosophy must both be pre rational they must remain crudely experimental unconscious of the limits of excellence and life Under such circumstances it is obviously impossible that religion should be reconstituted on a supernatural plane or should learn to express experience rather than impulse Now the Christianity of the gospels was itself post rational it had turned its back on the world In this respect the mixture with paganism altered nothing it merely reinforced the spiritualised and lyric despair of the Hebrews with the personal and metaphysical despair of the Romans and Greeks For all the later classic philosophy Stoic Sceptic or Epicurean was founded on despair and was post rational Pagan Christianity or Catholicism may accordingly be said to consist of two elements first the genius of paganism the faculty of expressing spiritual experience in myth and external symbol and second the experience of disillusion forcing that pagan imagination to take wing from earth and to decorate no longer the political and material circumstances of life but rather to remove beyond the clouds and constitute its realm of spirit beyond the veil of time and nature in a posthumous and metaphysical sphere A mythical economy abounding in points of attachment to human experience and in genial interpretations of life yet lifted beyond visible nature and filling a reported world a world believed in on hearsay or as it is called on faith that is Catholicism When this religion was established in the Roman Empire that empire was itself threatened by the barbarians who soon permeated and occupied it and made a new and unhappy beginning to European history They adopted Christianity not because it represented their religious needs or inspiration but because it formed part of a culture and a social organisation the influence of which they had not in their simplicity the means to withstand During several ages they could only modify by their misunderstandings and inertia arts wholly new to their lives Sidenote External conversion of the barbarians What sort of religion these barbarians may previously have had is beyond our accurate knowledge They handed down a mythology not radically different from the Graeco Roman though more vaguely and grotesquely conceived and they recognised tribal duties and glories from which religious sanctions could hardly have been absent But a barbarian mind like a child s is easy to convert and to people with what stories you will The Northmen drank in with pleased astonishment what the monks told them about hell and heaven God the Father and God the Son the Virgin and the beautiful angels they accepted the sacraments with vague docility they showed a qualified respect often broken upon it is true by instinctive rebellions for a clergy which after all represented whatever vestiges of learning benevolence or art still lingered in the world But this easy and boasted conversion was fanciful only and skin deep A non Christian ethics of valour and honour a non Christian fund of superstition legend and sentiment subsisted always among mediaeval peoples Their soul so largely inarticulate might be overlaid with churchly habits and imprisoned for the moment in the panoply of patristic dogma but pagan Christianity always remained a religion foreign to them accepted only while their minds continued in a state of helpless tutelage Such a foreign religion could never be understood by them in its genuine motives and spirit They were without the experience and the plastic imagination which had given it birth It might catch them unawares and prevail over them for a time but even during that period it could not root out from barbarian souls anything opposed to it which subsisted there It was thus that the Roman Church hatched the duck s egg of Protestantism Sidenote Expression of the northern genius within Catholicism In its native seats the Catholic system prompts among those who inwardly reject it satire and indifference rather than heresy because on the whole it expresses well enough the religious instincts of the people Only those strenuously oppose it who hate religion itself But among converted barbarians the case was naturally different and opposition to the Church came most vehemently from certain religious natures whose instincts it outraged or left unsatisfied Even before heresy burst forth this religious restlessness found vent in many directions It endowed Christianity with several beautiful but insidious gifts several incongruous though well meant forms of expression Among these we may count Gothic art chivalrous sentiment and even scholastic philosophy These things came as we know ostensibly to serve Christianity which has learned to regard them as its own emanations But in truth they barbarised Christianity just as Greek philosophy and worship and Roman habits of administration had paganised it in the beginning And barbarised Christianity even before it became heretical was something new something very different in temper and beauty from the pagan Christianity of the South and East In the Catholicism of the Middle Ages as it flourished in the North the barbarian soul apprenticed to monkish masters appeared in all its childlike trust originality and humour There was something touching and grotesque about it We seem to see a child playing with the toys of age his green hopes and fancies weaving themselves about an antique metaphysical monument the sanctuary of a decrepit world The structure of that monument was at first not affected and even when it had been undermined and partially ruined its style could not be transformed but clad in its northern ivy it wore at once a new aspect To races without experience that is without cumulative traditions or a visible past Christianity could be nothing but a fairy story and a gratuitous hope as if they had been told about the Sultan of Timbuctoo and promised that they should some day ride on his winged Arabian horses The tragic meaning of the Christian faith its immense renunciation of all things earthly and the merely metaphysical glory of its transfigured life commonly escaped their apprehension as it still continues to do They listened open mouthed to the missionary and accepted his asseverations with unsuspecting emotion like the Anglo Saxon king who likened the soul to a bird flying in and out of a tent at night about whose further fortunes any account would be interesting to hear A seed planted in such a virgin and uncultivated soil must needs bring forth fruit of a new savour Sidenote Internal discrepancies between the two In northern Christianity a fresh quality of brooding tenderness prevailed over the tragic passion elsewhere characteristic of Catholic devotion Intricacy was substituted for dignity and poetry for rhetoric the basilica became an abbey and the hermitage a school The feudal ages were a wonderful seed time in a world all gaunt with ruins Horrors were there mingled with delicacies and confusion with idyllic peace It was here a poet s childhood passed amid the crash of war there an alchemist s old age flickering away amid cobwebs and gibberish Something jocund and mischievous peeped out even in the cloister gargoyles leered from the belfry while ivy and holly grew about the cross The Middle Ages were the true renaissance Their Christianity was the theme the occasion the excuse for their art and jollity their curiosity and tenderness it was far from being the source of those delightful inventions The Crusades were not inspired by the Prince of Peace to whose honour they were fancifully and passionately dedicated so chivalry Gothic architecture and scholastic philosophy were profane expressions of a self discovering genius in a people incidentally Christian The barbarians had indeed been indoctrinated they had been introduced into an alien spiritual and historic medium but they had not been made over or inwardly tamed It had perhaps been rendered easier for them by contact with an existing or remembered civilisation to mature their own genius even in the act of confusing its expression through foreign accretions They had been thereby stimulated to civilise themselves and encouraged also to believe themselves civilised somewhat prematurely when they had become heirs merely to the titles and trappings of civilisation The process of finding their own art and polity begun under foreign guidance was bound on the whole to diverge more and more from its Latin model It consisted now of imitation now of revulsion and fanciful originality never was a race so much under the sway of fashions Fashion is something barbarous for it produces innovation without reason and imitation without benefit It marks very clearly that margin of irresponsible variation in manners and thoughts which among a people artificially civilised may so easily be larger than the solid core It is characteristic of occidental society in mediaeval and modern times because this society is led by people who being educated in a foreign culture remain barbarians at heart To this day we have not achieved a really native civilisation Our art morals and religion though deeply dyed in native feeling are still only definable and indeed conceivable by reference to classic and alien standards Among the northern races culture is even more artificial and superinduced than among the southern whence the strange phenomenon of snobbery in society affectation in art and a violent contrast between the educated and the uneducated the rich and the poor classes that live on different intellectual planes and often have different religions Some educated persons accordingly are merely students and imbibers they sit at the feet of a past which not being really theirs can produce no fruit in them but sentimentality Others are merely protestants they are active in the moral sphere only by virtue of an inward rebellion against something greater and overshadowing yet repulsive and alien They are conscious truants from a foreign school of life Sidenote Tradition and instinct at odds in Protestantism In the Protestant religion it is necessary to distinguish inner inspiration from historical entanglements Unfortunately as the whole doctrinal form of this religion is irrelevant to its spirit and imposed from without being due to the step motherly nurture it received from the Church we can reach a conception of its inner spirit only by studying its tendency and laws of change or its incidental expression in literature and custom Yet these indirect symptoms are so striking that even an outsider if at all observant need not fear to misinterpret them Taken externally Protestantism is of course a form of Christianity it retains the Bible and a more or less copious selection of patristic doctrines But in its spirit and inward inspiration it is something quite as independent of Judea as of Rome It is simply the natural religion of the Teutons raising its head above the flood of Roman and Judean influences Its character may be indicated by saying that it is a religion of pure spontaneity of emotional freedom deeply respecting itself but scarcely deciphering its purposes It is the self consciousness of a spirit in process of incubation jealous of its potentialities averse to definitions and finalities of any kind because it can itself discern nothing fixed or final It is adventurous and puzzled by the world full of rudimentary virtues and clear fire energetic faithful rebellious to experience inexpert in all matters of art and mind It boasts not without cause of its depth and purity but this depth and purity are those of any formless and primordial substance It keeps unsullied that antecedent integrity which is at the bottom of every living thing and at its core it is not acquainted with that ulterior integrity that sanctity which might be attained at the summit of experience through reason and speculative dominion It accordingly mistakes vitality both in itself and in the universe for spiritual life Sidenote The Protestant spirit remote from that of the gospel This underlying Teutonic religion which we must call Protestantism for lack of a better name is anterior to Christianity and can survive it To identify it with the Gospel may have seemed possible so long as in opposition to pagan Christianity the Teutonic spirit could appeal to the Gospel for support The Gospel has indeed nothing pagan about it but it has also nothing Teutonic and the momentary alliance of two such disparate forces must naturally cease with the removal of the common enemy which alone united them The Gospel is unworldly disenchanted ascetic it treats ecclesiastical establishments with tolerant contempt conforming to them with indifference it regards prosperity as a danger earthly ties as a burden Sabbaths as a superstition it revels in miracles it is democratic and antinomian it loves contemplation poverty and solitude it meets sinners with sympathy and heartfelt forgiveness but Pharisees and Puritans with biting scorn In a word it is a product of the Orient where all things are old and equal and a profound indifference to the business of earth breeds a silent dignity and high sadness in the spirit Protestantism is the exact opposite of all this It is convinced of the importance of success and prosperity it abominates what is disreputable contemplation seems to it idleness solitude selfishness and poverty a sort of dishonourable punishment It is constrained and punctilious in righteousness it regards a married and industrious life as typically godly and there is a sacredness to it as of a vacant Sabbath in the unoccupied higher spaces which such an existence leaves for the soul It is sentimental its ritual is meagre and unctuous it expects no miracles it thinks optimism akin to piety and regards profitable enterprise and practical ambition as a sort of moral vocation Its Evangelicalism lacks the notes so prominent in the gospel of disillusion humility and speculative detachment Its benevolence is optimistic and aims at raising men to a conventional well being it thus misses the inner appeal of Christian charity which being merely remedial in physical matters begins by renunciation and looks to spiritual freedom and peace Protestantism was therefore attached from the first to the Old Testament in which Hebrew fervour appears in its worldly and pre rational form It is not democratic in the same sense as post rational religions which see in the soul an exile from some other sphere wearing for the moment perhaps a beggar s disguise it is democratic only in the sense of having a popular origin and bending easily to popular forces Swayed as it is by public opinion it is necessarily conventional in its conception of duty and earnestly materialistic for the meaning of the word vanity never crosses the vulgar heart In fine it is the religion of a race young wistful and adventurous feeling its latent potentialities vaguely assured of an earthly vocation and possessing like the barbarian and the healthy child pure but unchastened energies Thus in the Protestant religion the faith natural to barbarism appears clothed by force of historical accident in the language of an adapted Christianity Sidenote Obstacles to humanism As the Middle Ages advanced the new born human genius which constituted their culture grew daily more playful curious and ornate It was naturally in the countries formerly pagan that this new paganism principally flourished Religion began in certain quarters to be taken philosophically its relation to life began to be understood that it was a poetic expression of need hope and ignorance Here prodigious vested interests and vested illusions of every sort made dangerous the path of sincerity Genuine moral and religious impulses could not be easily dissociated from a system of thought and discipline with which for a thousand years they had been intimately interwoven Scepticism instead of seeming what it naturally is a moral force a tendency to sincerity economy and fine adjustment of life and mind to experience scepticism seemed a temptation and a danger This situation which still prevails in a certain measure strikingly shows into how artificial a posture Christianity has thrown the mind If scepticism under such circumstances by chance penetrated among the clergy it was not favourable to consistency of life and it was the more certain to penetrate among them in that their ranks in a fat and unscrupulous age would naturally be largely recruited by men without conscience or ideal ambitions It became accordingly necessary to reform something either the gay world to suit the Church s primitive austerity and asceticism or the Church to suit the world s profane and general interests The latter task was more or less consciously undertaken by the humanists who would have abated the clergy s wealth and irrational authority advanced polite learning and while of course retaining Christianity for why should an ancestral religion be changed would have retained it as a form of paganism as an ornament and poetic expression of human life This movement had it not been overwhelmed by the fanatical Reformation and the fanatical reaction against it would doubtless have met with many a check from the Church s sincere zealots but it could have overcome them and had it been allowed to fight reason s battle with reason s weapons would ultimately have led to general enlightenment without dividing Christendom kindling venomous religious and national passions or vitiating philosophy Sidenote The Reformation and counter reformation It was not humanism however that was destined to restrain and soften the Church completing by critical reflection that paganisation of Christianity which had taken place at the beginning instinctively and of necessity There was now another force in the field the virgin conscience and wilfulness of the Teutonic races sincerely attached to what they had assimilated in Christianity and now awakening to the fact that they inwardly abhorred and rejected the rest This situation in so uncritical an age could be interpreted as a return to primitive Christianity though this had been in truth as we may now perceive utterly opposed to the Teutonic spirit Accordingly the humanistic movement was crossed and obscured by another specifically religious and ostensibly more Christian than the Church Controversies followed as puerile as they were bloody for it was not to be expected that the peoples once forming the Roman Empire were going to surrender their ancestral religion without a struggle and without resisting this new barbarian invasion into their imaginations and their souls They might have suffered their Christianised paganism to fade with time worldly prosperity and arts might have weaned them gradually from their supernaturalism and science from their myths but how were they to abandon at once all their traditions when challenged to do so by a foreign supernaturalism so much poorer and cruder than their own What happened was that they intrenched themselves in their system cut themselves off from the genial influences that might have rendered it innocuous and became sectaries like their opponents Enlightenment was only to come after a recrudescence of madness and by the mutual slaughter of a fresh crop of illusions usurpations and tyrannies Sidenote Protestantism an expression of character It would be easy to write in a satirical vein the history of Protestant dogma Its history was foreseen from the beginning by intelligent observers It consisted in a gradual and inevitable descent into a pious scepticism The attempt to cling to various intermediate positions on the inclined plane that slopes down from ancient revelation to private experience can succeed only for a time and where local influences limit speculative freedom You must slide smilingly down to the bottom or in horror at that eventuality creep up again and reach out pathetically for a resting place at the top To insist on this rather obvious situation as exhibited for instance in the Anglican Church would be to thresh straw and to study in Protestantism only its feeble and accidental side Its true essence is not constituted by the Christian dogmas that at a given moment it chances to retain but by the spirit in which it constantly challenges the others by the expression it gives to personal integrity to faith in conscience to human instinct courageously meeting the world It rebels for instance against the Catholic system of measurable sins and merits with rewards and punishments legally adjusted and controlled by priestly as well as by divine prerogative Such a supernatural mechanism seems to an independent and uncowed nature a profanation and an imposture Away it says with all intermediaries between the soul and God with all meddlesome priestcraft and all mechanical salvation Salvation shall be by faith alone that is by an attitude and sentiment private to the spirit by an inner company operation of man with the world The Church shall be invisible constituted by all those who possess this necessary faith and by no others It really follows from this although the conclusion may not be immediately drawn that religion is not an adjustment to other facts or powers or to other possibilities than those met with in daily life and in surrounding nature but is rather a spiritual adjustment to natural life an insight into its principles by which a man learns to identify himself with the cosmic power and to share its multifarious business no less than its ulterior security and calm Sidenote It has the spirit of life Protestantism in this perfectly instinctive trustfulness and self assertion is not only prior to Christianity but more primitive than reason and even than man The plants and animals if they could speak would express their attitude to their destiny in the Protestant fashion He that formed us they would say lives and energises within us He has sealed a covenant with us to stand by us if we are faithful and strenuous in following the suggestions he whispers in our hearts With fidelity to ourselves and what is the same thing to him we are bound to prosper and to have life more and more abundantly for ever This attitude where it concerns religion involves two corollaries first what in accordance with Hebrew precedent may be called symbolically faith in God that is confidence in one s own impulse and destiny a confidence which the world in the end is sure to reward and second abomination of all contrary religious tenets and practices of asceticism for instance because it denies the will of idolatry and myth because they render divinity concrete rather than relative to inner cravings and essentially responsive finally of tradition and institutional authority because these likewise jeopardise the soul s experimental development as in profound isolation she wrestles with reality and with her own inspiration Sidenote and of courage In thus meeting the world the soul without experience shows a fine courage proportionate to its own vigour We may well imagine that lions and porpoises have a more masculine assurance that God is on their side than ever visits the breast of antelope or jelly fish This assurance when put to the test in adventurous living becomes in a strong and high bred creature a refusal to be defeated a gallant determination to hold the last ditch and hope for the best in spite of appearances It is a part of Protestantism to be austere energetic unwearied in some laborious task The end and profit are not so much regarded as the mere habit of self control and practical devotion and steadiness The point is to accomplish something no matter particularly what so that Protestants show on this ground some respect even for an artist when he has once achieved success A certain experience of ill fortune is only a stimulus to this fidelity So great is the antecedent trust in the world that the world as it appears at first blush may be confidently defied Sidenote but the voice of inexperience Hence in spite of a theoretic optimism disapproval and proscription play a large part in Protestant sentiment The zeal for righteousness the practical expectation that all shall be well cannot tolerate recognised evils Evils must be abolished or at least hidden they must not offend the face of day and give the lie to universal sanctimony This austerity and repression though they involve occasional hypocrisy lead also to substantial moral reconstruction Protestantism springing from a pure heart purifies convention and is a tonic to any society in which it prominently exists It has the secret of that honest simplicity which belongs to unspoiled youth that keen integrity native to the ungalled spirit as yet unconscious of any duplicity in itself or of any inward reason why it should fail The only evils it recognises seem so many challenges to action so many conditions for some glorious unthought of victory Such a religion is indeed profoundly ignorant it is the religion of inexperience yet it has at its core the very spirit of life Its error is only to consider the will omnipotent and sacred and not to distinguish the field of inevitable failure from that of possible success Success however would never be possible without that fund of energy and that latent resolve and determination which bring also faith in success Animal optimism is a great renovator and disinfectant in the world Sidenote Its emancipation from Christianity It was this youthful religion profound barbaric poetical that the Teutonic races insinuated into Christianity and substituted for that last sigh of two expiring worlds In the end with the complete crumbling away of Christian dogma and tradition Absolute Egotism appeared openly on the surface in the shape of German speculative philosophy This form which Protestantism assumed at a moment of high tension and reckless self sufficiency it will doubtless shed in turn and take on new expressions but that declaration of independence on the part of the Teutonic spirit marks emphatically its exit from Christianity and the end of that series of transformations in which it took the Bible and patristic dogma for its materials It now bids fair to apply itself instead to social life and natural science and to attempt to feed its Protean hunger directly from these more homely sources CHAPTER VIII CONFLICT OF MYTHOLOGY WITH MORAL TRUTH Sidenote Myth should dissolve with the advance of science That magic and mythology have no experimental sanction is clear so soon as experience begins to be gathered together with any care As magic attempts to do work by incantations so myth tries to attain knowledge by playing with lies The attempt is in the first instance inevitable and even innocent for it takes time to discriminate valid from valueless fancies in a mind in which they spring up together with no intrinsic mark to distinguish them The idle notion attracts attention no less than the one destined to prove significant often it pleases more Only watchful eyes and that rare thing conscience applied to memory can pluck working notions from the gay and lascivious vegetation of the mind or learn to prefer Cinderella to her impudent sisters If a myth has some modicum of applicability or significance it takes root all the more firmly side by side with knowledge There are many subjects of which man is naturally so ignorant that only mythical notions can seem to do them justice such for instance are the minds of other men Myth remains for this reason a constituent part even of the most rational consciousness and what can at present be profitably attempted is not so much to abolish myth as to become aware of its mythical character The mark of a myth is that it does not interpret a phenomenon in terms capable of being subsumed under the same category with that phenomenon itself but fills it out instead with images that could never appear side by side with it or complete it on its own plane of existence Thus if meditating on the moon I conceive her other side or the aspect she would wear if I were travelling on her surface or the position she would assume in relation to the earth if viewed from some other planet or the structure she would disclose could she be cut in halves my thinking however fanciful would be on the scientific plane and not mythical for it would forecast possible perceptions complementary to those I am trying to enlarge If on the other hand I say the moon is the sun s sister that she carries a silver bow that she is a virgin and once looked lovingly on the sleeping Endymion only the fool never knew it my lucubration is mythical for I do not pretend that this embroidery on the aspects which the moon actually wears in my feeling and in the interstices of my thoughts could ever be translated into perceptions making one system with the present image By going closer to that disc I should not see the silver bow nor by retreating in time should I come to the moment when the sun and moon were actually born of Latona The elements are incongruous and do not form one existence but two the first sensible the other only to be enacted dramatically and having at best to the first the relation of an experience to its symbol These fancies are not fore tastes of possible perceptions but are free interpretations or translations of the perceptions I have actually had Mythical thinking has its roots in reality but like a plant touches the ground only at one end It stands unmoved and flowers wantonly into the air transmuting into unexpected and richer forms the substances it sucks from the soil It is therefore a fruit of experience an ornament a proof of animal vitality but it is no vehicle for experience it cannot serve the purposes of transitive thought or action Science on the other hand is constituted by those fancies which arising like myths out of perception retain a sensuous language and point to further perceptions of the same kind so that the suggestions drawn from one object perceived are only ideas of other objects similarly perceptible A scientific hypothesis is one which represents something continuous with the observed facts and conceivably existent in the same medium Science is a bridge touching experience at both ends over which practical thought may travel from act to act from perception to perception Sidenote But myth is confused with the moral values it expresses To separate fable from knowledge nothing is therefore requisite except close scrutiny and the principle of parsimony Were mythology merely a poetic substitute for natural science the advance of science would sufficiently dispose of it What remained over would like the myths in Plato be at least better than total silence on a subject that interests us and makes us think although we have no means of testing our thoughts in its regard But the chief source of perplexity and confusion in mythology is its confusion with moral truth The myth which originally was but a symbol substituted for empirical descriptions becomes in the sequel an idol substituted for ideal values This complication from which half the troubles of philosophy arise deserves our careful attention European history has now come twice upon the dissolution of mythologies first among the Stoics and then among the Protestants The circumstances in the two cases were very unlike so were the mythical systems that were discarded and yet the issue was in both instances similar Greek and Christian mythology have alike ended in pantheism So soon as the constructions of the poets and the Fathers were seen to be ingenious fictions criticism was confronted with an obvious duty to break up the mythical compound furnished by tradition into its elements putting on one side what natural observation or actual history had supplied and on the other what dramatic imagination had added For a cool and disinterested observer the task where evidence and records were not wanting would be simple enough But the critic in this case would not usually be cool or disinterested His religion was concerned he had no other object to hang his faith and happiness upon than just this traditional hybrid which his own enlightenment was now dissolving To which part should he turn for support In which quarter should he continue to place the object of his worship Sidenote Neo Platonic revision From the age of the Sophists to the final disappearance of paganism nearly a thousand years elapsed A thousand years from the infliction of a mortal wound to the moment of extinction is a long agony Religions do not disappear when they are discredited it is requisite that they should be replaced For a thousand years the augurs may have laughed they were bound nevertheless to stand at their posts until the monks came to relieve them During this prolonged decrepitude paganism lived on inertia by accretions from the Orient and by philosophic reinterpretations Of these reinterpretations the first was that attempted by Plato and afterward carried out by the neo Platonists and Christians into the notion of a supernatural spiritual hierarchy above a dialectical deity the hypostasis of intellect and its ontological phases below a host of angels and demons hypostases of faculties moral influences and evil promptings In other words in the diremption of myths which yielded here a natural phenomenon to be explained and there a moral value to be embodied Platonism attached divinity exclusively to the moral element The ideas which were essentially moral functions were many and eternal their physical embodiments were adventitious to them and constituted a lapse a misfortune to be wiped out by an eventual reunion of the alienated nature with its own ideal Religion in such a system necessarily meant redemption In this movement paganism turned toward the future toward supernatural and revealed religion and away from its own naturalistic principle Revelation as Plato himself had said was needed to guide a mind which distrusted phenomena and recoiled from earthly pursuits Sidenote It made mythical entities of abstractions This religion had the strength of despair but all else in it was weakness Apart from a revelation which until Christianity appeared remained nebulous and arbitrary there could be no means of maintaining the existence of those hypostasised moral entities The effort to separate them from the natural functions which they evidently expressed could not succeed while any critical acumen or independence subsisted in the believer Platonism to become a religion had to appeal to superstition Unity for instance which according to Plato himself is a category applicable to everything concomitantly with the complementary category of multiplicity for everything he says is evidently both one and many unity could not become the One an independent and supreme deity unless the meaning and function of unity were altogether forgotten and a foolish idolatry agape at words were substituted for understanding Some one had to come with an air of authority and report his visions of the One before such an entity could be added to the catalogue of actual existences The reality of all neo Platonic hypostasis was thus dependent on revelation and on forgetting the meaning once conveyed by the terms so mysteriously transfigured into metaphysical beings Sidenote Hypostasis ruins ideals This divorce of neo Platonic ideas from the functions they originally represented in human life and discourse was found in the end to defeat the very interest that had prompted it enthusiasm for the ideal Enthusiasm for the ideal had led Plato to treat all beauties as stepping stones toward a perfect beauty in which all their charms might be present together eternally and without alloy Enthusiasm for the ideal had persuaded him that mortal life was only an impeded effort to fall back into eternity These inspired but strictly unthinkable suggestions fell from his lips in his zeal to express how much the burden and import of experience exceeded its sensuous vehicle in permanence and value A thousand triangles revealed one pregnant proportion of lines and areas a thousand beds and bridles served one perpetual purpose in human life and found in fulfilling it their essence and standard of excellence a thousand fascinations taught the same lesson and coalesced into one reverent devotion to beauty and nobility wherever they might bloom It was accordingly a poignant sense for the excellence of real things that made Plato wish to transcend them his metaphysics was nothing but a visionary intuition of values an idealism in the proper sense of the word But when the momentum of such enthusiasm remained without its motive power and its transcendence without its inspiration in real experience idealism ceased to be an idealisation an interpretation of reality reaching prophetically to its goals It became a super numerary second physics a world to which an existence was attributed which could be hardly conceived and was certainly supported by no evidence while that significance which it really possessed in reference to natural processes was ignored or even denied An idealism which had consisted in understanding and discriminating values now became a superstition incapable of discerning existences It added a prodigious fictitious setting to the cosmos in which man had to operate it obscured his real interests and possible happiness by seeking to transport him into that unreal environment with its fantastic and disproportionate economy and worst of all it robbed the ideal of its ideality by tearing it up from its roots in natural will and in experienced earthly benefits For an ideal is not ideal if it is the ideal of nothing In that case it is only a ghostly existence with no more moral significance or authority in relation to the observer than has any happy creature which may happen to exist somewhere in the unknown reaches of the universe Sidenote The Stoic revision Meantime a second reinterpretation of mythology was attempted by the Stoics Instead of moving forward like Plato toward the supernaturalism that was for so many ages to dominate the world the Stoics with greater loyalty to pagan principles reverted to the natural forces that had been the chief basis for the traditional deities The progress of philosophy had given the Stoics a notion of the cosmos such as the early Aryan could not have possessed when he recorded and took to heart his scattered observations in the form of divine influences as many and various as the observations themselves To the Stoics the world was evidently one dynamic system The power that animated it was therefore one God Accordingly after explaining away the popular myths by turning them somewhat ruthlessly into moral apologues they proceeded to identify Zeus with the order of nature This identification was supported by many traditional tendencies and philosophic hints The resulting concept though still mythical was perhaps as rationalistic as the state of science at the time could allow Zeus had been from the beginning a natural force at once serene and formidable the thunderer no less than the spirit of the blue He was the ruler of gods and men he was under limitations a sort of general providence Anaxagoras too in proclaiming the cosmic function of reason had prepared the way for the Stoics in another direction This reason which in Socrates and Plato was already a deity meant an order an order making for the good It was the name for a principle much like that which Aristotle called Nature an indwelling prophetic instinct by which things strive after their perfection and happiness Now Aristotle observed this instinct as behoved a disciple of Socrates in its specific cases in which the good secured could be discriminated and visibly attained There were many souls each with its provident function and immutable guiding ideal one for each man and animal one for each heavenly sphere and one the prime mover for the highest sphere of all But the Stoics not trained in the same humane and critical school had felt the unity of things more dramatically and vaguely in the realm of physics Like Xenophanes of old they gazed at the broad sky and exclaimed The All is One Uniting these various influences they found it easy to frame a conception of Zeus or the world or the universal justice and law so as to combine in it a dynamic unity with a provident reason A world conceived to be material and fatally determined was endowed with foresight of its own changes perfect internal harmony and absolute moral dignity Thus mythology with the Stoics ended in pantheism Sidenote The ideal surrendered before the physical By reducing their gods to a single divine influence and identifying this in turn with natural forces the Stoics had in one sense saved mythology For no one would be inclined to deny existence or power to the cosmos to the body the soul of which was Zeus Pantheism taken theoretically is only naturalism poetically expressed It therefore was a most legitimate and congenial interpretation of paganism for a rationalistic age On the other hand mythology had not been a mere poetic physics it had formulated the object of religion it had embodied for mankind its highest ideals in worshipful forms It was when this religious function was transferred to the god of pantheism that the paradox and impossibility of the reform became evident Nature neither is nor can be man s ideal The substitution of nature for the traditional and ideal object of religion involves giving nature moral authority over man it involves that element of Stoicism which is the synonym of inhumanity Life and death good and ill fortune happiness and misery since they flow equally from the universal order shall be declared in spite of reason to be equally good True virtue shall be reduced to conformity He who has no ideal but that nature should possess her actual constitution will be wise and superior to all flattery and calamity he will be equal in dignity to Zeus He who has any less conformable and more determinate interests will be a fool and a worm The wise man will meantime perform all the offices of nature he will lend his body and his mind to her predestined labours For pantheistic morals though post rational are not ascetic In dislodging the natural ideal from the mind they put in its place not its supernatural exaggeration but a curtailment of it inspired by despair The passions are not renounced on the ground that they impede salvation or some visionary ecstasy they are merely chilled by the sense that their defeat when actual is also desirable As all the gods have been reduced to one substance or law so all human treasures are reduced to one privilege that of fortitude You can always consent and by a forced and perpetual conformity to nature lift yourself above all vicissitudes Those tender and tentative ideals which nature really breeds and which fill her with imperfect but genuine excellences you will be too stolid to perceive or too proud to share Thus the hereditary taint of mythology the poison of lies survived in the two forms of philosophic paganism which it concerns us to study In Plato s school myth helped to hypostasise the ideas and by divorcing them from their natural basis to deprive them of their significance and moral function and render the worship of them superstitious In the Stoa the surviving mythological element turned nature when her unity and order had been perceived into an idol so that the worship of her blasted all humane and plastic ideals and set men upon a vain and fanatical self denial Both philosophies were post rational as befitted a decadent age and as their rival and heir Christianity was also Sidenote Parallel movements in Christianity Christianity had already within itself a similar duality being a doctrine of redemption like neo Platonism it tended to deny the natural values of this life but being a doctrine of creation and providential government comparable in a way to the Stoic it had an ineradicable inward tendency toward pantheism and toward a consequent acceptance of both the goods and evils of this world as sanctioned and required by providence Sidenote Hebraism if philosophical must be pantheistic The horror which pantheism has always inspired in the Church is like that which materialism inspires in sentimental idealists they attack it continually not so much because anybody else defends it as because they feel it to be implied unmistakably in half their own tenets The non Platonic half of Christian theology the Mosaic half is bound to become pantheism in the hands of a philosopher The Jews were not pantheists themselves because they never speculated on the relation which omnipotence stood in to natural forces and human acts They conceived Jehovah s omnipotence dramatically as they conceived everything He might pounce upon anything and anybody he might subvert or play with the laws of nature he might laugh at men s devices and turn them to his own ends his craft and energy could not but succeed in every instance but that was not to say that men and nature had no will of their own and did not proceed naturally on their respective ways when Jehovah happened to be busy elsewhere So soon however as this dramatic sort of omnipotence was made systematic by dialectic so soon as the doctrines of creation omniscience and providential government were taken absolutely pantheism was clearly involved The consequences to moral philosophy were truly appalling for then the sins God punished so signally were due to his own contrivance The fervours of his saints the fate of his chosen people and holy temples became nothing but a puppet show in his ironical self consciousness Sidenote Pantheism even when psychic ignores ideals The strangest part of this system or what would seem so if its antecedents were not known is that it is only half conscious of its physical temper and in calling itself an idealism because it makes perception and will the substance of their objects thinks itself an expression of human aspirations This illusion has deep historical roots It is the last stage of a mythical philosophy which has been earnestly criticising its metaphors on the assumption that they were not metaphorical whereby it has stripped them of all significance and reduced them at last to the bare principle of inversion Nothing is any longer idealised yet all is still called an idealism A myth is an inverted image of things wherein their moral effects are turned into their dramatic antecedents as when the wind s rudeness is turned into his anger When the natural basis of moral life is not understood myth is the only way of expressing it theoretically as eyes too weak to see the sun face to face may as Plato says for a time study its image mirrored in pools and as we may add inverted there So the good which in itself is spiritual only is transposed into a natural power At first this amounts to an amiable misrepresentation of natural things the gods inhabit Mount Olympus and the Elysian Fields are not far west of Cadiz With the advance of geography the mythical facts recede and in a cosmography like Hegel s for instance they have disappeared altogether but there remain the mythical values once ascribed to those ideal objects but now transferred and fettered to the sad realities that have appeared in their place The titles of honour once bestowed on a fabled world are thus applied to the real world by right of inheritance Sidenote Truly divine action limited to what makes for the good Nothing could be clearer than the grounds on which pious men in the beginning recognise divine agencies We see they say the hand of God in our lives He has saved us from dangers he has comforted us in sorrow He has blessed us with the treasures of life of intelligence of affection He has set around us a beautiful world and one still more beautiful within us Pondering all these blessings we are convinced that he is mighty in the world and will know how to make all things good to those who trust in him In other words pious men discern God in the excellence of things If all were well as they hope it may some day be God would henceforth be present in everything While good is mixed with evil he is active in the good alone The pleasantness of life the preciousness of human possessions the beauty and promise of the world are proof of God s power so is the stilling of tempests and the forgiveness of sins But the sin itself and the tempest which optimistic theology has to attribute just as much to God s purposes are not attributed to him at all by pious feeling but rather to his enemies In spite of centuries wasted in preaching God s omnipotence his omnipotence is contradicted by every Christian judgment and every Christian prayer If the most pious of nations is engaged in war and suffers a great accidental disaster such as it might expect to be safe from Te deums are sung for those that were saved and Requiems for those that perished God s office in both cases is to save only No one seriously imagines that Providence does more than govern that is watch over and incidentally modify the natural course of affairs not even in the other world if fortunes are still changeable there Sidenote Need of an opposing principle The criterion of divine activity could not be placed more squarely and unequivocally in the good Plato and Aristotle are not in this respect better moralists than is an unsophisticated piety God is the ideal and what manifests the ideal manifests God Are you confident of the permanence and triumph of the things you prize Then you trust in God you live in the consciousness of his presence The proof and measure of rationality in the world and of God s power over it is the extent of human satisfactions In hell good people would disbelieve in God and it is impious of the trembling devils to believe in him there The existence of any evil and if evil is felt it exists for experience is its locus is a proof that some accident has intruded into God s works If that loyalty to the good which is the prerequisite of rationality is to remain standing we must admit into the world while it contains anything practically evil a principle however minimised which is not rational This irrational principle may be inertia in matter accidental perversity in the will or ultimate conflict of interests Somehow an element of resistance to the rational order must be introduced somewhere And immediately in order to distinguish the part furnished by reason from its irrational alloy we must find some practical test for if we are to show that there is a great and triumphant rationality in the world in spite of irrational accidents and brute opposition we must frame an idea of rationality different from that of being It will no longer do to say with the optimists the rational is the real the real is the rational For we wish to make a distinction in order to maintain our loyalty to the good and not to eviscerate the idea of reason by emptying it of its essential meaning which is action addressed to the good and thought envisaging the ideal To pious feeling the free will of creatures their power active or passive of independent origination is the explanation of all defects and everything which is not helpful to men s purposes must be assigned to their own irrationality as its cause Herein lies the explanation of that paradox in religious feeling which attributes sin to the free will but repentance and every good work to divine grace Physically considered as theology must consider the matter both acts and both volitions are equally necessary and involved in the universal order but practical religion calls divine only what makes for the good Whence it follows at once that both within and without us what is done well is God s doing and what is done ill is not Sidenote The standard of value is human Thus what we may call the practical or Hebrew theory of cosmic rationality betrays in plainest possible manner that reason is primarily a function of human nature Reason dwells in the world in so far as the world is good and the world is good in so far as it supports the wills it generates the excellence of each creature the value of its life and the satisfaction of its ultimate desires Thus Hebrew optimism could be moral because although it asserted in a sense the morality of the universe it asserted this only by virtue of a belief that the universe supported human ideals Undoubtedly much insistence on the greatness of that power which made for righteousness was in danger of passing over into idolatry of greatness and power for whatever they may make Yet these relapses into Nature worship are the more rare in that the Jews were not a speculative people and had in the end to endow even Job with his worldly goods in order to rationalise his constancy It was only by a scandalous heresy that Spinoza could so change the idea of God as to make him indifferent to his creatures and this transformation in spite of the mystic and stoical piety of its author passed very justly for atheism for that divine government and policy had been denied by which alone God was made manifest to the Hebrews If Job s reward seems to us unworthy we must remember that we have since passed through the discipline of an extreme moral idealism through a religion of sacrifice and sorrow We should not confuse the principle that virtue must somehow secure the highest good for what should not secure it would not be virtue with the gross symbols by which the highest good might be expressed at Jerusalem That Job should recover a thousand she asses may seem to us a poor sop for his long anguish of mind and body and we may hardly agree with him in finding his new set of children just as good as the old Yet if fidelity had led to no good end if it had not somehow brought happiness to somebody that fidelity would have been folly There is a noble folly which consists in pushing a principle usually beneficent to such lengths as to render it pernicious and the pertinacity of Job would have been a case of such noble folly if we were not somehow assured of its ultimate fruits In Christianity we have the same principle save that the fruits of virtue are more spiritually conceived they are inward peace the silence of the passions the possession of truth and the love of God and of our fellows This is a different conception of happiness incomplete perhaps in a different direction But were even this attenuated happiness impossible to realise all rationality would vanish not merely from Christian charity and discipline but from the whole Christian theory of creation redemption and judgment Without some window open to heaven religion would be more fantastic than worldliness without being less irrational and vain Sidenote Hope for happiness makes belief in God Revelation has intervened to bring about a conception of the highest good which never could have been derived from an impartial synthesis of human interests The influence of great personalities and the fanaticism of peculiar times and races have joined in imposing such variations from the natural ideal The rationality of the world as Christianity conceived it is due to the plan of salvation and the satisfaction of human nature however purified and developed is what salvation means If an ascetic ideal could for a moment seem acceptable it was because the decadence and sophistication of the world had produced a great despair in all noble minds and they thought it better that an eye or a hand which had offended should perish and that they should enter blind and maimed into the kingdom of heaven than that whole and seeing they should remain for ever in hell fire Supernatural then as the ideal might seem and imposed on human nature from above it was yet accepted only because nothing else in that state of conscience and imagination could revive hope nothing else seemed to offer an escape from the heart s corruption and weariness into a new existence CHAPTER IX THE CHRISTIAN COMPROMISE The human spirit has not passed in historical times through a more critical situation or a greater revulsion than that involved in accepting Christianity Was this event favourable to the life of Reason Was it a progress in competence understanding and happiness Any absolute answer would be misleading Christianity did not come to destroy the ancient springs were dry already and for two or three centuries unmistakable signs of decadence had appeared in every sphere not least in that of religion and philosophy Christianity was a reconstruction out of ruins In the new world competence could only be indirect understanding mythical happiness surreptitious but all three subsisted and it was Christianity that gave them their necessary disguises Sidenote Suspense between hope and disillusion The young West had failed in its first great experiment for though classic virtue and beauty and a great classic state subsisted the force that had created them was spent Was it possible to try again Was it necessary to sit down like the Orient in perpetual flux and eternal apathy This question was answered by Christianity in a way under the circumstances extremely happy The Gospel on which Christianity was founded had drawn a very sharp contrast between this world and the kingdom of heaven a phrase admitting many interpretations From the Jewish millennium or a celestial paradise it could shift its sense to mean the invisible Church or even the inner life of each mystical spirit Platonic philosophy to which patristic theology was allied had made a contrast not less extreme between sense and spirit between life in time and absorption in eternity Armed with this double dualism Christianity could preach both renunciation and hope both asceticism and action both the misery of life and the blessing of creation It even enshrined the two attitudes in its dogma uniting the Jewish doctrine of a divine Creator and Governor of this world with that of a divine Redeemer to lead us into another Persons were not lacking to perceive the contradiction inherent in such an eclecticism and it was the Gnostic or neo Platonic party which denied creation and taught a pure asceticism that had the best of the argument The West however would not yield to their logic It might in an hour of trouble and weakness make concessions to quietism and accept the cross but it would not suffer the naturalistic note to die out altogether It preferred an inconsistency which it hardly perceived to a complete surrender of its instincts It settled down to the conviction that God created the world and redeemed it that the soul is naturally good and needs salvation Sidenote Superficial solution This contradiction can be explained exoterically by saying that time and changed circumstances separate the two situations having made the world perfect God redeems it after it has become corrupt and whereas all things are naturally good they may by accident lose their excellence and need to have it restored There is however an esoteric side to the matter A soul that may be redeemed a will that may look forward to a situation in which its action will not be vain or sinful is one that in truth has never sinned it has merely been thwarted Its ambition is rational and what its heart desires is essentially good and ideal So that the whole classic attitude the faith in action art and intellect is preserved under this protecting cuticle of dogma nothing was needed but a little courage and circumstances somewhat more favourable for the natural man to assert himself again A people believing in the resurrection of the flesh in heaven will not be averse to a reawakening of the mind on earth Sidenote But from what shall we be redeemed Another pitfall however opens here These contrasted doctrines may change roles So long as by redemption we understand in the mystic way exaltation above finitude and existence because all particularity is sin to be redeemed is to abandon the Life of Reason but redemption might mean extrication from untoward accidents so that a rational life might be led under right conditions Instead of being like Buddha the redeemer might be like Prometheus In that case however the creator would become like Zeus a tyrant will responsible for our conditions rather than expressive of our ideal The doctrine of creation would become pantheism and that of redemption formerly ascetic would represent struggling humanity Sidenote Typical attitude of saint Augustine The seething of these potent and ambiguous elements can be studied nowhere better than in Saint Augustine He is a more genial and complete representative of Christianity than any of the Greek Fathers in whom the Hebraic and Roman vitality was comparatively absent Philosophy was only one phase of Augustine s genius with him it was an instrument of zeal and a stepping stone to salvation Scarcely had it been born out of rhetoric when it was smothered in authority Yet even in that precarious and episodic form it acquired a wonderful sweep depth and technical elaboration He stands at the watershed of history looking over either land his invectives teach us almost as much of paganism and heresy as his exhortations do of Catholicism To Greek subtlety he joins Hebrew fervour and monkish intolerance he has a Latin amplitude and it must be confessed coarseness of feeling but above all he is the illumined enraptured forgiven saint In him theology however speculative remains a vehicle for living piety and while he has perhaps done more than any other man to materialise Christianity no one was ever more truly filled with its spirit Sidenote He achieves Platonism Saint Augustine was a thorough Platonist but to reach that position he had to pass in his youth through severe mental struggles The difficult triumph over the sensuous imagination by which he attained the conception of intelligible objects was won only after long discipline and much reading of Platonising philosophers Every reality seemed to him at first an object of sense God if he existed must be perceptible for to Saint Augustine s mind also at this early and sensuous stage of its development esse was percipi He might never have worked himself loose from these limitations with which his vivid fancy and not too delicate eloquence might easily have been satisfied had it not been for his preoccupation with theology God must somehow be conceived for no one in that age of religious need and of theological passion felt both more intensely than Saint Augustine If sensible objects alone were real God must be somewhere discoverable in space he must either have a body like the human or be the body of the universe or some subtler body permeating and moving all the rest These conceptions all offered serious dialectical difficulties and what was more to the point they did not satisfy the religious and idealistic instinct which the whole movement of Saint Augustine s mind obeyed So he pressed his inquiries farther At length meditation and more perhaps that experience of the flux and vanity of natural things on which Plato himself had built his heaven of ideas persuaded him that reality and substantiality in any eulogistic sense must belong rather to the imperceptible and eternal Only that which is never an object of sense or experience can be the root and principle of experience and sense Only the invisible and changeless can be the substance of a moving show God could now be apprehended and believed in precisely because he was essentially invisible had he anywhere appeared he could not be the principle of all appearance had he had a body and a locus in the universe he could not have been its spiritual creator The ultimate objects of human knowledge were accordingly ideas not things principles reached by the intellect not objects by any possibility offered to sense The methodological concepts of science by which we pass from fact to fact and from past perception to future did not attract Augustine s attention He admitted it is true that there was a subordinate and to him apparently uninteresting region governed by certissima ratione vel experientia and he even wished science to be allowed a free hand within that empirical and logical sphere A mystic and allegorical interpretation of Scripture was to be invoked to avoid the puerilities into which any literal interpretation of the creation in six days for instance would be sure to run Unbelievers would thus not be scandalised by mythical dogmas concerning things which they might have actually experienced or discovered by sure calculation Science was to have its way in the field of calculable experience that region could be the more readily surrendered by Augustine because his attention was henceforth held by those ideal objects which he had so laboriously come to conceive These were concepts of the contemplative reason or imagination which envisages natures and eternal essences behind the variations of experience essences which at first receive names becoming thus the centres of rational discourse then acquire values becoming guides to action and measures of achievement and finally attract unconditional worship being regarded as the first causes and ultimate goals of all existence and aspiration Sidenote He identifies it with Christianity This purely Platonic philosophy however was not to stand alone Like every phase of Saint Augustine s speculation it came as we have said to buttress or express some religious belief But it is a proof of his depth and purity of soul that his searching philosophic intuition did more to spiritualise the dogmas he accepted from others than these dogmas could do to denaturalise his spontaneous philosophy Platonic ideas had by that time long lost their moral and representative value their Socratic significance They had become ontological entities whereas originally they had represented the rational functions of life This hypostasis of the rational by which the rational abdicates its meaning in the effort to acquire a metaphysical existence had already been carried to its extreme by the Neo Platonists But Saint Augustine while helpless as a philosopher to resist that speculative realism was able as a Christian to infuse into those dead concepts some of the human blood which had originally quickened them Metaphysics had turned all human interests into mythical beings and now religion without at all condemning or understanding that transformation was going to adopt those mythical beings and turn them again into moral influences In Saint Augustine s mind fed as it was by the Psalmist the Platonic figments became the Christian God the Christian Church and the Christian soul and thus acquired an even subtler moral fragrance than that which they had lost when they were uprooted by a visionary philosophy from the soil of Greek culture Sidenote God the good Saint Augustine s way of conceiving God is an excellent illustration of the power inherent in his religious genius and sincerity of giving life and validity to ideas which he was obliged to borrow in part from a fabulous tradition and in part from a petrified metaphysics God to him was simply the ideal eternal object of human thought and love All ideation on an intellectual plane was a vague perception of the divine essence The rational soul understands God for it understands what exists always unchanged God is happiness and in him and from him and through him all things are happy which are happy at all God is the good and the beautiful He was never tired of telling us that God is not true but the truth i e the ideal object of thought in any sphere not good but the good i e the ideal object of will in all its rational manifestations In other words whenever a man reflecting on his experience conceived the better or the best the perfect and the eternal he conceived God inadequately of course yet essentially because God signified the comprehensive ideal of all the perfections which the human spirit could behold in itself or in its objects Of this divine essence accordingly every interesting thing was a manifestation all virtue and beauty were parcels of it tokens of its superabundant grace Hence the inexhaustible passion of Saint Augustine toward his God hence the sweetness of that endless colloquy in prayer into which he was continually relapsing a passion and a sweetness which no one will understand to whom God is primarily a natural power and only accidentally a moral ideal Sidenote Primary and secondary religion Herein lies the chief difference between those in whom religion is spontaneous and primary a very few those in whom it is imitative and secondary To the former divine things are inward values projected by chance into images furnished by poetic tradition or by external nature while to the latter divine things are in the first instance objective factors of nature or of social tradition although they have come perhaps to possess some point of contact with the interests of the inner life on account of the supposed physical influence which those super human entities have over human fortunes In a word theology for those whose religion is secondary is simply a false physics a doctrine about eventual experience not founded on the experience of the past Such a false physics however is soon discredited by events it does not require much experience or much shrewdness to discover that supernatural beings and laws are without the empirical efficacy which was attributed to them True physics and true history must always tend in enlightened minds to supplant those misinterpreted religious traditions Therefore those whose reflection or sentiment does not furnish them with a key to the moral symbolism and poetic validity underlying theological ideas if they apply their intelligence to the subject at all and care to be sincere will very soon come to regard religion as a delusion Where religion is primary however all that worldly dread of fraud and illusion becomes irrelevant as it is irrelevant to an artist s pleasure to be warned that the beauty he expresses has no objective existence or as it would be irrelevant to a mathematician s reasoning to suspect that Pythagoras was a myth and his supposed philosophy an abracadabra To the religious man religion is inwardly justified God has no need of natural or logical witnesses but speaks himself within the heart being indeed that ineffable attraction which dwells in whatever is good and beautiful and that persuasive visitation of the soul by the eternal and incorruptible by which she feels herself purified rescued from mortality and given an inheritance in the truth This is precisely what Saint Augustine knew and felt with remarkable clearness and persistence and what he expressed unmistakably by saying that every intellectual perception is knowledge of God or has God s nature for its object Proofs of the existence of God are therefore not needed since his existence is in one sense obvious and in another of no religious interest It is obvious in the sense that the ideal is a term of moral experience and that truth goodness and beauty are inevitably envisaged by any one whose life has in some measure a rational quality It is of no religious interest in the sense that perhaps some physical or dynamic absolute might be scientifically discoverable in the dark entrails of nature or of mind The great difference between religion and metaphysics is that religion looks for God at the top of life and metaphysics at the bottom a fact which explains why metaphysics has such difficulty in finding God while religion has never lost him This brings us to the grand characteristic and contradiction of Saint Augustine s philosophy a characteristic which can be best studied perhaps in him although it has been inherited by all Christian theology and was already present in Stoic and Platonic speculation when the latter had lost its ethical moorings This is the idea that the same God who is the ideal of human aspiration is also the creator of the universe and its only primary substance Sidenote Ambiguous efficacy of the good in Plato If Plato when he wrote that fine and profound passage in the sixth book of the Republic where he says that the good is the cause of all intelligence in the mind and of all intelligibility in the object and indeed the principle of all essence and existence if Plato could have foreseen what his oracular hyperbole was to breed in the world we may well believe that he would have expunged it from his pages with the same severity with which he banished the poets from his State In the lips of Socrates and at that juncture in the argument of the Republic those sentences have a legitimate meaning The good is the principle of benefit and the philosophers who are to rule the state will not be alienated by their contemplations from practical wisdom seeing that the idea of the good i e of the advantageous profitable and beneficial is the highest concept of the whole dialectic that in reference to which all other ideas have place and significance If we ventured to extend the interpretation of the passage retaining its spirit into fields where we have more knowledge than Plato could have we might say that the principle of the good generates essence and existence in the sense that all natural organs have functions and utilities by which they establish themselves in the world and that the system of these useful functions is the true essence or idea of any living thing But the Socratic origin and sense of such a passage as this and of others in the Timaeus for instance allied to it was soon lost in the headlong idolatry which took possession of the neo Platonic school and it was through this medium that Saint Augustine received his Platonic inspiration The good no longer meant as it did to Plato the principle of benefit everywhere but it meant the good Being and this for a Christian could naturally be none other than God so that the idea that the good was the creator of all essence and existence now assumed a marvellously Mosaic significance Here was one of those bits of primeval revelation which it was explained had survived in the heathen world The hypostasis of moral conceptions then and of the idea of the good in particular led up from the Platonic side to the doctrine of creation Sidenote Ambiguous goodness of the creator in Job The history of the conception among the Jews was entirely different the element of goodness in the creator being there adventitious and the element of power original Jehovah for Job was a universal force justified primarily by his omnipotence but this physical authority would in the end he hoped be partly rationalised and made to clash less scandalously with the authority of justice Among the Greeks as was to be expected the idea of justice was more independent and entire but once named and enshrined that divinity too tended to absoluteness and could be confused with the physical basis of existence In the Stoic philosophy the latter actually gained the upper hand and the problem of Job reappeared on the horizon It did not rise into painful prominence however until Christian times when absolute moral perfection and absolute physical efficacy were predicated of God with equal emphasis if not among the people who never have conceived God as either perfectly good or entirely omnipotent at least among the theologians If not all felt the contradiction with equal acuteness the reason doubtless was that a large part of their thought was perfunctory and merely apologetic they did not quite mean what they said when they spoke of perfect goodness and we shall see how Saint Augustine himself when reduced to extremities surrendered his loyalty to the moral ideal rather than reconsider his traditional premisses Sidenote The Manicheans How tenaciously however he clung to the moral in the religious we can see by the difficulty he had in separating himself from the Manicheans The Manicheans admitted two absolutes the essence of the one being goodness and of the other badness This system was logically weak because these absolutes were in the first place two which is one contradiction and in the second place relative which is another But in spite of the pitfalls into which the Manicheans were betrayed by their pursuit of metaphysical absolutes they were supported by a moral intuition of great truth and importance They saw that an essentially good principle could not have essential evil for its effect These moral terms are we may ourselves feel sure relative to existence and to actual impulse and it may accordingly be always misleading to make them the essence of metaphysical realities good and bad may be not existences but qualities which existences have only in relation to demands in themselves or in one another Yet if we once launch as many metaphysicians would have us do into the hypostasis of qualities and relations it is certainly better and more honest to make contradictory qualities into opposed entities and not to render our metaphysical world unmeaning as well as fictitious by peopling it with concepts in which the most important categories of life are submerged and invalidated Evil may be no more a metaphysical existence than good is both are undoubtedly mere terms for vital utilities and impediments but if we are to indulge in mythology at all it is better that our mythology should do symbolic justice to experience and should represent by contrasted figures the ineradicable practical difference between the better and the worse the beautiful and the ugly the trustworthy and the fallacious To discriminate between these things in practice is wisdom and it should be the part of wisdom to discriminate between them in theory The Manicheans accordingly attributed what is good in the world to one power and what is bad to another The fable is transparent enough and we who have only just learned to smile at a personal devil may affect to wonder that any one should ever have taken it literally But in an age when the assertive imagination was unchecked by any critical sense such a device at least avoided the scandal of attributing all the evils and sins of this world to a principle essentially inviolate and pure By avoiding what must have seemed a blasphemy to Saint Augustine as to every one whose speculation was still relevant to his conscience and to his practical idealism the Manicheans thus prevailed on many to overlook the contradictions which their system developed so soon as its figments were projected into the sphere of absolute existences Sidenote All things good by nature The horror with which an idealistic youth at first views the truculence of nature and the turpitude of worldly life is capable of being softened by experience Time subdues our initial preferences by showing us the complexity of moral relations in this world and by extending our imaginative sympathy to forms of existence and passion at first repulsive which from new and ultra personal points of view may have their natural sweetness and value In this way Saint Augustine was ultimately brought to appreciate the catholicity and scope of those Greek sages who had taught that all being was to itself good that evil was but the impediment of natural function and that therefore the conception of anything totally or essentially evil was only a petulance or exaggeration in moral judgment that took as it were the bit in its teeth and turned an incidental conflict of interests into a metaphysical opposition of natures All definite being is in itself congruous with the true and the good since its constitution is intelligible and its operation is creative of values Were it not for the limitations of matter and the accidental crowding and conflict of life all existing natures might subsist and prosper in peace and concord just as their various ideas live without contradiction in the realm of conceptual truth We may say of all things in the words of the Gospel that their angels see the face of God Their ideals are no less cases of the good no less instances of perfection than is the ideal locked in our private bosom It is the part of justice and charity to recognise this situation in view of which we may justly say that evil is always relative and subordinate to some constituted nature in itself a standard of worth a point of departure for the moral valuation of eventual changes and of surrounding things Evil is accordingly accidental and unnatural it follows upon the maladaptation of actions to natures and of natures to one another It can be no just ground for the condemnation of any of those natural essences which only give rise to it by their imperfect realisation The Semitic idea of creation could now receive that philosophical interpretation which it so sadly needed Primordially and in respect to what was positive in them all things might he expressions of the good in their essence and ideal state they might be said to be created by God For God was the supreme ideal to which all other goods were subordinate and instrumental and if we agree to make a cosmogony out of morals and to hypostasise the series of rational ideals taken in the inverse order into a series of efficient causes it is clear that the highest good which is at the end of the moral scale will now figure as a first cause at the beginning of the physical sequence This operation is what is recorded and demanded in the doctrine of creation a doctrine which would lose its dogmatic force if we allowed either the moral ideality or the physical efficacy of the creator to drop out of sight If the moral ideality is sacrificed we pass to an ordinary pantheism while if the physical efficacy is surrendered we take refuge in a naturalistic idealism of the Aristotelian type where the good is a function of things and neither their substance nor their cause Sidenote The doctrine of creation demands that of the fall To accept the doctrine of creation after it had become familiar was not very hard because the contradiction it contains could then be set down to our imperfect apprehension The unintelligibility of matters of fact does not lead us to deny them but merely to study them and when the creation was accepted as a fact its unintelligibility became merely a theological problem and a religious mystery such as no mortal philosophy can be without But for Saint Augustine the situation was wholly different A doctrine of the creation had to be constructed the disparate ideas had to be synthesised which posterity was afterward to regard as the obvious if not wholly reconcilable attributes of the deity The mystery could not then be recognised it had to be made And Saint Augustine with his vital religion with his spontaneous adoration of God the ideal could not attribute to that ideal unimpeded efficacy in the world To admit that all natures were essentially good might dispel the Manichean fancy about an Evil Absolute engaged in single combat with an Absolute Good but insight into the meaning and the natural conditions of evil could only make its presence more obvious and its origin more intimately bound up with the general constitution of the world Evil is only imperfection but everything is imperfect Conflict is only maladaptation but there is maladaptation everywhere If we assume then what the doctrine of creation requires that all things at first proceeded out of the potency of the good their matter and form their distribution and their energies being wholly attributable to the attraction of the ultimately best it is clear that some calamity must have immediately supervened by which the fountains of life were defiled the strength of the ideal principle in living things weakened and the mortal conflict instituted which not only condemns all existent things ultimately to perish but hardly allows them even while they painfully endure to be truly and adequately themselves Original sin with the fall of the angels and of man for its mythical ground thus enters into the inmost web of Augustinian philosophy This fact cannot be too much insisted upon for only by the immediate introduction of original sin into the history of the world could a man to whom God was still a moral term believe at all in the natural and fundamental efficacy of God in the cosmos The doctrine of the fall made it possible for Saint Augustine to accept the doctrine of the creation Both belonged to the same mythical region in which the moral values of life were made to figure as metaphysical agents but when once the metaphysical agency of the highest good was admitted into a poetic cosmogony it became imperative to admit also the metaphysical agency of sin into it for otherwise the highest good would be deprived of its ideal and moral character would cease to be the entelechy of rational life and be degraded into a flat principle of description or synthesis for experience and nature as they actually are God would thus become a natural agent like the fire of Heraclitus in which human piety could take an interest only by force of traditional inertia and unintelligence while the continued muttering of the ritual prevented men from awaking to the disappearance of the god The essence of deity as Augustine was inwardly convinced was correspondence to human aspiration moral perfection and ideality God therefore as the Manicheans with Plato and Aristotle before them had taught could be the author of good only or to express the same thing in less figurative and misleading language it was only the good in things that could contribute to our idea of divinity What was evil must therefore be carried up into another concept must be referred if you will to another mythical agent and this mythical agent in Saint Augustine s theology was named sin Sidenote Original sin Everything in the world which obscured the image of the creator or rebelled against his commandments everything that is which prevented in things the expression of their natural ideals was due to sin Sin was responsible for disease of mind and body for all suffering for death for ignorance perversity and dulness Sin was responsible so truly original was it for what was painful and wrong even in the animal kingdom and sin such was the paradoxical apex of this inverted series of causes sin was responsible for sin itself The insoluble problems of the origin of evil and of freedom in a world produced in its every fibre by omnipotent goodness can never be understood until we remember their origin They are artificial problems unknown to philosophy before it betook itself to the literal justification of fables in which the objects of rational endeavour were represented as causes of natural existence The former are internal products of life the latter its external conditions When the two are confused we reach the contradiction confronting Saint Augustine and all who to this day have followed in his steps The cause of everything must have been the cause of sin yet the principle of good could not be the principle of evil Both propositions were obviously true and they were contradictory only after the mythical identification of the God which meant the ideal of life with the God which meant the forces of nature Sidenote Forced abandonment of the ideal It would help us little in trying to understand these doctrines to work over the dialectic of them and to express the contradiction in somewhat veiled terms or according to new pictorial analogies Good and evil in the context of life undoubtedly have common causes but that system which involves both is for that very reason not an ideal system and to represent it as such is simply to ignore the conscience and the upward effort of life The contradiction can be avoided only by renouncing the meaning of one of the terms either that is by no longer regarding the good as an absolute creator but merely as a partial result or tendency in a living world whose life naturally involves values or else by no longer conceiving God as the ideal term in man s own existence The latter is the solution adopted by metaphysicians generally and by Saint Augustine himself when hard pressed by the exigencies of his double allegiance God he tells us is just although not just as man is nor as man should be In other words God is to be called just even when he is unjust in the only sense in which the word justice has a meaning among men We are forced in fact to obscure our moral concepts and make them equivocal in order to be able to apply them to the efficient forces and actual habits of this world The essence of divinity is no longer moral excellence but ontological and dynamic relations to the natural world so that the love of God would have to become not an exercise of reason and conscience as it naturally was with Saint Augustine but a mystical intoxication as it was with Spinoza The sad effects of this degradation of God into a physical power are not hard to trace in Augustine s own doctrine and feeling He became a champion of arbitrary grace and arbitrary predestination to perdition The eternal damnation of innocents gave him no qualms and in this we must admire the strength of his logic since if it is right that there should be wrong at all there is no particular reason for stickling at the quantity or the enormity of it And yet there are sentences which for their brutality and sycophancy cannot be read without pain sentences inspired by this misguided desire to apologise for the crimes of the universe Why should God not create beings that he foreknew were to sin when indeed in their persons and by their fates he could manifest both what punishment their guilt deserved and what free gifts he might bestow on them by his favour Thinking it more lordly and better to do well even in the presence of evil than not to allow evil to exist at all Here the pitiful maxim of doing evil that good may come is robbed of the excuse it finds in human limitations and is made the first principle of divine morality Repellent and contorted as these ultimate metaphysical theories may seem we must not suppose that they destroyed in Saint Augustine that practical and devotional idealism which they contradicted the region of Christian charity is fortunately far wider and far nearer home than that of Christian apologetics The work of practical redemption went on while the dialectics about the perfection of the universe were forgotten and Saint Augustine never ceased by a happy inconsistency to bewail the sins and to combat the heresies which his God was stealthily nursing so that in their melodramatic punishment his glory might be more beautifully manifested Sidenote The problem among the protestants It was Saint Augustine as we know who in spite of his fervid Catholicism was the favourite master of both Luther and Calvin They emphasised however his more fanatical side and this very predestinarian and absolutist doctrine which he had prevailed on himself to accept Here was the pantheistic leaven doing its work and concentration of attention on the Old Testament given the reformers controversial and metaphysical habit of thought could only precipitate the inevitable While popular piety bubbled up into all sorts of emotional and captious sects each with its pathetic insistence on some text or on some whimsey but all inwardly inspired by an earnest religious hunger academic and cultivated Protestantism became every day more pale and rationalistic Mediocre natures continued to rehearse the old platitudes and tread the slippery middle courses of one orthodoxy or another but distinguished minds could no longer treat such survivals as more than allegories historic or mythical illustrations of general spiritual truths So Lessing Goethe and the idealists in Germany and after them such lay prophets as Carlyle and Emerson had for Christianity only an inessential respect They drank their genuine inspiration directly from nature from history from the total personal apprehension they might have of life In them speculative theology rediscovered its affinity to neo Platonism in other words Christian philosophy was washed clean of its legendary alloy to become a pure cosmic speculation It was Gnosticism come again in a very different age to men in an opposite phase of culture but with its logic unchanged The creation was the self diremption of the infinite into finite expression the fall was the self discovery of this finitude the incarnation was the awakening of the finite to its essential infinity and here a sufficient number of pages having been engrossed the matter generally hastened to a conclusion for the redemption with its means of application once the central point in Christianity was less pliable to the new pantheistic interpretation Neo Platonism had indeed cultivated asceticism ecstasies and a hope of reabsorption into the One but these things a modern and especially a Teutonic temperament could hardly relish and though absolutism in a sense must discountenance all finite interests and dissolve all experience in theory into a neutral whole yet this inevitable mysticism remained as with the Stoics sternly optimistic in order to respond to the vital social forces which Protestantism embodied The ethical part of neo Platonism and the corresponding Christian doctrine of salvation had accordingly to be discarded for mystical as the northern soul may gladly be in speculation to satisfy its sentimentality it hardly can be mystical in action since it has to satisfy also its interest in success and its fidelity to instinct Sidenote Pantheism accepted An absolutism which thus encourages and sanctions the natural will is Stoical and pantheistic it does not like Indian and Platonic absolutism seek to suspend the will in view of some supernatural destiny Pantheism subordinates morally what it finds to be dependent in existence its religion bids human reason and interest abdicate before cosmic forces instead of standing out like Buddhism and Christianity for salvation for spiritual extrication from a world which they regard as delusive and fallen The world of German absolutism like the Stoic world was not fallen On the contrary it was divinely inspired and altogether authoritative he alone who did not find his place and function in it was unholy and perverse This world worship despising heartily every finite and rational ideal gives to impulse and fact whatever they may be liberty to flourish under a divine warrant Were the people accepting such a system corrupt it would sanction their corruption and thereby most probably lead to its own abandonment for it would bring on an ascetic and supernaturalistic reaction by which its convenient sycophancy would be repudiated But reflection and piety even if their object be material and their worship idolatrous exalt the mind and raise it above vulgar impulse If you fetch from contemplation a theoretic license to be base your contemplative habit itself will have purified you more than your doctrine will have power to degrade you afresh for training affects instinct much more than opinion can Antinomian theory can flourish blamelessly in a puritan soil for there it instinctively remains theoretical And the Teutonic pantheists are for the most part uncontaminated souls puritan by training and only interested in furthering the political and intellectual efficiency of the society in which they live Their pantheism under these circumstances makes them the more energetic and turns them into practical positivists docile to their social medium and apologists for all its conventions So that while they write books to disprove naturalism in natural philosophy where it belongs in morals where naturalism is treason they are themselves naturalists of the most uncritical description forgetting that only the interests of the finite soul introduce such a thing as good and evil into the world and that nature and society are so far from being authoritative and divine that they have no value whatever save by the services they may render to each spirit in its specific and genuine ambitions Sidenote Plainer scorn for the ideal Indeed this pantheistic subordination of conscience to what happens to exist this optimism annulling every human ideal betrays its immoral tendency very clearly so soon as it descends from theological seminaries into the lay world Poets at first begin to justify on its authority their favourite passions and to sing the picturesqueness of a blood stained world Practical men follow deprecating any reflection which may cast a doubt on the providential justification of their chosen activities and on the invisible value of the same however sordid brutal or inane they may visibly be Finally politicians learn to invoke destiny and the movement of the age to save themselves the trouble of discerning rational ends and to colour their secret indifference to the world s happiness The follies thus sanctioned theoretically because they are involved in a perfect world would doubtless be perpetrated none the less by the same persons had they absorbed in youth a different religion for conduct is rooted in deep instincts which affect opinion more than opinion can avail to affect them in turn Yet there is an added indignity in not preserving a clear and honest mind and in quitting the world without having in some measure understood and appreciated it Sidenote The price of mythology is superstition Pantheism is mythical and has as we have just seen all the subversive powers of ordinary superstition It turns the natural world man s stamping ground and system of opportunities into a self justifying and sacred life it endows the blameless giant with an inhuman soul and then worships the monstrous divinity it has fabricated It thereby encounters the same dilemma that defeats all mythology when it forgets its merely poetic office and trespasses upon moral ground It must either interpret the natural world faithfully attributing to the mythical deity the sort of life that dramatically suits its visible behaviour or if it idealises and moralises the spectacle it must renounce the material reality and efficacy of its gods Either the cosmic power must cover the actual goodness and badness in nature impartially when to worship it would be idolatrous or it must cover only the better side of nature those aspects of it which support and resemble human virtue In the latter case it is human virtue that mythology is formulating in a dramatic fiction a human ideal that is being illustrated by a poet who selects for the purpose certain phases of nature and experience By this idealisation the affinity which things often have to man s interests may be brought out in a striking manner but their total and real mechanism is no better represented than that of animals in AEsop s fables To detect the divergence it suffices to open the eyes and while nature may be rationally admired and cherished for so supporting the soul it is her eventual ministry to man that makes her admirable not her independent magnitude or antiquity To worship nature as she really is with all her innocent crimes made intentional by our mythology and her unfathomable constitution turned into a caricature of barbarian passions is to subvert the order of values and to falsify natural philosophy Yet this dislocation of reason both in its conceptions and in its allegiance is the natural outcome of thinking on mythical lines A myth by turning phenomena into expressions of thought and passion teaches man to look for models and goals of action in that external world where reason can find nothing but instruments and materials CHAPTER X PIETY Sidenote The core of religion not theoretical Hebraism is a striking example of a religion tending to discard mythology and magic It was a Hebraising apostle who said that true religion and undefiled was to visit the fatherless and the widow and do other works of mercy Although a complete religion can hardly remain without theoretic and ritual expression we must remember that after all religion has other aspects less conspicuous perhaps than its mythology but often more worthy of respect If religion be as we have assumed an imaginative symbol for the Life of Reason it should contain not only symbolic ideas and rites but also symbolic sentiments and duties And so it everywhere does in a notable fashion Piety and spirituality are phases of religion no less important than mythology or than those metaphysical spectres with which mythology terminates It is therefore time we should quite explicitly turn from religious ideas to religious emotions from imaginative history and science to imaginative morals Piety in its nobler and Roman sense may be said to mean man s reverent attachment to the sources of his being and the steadying of his life by that attachment A soul is but the last bubble of a long fermentation in the world If we wish to live associated with permanent racial interests we must plant ourselves on a broad historic and human foundation we must absorb and interpret the past which has made us so that we may hand down its heritage reinforced if possible and in no way undermined or denaturalised This consciousness that the human spirit is derived and responsible that all its functions are heritages and trusts involves a sentiment of gratitude and duty which we may call piety Sidenote Loyalty to the sources of our being The true objects of piety are of course those on which life and its interests really depend parents first then family ancestors and country finally humanity at large and the whole natural cosmos But had a lay sentiment toward these forces been fostered by clear knowledge of their nature and relation to ourselves the dutifulness or cosmic emotion thereby aroused would have remained purely moral and historical As science would not in the end admit any myth which was not avowed poetry so it would not admit any piety which was not plain reason and duty But man in his perplexities and pressing needs has plunged once for all into imaginative courses through which it is our business to follow him to see if he may not eventually reach his goal even by those by paths and dark circumlocutions Sidenote The pious AEneas What makes piety an integral part of traditional religions is the fact that moral realities are represented in the popular mind by poetic symbols The awe inspired by principles so abstract and consequences so remote and general is arrested at their conventional name We have all read in boyhood perhaps with derision about the pious AEneas His piety may have seemed to us nothing but a feminine sensibility a faculty of shedding tears on slight provocation But in truth AEneas s piety as Virgil or any Roman would have conceived it lay less in his feelings than in his function and vocation He was bearing the Palladium of his country to a new land to found another Troy so that the blood and traditions of his ancestors might not perish His emotions were only the appropriate expression of his priestly office The hero might have been stern and stolid enough on his own martial ground but since he bore the old Anchises from the ruins of Ilium he had assumed a sacred mission Henceforth a sacerdotal unction and lyric pathos belonged rightfully to his person If those embers so religiously guarded should by chance have been extinguished there could never have been a Vestal fire nor any Rome So that all that Virgil and his readers if they had any piety revered in the world had been hazarded in those legendary adventures It was not AEneas s own life or private ambition that was at stake to justify his emotion His tenderness like Virgil s own was ennobled and made heroic by its magnificent and impersonal object It was truly an epic destiny that inspired both poet and hero Sidenote An ideal background required If we look closer however we shall see that mythical and magic elements were requisite to lend this loftiness to the argument Had AEneas not been Venus s son had no prophetic instinct animated him had no Juno been planning the rise of Carthage how could the future destinies of this expedition have been imported into it to lift it above some piratical or desperate venture Colonists passing in our day to America or Australia might conceivably carry with them the seeds of empires as considerable as Rome s But they would go out thinking of their private livelihood and convenience breaking or loosening whatever pious bonds might unite them to the past and quite irresponsibly laying the foundations for an unknown future A poet to raise them to the height of their unwitting function would have to endow them with second sight and a corresponding breadth of soul and purpose He would need in a word heroic figures and supernatural machinery Now what supernatural machinery and heroic figures do for an epic poet piety does for a race It endows it through mythical and magic symbols with something like a vision or representation of its past and future Religion is normally the most traditional and national of things It embodies and localises the racial heritage Commandments of the law feasts and fasts temples and the tombs associated with them are so many foci of communal life so many points for the dissemination of custom The Sabbath which a critical age might justify on hygienic grounds is inconceivable without a religious sanction The craving for rest and emotion expressed itself spontaneously in a practice which as it established itself had to be sanctioned by fables till the recurrent holiday with all its humane and chastening influences came to be established on supernatural authority It was now piety to observe it and to commemorate in it the sacred duties and traditions of the race In this function of course lay its true justification but the mythical one had to be assigned since the diffused prosaic advantages of such a practice would never avail to impose it on irrational wills Indeed to revert to our illustration had AEneas foreseen in detail the whole history of Rome would not his faith in his divine mission have been considerably dashed The reality precious and inestimable as on the whole it was to humanity might well have shocked him by its cruelties shames and disasters He would have wished to found only a perfect nation and a city eternal indeed A want of rationality and measure in the human will that has not learned to prize small betterments and finite but real goods compels it to deceive itself about the rewards of life in order to secure them That celestial mission those heavenly apparitions those incalculable treasures carried through many a storm abused AEEneas s mind in order to nerve him to his real duty Yet his illusion was merely intellectual The mission undertaken was truly worth carrying out Piety thus came to bear the fruits of philanthropy in an age when the love of man was inconceivable A dull and visionary intellect could hit on no other way of justifying a good instinct Sidenote Piety accepts natural conditions and present tasks Sidenote The leadership of instinct is normal Philosophers who harbour illusions about the status of intellect in nature may feel that this leadership of instinct in moral life is a sort of indignity and that to dwell on it so insistently is to prolong satire without wit But the leadership of instinct the conscious expression of mechanism is not merely a necessity in the Life of Reason it is a safeguard Piety in spite of its allegories contains a much greater wisdom than a half enlightened and pert intellect can attain Natural beings have natural obligations and the value of things for them is qualified by distance and by accidental material connections Intellect would tend to gauge things impersonally by their intrinsic values since intellect is itself a sort of disembodied and universal function it would tend to disregard material conditions and that irrational substratum of reason without which reason would have no organs and no points of application Piety on the contrary esteems things apart from their intrinsic worth on account of their relation to the agent s person and fortune Yet such esteem is perfectly rational partiality in man s affections and allegiance being justified by the partial nature and local status of his life Piety is the spirit s acknowledgment of its incarnation So in filial and parental affection which is piety in an elementary form there is a moulding of will and emotion a check to irresponsible initiative in obedience to the facts of animal reproduction Every living creature has an intrinsic and ideal worth he is the centre of actual and yet more of potential interests But this moral value which even the remotest observer must recognise in both parent and child is not the ground of their specific affection for each other which no other mortal is called to feel their regard This affection is based on the incidental and irrational fact that the one has this particular man for a father and the other that particular man for a son Yet considering the animal basis of human life an attachment resting on that circumstance is a necessary and rational attachment This physical bond should not indeed disturb the intellect in its proper function or warp its judgments you should not under guise of tenderness become foolish and attribute to your father or child greater stature or cleverness or goodness than he actually possesses To do so is a natural foible but no part of piety or true loyalty It is one thing to lack a heart and another to possess eyes and a just imagination Indeed piety is never so beautiful and touching never so thoroughly humane and invincible as when it is joined to an impartial intellect conscious of the relativity involved in existence and able to elude through imaginative sympathy the limits set to personal life by circumstance and private duty As a man dies nobly when awaiting his own extinction he is interested to the last in what will continue to be the interests and joys of others so he is most profoundly pious who loves unreservedly a country friends and associations which he knows very well to be not the most beautiful on earth and who being wholly content in his personal capacity with his natural conditions does not need to begrudge other things whatever speculative admiration they may truly deserve The ideal in this polyglot world where reason can receive only local and temporal expression is to understand all languages and to speak but one so as to unite in a manly fashion comprehension with propriety Piety is in a sense pathetic because it involves subordination to physical accident and acceptance of finitude But it is also noble and eminently fruitful because in subsuming a life under the general laws of relativity it meets fate with simple sincerity and labours in accordance with the conditions imposed Since man though capable of abstraction and impartiality is rooted like a vegetable to one point in space and time and exists by limitation piety belongs to the equilibrium of his being It resides so to speak at his centre of gravity at the heart and magnetic focus of his complex endowment It exercises there the eminently sane function of calling thought home It saves speculative and emotional life from hurtful extravagance by keeping it traditional and social Conventional absurdities have at least this advantage that they may be taken conventionally and may come to be in practice mere symbols for their uses Piety is more closely linked with custom than with thought It exercises an irrational suasion moralises by contagion and brings an emotional peace Sidenote Embodiment essential to spirit Patriotism is another form of piety in which its natural basis and rational function may be clearly seen It is right to prefer our own essential to country to all others because we are children and citizens before we can be travellers or philosophers Specific character is a necessary point of origin for universal relations a pure nothing can have no radiation or scope It is no accident for the soul to be embodied her very essence is to express and bring to fruition the body s functions and resources Its instincts make her ideals and its relations her world A native country is a sort of second body another enveloping organism to give the will definition A specific inheritance strengthens the soul Cosmopolitanism has doubtless its place because a man may well cultivate in himself and represent in his nation affinities to other peoples and such assimilation to them as is compatible with personal integrity and clearness of purpose Plasticity to things foreign need not be inconsistent with happiness and utility at home But happiness and utility are possible nowhere to a man who represents nothing and who looks out on the world without a plot of his own to stand on either on earth or in heaven He wanders from place to place a voluntary exile always querulous always uneasy always alone His very criticisms express no ideal His experience is without sweetness without cumulative fruits and his children if he has them are without morality For reason and happiness are like other flowers they wither when plucked Sidenote Piety to the gods takes form from current ideals The object most commonly associated with piety is the gods Popular philosophy inverting the natural order of ideas thinks piety to the gods the source of morality But piety when genuine is rather an incidental expression of morality Its sources are perfectly natural A volitional life that reaches the level of reflection is necessarily moral in proportion to the concreteness and harmony of its instincts The fruits which such harmonious instincts expressed in consciousness may eventually bear fruits which would be the aim of virtue are not readily imaginable and the description of them has long ago been intrusted to poets and mythologists Thus the love of God for example is said to be the root of Christian charity but is in reality only its symbol For no man not having a superabundant need and faculty of loving real things could have given a meaning to the phrase love of God or been moved by it to any action History shows in unequivocal fashion that the God loved shifts his character with the shift in his worshippers real affections What the psalmist loves is the beauty of God s house and the place where his glory dwelleth A priestly quietude and pride a grateful meditative leisure after the storms of sedition and war some retired unity of mind after the contradictions of the world this is what the love of God might signify for the levites Saint John tells us that he who says he loves God and loves not his neighbour is a liar Here the love of God is an anti worldly estimation of things and persons a heart set on that kingdom of heaven in which the humble and the meek should be exalted Again for modern Catholicism the phrase has changed its meaning remarkably and signifies in effect love for Christ s person because piety has taken a sentimental turn and centred on maintaining imaginary personal relations with the Saviour How should we conceive that a single supernatural influence was actually responsible for moral effects themselves so various and producing in spite of a consecutive tradition such various notions concerning their object and supposed source Sidenote The religion of humanity Mankind at large is also to some minds an object of piety But this religion of humanity is rather a desideratum than a fact humanity does not actually appear to anybody in a religious light The nihil homine homini utittus remains a signal truth but the collective influence of men and their average nature are far too mixed and ambiguous to fill the soul with veneration Piety to mankind must be three fourths pity There are indeed specific human virtues but they are those necessary to existence like patience and courage Supported on these indispensable habits mankind always carries an indefinite load of misery and vice Life spreads rankly in every wrong and impracticable direction as well as in profitable paths and the slow and groping struggle with its own ignorance inertia and folly leaves it covered in every age of history with filth and blood It would hardly be possible to exaggerate man s wretchedness if it were not so easy to overestimate his sensibility There is a fond of unhappiness in every bosom but the depths are seldom probed and there is no doubt that sometimes frivolity and sometimes sturdy habit helps to keep attention on the surface and to cover up the inner void Certain moralists without meaning to be satirical often say that the sovereign cure for unhappiness is work Unhappily the work they recommend is better fitted to dull pain than to remove its cause It occupies the faculties without rationalising the life Before mankind could inspire even moderate satisfaction not to speak of worship its whole economy would have to be reformed its reproduction regulated its thoughts cleared up its affections equalised and refined To worship mankind as it is would be to deprive it of what alone makes it akin to the divine its aspiration For this human dust lives this misery and crime are dark in contrast to an imagined excellence they are lighted up by a prospect of good Man is not adorable but he adores and the object of his adoration may be discovered within him and elicited from his own soul In this sense the religion of humanity is the only religion all others being sparks and abstracts of the same The indwelling ideal lends all the gods their divinity No power either physical or psychical has the least moral prerogative nor any just place in religion at all unless it supports and advances the ideal native to the worshipper s soul Without moral society between the votary and his god religion is pure idolatry and even idolatry would be impossible but for the suspicion that somehow the brute force exorcised in prayer might help or mar some human undertaking Sidenote Cosmic piety There is finally a philosophic piety which has the universe for its object This feeling common to ancient and modern Stoics has an obvious justification in man s dependence upon the natural world and in its service to many sides of the mind Such justification of cosmic piety is rather obscured than supported by the euphemisms and ambiguities in which these philosophers usually indulge in their attempt to preserve the customary religious unction For the more they personify the universe and give it the name of God the more they turn it into a devil The universe so far as we can observe it is a wonderful and immense engine its extent its order its beauty its cruelty makes it alike impressive If we dramatise its life and conceive its spirit we are filled with wonder terror and amusement so magnificent is that spirit so prolific inexorable grammatical and dull Like all animals and plants the cosmos has its own way of doing things not wholly rational nor ideally best but patient fatal and fruitful Great is this organism of mud and fire terrible this vast painful glorious experiment Why should we not look on the universe with piety Is it not our substance Are we made of other clay All our possibilities lie from eternity hidden in its bosom It is the dispenser of all our joys We may address it without superstitious terrors it is not wicked It follows its own habits abstractedly it can be trusted to be true to its word Society is not impossible between it and us and since it is the source of all our energies the home of all our happiness shall we not cling to it and praise it seeing that it vegetates so grandly and so sadly and that it is not for us to blame it for what doubtless it never knew that it did Where there is such infinite and laborious potency there is room for every hope If we should abstain from judging a father s errors or a mother s foibles why should we pronounce sentence on the ignorant crimes of the universe which have passed into our own blood The universe is the true Adam the creation the true fall and as we have never blamed our mythical first parent very much in spite of the disproportionate consequences of his sin because we felt that he was but human and that we in his place might have sinned too so we may easily forgive our real ancestor whose connatural sin we are from moment to moment committing since it is only the necessary rashness of venturing to be without fore knowing the price or the fruits of existence CHAPTER XI SPIRITUALITY AND ITS CORRUPTIONS Sidenote To be spiritual is to live in view of the ideal In honouring the sources of life piety is retrospective It collects as it were food for morality and fortifies it with natural and historic nutriment But a digestive and formative principle must exist to assimilate this nutriment a direction and an ideal have to be imposed on these gathered forces So that religion has a second and a higher side which looks to the end toward which we move as piety looks to the conditions of progress and to the sources from which we draw our energies This aspiring side of religion may be called Spirituality Spirituality is nobler than piety because what would fulfil our being and make it worth having is what alone lends value to that being s source Nothing can be lower or more wholly instrumental than the substance and cause of all things The gift of existence would be worthless unless existence was good and supported at least a possible happiness A man is spiritual when he lives in the presence of the ideal and whether he eat or drink does so for the sake of a true and ultimate good He is spiritual when he envisages his goal so frankly that his whole material life becomes a transparent and transitive vehicle an instrument which scarcely arrests attention but allows the spirit to use it economically and with perfect detachment and freedom There is no need that this ideal should be pompously or mystically described A simple life is its own reward and continually realises its function Though a spiritual man may perfectly well go through intricate processes of thought and attend to very complex affairs his single eye fixed on a rational purpose will simplify morally the natural chaos it looks upon and will remain free This spiritual mastery is of course no slashing and forced synthesis of things into a system of philosophy which even if it were thinkable would leave the conceived logical machine without ideality and without responsiveness to actual interests it is rather an inward aim and fixity in affection that knows what to take and what to leave in a world over which it diffuses something of its own peace It threads its way through the landscape with so little temptation to distraction that it can salute every irrelevant thing as Saint Francis did the sun and moon with courtesy and a certain affectionate detachment Sidenote Spirituality natural Spirituality likes to say Behold the lilies of the field For its secret has the same simplicity as their vegetative art only spirituality has succeeded in adding consciousness without confusing instinct This success unfortunately so rare in man s life as to seem paradoxical is its whole achievement Spirituality ought to have been a matter of course since conscious existence has inherent value and there is no intrinsic ground why it should smother that value in alien ambitions and servitudes But spirituality though so natural and obvious a thing is subject like the lilies beauty to corruption I know not what army of microbes evidently invaded from the beginning the soul s physical basis and devoured its tissues so that sophistication and bad dreams entirely obscured her limpidity None the less spirituality or life in the ideal must be regarded as the fundamental and native type of all life what deviates from it is disease and incipient dissolution and is itself what might plausibly demand explanation and evoke surprise The spiritual man should be quite at home in a world made to be used the firmament is spread over him like a tent for habitation and sublunary furniture is even more obviously to be taken as a convenience He cannot indeed remove mountains but neither does he wish to do so He comes to endow the mountains with a function and takes them at that as a painter might take his brushes and canvas Their beauty their metals their pasturage their defence this is what he observes in them and celebrates in his addresses to them The spiritual man though not ashamed to be a beggar is cognisant of what wealth can do and of what it cannot His unworldliness is true knowledge of the world not so much a gaping and busy acquaintance as a quiet comprehension and estimation which while it cannot come without intercourse can very well lay intercourse aside Sidenote Primitive consciousness may be spiritual If the essence of life be spiritual early examples of life would seem to be rather the opposite But man s view of primitive consciousness is humanly biassed and relies too much on partial analogies We conceive an animal s physical life in the gross and must then regard the momentary feelings that accompany it as very poor expressions either of its extent or conditions These feelings are indeed so many ephemeral lives containing no comprehensive view of the animal s fortunes They accordingly fail to realise our notion of a spiritual human life which would have to be rational and to form some representation of man s total environment and interests But it hardly follows that animal feelings are not spiritual in their nature and on their narrow basis perfectly ideal The most ideal human passion is love which is also the most absolute and animal and one of the most ephemeral Very likely if we could revert to an innocent and absorbed view of our early sensations we should find that each was a little spiritual universe like Dante s with its internal hell purgatory and heaven Cut off as those experiences were from all vistas and from sympathy with things remote they would contain a closed circle of interests a flying glimpse of eternity So an infant living in his mystical limbo without trailing in a literal sense any clouds of glory from elsewhere might well repeat on a diminutive scale the beatific vision insomuch as the only function of which he was conscious at all might be perfectly fulfilled by him and felt in its ideal import Sucking and blinking are ridiculous processes perhaps but they may bring a thrill and satisfaction no less ideal than do the lark s inexhaustible palpitations Narrow scope and low representative value are not defects in a consciousness having a narrow physical basis and comparatively simple conditions Sidenote Spirit crossed by instrumentalities The spirit s foe in man has not been simplicity but sophistication His instincts in becoming many became confused and in growing permanent grew feeble and subject to arrest and deviation Nature we may say threw the brute form back into her cauldron to smelt its substance again before pouring it into a rational mould The docility which instinct in its feebleness acquired in the new creature was to be reason s opportunity but before the larger harmony could be established a sorry chaos was bound to reign in the mind Every peeping impulse would drop its dark hint and hide its head in confusion while some pedantic and unjust law would be passed in its absence and without its vote Secondary activities which should always be representative would establish themselves without being really such Means would be pursued as if they were ends and ends under the illusion that they were forces would be expected to further some activity itself without justification So pedantry might be substituted for wisdom tyranny for government superstition for morals rhetoric for art This sophistication is what renders the pursuit of reason so perplexing and prolonged a problem Half formed adjustments in the brain and in the body politic are represented in consciousness by what are called passions prejudices motives animosities None of these felt ebullitions in the least understands its own causes effects or relations but is hatched so to speak on the wing and flutters along in the direction of its momentary preference until it lapses it knows not why or is crossed and overwhelmed by some contrary power Thus the vital elements which in their comparative isolation in the lower animals might have yielded simple little dramas each with its obvious ideal its achievement and its quietus when mixed in the barbarous human will make a boisterous medley For they are linked enough together to feel a strain but not knit enough to form a harmony In this way the unity of apperception seems to light up at first nothing but disunion The first dawn of that rational principle which involves immortality breaks upon a discovery of death The consequence is that ideality seems to man something supernatural and almost impossible He finds himself at his awakening so confused that he puts chaos at the origin of the world But only order can beget a world or evoke a sensation Chaos is something secondary composed of conflicting organisations interfering with one another It is compounded like a common noise out of jumbled vibrations each of which has its period and would in itself be musical The problem is to arrange these sounds naturally so tuneful into concerted music So long as total discord endures human life remains spasmodic and irresolute it can find no ideal and admit no total representation of nature Only when the disordered impulses and perceptions settle down into a trained instinct a steady vital response and adequate preparation for the world do clear ideas and successful purposes arise in the mind The Life of Reason with all the arts then begins its career The forces at play in this drama are first the primary impulses and functions represented by elementary values second the thin network of signals and responses by which those functions are woven into a total organ represented by discursive thought and all secondary mental figments and third the equilibrium and total power of that new organism in action represented by the ideal Spirituality which might have resided in the elementary values sensuous or passionate before the relational process supervened can now exist only in the ultimate activity to which these processes are instrumental Obstacles to spirituality in human life may accordingly take the form of an arrest either at the elementary values an entanglement in sense and passion or at the instrumental processes an entanglement in what in religious parlance is called the world Sidenote One foe of the spirit is worldliness Worldly minds bristle with conventional morality though in private they may nurse a vice or two to appease wayward nature and they are rational in everything except first principles They consider the voluptuary a weak fool disgraced and disreputable and if they notice the spiritual man at all for he is easily ignored they regard him as a useless and visionary fellow Civilisation has to work algebraically with symbols for known and unknown quantities which only in the end resume their concrete values so that the journeymen and vulgar middlemen of the world know only conventional goods They are lost in instrumentalities and are themselves only instruments in the Life of Reason Wealth station fame success of some notorious and outward sort make their standard of happiness Their chosen virtues are industry good sense probity conventional piety and whatever else has acknowledged utility and seemliness Sidenote The case for and against pleasure In its strictures on pleasure and reverie this Philistia is perfectly right Sensuous living and I do not mean debauchery alone but the palpitations of any poet without art or any mystic without discipline is not only inconsequential and shallow but dangerous to honour and to sincere happiness When life remains lost in sense or reverts to it entirely humanity itself is atrophied And humanity is tormented and spoilt when as more often happens a man disbelieving in reason and out of humour with his world abandons his soul to loose whimseys and passions that play a quarrelsome game there like so many ill bred children Nevertheless compared with the worldling s mental mechanism and rhetoric the sensualist s soul is a well of wisdom He lives naturally on an animal level and attains a kind of good He has free and concrete pursuits though they be momentary and he has sincere satisfactions He is less often corrupt than primitive and even when corrupt he finds some justification for his captious existence He harvests pleasures as he goes which intrinsically as we have seen may have the depth and ideality which nature breathes in all her oracles His experience for that reason though disastrous is interesting and has some human pathos it is easier to make a saint out of a libertine than out of a prig True the libertine is pursued like the animals by unforeseen tortures decay and abandonment and he is vowed to a total death but in these respects the worldly man has hardly an advantage The Babels he piles up may indeed survive his person but they are themselves vain and without issue while his brief life has been meantime spent in slavery and his mind cramped with cant and foolish ambitions The voluptuary is like some roving creature browsing on nettles and living by chance the worldling is like a beast of burden now ill used and over worked now fatted stalled and richly caparisoned AEsop might well have described their relative happiness in a fable about the wild ass and the mule Sidenote Upshot of worldly wisdom Thus even if the voluptuary is sometimes a poet and the worldling often an honest man they both lack reason so entirely that reflection revolts equally against the life of both Vanity vanity is their common epitaph Now at the soul s christening and initiation into the Life of Reason the first vow must always be to renounce the pomps and vanities of this wicked world A person to whom this means nothing is one to whom in the end nothing has meaning He has not conceived a highest good no ultimate goal is within his horizon and it has never occurred to him to ask what he is living for With all his pompous soberness the worldly man is fundamentally frivolous with all his maxims and cant estimations he is radically inane He conforms to religion without suspecting what religion means not being in the least open to such an inquiry He judges art like a parrot without having ever stopped to evoke an image He preaches about service and duty without any recognition of natural demands or any standard of betterment His moral life is one vast anacoluthon in which the final term is left out that might have given sense to the whole one vast ellipsis in which custom seems to bridge the chasm left between ideas He denies the values of sense because they tempt to truancies from mechanical activity the values of reason he necessarily ignores because they lie beyond his scope He adheres to conventional maxims and material quantitative standards his production is therefore as far as he himself is concerned an essential waste and his activity an essential tedium If at least like the sensualist he enjoyed the process and expressed his fancy in his life there would be something gained and this sort of gain though over looked in the worldling s maxims all of which have a categorical tone is really what often lends his life some propriety and spirit Business and war and any customary task may come to form so to speak an organ whose natural function will be just that operation and the most abstract and secondary activity like that of adding figures or reading advertisements may in this way become the one function proper to some soul There are Nibelungen dwelling by choice underground and happy pedants in the upper air Facts are not wanting for these pillars of society to take solace in if they wish to defend their philosophy The time will come astronomers say when life will be extinct upon this weary planet All the delights of sense and imagination will be over It is these that will have turned out to be vain But the masses of matter which the worldlings have transformed with their machinery and carried from one place to another will remain to bear witness of them The collocation of atoms will never be what it would have been if their feet had less continually beaten the earth They may have the proud happiness of knowing that when nothing that the spirit values endures the earth may still sometimes because of them cast a slightly different shadow across the moon s craters Sidenote Two supposed escapes from vanity There is no more critical moment in the life of a man and a nation than that in which they are first conscience stricken and convicted of vanity Failure exhaustion confusion of aims or whatever else it be that causes a revulsion brings them before a serious dilemma Has the vanity of life hitherto been essential or incidental Are we to look for a new ambition free from all the illusions of natural impulse or are we rather to renounce all will indiscriminately and fall back upon conformity and consummate indifference As this question is answered in one way or the other two different types of unworldly religion arise Sidenote fanaticism The first which heralds a new and unimpeachable special hope a highest duty finally recognised and driving out all lesser motives and satisfactions from the soul refers vanity to perversity to error to a sort of original misunderstanding of our own nature which has led us in pursuing our worldly interests to pursue in truth our own destruction The vanity of life according to this belief has been accidental The taint of existence is not innate vanity but casual sin what has misled us is not the will in general but only the false and ignorant direction of a will not recognising its only possible satisfaction What religion in this case opposes to the world is a special law a special hope a life intense ambitious and aggressive but excluding much which to an ingenuous will might seem excellent and tempting Worldliness in a word is here met by fanaticism Sidenote and mysticism The second type of unworldly religion does not propose to overwhelm the old Adam by singleminded devotion to one selected interest nor does it refer vanity to an accidental error On the contrary it conceives that any special interest any claim made by a finite and mortal creature upon an infinite world is bound to be defeated It is not special acts it conceives which are sinful but action and will themselves that are intrinsically foolish The cure lies in rescinding the passionate interests that torment us not in substituting for them another artificial passion more imperious and merciless than the natural passions it comes to devour This form of religion accordingly meets worldliness with mysticism Holiness is not placed in conformity to a prescriptive law in pursuit of a slightly regenerated bliss nor in advancing a special institution and doctrine Holiness for the mystic consists rather in universal mildness and insight in freedom from all passion bias and illusion in a disembodied wisdom which accepts the world dominates its labyrinths and is able to guide others through it without pursuing for its own part any hope or desire Sidenote Both are irrational If these two expedients of the conscience convicted of vanity were to be subjected to a critical judgment they would both be convicted of vanity themselves The case of fanaticism is not doubtful for the choice it makes of a special law or institution or posthumous hope is purely arbitrary and only to be justified by the satisfaction it affords to those very desires which it boasts to supplant An oracular morality or revealed religion can hope to support its singular claims only by showing its general conformity to natural reason and its perfect beneficence in the world Where such justification is wanting the system fanatically embraced is simply an epidemic mania a social disease for the philosopher to study and if possible to cure Every strong passion tends to dislodge the others so that fanaticism may often involve a certain austerity impetuosity and intensity of life This vigour however is seldom lasting fanaticism dries its own roots and becomes when traditionally established a convention as arbitrary as any fashion and the nest for a new brood of mean and sinister habits The Pharisee is a new worldling only his little world is narrowed to a temple a tribe and a clerical tradition Mysticism as its meditative nature comports is never so pernicious nor can it be brought so easily round to worldliness again That its beneficent element is purely natural and inconsistent with a denial of will we shall have occasion elsewhere to observe Suffice it here to point out that even if a moral nihilism could be carried through and all definite interests abandoned the vanity of life would not be thereby corrected but merely exposed When our steps had been retraced to the very threshold of being nothing better worth doing would have been discovered on the way That to suffer illusion is a bad thing might ordinarily be taken for an axiom because ordinarily we assume that true knowledge and rational volition are possible but if this assumption is denied the value of retracting illusions is itself impeached When vanity is represented as universal and salvation as purely negative every one is left free to declare that it is vain to renounce vanity and sinful to seek salvation This result fantastic though it may at first sight appear is one which mysticism actually comes to under certain circumstances Absolute pessimism and absolute optimism are opposite sentiments attached to a doctrine identically the same In either case no improvement is possible and the authority of human ideals is denied To escape to stanch natural wounds to redeem society and the private soul are then mistaken and pitiable ambitions adding to their vanity a certain touch of impiety One who really believes that the world s work is all providentially directed and that whatever happens no matter how calamitous or shocking happens by divine right has a quietistic excuse for license to check energy by reason and seek to limit and choose its path seems to him a puny rebellion against omnipotence which works through madness and crime in man no less than through cataclysms in outer nature Every particular desire is vain and bound perhaps to be defeated but the mystic when caught in the expansive mood accepts this defeat itself as needful Thus a refusal to discriminate rationally or to accept human interests as the standard of right may culminate in a convulsive surrender to passion just as when caught in the contractile phase the same mysticism may lead to universal abstention Sidenote Is there a third course Must unworldliness be either fanatical or mystical That is a question of supreme importance to the moral philosopher On the answer to it hangs the rationality of a spiritual life nay the existence of spirituality itself among the types of human activity For the fanatic and mystic are only spiritual in appearance because they separate themselves from the prevalent interests of the world the one by a special persistent aggression the other by a general passivity and unearthly calm The fanatic is notwithstanding nothing but a worldling too narrow and violent to understand the world while the mystic is a sensualist too rapt and voluptuous to rationalise his sensations Both represent arrested forms of common sense partial developments of a perfectly usual sensibility There is no divine inspiration in having only one passion left nor in dreamfully accepting or renouncing all the passions together Spirituality if identified with such types might justly be called childish There is an innocent and incredulous childishness with its useless eyes wide open just as there is a malevolent and peevish childishness eaten up with some mischievous whim The man of experience and affairs can very quickly form an opinion on such phenomena He has no reason to expect superior wisdom in those quarters On the contrary his own customary political and humane standpoint gives him the only authoritative measure of their merits and possible uses These sectaries and dreamers he will say to himself cannot understand one another nor the role they themselves play in society It is for us to make the best of them we can taking such prudent measures as are possible to enlist the forces they represent in works of common utility Sidenote Yes for experience has intrinsic inalienable values The philosopher s task in these premisses is to discover an escape from worldliness which shall offer a rational advance over it such as fanaticism and mysticism cannot afford Does the Life of Reason differ from that of convention Is there a spirituality really wiser than common sense That there is appears in many directions Worldliness is arrest and absorption in the instrumentalities of life but instrumentalities cannot exist without ultimate purposes and it suffices to lift the eyes to those purposes and to question the will sincerely about its essential preferences to institute a catalogue of rational goods by pursuing any of which we escape worldliness Sense itself is one of these goods The sensualist at least is not worldly and though his nature be atrophied in all its higher part there is not lacking as we have seen a certain internal and abstract spirituality in his experience He is a sort of sprightly and incidental mystic treating his varied succession of little worlds as the mystic does his monotonous universe Sense moreover is capable of many refinements by which physical existence becomes its own reward In the disciplined play of fancy which the fine arts afford the mind s free action justifies itself and becomes intrinsically delightful Science not only exercises in itself the intellectual powers but assimilates nature to the mind so that all things may nourish it In love and friendship the liberal life extends also to the heart All these interests which justify themselves by their intrinsic fruits make so many rational episodes and patches in conventional life but it must be confessed in all candour that these are but oases in the desert and that as the springs of life are irrational so its most vehement and prevalent interests remain irrational to the end When the pleasures of sense and art of knowledge and sympathy are stretched to the utmost what part will they cover and justify of our passions our industry our governments our religion It was a signal error in those rationalists who attributed their ideal retrospectively to nature that they grotesquely imagined that people were hungry so that they might enjoy eating or curious in order to delight in discovering the truth or in love the better to live in conscious harmony Such a view forgets that all the forces of life work originally and fundamentally a tergo that experience and reason are not the ground of preference but its result In order to live men will work disproportionately and eat all manner of filth without pleasure curiosity as often as not leads to illusion and argument serves to foster hatred of the truth finally love is notoriously a great fountain of bitterness and frequently a prelude to crime and death When we have skimmed from life its incidental successes when we have harvested the moments in which existence justifies itself its profound depths remain below in their obscure commotion depths that breed indeed a rational efflorescence but which are far from exhausted in producing it and continually threaten on the contrary to engulf it Sidenote For these the religious imagination must supply an ideal standard The spiritual man needs therefore something more than a cultivated sympathy with the brighter scintillation of things He needs to refer that scintillation to some essential light so that in reviewing the motley aspects of experience he may not be reduced to culling superciliously the flowers that please him but may view in them all only images and varied symbols of some eternal good Spirituality has never flourished apart from religion except momentarily perhaps in some master mind whose original intuitions at once became a religion to his followers For it is religion that knows how to interpret the casual rationalities in the world and isolate their principle setting this principle up in the face of nature as nature s standard and model This ideal synthesis of all that is good this consciousness that over earth floats its congenial heaven this vision of perfection which gilds beauty and sanctifies grief has taken form for the most part in such grossly material images in a mythology so opaque and pseudo physical that its ideal and moral essence has been sadly obscured nevertheless every religion worthy of the name has put into its gods some element of real goodness something by which they become representative of those scattered excellences and self justifying bits of experience in which the Life of Reason consists That happy constitution which human life has at its best moments that says Aristotle the divine life has continually The philosopher thus expressed with absolute clearness the principle which the poets had been clumsily trying to embody from the beginning Burdened as traditional faiths might be with cosmological and fanciful matter they still presented in a conspicuous and permanent image that which made all good things good the ideal and standard of all excellence By the help of such symbols the spiritual man could steer and steady his judgment he could say according to the form religion had taken in his country that the truly good was what God commanded or what made man akin to the divine or what led the soul to heaven Such expressions though taken more or less literally by a metaphysical intellect did not wholly forfeit their practical and moral meaning God for a long time was understood to command what in fact was truly important the divine was long the truly noble and beautiful heaven hardly ever ceased to respond to impersonal and ideal aspirations Under those figures therefore the ideals of life could confront life with clearness and authority The spiritual man fixing his eyes on them could live in the presence of ultimate purposes and ideal issues Before each immediate task each incidental pleasure each casual success he could retain his sweetness and constancy accepting what good these moments brought and laying it on the altar of what they ought to bring CHAPTER XII CHARITY Sidenote Possible tyranny of reason Those whom a genuine spirituality has freed from the foolish enchantment of words and conventions and brought back to a natural ideal have still another illusion to vanquish one into which the very concentration and deepening of their life might lead them This illusion is that they and their chosen interests alone are important or have a legitimate place in the moral world Having discovered what is really good for themselves they assume that the like is good for everybody Having made a tolerable synthesis and purification of their own natures they require every other nature to be composed of the same elements similarly combined What they have vanquished in themselves they disregard in others and the consequence sometimes is that an impossibly simplified and inconsiderate regimen is proposed to mankind altogether unrepresentative of their total interests Spiritual men in a word may fall into the aristocrat s fallacy they may forget the infinite animal and vulgar life which remains quite disjointed impulsive and short winded but which nevertheless palpitates with joys and sorrows and makes after all the bulk of moral values in this democratic world Sidenote Everything has its rights After adopting an ideal it is necessary therefore without abandoning it to recognise its relativity The right path is in such a matter rather difficult to keep to On the one hand lies fanatical insistence on an ideal once arrived at no matter how many instincts and interests the basis of all ideals are thereby outraged in others and ultimately also in one s self On the other hand lies mystical disintegration which leads men to feel so keenly the rights of everything in particular and of the All in general that they retain no hearty allegiance to any human interest Between these two abysses winds the narrow path of charity and valour The ultimate ideal is absolutely authoritative because if any ground were found to relax allegiance to it in any degree or for any consideration that ground would itself be the ideal found to be more nearly absolute and ultimate than the one hastily so called which it corrected The ultimate ideal in order to maintain its finality and preclude the possibility of an appeal which should dislodge it from its place of authority must have taken all interests into consideration it must be universally representative Now to take an interest into consideration and represent it means to intend as far as possible to secure the particular good which that particular interest looks to and never whatever measures may be adopted to cease to look back on the elementary impulse as upon something which ought if possible to have been satisfied and which we should still go back and satisfy now if circumstances and the claims of rival interests permitted Justice and charity are identical To deny the initial right of any impulse is not morality but fanaticism However determined may be the prohibition which reason opposes to some wild instinct that prohibition is never reckless it is never inconsiderate of the very impulse which it suppresses It suppresses that impulse unwillingly pitifully under stress of compulsion and force majeure for reason in representing this impulse in the context of life and in relation to every other impulse which in its operation it would affect mechanically rejects and condemns it but it condemns it not by antecedent hate but by supervening wisdom The texture of the natural world the conflict of interests in the soul and in society all of which cannot be satisfied together is accordingly the ground for moral restrictions and compromises Whatever the up shot of the struggle may be whatever the verdict pronounced by reason the parties to the suit must in justice all be heard and heard sympathetically Sidenote Primary and secondary morality Herein lies the great difference between first hand and second hand morality The retailers of moral truth the town criers that go shouting in the streets some sentence passed long ago in reason s court against some inadmissible desire know nothing of justice or mercy or reason three principles essentially identical They thunder conclusions without remembering the premisses and expose their precepts daily of course grown more thin and unrepresentative to the aversion and neglect of all who genuinely love what is good The masters of life on the contrary the first framers and discoverers of moral ideals are persons who disregard those worn conventions and their professional interpreters they are persons who have a fresh sense for the universal need and cry of human souls and reconstruct the world of duty to make it fit better with the world of desire and of possible happiness Primary morality inspired by love of something naturally good is accordingly charitable and ready to forgive while secondary morality founded on prejudice is fanatical and ruthless Sidenote Uncharitable pagan justice is not just As virtue carries with it a pleasure which perfects it and without which virtue would evidently be spurious and merely compulsory so justice carries with it a charity which is its highest expression without which justice remains only an organised wrong Of justice without charity we have a classic illustration in Plato s Republic and in general in the pagan world An end is assumed in this case an end which involves radical injustice toward every interest not included in it and then an organism is developed or conceived that shall subserve that end and political justice is defined as the harmonious adjustment of powers and functions within that organism Reason and art suffice to discover the right methods for reaching the chosen end and the polity thus established with all its severities and sacrifices of personal will is rationally grounded The chosen end however is arbitrary and in fact perverse for to maintain a conventional city with stable institutions and perpetual military efficiency would not secure human happiness nor to pass to the individual virtue symbolised by such a state would the corresponding discipline of personal habits in the service of vested interests and bodily life truly unfold the potentialities of the human spirit Plato himself in passing acknowledges that his political ideal is secondary and not ideal at all since only luxury corruption and physical accidents make a military state necessary but his absorption in current Greek questions made him neglect the initial question of all namely how a non military and non competitive state might be established or rather how the remedial functions of the state might be forestalled by natural justice and rendered unnecessary The violence which such a fallen ideal with its iniquitous virtues does to humanity appeared only too clearly in the sequel when Platonism took refuge in the supernatural The whole pagan world was convicted of injustice and the cities for whose glory the greatest heroes had lived and died were abandoned with horror Only in a catacomb or a hermitage did there seem to be any room for the soul This revulsion perverse in its own way expressed rightly enough the perversity of that unjust justice those worldly and arbitrary virtues and that sad happiness which had enslaved the world Sidenote The doom of ancient republics Plato could never have answered the question whether his Republic had a right to exist and to brush aside all other commonwealths he could never have justified the ways of man to the rest of creation nor what is more pertinent to man s more plastic and tenderer imagination The initial impulses on which his Republic is founded which make war defensive and aggressive the first business of the state are not irresistible impulses they do not correspond to ultimate ends Physical life cannot justify itself it cannot be made the purpose of those rational faculties which it generates these on the contrary are its own end The purpose of war must be peace the purpose of competition a more general prosperity the purpose of personal life ideal achievements A polity which should not tend to abolish private lusts competition and war would be an irrational polity The organisation which the ancients insisted on within each state the sacrifices they imposed on each class in the community for the general welfare have to be repeated in that greater commonwealth of which cities and nations are citizens for their own existence and prosperity depends on conciliating inwardly all that may affect them and turning foreign forces when contact with them is inevitable into friends Duty and company operation must extend as far as do physical bonds the function of reason being to bring life into harmony with its conditions so as to render it self perpetuating and free This end can never be attained while the scope of moral fellowship is narrower than that of physical interplay Ancient civilisation brilliant in proportion to its inner integration was brief in proportion to its outer injustice By defying the external forces on which also a commonwealth depends those commonwealths came to premature extinction Sidenote Rational charity There is accordingly a justice deeper and milder than that of pagan states a universal justice called charity a kind of all penetrating courtesy by which the limits of personal or corporate interests are transgressed in imagination Value is attributed to rival forms of life something of the intensity and narrowness inherent in the private will is surrendered to admiration and solicitude for what is most alien and hostile to one s self When this imaginative expansion ends in neutralising the will altogether we have mysticism but when it serves merely to company ordinate felt interests with other actual interests conceived sympathetically and to make them converge we have justice and charity Charity is nothing but a radical and imaginative justice So the Buddhist stretches his sympathy to all real beings and to many imaginary monsters so the Christian chooses for his love the diseased the sinful the unlovely His own salvation does not seem to either complete unless every other creature also is redeemed and forgiven Sidenote Its limits Such universal solicitude is rational however only when the beings to which it extends are in practical efficient relations with the life that would company operate with theirs In other words charity extends only to physical and discoverable creatures whose destiny is interwoven dynamically with our own Absolute and irresponsible fancy can be the basis of no duty If not to take other real forces and interests into account made classic states unstable and unjust to take into consideration purely imaginary forces yields a polity founded on superstition one unjust to those who live under it A compromise made with non existent or irrelevant interests is a wrong to the real interests on which that sacrifice is imposed gratuitously All sacrifices exacted by mere religion have accordingly been inhuman at best they have unintentionally made some amends by affording abstract discipline or artistic forms of expression The sacrifice must be fruitful in the end and bring happiness to somebody otherwise it cannot long remain tender or beautiful Sidenote Its mythical supports Charity is seldom found uncoloured by fables which illustrate it and lend it a motive by which it can justify itself verbally Metempsychosis heaven and hell Christ s suffering for every sinner are notions by which charity has often been guided and warmed Like myth everywhere these notions express judgments which they do not originate although they may strengthen or distort them in giving them expression The same myths in cruel hands become goads to fanaticism That natural sensitiveness in which charity consists has many degrees and many inequalities the spirit bloweth where it listeth Incidental circumstances determine its phases and attachments in life Christian charity for instance has two chief parts first it hastens to relieve the body then forgetting physical economy altogether it proceeds to redeem the soul The bodily works of mercy which Christians perform with so much tact and devotion are not such as philanthropy alone would inspire they are more and less than that They are more because they are done with a certain disproportionate and absolute solicitude quite apart from ultimate benefit or a thought of the best distribution of energies they are also less because they stop at healing and cannot pass beyond the remedial and incidental phase without ceasing to be Christian The poor says Christian charity we have always with us every man must be a sinner else what obligation should he have to repent and in fine this world is essentially the kingdom of Satan Charity comes only to relieve the most urgent bodily needs and then to wean the heart altogether from mortal interests Thus Christianity covers the world with hospitals and orphanages but its only positive labours go on in churches and convents nor will it found schools if left to itself to teach anything except religion These offices may be performed with more or less success with more or less appeal to the miraculous but with whatever mixture of magic and policy Christian charity has never aimed at anything but healing the body and saving the soul Sidenote There is intelligence in charity Christ himself we may well feel did not affect publicans and sinners ignorant people and children in order to save them in the regimental and prescriptive fashion adopted by the Church He commanded those he forgave to sin no more and those he healed to go as custom would have it to the priest He understood the bright good that each sinner was following when he stumbled into the pit For this insight he was loved To be rebuked in that sympathetic spirit was to be comforted to be punished by such a hand was to be made whole The Magdalene was forgiven because she had loved much an absolution which rehabilitates the primary longing that had driven her on a longing not insulted but comprehended in such an absolution and purified by that comprehension It is a charitable salvation which enables the newly revealed deity to be absolutely loved Charity has this art of making men abandon their errors without asking them to forget their ideals Sidenote Buddhist and Christian forms of it In Buddhism the same charity wears a more speculative form All beings are to be redeemed from the illusion which is the fountain of their troubles None is to be compelled to assume irrationally an alien set of duties or other functions than his own Spirit is not to be incarcerated perpetually in grotesque and accidental monsters but to be freed from all fatality and compulsion The goal is not some more flattering incarnation but escape from incarnation altogether Ignorance is to be enlightened passion calmed mistaken destiny revoked only what the inmost being desiderates only what can really quiet the longings embodied in any particular will is to occupy the redeemed mind Here though creative reason is wholly wanting charity is truly understood for it avails little to make of kindness a vicarious selfishness and to use neighbourly offices to plunge our neighbour deeper into his favourite follies Such servile sympathy would make men one another s accomplices rather than friends It would treat them with a weak promiscuous favour not with true mercy and justice In charity there can be nothing to repent of as there so often is in natural love and in partisan propaganda Christians have sometimes interpreted charity as zeal to bring men into their particular fold or at other times when enthusiasm for doctrine and institutes has cooled they have interpreted charity to be mere blind company operation no matter in what The Buddhists seem to have shown a finer sense in their ministry knowing how to combine universal sympathy with perfect spirituality There was no brow beating in their call to conversion no new tyranny imposed of sanctioned by their promised deliverance If they could not rise to a positive conception of natural life this inability but marks the well known limitations of Oriental fancy which has never been able to distinguish steadily that imagination which rests on and expresses material life from that which in its import breaks loose from the given conditions of life altogether and is therefore monstrous and dreamful But at least Buddhism knew how to sound the heart and pierce to the genuine principles of happiness and misery If it did not venture to interpret reason positively it at least forbore to usurp its inward and autonomous authority and did not set up in the name of salvation some new partiality some new principle of distress and illusion In destroying worldliness this religion avoided imposture The clearing it made in the soul was soon overgrown again by the inexorable Indian jungle but had a virile intellect been at hand it would have been free to raise something solid and rational in the space so happily swept clean of all accumulated rubbish Sidenote Apparent division of the spiritual and the natural Against avarice lust and rancour against cruel and vain national ambitions tenderer and more recollected minds have always sought some asylum but they have the seldom possessed enough knowledge of nature and of human life to distinguish clearly the genuine and innocent goods which they longed for and their protest against the world has too often taken on a mystical and irrational accent Charity for instance in its profounder deliverances has become a protest against the illusion of personality whereby existence and action seem to be wholly condemned after their principle has been identified with selfishness An artificial puzzle is thus created the same concept selfishness or an irrational partiality and injustice in the will being applied to two principles of action the one wrong and the other necessary Every man is necessarily the seat of his own desires which if truly fulfilled would bring him satisfaction but the objects in which that satisfaction may be found and the forces that must company operate to secure it lie far afield and his life will remain cramped and self destructive so long as he does not envisage its whole basis and company operate with all his potential allies The rationality which would then be attained is so immensely exalted above the microscopic vision and punctiform sensibility of those who think themselves practical that speculative natures seem to be proclaiming another set of interests another and quite miraculous life when they attempt to thaw out and vivify the vulgar mechanism and the sense of estrangement and contradiction often comes over the spiritually minded themselves making them confess sadly that the kingdom of heaven is not of this world As common morality itself falls easily into mythical expressions and speaks of a fight between conscience and nature reason and the passions as if these were independent in their origin or could be divided in their operation so spiritual life even more readily opposes the ideal to the real the revealed and heavenly truth to the extant reality as if the one could be anything but an expression and fulfilment of the other Being equal convinced that spiritual life is authoritative and possible and that it is opposed to all that earthly experience has as yet supplied the prophet almost inevitably speaks of another world above the clouds and another existence beyond the grave he thus seeks to clothe in concrete and imaginable form the ideal to which natural existence seems to him wholly rebellious Spiritual life comes to mean life abstracted from politics from art from sense even in the end from morality Natural motives and natural virtues are contrasted with those which are henceforth called supernatural and all the grounds and sanctions of right living are transferred to another life A doctrine of immortality thus becomes the favourite expression of religion By its variations and greater or less transparency and ideality we can measure the degree of spiritual insight which has been reached at any moment CHAPTER XIII THE BELIEF IN A FUTURE LIFE Sidenote The length of life a subject for natural science At no point are the two ingredients of religion superstition and moral truth more often confused than in the doctrine of immortality yet in none are they more clearly distinguishable Ideal immortality is a principle revealed to insight it is seen by observing the eternal quality of ideas and validities and the affinity to them native to reason or the cognitive energy of mind A future life on the contrary is a matter for faith or presumption it is a prophetic hypothesis regarding occult existences This latter question is scientific and empirical and should be treated as such A man is forensically speaking the same man after the nightly break in his consciousness After many changes in his body and after long oblivion parcels of his youth may be revived and may come to figure again among the factors in his action Similarly if evidence to that effect were available we might establish the resurrection of a given soul in new bodies or its activity in remote places and times Evidence of this sort has in fact always been offered copiously by rumour and superstition The operation of departed spirits like that of the gods has been recognised in many a dream or message or opportune succour The Dioscuri and Saint James the Apostle have appeared preferably on white horses in sundry battles Spirits duly invoked have repeated forgotten gossip and revealed the places where crimes had been committed or treasure buried More often perhaps ghosts have walked the night without any ostensible or useful purpose apparently in obedience to some ghastly compulsion that crept over them in death as if a hesitating sickle had left them still hanging to life by one attenuated fibre Sidenote Psychical phenomena The mass of this evidence ancient and modern traditional and statistical is beneath consideration the palpitating mood in which it is gathered and received even when ostensibly scientific is such that gullibility and fiction play a very large part in the report for it is not to be assumed that a man because he speaks in the first person and addresses a learned society has lost the primordial faculty of lying When due allowance has been made however for legend and fraud there remains a certain residuum of clairvoyance and telepathy and an occasional abnormal obedience of matter to mind which might pass for magic There are unmistakable indications that in these regions we touch lower and more rudimentary faculties There seems to be as is quite natural a sub human sensibility in man wherein ideas are connected together by bonds so irrational and tenacious that they seem miraculous to a mind already trained in practical and relevant thinking This sub human sense far from representing important truths more clearly than ordinary apprehension can reduces consciousness again to a tangle of trivial impressions shots of uncertain range as if a skin had not yet formed over the body It emerges in tense and disorganised moments Its reports are the more trifling the more startingly literal their veracity It seems to represent a stratum of life beneath moral or intellectual functions and beneath all personality When proof has been found that a ghost has actually been seen proof is required that the phantom has been rightly recognised and named and this imputed identity is never demonstrable and in most cases impossible So in the magic cures which from time immemorial have been recorded at shrines of all religions and which have been attributed to wonder workers of every sect the one thing certain about them is that they prove neither the truth of whatever myth is capriciously associated with them nor the goodness or voluntary power of the miracle worker himself Healer and medium are alike vehicles for some elemental energy they cannot control and which as often as not misses fire at best they feel a power going out of them which they themselves undergo and which radiates from them like electricity to work as chance will have it good or evil in the world The whole operation lies in so far as it really takes place at all on the lowest levels of unintelligence in a region closely allied to madness in consciousness and to sporadic organic impulses in the physical sphere Sidenote Hypertrophies of sense Among the blind the retina having lost its function the rest of the skin is said to recover its primordial sensitiveness to distance and light so that the sightless have a clearer premonition of objects about them than seeing people could have in the dark So when reason and the ordinary processes of sense are in abeyance a certain universal sensibility seems to return to the soul influences at other times not appreciable make then a sensible impression and automatic reactions may be run through in response to a stimulus normally quite insufficient Now the complexity of nature is prodigious everything that happens leaves like buried cities almost indelible traces which an eye by chance attentive and duly prepared can manage to read recovering for a moment the image of an extinct life Symbols illegible to reason can thus sometimes read themselves out in trance and madness Faint vestiges may be found in matter of forms which it once wore or which like a perfume impregnated and got lodgment within it Slight echoes may suddenly reconstitute themselves in the mind s silence and a half stunned consciousness may catch brief glimpses of long lost and irrelevant things Real ghosts are such reverberations of the past exceeding ordinary imagination and discernment both in vividness and in fidelity they may not be explicable without appealing to material influences subtler than those ordinarily recognised as they are obviously not discoverable without some derangement and hypertrophy of the senses Sidenote These possibilities affect physical existence only That such subtler influences should exist is entirely consonant with reason and experience but only a hankering tenderness for superstition a failure to appreciate the function both of religion and of science can lead to reverence for such oracular gibberish as these influences provoke The world is weary of experimenting with magic In utter seriousness and with immense solemnity whole races have given themselves up to exploiting these shabby mysteries and while a new survey of the facts in the light of natural science and psychology is certainly not superfluous it can be expected to lead to nothing but a more detailed and conscientious description of natural processes The thought of employing such investigations to save at the last moment religious doctrines founded on moral ideas is a pathetic blunder the obscene supernatural has nothing to do with rational religion If it were discovered that wretched echoes of a past life could be actually heard by putting one s ear long enough to a tomb and if per impossibile those echoes could be legitimately attributed to another mind and to the very mind indeed whose former body was interred there a melancholy chapter would indeed be added to man s earthly fortunes since it would appear that even after death he retained under certain conditions a fatal attachment to his dead body and to the other material instruments of his earthly life Obviously such a discovery would teach us more about dying than about immortality the truths disclosed since they would be disclosed by experiment and observation would be psycho physical truths implying nothing about what a truly disembodied life might be if one were attainable for a disembodied life could by no possibility betray itself in spectres rumblings and spasms Actual thunders from Sinai and an actual discovery of two stone tables would have been utterly irrelevant to the moral authority of the ten commandments or to the existence of a truly supreme being No less irrelevant to a supramundane immortality is the length of time during which human spirits may be condemned to operate on earth after their bodies are quiet In other words spectral survivals would at most enlarge our conception of the soul s physical basis spreading out the area of its manifestations they could not possibly seeing the survivals are physical reveal the disembodied existence of the soul Sidenote Moral grounds for the doctrine The necessary assumption of a future Such a disembodied existence removed by its nature from the sphere of empirical evidence might nevertheless be actual and grounds of a moral or metaphysical type might be sought for postulating its reality Life and the will to live are at bottom identical Experience itself is transitive and can hardly arise apart from a forward effort and prophetic apprehension by which adjustments are made to a future unmistakably foreseen This premonition by which action seeks to justify and explain itself to reflection may be analysed into a group of memories and sensations of movement generating ideal expectations which might easily be disappointed but scepticism about the future can hardly be maintained in the heat of action A postulate acted on is an act of genuine and dogmatic faith I not only postulate a morrow when I prepare for it but ingenuously and heartily believe that the morrow will come This faith does not amount to certitude I may confess if challenged that before to morrow I and the world and time itself might conceivably come to an end together but that idle possibility so long as it does not slacken action will not disturb belief Every moment of life accordingly trusts that life will continue and this prophetic interpretation of action so long as action lasts amounts to continual faith in futurity Sidenote An assumption no evidence A sophist might easily transform this psychological necessity into a dazzling proof of immortality To believe anything he might say is to be active but action involves faith in a future and in the fruits of action and as no living moment can be without this confidence belief in extinction would be self contradictory and at no moment a possible belief The question however is not whether every given moment has or has not a specious future before it to which it looks forward but whether the realisation of such foresight a realisation which during waking life is roughly usual is incapable of failing Now expectation never without its requisite antecedents and natural necessity often lacks fulfilment and never finds its fulfilment entire so that the necessity of a postulate gives no warrant for its verification Expectation and action are constantly suspended together and what happens whenever thought loses itself or stumbles what happens whenever in its shifts it forgets its former objects might well happen at crucial times to that train of intentions which we call a particular life or the life of humanity The prophecy involved in action is not insignificant but it is notoriously fallible and depends for its fulfilment on external conditions The question accordingly really is whether a man expecting to live for ever or one expecting to die in his time has the more representative and trustworthy notion of the future The question so stated cannot be solved by an appeal to evidence which is necessarily all on one side but only by criticising the value of evidence as against instinct and hope and by ascertaining the relative status which assumption and observation have in experience The transcendental compulsion under which action labours of envisaging a future and the animal instinct that clings to life and flees from death as the most dreadful of evils are the real grounds why immortality seems initially natural and good Confidence in living for ever is anterior to the discovery that all men are mortal and to the discovery that the thinker is himself a man These discoveries flatly contradict that confidence in the form in which it originally presents itself and all doctrines of immortality which adult philosophy can entertain are more or less subterfuges and after thoughts by which the observed fact of mortality and the native inconceivability of death are more or less clumsily reconciled Sidenote A solipsistic argument The most lordly and genuine fashion of asserting immortality would be to proclaim one s self an exception to the animal race and to point out that the analogy between one s singular self and others is altogether lame and purely conventional Any proud barbarian with a tincture of transcendental philosophy might adopt this tone Creatures that perish he might say are and can be nothing but puppets and painted shadows in my mind My conscious will forbids its own extinction it scorns to level itself with its own objects and instruments The world which I have never known to exist without me exists by my company operation and consent it can never extinguish what lends it being The death prophetically accepted by weaklings with such small insight and courage I mock and altogether defy it can never touch me Such solipsistic boasts may not have been heard in historic times from the lips of men speaking in their own persons Language has an irresistible tendency to make thought communistic and ideally transferable to others It forbids a man to say of himself what it would be ridiculous to hear from another Now solipsism in another man is a comic thing and a mind prompted perhaps by hell and heaven to speak solipsistically is stopped by the laughable echo of its own words when it remembers its bold sayings Language being social resists a virgin egotism and forbids it to express itself publicly no matter how well grounded it may be in transcendental logic and in animal instinct Social convention is necessarily materialistic since the beginning of all moral reasonableness consists in taming the transcendental conceit native to a living mind in attaching it to its body and bringing the will that thought itself absolute down to the rank of animals and men Otherwise no man would acknowledge another s rights or even conceive his existence Sidenote Absoluteness and immortality transferred to the gods Primeval solipsism the philosophy of untamed animal will has accordingly taken to the usual by paths and expressed itself openly only in myth or by a speculative abstraction in which the transcendental spirit for which all the solipsistic privileges were still claimed was distinguished from the human individual The gods it was said were immortal and although on earth spirit must submit to the yoke and service of matter on whose occasions it must wait yet there existed in the ether other creatures more normally and gloriously compounded since their forms served and expressed their minds which ruled also over the elements and feared no assault from time With the advent of this mythology experience and presumption divided their realms experience was allowed to shape men s notions of vulgar reality but presumption which could not be silenced was allowed to suggest a second sphere thinly and momentarily veiled to mortal sense in which the premonitions of will were abundantly realised This expedient had the advantage of endowing the world with creatures that really satisfied human aspirations such as at any moment they might be The gods possessed longevity beauty magic celerity of movement leisure splendour of life indefinite strength and practical omniscience When the gods were also expressions for natural forces this function somewhat prejudiced their ideality and they failed to correspond perfectly to what their worshippers would have most esteemed but religious reformers tended to expunge naturalism from theology and to represent the gods as entirely admirable The Greek gods to be sure always continued to have genealogies and the fact of having been born is a bad augury for immortality but other religions and finally the Greek philosophers themselves conceived unbegotten gods in whom the human rebellion against mutability was expressed absolutely Thus a place was found in nature for the constant and perpetual element which crude experience seems to contain or at least to suggest Unfortunately the immortal and the human were in this mythology wholly divorced so that while immortality was vindicated for something in the universe it was emphatically denied to man and to his works Contemplation to be satisfied with this situation had to be heroically unselfish and resigned the gods greatness and glory had to furnish sufficient solace for all mortal defeats At the same time all criticism had to be deprecated for reflection would at once have pointed out that the divine life in question was either a personification of natural processes and thus really in flux and full of oblivion and imperfection or else a hypostasis of certain mental functions and ideals which could not really be conceived apart from the natural human life which they informed and from which they had been violently abstracted Sidenote Or to a divine principle in all beings Another expedient was accordingly found especially by mystics and critical philosophers for uniting the mortal and immortal in existence while still distinguishing them in essence Cur Deus Homo might be said to be the theme of all such speculations Plato had already found the eternal in the form which the temporal puts on or if the phrase be preferred had seen in the temporal and existential nothing but an individuated case of the ideal The soul was immortal unbegotten impassible the bodies it successively inhabited and the experience it gathered served merely to bring out its nature with greater or less completeness To somewhat the same effect the German transcendentalists identified and distinguished the private and the universal spirit What lived in each man and in each moment was the Absolute for nothing else could really exist and the expression which the Absolute there took on was but a transitional phase of its total self expression which could it be grasped in its totality would no longer seem subject to contradiction and flux An immortal agent therefore went through an infinite series of acts each transitory and relative to the others but all possessed of inalienable reality and eternal significance In such formulations the divorce was avoided between the intellectual and the sensuous factor in experience a divorce which the myth about immortal gods and mortal men had introduced On the other hand existential immortality was abandoned only an ideal permanence only significance was allowed to any finite being and the better or future world of which ancient poets had dreamt Olympus and every other heaven was altogether abolished There was an eternal universe where everything was transitory and a single immortal spirit at no two moments the same The world of idealism realised no particular ideal and least of all the ideal of a natural and personal immunity from death Sidenote In neither case is the individual immortal First then a man may refuse to admit that he must die at all then abashed at the arrogance of that assertion he may consider the immortal life of other creatures like the earth and stars which seem subject to no extinction and he may ascribe to these a perpetual consciousness and personality Finally confessing the fabulous character of those deities he may distinguish an immortal agent or principle within himself identify it with the inner principle of all other beings and contrast it with its varying and conditioned expressions But scarcely is this abstraction attained when he must perceive its worthlessness since the natural life the concrete aims and the personal career which immortality was intended to save from dissolution are wholly alien to a nominal entity which endures through all change however fundamental and cohabits with every nature however hostile and odious to humanity If immortality is to be genuine what is immortal must be something definite and if this immortality is to concern life and not mere significance or ideal definition that which endures must be an individual creature with a fixed nucleus of habits and demands so that its persistence may contain progress and achievement Herewith we may dismiss the more direct attempts to conceive and assert a future life Their failure drives us to a consideration of indirect attempts to establish an unobservable but real immortality through revelation and dogma Such an immortality would follow on transmigration or resurrection and would be assigned to a supernatural sphere a second empirical world present to the soul after death where her fortunes would not be really conceivable without a reconstituted body and a new material environment Sidenote Possible forms of survival Many a man dies too soon and some are born in the wrong age or station Could these persons drink at the fountain of youth at least once more they might do themselves fuller justice and cut a better figure at last in the universe Most people think they have stuff in them for greater things than time suffers them to perform To imagine a second career is a pleasing antidote for ill fortune the poor soul wants another chance But how should a future life be constituted if it is to satisfy this demand and how long need it last It would evidently have to go on in an environment closely analogous to earth I could not for instance write in another world the epics which the necessity of earning my living may have stifled here did that other world contain no time no heroic struggles or no metrical language Nor is it clear that my epics to be perfect would need to be quite endless If what is foiled in me is really poetic genius and not simply a tendency toward perpetual motion it would not help me if in heaven in lieu of my dreamt of epics I were allowed to beget several robust children In a word if hereafter I am to be the same man improved I must find myself in the same world corrected Were I transformed into a cherub or transported into a timeless ecstasy it is hard to see in what sense I should continue to exist Those results might be interesting in themselves and might enrich the universe they would not prolong my life nor retrieve my disasters For this reason a future life is after all best represented by those frankly material ideals which most Christians being Platonists are wont to despise It would be genuine happiness for a Jew to rise again in the flesh and live for ever in Ezekiel s New Jerusalem with its ceremonial glories and civic order It would be truly agreeable for any man to sit in well watered gardens with Mohammed clad in green silks drinking delicious sherbets and transfixed by the gazelle like glance of some young girl all innocence and fire Amid such scenes a man might remain himself and might fulfil hopes that he had actually cherished on earth He might also find his friends again which in somewhat generous minds is perhaps the thought that chiefly sustains interest in a posthumous existence But to recognise his friends a man must find them in their bodies with their familiar habits voices and interests for it is surely an insult to affection to say that he could find them in an eternal formula expressing their idiosyncrasy When however it is clearly seen that another life to supplement this one must closely resemble it does not the magic of immortality altogether vanish Is such a reduplication of earthly society at all credible And the prospect of awakening again among houses and trees among children and dotards among wars and rumours of wars still fettered to one personality and one accidental past still uncertain of the future is not this prospect wearisome and deeply repulsive Having passed through these things once and bequeathed them to posterity is it not time for each soul to rest The universe doubtless contains all sorts of experiences better and worse than the human but it is idle to attribute to a particular man a life divorced from his circumstances and from his body Sidenote Arguments from retribution and need of opportunity Dogmas about such a posthumous experience find some shadowy support in various illusions and superstitions that surround death but they are developed into articulate prophecies chiefly by certain moral demands One of these requires rewards and punishments more emphatic and sure than those which conduct meets with in this world Another requires merely a more favourable and complete opportunity for the soul s development Considerations like these are pertinent to moral philosophy It touches the notion of duty whether an exact hedonistic retribution is to be demanded for what is termed merit and guilt so that without such supernatural remuneration virtue perhaps would be discredited and deprived of a motive It likewise touches the ideality and nobleness of life whether human aims can be realised satisfactorily only in the agent s singular person so that the fruits of effort would be forth with missed if the labourer himself should disappear Sidenote Ignoble temper of both To establish justice in the world and furnish an adequate incentive to virtue was once thought the chief business of a future life The Hebraic religions somewhat overreached themselves on these points for the grotesque alternative between hell and heaven in the end only aggravated the injustice it was meant to remedy Life is unjust in that it subordinates individuals to a general mechanical law and the deeper and longer hold fate has on the soul the greater that injustice A perpetual life would be a perpetual subjection to arbitrary power while a last judgment would be but a last fatality That hell may have frightened a few villains into omitting a crime is perhaps credible but the embarrassed silence which the churches in a more sensitive age prefer to maintain on that wholesome doctrine once as they taught the only rational basis for virtue shows how their teaching has to follow the independent progress of morals Nevertheless persons are not wanting apparently free from ecclesiastical constraint who still maintain that the value of life depends on its indefinite prolongation By an artifice of reflection they substitute vanity for reason and selfish for ingenuous instincts in man Being apparently interested in nothing but their own careers they forget that a man may remember how little he counts in the world and suffer that rational knowledge to inspire his purposes Intense morality has always envisaged earthly goods and evils and even when a future life has been accepted vaguely it has never given direction to human will or aims which at best it could only proclaim more emphatically It may indeed be said that no man of any depth of soul has made his prolonged existence the touchstone of his enthusiasms Such an instinct is carnal and if immortality is to add a higher inspiration to life it must not be an immortality of selfishness What a despicable creature must a man be and how sunk below the level of the most barbaric virtue if he cannot bear to live for his children for his art or for country Sidenote False optimistic postulate involved To turn these moral questions however into arguments for a physical speculation like that about human longevity resurrection or metempsychosis a hybrid principle is required thus even if we have answered those moral questions in the conventional way and satisfied ourselves that personal immortality is a postulate of ethics we cannot infer that immortality therefore exists unless we import into the argument a tremendous optimistic postulate to the effect that what is requisite for moral rationality must in every instance be realised in experience Such an optimistic postulate however as the reader must have repeatedly observed is made not only despite all experience but in ignorance of the conditions under which alone ideals are framed and retain their significance Every ideal expresses individual and specific tendencies proper at some moment to some natural creature every ideal therefore has for its basis a part only of the dynamic world so that its fulfilment is problematical and altogether adventitious to its existence and authority To decide whether an ideal can be or will be fulfilled we must examine the physical relation between such organic forces as that ideal expresses and the environment in which those forces operate we may then perceive how far a realisation of the given aims is possible how far it must fail and how far the aims in question by a shift in their natural basis will lapse and yield to others possibly more capable of execution and more stable in the world The question of success is a question of physics To say that an ideal will be inevitably fulfilled simply because it is an ideal is to say something gratuitous and foolish Pretence cannot in the end avail against experience Sidenote Transition to ideality Nevertheless it is important to define ideals even before their realisation is known to be possible because they constitute one of the two factors whose interaction and adjustment is moral life factors which are complementary and diverse in function and may be independently ascertained The value of existences is wholly borrowed from their ideality without direct consideration of their fate while the existence of ideals is wholly determined by natural forces without direct relation to their fulfilment Existence and ideal value can therefore be initially felt and observed apart although of course a complete description would lay bare physical necessity in the ideals entertained and inevitable ideal harmonies among the facts discovered Human life lying as it does in the midst of a larger process will surely not be without some congruity with the universe Every creature lends potential values to a world in which it can satisfy some at least of its demands and learn perhaps to modify the others Happiness is always a natural and an essentially possible thing and a total despair since it ignores those goods which are attainable can express only a partial experience But before considering in what ways a disciplined soul might make its peace with reality we may consider what an undisciplined soul in the first instance desires and from this starting point we may trace her chastening and education observing the ideal compensations which may console her for lost illusions CHAPTER XIV IDEAL IMMORTALITY Sidenote Olympian immortality the first ideal In order to give the will to live frank and direct satisfaction it would have been necessary to solve the problem of perpetual motion in the animal body as nature has approximately solved it in the solar system Nutrition should have continually repaired all waste so that the cycle of youth and age might have repeated itself yearly in every individual like summer and winter on the earth Nor are some hints of such an equilibrium altogether wanting Convalescence sudden good fortune a belated love and even the April sunshine or morning air bring about a certain rejuvenescence in man prophetic of what is not ideally impossible perpetuity and constant reinforcement in his vital powers Had nature furnished the elixir of life or could art have discovered it the whole face of human society would have been changed The earth once full no more children would have been begotten and parental instincts would have been atrophied for want of function All men would have been contemporaries and having all time before them for travel and experiment would have allied themselves eventually with what was most congenial to them and would have come to be bound only by free and friendly ties They would all have been well known and would have acted perpetually in their ultimate and true character like the immortal gods One might have loved fixity like Hestia and another motion like Hermes a third might have been untiring in the plastic arts like Hephaestus or like Apollo in music while the infinite realms of mathematics and philosophy would have lain open to spirits of a quality not represented in Homer s pantheon That man s primary and most satisfying ideal is something of this sort is clear in itself and attested by mythology for the great use of the gods is that they interpret the human heart to us and help us while we conceive them to discover our inmost ambition and while we emulate them to pursue it Christian fancy because of its ascetic meagreness and fear of life has not known how to fill out the picture of heaven and has left it mystical and vague but whatever paradise it has ventured to imagine has been modelled on the same primary ideal It has represented a society of eternal beings among which there was no marriage nor giving in marriage and where each found his congenial mansion and that perfected activity which brings inward peace After this easy fashion were death and birth conquered in the myths which truly interpreted the will to live according to its primary intention but in reality such direct satisfaction was impossible A total defeat on the other hand would have extinguished the will itself and obliterated every human impulse seeking expression Man s existence is proof enough that nature was not altogether unpropitious but offered in an unlooked for direction some thoroughfare to the soul Roundabout imperfect methods were discovered by which something at least of what was craved might be secured The individual perished yet not without having segregated and detached a certain portion of himself capable of developing a second body and mind The potentialities of this seminal portion having been liberated long after the parent body had begun to feel the shock of the world could reach full expression after the parent body had begun to decay and the offspring needed not itself to succumb before it had launched a third generation A cyclical life or arrested death a continual motion by little successive explosions could thus establish itself and could repeat from generation to generation a process not unlike nutrition only that while in nutrition the individual form remains and the inner substance is renewed insensibly in reproduction the form is renewed openly and the inner substance is insensibly continuous Sidenote Its indirect attainment by reproduction Reproduction seems from the will s point of view a marvellous expedient involving a curious mixture of failure and success The individual who alone is the seat and principle of will is thereby sacrificed so that reproduction is no response to his original hopes and aspirations yet in a double way he is enticed and persuaded to be almost satisfied first in that so like a counterfeit of himself actually survives a creature to which all his ideal interests may be transmitted and secondly because a new and as it were a rival aim is now insinuated into his spirit For the impulse toward reproduction has now become no less powerful even if less constant than the impulse toward nutrition in other words the will to live finds itself in the uncongenial yet inevitable company of the will to have an heir Reproduction thus partly entertains the desire to be immortal by giving it a vicarious fulfilment and partly cancels it by adding an impulse and joy which when you think of it accepts mortality For love whether sexual parental or fraternal is essentially sacrificial and prompts a man to give his life for his friends In thus losing his life gladly he in a sense finds it anew since it has now become a part of his function and ideal to yield his place to others and to live afterwards only in them While the primitive and animal side of him may continue to cling to existence at all hazards and to find the thought of extinction intolerable his reason and finer imagination will build a new ideal on reality better understood and be content that the future he looks to should be enjoyed by others When we consider such a natural transformation and discipline of the will when we catch even a slight glimpse of nature s resources and mysteries how thin and verbal those belated hopes must seem which would elude death and abolish sacrifice Such puerile dreams not only miss the whole pathos of human life but ignore those specifically mortal virtues which might console us for not being so radiantly divine as we may at first have thought ourselves Nature in denying us perennial youth has at least invited us to become unselfish and noble A first shift in aspiration a capacity for radical altruism thus supervenes upon the lust to live and accompanies parental and social interests The new ideal however can never entirely obliterate the old and primary one because the initial functions which the old Adam exclusively represented remain imbedded in the new life and are its physical basis If the nutritive soul ceased to operate the reproductive soul could never arise to be altruistic we must first be and spiritual interests can never abolish or cancel the material existence on which they are grafted The consequence is that death even when circumvented by reproduction and relieved by surviving impersonal interests remains an essential evil It may be accepted as inevitable and the goods its intrusion leaves standing may be heartily appreciated and pursued but something pathetic and incomplete will always attach to a life that looks to its own termination The effort of physical existence is not to accomplish anything definite but merely to persist for ever The will has its first law of motion corresponding to that of matter its initial tendency is to continue to operate in the given direction and in the given manner Inertia is in this sense the essence of vitality To be driven from that perpetual course is somehow to be checked and an external and hostile force is required to change a habit or an instinct as much as to deflect a star Indeed nutrition itself hunting feeding and digestion are forced activities and the basis of passions not altogether congenial nor ideal Hunger is an incipient faintness and agony and an animal that needs to hunt gnaw and digest is no immortal free or essentially victorious creature His will is already driven into by paths and expedients his primitive beatific vision has to be interrupted by remedial action to restore it for a while since otherwise it would obviously degenerate rapidly through all stages of distress until its total extinction Sidenote Moral acceptance of this compromise The tasks thus imposed upon the protoplasmic will raise it we may say to a higher level to hunt is better sport and more enlightening than to lie imbibing sunshine and air and to eat is we may well think a more positive and specific pleasure than merely to be Such judgments however show a human bias They arise from incapacity to throw off acquired organs Those necessities which have led to the forms of life which we happen to exemplify and in terms of which our virtues are necessarily expressed seem to us in retrospect happy necessities since without them our conventional goods would not have come to appeal to us These conventional goods however are only compromises with evil and the will would never have taken to pursuing them if it had not been dislodged and beaten back from its primary aims Even food is for this reason no absolute blessing it is only the first and most necessary of comforts of restorations of truces and reprieves in that battle with death in which an ultimate defeat is too plainly inevitable for the pitcher that goes often to the well is at last broken and a creature that is forced to resist his inward collapse by adventitious aids will some day find that these aids have failed him and that inward dissolution has become for some mechanical reason quite irresistible It is therefore not only the lazy or mystical will that chafes at the need of material supports and deprecates anxieties about the morrow the most conventional and passionate mind when it attains any refinement confesses the essential servitude involved in such preoccupations by concealing or ignoring them as much as may be We study to eat as if we were not ravenous to win as if we were willing to lose and to treat personal wants in general as merely compulsory and uninteresting matters Why dwell we say to ourselves on our stammerings and failures The intent is all and the bungling circumlocutions we may be driven to should be courteously ignored like a stammerer s troubles when once our meaning has been conveyed Even animal passions are in this way after thoughts and expedients and although in a brutal age they seem to make up the whole of life later it appears that they would be gladly enough outgrown did the material situation permit it Intellectual life returns in its freedom to the attitude proper to primitive will except that through the new machinery underlying reason a more stable equilibrium has been established with external forces and the freedom originally absolute has become relative to certain underlying adjustments adjustments which may be ignored but cannot be abandoned with impunity Original action as seen in the vegetable is purely spontaneous On the animal level instrumental action is added and chiefly attended to so that the creature without knowing what it lives for finds attractive tasks and a sort of glory in the chase in love and in labour In the Life of Reason this instrumental activity is retained for it is a necessary basis for human prosperity and power but the value of life is again sought in the supervening free activity which that adjustment to physical forces or dominion over them has made possible on a larger scale Every free activity would gladly persist for ever and if any be found that involves and aims at its own arrest or transformation that activity is thereby proved to be instrumental and servile imposed from without and not ideal Sidenote Even vicarious immortality intrinsically impossible Not only is man s original effort aimed at living for ever in his own person but even if he could renounce that desire the dream of being represented perpetually by posterity is no less doomed Reproduction like nutrition is a device not ultimately successful If extinction does not defeat it evolution will Doubtless the fertility of whatever substance may have produced us will not be exhausted in this single effort a potentiality that has once proved efficacious and been actualised in life though it should sleep will in time revive again In some form and after no matter what intervals nature may be expected always to possess consciousness But beyond this planet and apart from the human race experience is too little imaginable to be interesting No definite plan or ideal of ours can find its realisation except in ourselves Accordingly a vicarious physical immortality always remains an unsatisfactory issue what is thus to be preserved is but a counterfeit of our being and even that counterfeit is confronted by omens of a total extinction more or less remote A note of failure and melancholy must always dominate in the struggle against natural death Sidenote Intellectual victory over change This defeat is not really problematical or to be eluded by reviving ill digested hopes resting entirely on ignorance an ignorance which these hopes will wish to make eternal We need not wait for our total death to experience dying we need not borrow from observation of others demise a prophecy of our own extinction Every moment celebrates obsequies over the virtues of its predecessor and the possession of memory by which we somehow survive in representation is the most unmistakable proof that we are perishing in reality In endowing us with memory nature has revealed to us a truth utterly unimaginable to the unflective creation the truth of mortality Everything moves in the midst of death because it indeed moves but it falls into the pit unawares and by its own action unmakes and disestablishes itself until a wonderful visionary faculty is added so that a ghost remains of what has perished to reveal that lapse and at the same time in a certain sense to neutralise it The more we reflect the more we live in memory and idea the more convinced and penetrated we shall be by the experience of death yet without our knowing it perhaps this very conviction and experience will have raised us in a way above mortality That was a heroic and divine oracle which in informing us of our decay made us partners of the gods eternity and by giving us knowledge poured into us to that extent the serenity and balm of truth As it is memory that enables us to feel that we are dying and to know that everything actual is in flux so it is memory that opens to us an ideal immortality unacceptable and meaningless to the old Adam but genuine in its own way and undeniably true It is an immortality in representation a representation which envisages things in their truth as they have in their own day possessed themselves in reality It is no subterfuge or superstitious effrontery called to disguise or throw off the lessons of experience on the contrary it is experience itself reflection itself and knowledge of mortality Memory does not reprieve or postpone the changes which it registers nor does it itself possess a permanent duration it is if possible less stable and more mobile than primary sensation It is in point of existence only an internal and complex kind of sensibility But in intent and by its significance it plunges to the depths of time it looks still on the departed and bears witness to the truth that though absent from this part of experience and incapable of returning to life they nevertheless existed once in their own right were as living and actual as experience is to day and still help to make up in company with all past present and future mortals the filling and value of the world Sidenote The glory of it As the pathos and heroism of life consists in accepting as an opportunity the fate that makes our own death partial or total serviceable to others so the glory of life consists in accepting the knowledge of natural death as an opportunity to live in the spirit The sacrifice the self surrender remains real for though the compensation is real too and at moments perhaps apparently overwhelming it is always incomplete and leaves beneath an incurable sorrow Yet life can never contradict its basis or reach satisfactions essentially excluded by its own conditions Progress lies in moving forward from the given situation and satisfying as well as may be the interests that exist And if some initial demand has proved hopeless there is the greater reason for cultivating other sources of satisfaction possibly more abundant and lasting Now reflection is a vital function memory and imagination have to the full the rhythm and force of life But these faculties in envisaging the past or the ideal envisage the eternal and the man in whose mind they predominate is to that extent detached in his affections from the world of flux from himself and from his personal destiny This detachment will not make him infinitely long lived nor absolutely happy but it may render him intelligent and just and may open to him all intellectual pleasures and all human sympathies There is accordingly an escape from death open to man one not found by circumventing nature but by making use of her own expedients in circumventing her imperfections Memory nay perception itself is a first stage in this escape which coincides with the acquisition and possession of reason When the meaning of successive perceptions is recovered with the last of them when a survey is made of objects whose constitutive sensations first arose independently this synthetic moment contains an object raised above time on a pedestal of reflection a thought indefeasibly true in its ideal deliverance though of course fleeting in its psychic existence Existence is essentially temporal and life foredoomed to be mortal since its basis is a process and an opposition it floats in the stream of time never to return never to be recovered or repossessed But ever since substance became at some sensitive point intelligent and reflective ever since time made room and pause for memory for history for the consciousness of time a god as it were became incarnate in mortality and some vision of truth some self forgetful satisfaction became a heritage that moment could transmit to moment and man to man This heritage is humanity itself the presence of immortal reason in creatures that perish Apprehension which makes man so like a god makes him in one respect immortal it quickens his numbered moments with a vision of what never dies the truth of those moments and their inalienable values Sidenote Reason makes man s divinity To participate in this vision is to participate at once in humanity and in divinity since all other makes bonds are material and perishable but the bond between two thoughts that have grasped the same truth of two instants that have caught the same beauty is a spiritual and imperishable bond It is imperishable simply because it is ideal and resident merely in import and intent The two thoughts the two instants remain existentially different were they not two they could not come from different quarters to unite in one meaning and to behold one object in distinct and conspiring acts of apprehension Being independent in existence they can be united by the identity of their burden by the common worship so to speak of the same god Were this ideal goal itself an existence it would be incapable of uniting anything for the same gulf which separated the two original minds would open between them and their common object But being as it is purely ideal it can become the meeting ground of intelligences and render their union ideally eternal Among the physical instruments of thought there may be rivalry and impact the two thinkers may compete and clash but this is because each seeks his own physical survival and does not love the truth stripped of its accidental associations and provincial accent Doctors disagree in so far as they are not truly doctors but as Plato would say seek like sophists and wage earners to circumvent and defeat one another The conflict is physical and can extend to the subject matter only in so far as this is tainted by individual prejudice and not wholly lifted from the sensuous to the intellectual plane In the ether there are no winds of doctrine The intellect being the organ and source of the divine is divine and single if there were many sorts of intellect many principles of perspective they would fix and create incomparable and irrelevant worlds Reason is one in that it gravitates toward an object called truth which could not have the function it has of being a focus for mental activities if it were not one in reference to the operations which converge upon it This unity in truth as in reason is of course functional only not physical or existential The heats of thought and the thinkers are innumerable indefinite too the variations to which their endowment and habits may be subjected But the condition of spiritual communion or ideal relevance in these intelligences is their possession of a method and grammar essentially identical Language for example is significant in proportion to the constancy in meaning which words and locutions preserve in a speaker s mind at various times or in the minds of various persons This constancy is never absolute Therefore language is never wholly significant never exhaustively intelligible There is always mud in the well if we have drawn up enough water Yet in peaceful rivers though they flow there is an appreciable degree of translucency So from moment to moment and from man to man there is an appreciable element of unanimity of constancy and congruity of intent On this abstract and perfectly identical function science rests together with every rational formation Sidenote and his immortality The same function is the seat of human immortality Reason lifts a larger or smaller element in each man to the plane of ideality according as reason more or less thoroughly leavens and permeates the lump No man is wholly immortal as no philosophy is wholly true and no language wholly intelligible but only in so far as intelligible is a language a language rather than a noise only in so far as true is a philosophy more than a vent for cerebral humours and only in so far as a man is rational and immortal is he a man and not a sensorium It is hard to convince people that they have such a gift as intelligence If they perceive its animal basis they cannot conceive its ideal affinities or understand what is meant by calling it divine if they perceive its ideality and see the immortal essences that swim into its ken they hotly deny that it is an animal faculty and invent ultramundane places and bodiless persons in which it is to reside as if those celestial substances could be in respect to thought any less material than matter or in respect to vision and life any less instrumental than bodily organs It never occurs to them that if nature has added intelligence to animal life it is because they belong together Intelligence is a natural emanation of vitality If eternity could exist otherwise than as a vision in time eternity would have no meaning for men in the world while the world men and time would have no vocation or status in eternity The travail of existence would be without excuse without issue or consummation while the conceptions of truth and of perfection would be without application to experience pure dreams about things preternatural and unreal vacantly conceived and illogically supposed to have something to do with living issues But truth and perfection for the very reason that they are not problematic existences but inherent ideals cannot be banished from discourse Experience may lose any of its data it cannot lose while it endures the terms with which it operates in becoming experience Now truth is relevant to every opinion which looks to truth for its standard and perfection is envisaged in every cry for relief in every effort at betterment Opinions volitions and passionate refusals fill human life So that when the existence of truth is denied truth is given the only status which it ever required it is conceived Sidenote It is the locus of all truths Nor can any better defense be found for the denial that nature and her life have a status in eternity This statement may not be understood but if grasped at all it will not be questioned By having a status in eternity is not meant being parts of an eternal existence petrified or congealed into something real but motionless What is meant is only that whatever exists in time when bathed in the light of reflection acquires an indelible character and discloses irreversible relations every fact in being recognised takes its place in the universe of discourse in that ideal sphere of truth which is the common and unchanging standard for all assertions Language science art religion and all ambitious dreams are compacted of ideas Life is as much a mosaic of notions as the firmament is of stars and these ideal and transpersonal objects bridging time fixing standards establishing values constituting the natural rewards of all living are the very furniture of eternity the goals and playthings of that reason which is an instinct in the heart as vital and spontaneous as any other Or rather perhaps reason is a supervening instinct by which all other instincts are interpreted just as the sensus communis or transcendental unity of psychology is a faculty by which all perceptions are brought face to face and compared So that immortality is not a privilege reserved for a part only of experience but rather a relation pervading every part in varying measure We may in leaving the subject mark the degrees and phases of this idealisation Sidenote Epicurean immortality through the truth of existence Animal sensation is related to eternity only by the truth that it has taken place The fact fleeting as it is is registered in ideal history and no inventory of the world s riches no true confession of its crimes would ever be complete that ignored that incident This indefeasible character in experience makes a first sort of ideal immortality one on which those rational philosophers like to dwell who have not speculation enough to feel quite certain of any other It was a consolation to the Epicurean to remember that however brief and uncertain might be his tenure of delight the past was safe and the present sure He lives happy says Horace and master over himself who can say daily I have lived To morrow let Jove cover the sky with black clouds or flood it with sunshine he shall not thereby render vain what lies behind he shall not delete and make never to have existed what once the hour has brought in its flight Such self concentration and hugging of the facts has no power to improve them it gives to pleasure and pain an impartial eternity and rather tends to intrench in sensuous and selfish satisfactions a mind that has lost faith in reason and that deliberately ignores the difference in scope and dignity which exists among various pursuits Yet the reflection is staunch and in its way heroic it meets a vague and feeble aspiration that looks to the infinite with a just rebuke it points to real satisfactions experienced successes and asks us to be content with the fulfilment of our own wills If you have seen the world if you have played your game and won it what more would you ask for If you have tasted the sweets of existence you should be satisfied if the experience has been bitter you should be glad that it comes to an end Of course as we have seen there is a primary demand in man which death and mutation contradict flatly so that no summons to cease can ever be obeyed with complete willingness Even the suicide trembles and the ascetic feels the stings of the flesh It is the part of philosophy however to pass over those natural repugnances and overlay them with as much countervailing rationality as can find lodgment in a particular mind The Epicurean having abandoned politics and religion and being afraid of any far reaching ambition applied philosophy honestly enough to what remained Simple and healthy pleasures are the reward of simple and healthy pursuits to chafe against them because they are limited is to import a foreign and disruptive element into the case a healthy hunger has its limit and its satisfaction reaches a natural term Philosophy far from alienating us from those values should teach us to see their perfection and to maintain them in our ideal In other words the happy filling of a single hour is so much gained for the universe at large and to find joy and sufficiency in the flying moment is perhaps the only means open to us for increasing the glory of eternity Sidenote Logical immortality through objects of thought Moving events while remaining enshrined in this fashion in their permanent setting may contain other and less external relations to the immutable They may represent it If the pleasures of sense are not cancelled when they cease but continue to satisfy reason in that they once satisfied natural desires much more will the pleasures of reflection retain their worth when we consider that what they aspired to and reached was no momentary physical equilibrium but a permanent truth As Archimedes measuring the hypothenuse was lost to events being engaged in an event of much greater transcendence so art and science interrupt the sense for change by engrossing attention in its issues and its laws Old age often turns pious to look away from ruins to some world where youth endures and where what ought to have been is not overtaken by decay before it has quite come to maturity Lost in such abstract contemplations the mind is weaned from mortal concerns It forgets for a few moments a world in which it has so little more to do and so much perhaps still to suffer As a sensation of pure light would not be distinguishable from light itself so a contemplation of things not implicating time in their structure becomes so far as its own deliverance goes a timeless existence Unconsciousness of temporal conditions and of the very flight of time makes the thinker sink for a moment into identity with timeless objects And so immortality in a second ideal sense touches the mind Sidenote Ethical immortality through types of excellence The transitive phases of consciousness however have themselves a reference to eternal things They yield a generous enthusiasm and love of good which is richer in consolation than either Epicurean self concentration or mathematical ecstasy Events are more interesting than the terms we abstract from them and the forward movement of the will is something more intimately real than is the catalogue of our past experiences Now the forward movement of the will is an avenue to the eternal What would you have What is the goal of your endeavour It must be some success the establishment of some order the expression of some experience These points once reached we are not left merely with the satisfaction of abstract success or the consciousness of ideal immortality Being natural goals these ideals are related to natural functions Their attainment does not exhaust but merely liberates in this instance the function concerned and so marks the perpetual point of reference common to that function in all its fluctuations Every attainment of perfection in an art as for instance in government makes a return to perfection easier for posterity since there remains an enlightening example together with faculties predisposed by discipline to recover their ancient virtue The better a man evokes and realises the ideal the more he leads the life that all others in proportion to their worth will seek to live after him and the more he helps them to live in that nobler fashion His presence in the society of immortals thus becomes so to speak more pervasive He not only vanquishes time by his own rationality living now in the eternal but he continually lives again in all rational beings Since the ideal has this perpetual pertinence to mortal struggles he who lives in the ideal and leaves it expressed in society or in art enjoys a double immortality The eternal has absorbed him while he lived and when he is dead his influence brings others to the same absorption making them through that ideal identity with the best in him reincarnations and perennial seats of all in him which he could rationally hope to rescue from destruction He can say without any subterfuge or desire to delude himself that he shall not wholly die for he will have a better notion than the vulgar of what constitutes his being By becoming the spectator and confessor of his own death and of universal mutation he will have identified himself with what is spiritual in all spirits and masterful in all apprehension and so conceiving himself he may truly feel and know that he is eternal CHAPTER XV CONCLUSION Sidenote The failure of magic The preceding analysis of religion although it is illustrated mainly by Christianity may enable us in a general way to distinguish the rational goal of all religious life In no sphere is the contrast clearer between wisdom and folly in none perhaps has there been so much of both It was a prodigious delusion to imagine that work could be done by magic and the desperate appeal which human weakness has made to prayer to castigations to miscellaneous fantastic acts in the hope of thereby bending nature to greater sympathy with human necessities is a pathetic spectacle all the more pathetic in that here the very importunity of evil which distracted the mind and allowed it no choice or deliberation prevented very often those practical measures which if lighted upon would have instantly relieved the situation Religion when it has tried to do man s work for him has not only cheated hope but consumed energy and drawn away attention from the true means of success Sidenote and of mythology Sidenote Their imaginative value No less useless and retarding has been the effort to give religion the function of science Mythology in excogitating hidden dramatic causes for natural phenomena or in attributing events to the human values which they might prevent or secure has profoundly perverted and confused the intellect it has delayed and embarrassed the discovery of natural forces at the same time fostering presumptions which on being exploded tended to plunge men by revulsion into an artificial despair At the same time this experiment in mythology involved wonderful creations which have a poetic value of their own to offset their uselessness in some measure and the obstruction they have occasioned In imagining human agents behind every appearance fancy has given appearances some kinship to human life it has made nature a mass of hieroglyphics and enlarged to that extent the means of human expression While objects and events were capriciously moralised the mind s own plasticity has been developed by its great exercise in self projection To imagine himself a thunder cloud or a river the dispenser of silent benefits and the contriver of deep seated universal harmonies has actually stimulated man s moral nature he has grown larger by thinking himself so large Through the dense cloud of false thought and bad habit in which religion thus wrapped the world some rays broke through from the beginning for mythology and magic expressed life and sought to express its conditions Human needs and human ideals went forth in these forms to solicit and to conquer the world and since these imaginative methods for their very ineptitude rode somewhat lightly over particular issues and envisaged rather distant goods it was possible through them to give aspiration and reflection greater scope than the meaner exigencies of life would have permitted Where custom ruled morals and a narrow empiricism bounded the field of knowledge it was partly a blessing that imagination should be given an illegitimate sway Without misunderstanding there might have been no understanding at all without confidence in supernatural support the heart might never have uttered its own oracles So that in close association with superstition and fable we find piety and spirituality entering the world Sidenote Piety and spirituality justified Rational religion has these two phases piety or loyalty to necessary conditions and spirituality or devotion to ideal ends These simple sanctities make the core of all the others Piety drinks at the deep elemental sources of power and order it studies nature honours the past appropriates and continues its mission Spirituality uses the strength thus acquired remodelling all it receives and looking to the future and the ideal True religion is entirely human and political as was that of the ancient Hebrews Romans and Greeks Supernatural machinery is either symbolic of natural conditions and moral aims or else is worthless Sidenote Mysticism a primordial state of feeling There is one other phase or possible overtone of religion about which a word might be added in conclusion What is called mysticism is a certain genial loosening of convention whether rational or mythical the mystic smiles at science and plays with theology undermining both by force of his insight and inward assurance He is all faith all love all vision but he is each of these things in vacuo and in the absence of any object Mysticism can exist in varied degrees at any stage of rational development Its presence is therefore no indication of the worth or worthlessness of its possessor This circumstance tends to obscure its nature which would otherwise be obvious enough Seeing the greatest saints and philosophers grow mystical in their highest flights an innocent observer might imagine that mysticism was an ultimate attitude which only his own incapacity kept him from understanding But exactly the opposite is the case Mysticism is the most primitive of feelings and only visits formed minds in moments of intellectual arrest and dissolution It can exist in a child very likely in an animal indeed to parody a phrase of Hegel s the only pure mystics are the brutes When articulation fails in the face of experience when instinct guides without kindling any prophetic idea to which action may be inwardly referred when life and hope and joy flow through the soul from an unknown region to an unknown end then consciousness is mystical Such an experience may suffuse the best equipped mind if its primordial energies its will and emotions much outrun its intelligence Just as at the beginning pure inexperience may flounder intellectually and yet may have a sense of not going astray a sense of being carried by earth and sky by contagion and pleasure into its animal paradise so at the end if the vegetative forces still predominate all articulate experience may be lifted up and carried down stream bodily by the elementary flood rising from beneath Sidenote It may recur at any stage of culture Every religion all science all art is accordingly subject to incidental mysticism but in no case can mysticism stand alone and be the body or basis of anything In the Life of Reason it is if I may say so a normal disease a recurrent manifestation of lost equilibrium and interrupted growth but in these pauses when the depths rise to the surface and obliterate what scratches culture may have made there the rhythm of life may be more powerfully felt and the very disappearance of intellect may be taken for a revelation Both in a social and a psychological sense revelations come from beneath like earthquakes and volcanic eruptions and while they fill the spirit with contempt for those fragile structures which they so easily overwhelm they are utterly incapable of raising anything on the ruins If they leave something standing it is only by involuntary accident and if they prepare the soil for anything it is commonly only for wild flowers and weeds Revelations are seldom beneficent therefore unless there is more evil in the world to destroy than good to preserve and mysticism under the same circumstances may also liberate and relieve the spirit Sidenote Form gives substance its life and value The feelings which in mysticism rise to the surface and speak in their own name are simply the ancient overgrown feelings of vitality dependence inclusion they are the background of consciousness coming forward and blotting out the scene What mysticism destroys is in a sense its only legitimate expression The Life of Reason in so far as it is life contains the mystic s primordial assurances and his rudimentary joys but in so far as it is rational it has discovered what those assurances rest on in what direction they may be trusted to support action and thought and it has given those joys distinction and connexion turning a dumb momentary ecstasy into a many coloured and

THE BASIS OF ART IN INSTINCT AND EXPERIENCE Man affects his environment sometimes to good purpose Art is plastic instinct conscious of its aims It is automatic So are the ideas it expresses We are said to control whatever obeys us Utility is a result The useful naturally stable Intelligence is docility Art is reason propagating itself Beauty an incident in rational art inseparable from the others Pages three seventeen CHAPTER II RATIONALITY OF INDUSTRIAL ART Utility is ultimately ideal Work wasted and chances missed Ideals must be interpreted not prescribed The aim of industry is to live well Some arts but no men are slaves by nature Servile arts may grow spontaneous or their products may be renounced Art starts from two potentialities its material and its problem Each must be definite and congruous with the other A sophism exposed Industry prepares matter for the liberal arts Each partakes of the other Pages eighteen thirty three CHAPTER III EMERGENCE OF FINE ART Art is spontaneous action made stable by success It combines utility and automatism Automatism fundamental and irresponsible It is tamed by contact with the world The dance Functions of gesture Automatic music Pages thirty four forty three CHAPTER IV MUSIC Music is a world apart It justifies itself It is vital and transient Its physical affinities Physiology of music Limits of musical sensibility The value of music is relative to them Wonders of musical structure Its inherent emotions In growing specific they remain unearthly They merge with common emotions and express such as find no object in nature Music lends elementary feelings an intellectual communicable form All essences are in themselves good even the passions Each impulse calls for a possible congenial world Literature incapable of expressing pure feelings Music may do so Instability the soul of matter Peace the triumph of spirit Refinement is true strength Pages forty four sixty seven CHAPTER V SPEECH AND SIGNIFICATION Sounds well fitted to be symbols Language has a structure independent of things Words remaining identical serve to identify things that change Language the dialectical garment of facts Words are wise men s counters Nominalism right in psychology and realism in logic Literature moves between the extremes of music and denotation Sound and object in their sensuous presence may have affinity Syntax positively representative Yet it vitiates what it represents Difficulty in subduing a living medium Language foreshortens experience It is a perpetual mythology It may be apt or inapt with equal richness Absolute language a possible but foolish art Pages sixty eight eighty six CHAPTER VI POETRY AND PROSE Force of primary expressions Its exclusiveness and narrowness Rudimentary poetry an incantation or charm Inspiration irresponsible Plato s discriminating view Explosive and pregnant expression Natural history of inspiration Expressions to be understood must be recreated and so changed Expressions may be recast perversely humourously or sublimely The nature of prose It is more advanced and responsible than poetry Maturity brings love of practical truth Pure prose would tend to efface itself Form alone or substance alone may be poetical Poetry has its place in the medium It is the best medium possible Might it not convey what it is best to know A rational poetry would exclude much now thought poetical All apperception modifies its object Reason has its own bias and method Rational poetry would envelop exact knowledge in ultimate emotions An illustration Volume can be found in scope better than in suggestion Pages eighty seven one hundred fifteen CHAPTER VII PLASTIC CONSTRUCTION Automatic expression often leaves traces in the outer world Such effects fruitful Magic authority of man s first creations Art brings relief from idolatry Inertia in technique Inertia in appreciation Adventitious effects appreciated first Approach to beauty through useful structure Failure of adapted styles Not all structure beautiful nor all beauty structural Structures designed for display Appeal made by decoration Its natural rights Its alliance with structure in Greek architecture Relations of the two in Gothic art The result here romantic The mediaeval artist Representation introduced Transition to illustration Pages one hundred sixteen one hundred forty three CHAPTER VIII PLASTIC REPRESENTATION Psychology of imitation Sustained sensation involves reproduction Imitative art repeats with intent to repeat and in a new material Imitation leads to adaptation and to knowledge How the artist is inspired and irresponsible Need of knowing and loving the subject rendered Public interests determine the subject of art and the subject the medium Reproduction by acting ephemeral demands of sculpture It is essentially obsolete When men see groups and backgrounds they are natural painters Evolution of painting Sensuous and dramatic adequacy approached Essence of landscape painting Its threatened dissolution Reversion to pure decorative design Sensuous values are primordial and so indispensable Pages one hundred forty four one hundred sixty five CHAPTER IX JUSTIFICATION OF ART Art is subject to moral censorship Its initial or specific excellence is not enough All satisfactions however hurtful have an initial worth But on the whole artistic activity is innocent It is liberal and typical of perfect activity The ideal when incarnate becomes subject to civil society Plato s strictures he exaggerates the effect of myths His deeper moral objections Their lightness Importance of aesthetic alternatives The importance of aesthetic goods varies with temperaments The aesthetic temperament requires tutelage Aesthetic values everywhere interfused They are primordial To superpose them adventitiously is to destroy them They flow naturally from perfect function Even inhibited functions when they fall into a new rhythm yield new beauties He who loves beauty must chasten it Pages one hundred sixty six one hundred ninety CHAPTER X THE CRITERION OF TASTE Dogmatism is inevitable but may be enlightened Taste gains in authority as it is more and more widely based Different aesthetic endowments may be compared in quantity or force Authority of vital over verbal judgments Tastes differ also in purity or consistency They differ finally in pertinence and in width of appeal Art may grow classic by idealising the familiar or by reporting the ultimate Good taste demands that art should be rational i e harmonious with all other interests A mere work of art a baseless artifice Human uses give to works of art their highest expression and charm The sad values of appearance They need to be made prophetic of practical goods which in turn would be suffused with beauty Pages one hundred ninety one two hundred fifteen CHAPTER XI ART AND HAPPINESS Aesthetic harmonies are parodies of real ones which in turn would be suffused with beauty yet prototypes of true perfections Pros and cons of detached indulgences The happy imagination is one initially in line with things and brought always closer to them by experience Reason is the principle of both art and happiness Only a rational society can have sure and perfect arts Why art is now empty and unstable Anomalous character of the irrational artist True art measures and completes happiness Pages two hundred sixteen two hundred thirty REASON IN ART CHAPTER I THE BASIS OF ART IN INSTINCT AND EXPERIENCE Sidenote Man affects his environment sometimes to good purpose Man exists amid a universal ferment of being and not only needs plasticity in his habits and pursuits but finds plasticity also in the surrounding world Life is an equilibrium which is maintained now by accepting modification and now by imposing it Since the organ for all activity is a body in mechanical relation to other material objects objects which the creature s instincts often compel him to appropriate or transform changes in his habits and pursuits leave their mark on whatever he touches His habitat must needs bear many a trace of his presence from which intelligent observers might infer something about his life and action These vestiges of action are for the most part imprinted unconsciously and aimlessly on the world They are in themselves generally useless like footprints and yet almost any sign of man s passage might under certain conditions interest a man A footprint could fill Robinson Crusoe with emotion the devastation wrought by an army s march might prove many things to a historian and even the disorder in which a room is casually left may express very vividly the owner s ways and character Sometimes however man s traces are traces of useful action which has so changed natural objects as to make them congenial to his mind Instead of a footprint we might find an arrow instead of a disordered room a well planted orchard things which would not only have betrayed the agent s habits but would have served and expressed his intent Such propitious forms given by man to matter are no less instrumental in the Life of Reason than are propitious forms assumed by man s own habit or fancy Any operation which thus humanises and rationalises objects is called art Sidenote Art is plastic instinct conscious of its aim All art has an instinctive source and a material embodiment If the birds in building nests felt the utility of what they do they would be practising an art and for the instinct to be called rational it would even suffice that their traditional purpose and method should become conscious occasionally Thus weaving is an art although the weaver may not be at every moment conscious of its purpose but may be carried along like any other workman by the routine of his art and language is a rational product not because it always has a use or meaning but because it is sometimes felt to have one Arts are no less automatic than instincts and usually as Aristotle observed less thoroughly purposive for instincts being transmitted by inheritance and imbedded in congenital structure have to be economically and deeply organised If they go far wrong they constitute a burden impossible to throw off and impossible to bear The man harassed by inordinate instincts perishes through want vice disease or madness Arts on the contrary being transmitted only by imitation and teaching hover more lightly over life If ill adjusted they make less havoc and cause less drain The more superficial they are and the more detached from practical habits the more extravagant and meaningless they can dare to become so that the higher products of life are the most often gratuitous No instinct or institution was ever so absurd as is a large part of human poetry and philosophy while the margin of ineptitude is much broader in religious myth than in religious ethics Sidenote It is automatic Arts are instincts bred and reared in the open creative habits acquired in the light of reason Consciousness accompanies their formation a certain uneasiness or desire and a more or less definite conception of what is wanted often precedes their full organisation That the need should be felt before the means for satisfying it have been found has led the unreflecting to imagine that in art the need produces the discovery and the idea the work Causes at best are lightly assigned by mortals and this particular superstition is no worse than any other The data the plan and its execution as conjoined empirically in the few interesting cases which show successful achievement are made into a law in oblivion of the fact that in more numerous cases such conjunction fails wholly or in part and that even in the successful cases other natural conditions are present and must be present to secure the result In a matter where custom is so ingrained and supported by a constant apperceptive illusion there is little hope of making thought suddenly exact or exact language not paradoxical We must observe however that only by virtue of a false perspective do ideas seems to govern action or is a felt necessity the mother of invention In truth invention is the child of abundance and the genius or vital premonition and groping which achieve art simultaneously achieve the ideas which that art embodies or rather ideas are themselves products of an inner movement which has an automatic extension outwards and this extension manifests the ideas Mere craving has no lights of its own to prophesy by no prescience of what the world may contain that would satisfy no power of imagining what would allay its unrest Images and satisfactions have to come of themselves then the blind craving as it turns into an incipient pleasure first recognises its object The pure will s impotence is absolute and it would writhe for ever and consume itself in darkness if perception gave it no light and experience no premonition Sidenote So are the ideas it expresses Now a man cannot draw bodily from external perception the ideas he is supposed to create or invent and as his will or uneasiness before he creates the satisfying ideas is by hypothesis without them it follows that creation or invention is automatic The ideas come of themselves being new and unthought of figments similar no doubt to old perceptions and compacted of familiar materials but reproduced in a novel fashion and dropping in their sudden form from the blue However instantly they may be welcomed they were not already known and never could have been summoned In the stock example for instance of groping for a forgotten name we know the context in which that name should lie we feel the environment of our local void but what finally pops into that place reinstated there by the surrounding tensions is itself unforeseen for it was just this that was forgotten Could we have invoked the name we should not have needed to do so having it already at our disposal It is in fact a palpable impossibility that any idea should call itself into being or that any act or any preference should be its own ground The responsibility assumed for these things is not a determination to conceive them before they are conceived which is a contradiction in terms but an embrace and appropriation of them once they have appeared It is thus that ebullitions in parts of our nature become touchstones for the whole and the incidents within us seem hardly our own work till they are accepted and incorporated into the main current of our being All invention is tentative all art experimental and to be sought like salvation with fear and trembling There is a painful pregnancy in genius a long incubation and waiting for the spirit a thousand rejections and futile birth pangs before the wonderful child appears a gift of the gods utterly undeserved and inexplicably perfect Even this unaccountable success comes only in rare and fortunate instances What is ordinarily produced is so base a hybrid so lame and ridiculous a changeling that we reconcile ourselves with difficulty to our offspring and blush to be represented by our fated works Sidenote We are said to control whatever obeys us The propensity to attribute happy events to our own agency little as we understand what we mean by it and to attribute only untoward results to external forces has its ground in the primitive nexus of experience What we call ourselves is a certain cycle of vegetative processes bringing a round of familiar impulses and ideas this stream has a general direction a conscious vital inertia in harmony with which it moves Many of the developments within it are dialectical that is they go forward by inner necessity like an egg hatching within its shell warmed but undisturbed by an environment of which they are wholly oblivious and this sort of growth when there is adequate consciousness of it is felt to be both absolutely obvious and absolutely free The emotion that accompanies it is pleasurable but is too active and proud to call itself a pleasure it has rather the quality of assurance and right This part of life however is only its courageous core about it play all sorts of incidental processes allying themselves to it in more or less congruous movement Whatever peripheral events fall in with the central impulse are accordingly lost in its energy and felt to be not so much peripheral and accidental as inwardly grounded being like the stages of a prosperous dialectic spontaneously demanded and instantly justified when they come The sphere of the self s power is accordingly for primitive consciousness simply the sphere of what happens well it is the entire unoffending and obedient part of the world A man who has good luck at dice prides himself upon it and believes that to have it is his destiny and desert If his luck were absolutely constant he would say he had the power to throw high and as the event would by hypothesis sustain his boast there would be no practical error in that assumption A will that never found anything to thwart it would think itself omnipotent and as the psychological essence of omniscience is not to suspect there is anything which you do not know so the psychological essence of omnipotence is not to suspect that anything can happen which you do not desire Such claims would undoubtedly be made if experience lent them the least colour but would even the most comfortable and innocent assurances of this sort cease to be precarious Might not any moment of eternity bring the unimagined contradiction and shake the dreaming god Sidenote Utility is a result Utility like significance is an eventual harmony in the arts and by no means their ground All useful things have been discovered as the Lilliputians discovered roast pig and the casual feat has furthermore to be supported by a situation favourable to maintaining the art The most useful act will never be repeated unless its secret remains embodied in structure Practice and endeavour will not help an artist to remain long at his best and many a performance is applauded which cannot be imitated To create the requisite structure two preformed structures are needed one in the agent to give him skill and perseverance and another in the material to give it the right plasticity Human progress would long ago have reached its goal if every man who recognised a good could at once appropriate it and possess wisdom for ever by virtue of one moment s insight Insight unfortunately is in itself perfectly useless and inconsequential it can neither have produced its own occasion nor now insure its own recurrence Nevertheless being proof positive that whatever basis it needs is actual insight is also an indication that the extant structure if circumstances maintain it may continue to operate with the same moral results maintaining the vision which it has once supported Sidenote The useful naturally stable When men find that by chance they have started a useful change in the world they congratulate themselves upon it and call their persistence in that practice a free activity And the activity is indeed rational since it subserves an end The happy organisation which enables us to continue in that rational course is the very organisation which enabled us to initiate it If this new process was formed under external influences the same influences when they operate again will reconstitute the process each time more easily while if it was formed quite spontaneously its own inertia will maintain it quietly in the brain and bring it to the surface whenever circumstances permit This is what is called learning by experience Such lessons are far from indelible and are not always at command Yet what has once been done may be repeated repetition reinforces itself and becomes habit and a clear memory of the benefit once attained by fortunate action representing as it does the trace left by that action in the system and its harmony with the man s usual impulses for the action is felt to be beneficial constitutes a strong presumption that the act will be repeated automatically on occasion i e that it has really been learned Consciousness which willingly attends to results only will judge either the memory or the benefit or both confusedly to be the ground of this readiness to act and only if some hitch occurs in the machinery so that rational behaviour fails to takes place will a surprised appeal be made to material accidents or to a guilty forgetfulness or indocility in the soul Sidenote Intelligence is docility The idiot cannot learn from experience at all because a new process in his liquid brain does not modify structure while the fool uses what he has learned only inaptly and in frivolous fragments because his stretches of linked experience are short and their connections insecure But when the cerebral plasm is fresh and well disposed and when the paths are clear attention is consecutive and learning easy a multitude of details can be gathered into a single cycle of memory or of potential regard Under such circumstances action is the unimpeded expression of healthy instinct in an environment squarely faced Conduct from the first then issues in progress and by reinforcing its own organisation at each rehearsal makes progress continual For there will subsist not only a readiness to act and a great precision in action but if any significant circumstance has varied in the conditions or in the interests at stake this change will make itself felt it will check the process and prevent precipitate action Deliberation or well founded scruple has the same source as facility a plastic and quick organisation To be sensitive to difficulties and dangers goes with being sensitive to opportunities Sidenote Art is reason propagating itself Of all reason s embodiments art is therefore the most splendid and complete Merely to attain categories by which inner experience may be articulated or to feign analogies by which a universe may be conceived would be but a visionary triumph if it remained ineffectual and went with no actual remodelling of the outer world to render man s dwelling more appropriate and his mind better fed and more largely transmissible Mind grows self perpetuating only by its expression in matter What makes progress possible is that rational action may leave traces in nature such that nature in consequence furnishes a better basis for the Life of Reason in other words progress is art bettering the conditions of existence Until art arises all achievement is internal to the brain dies with the individual and even in him spends itself without recovery like music heard in a dream Art in establishing instruments for human life beyond the human body and moulding outer things into sympathy with inner values establishes a ground whence values may continually spring up the thatch that protects from to day s rain will last and keep out to morrow s rain also the sign that once expresses an idea will serve to recall it in future Not only does the work of art thus perpetuate its own function and produce a better experience but the process of art also perpetuates itself because it is teachable Every animal learns something by living but if his offspring inherit only what he possessed at birth they have to learn life s lessons over again from the beginning with at best some vague help given by their parents example But when the fruits of experience exist in the common environment when new instruments unknown to nature are offered to each individual for his better equipment although he must still learn for himself how to live he may learn in a humaner school where artificial occasions are constantly open to him for expanding his powers It is no longer merely hidden inner processes that he must reproduce to attain his predecessors wisdom he may acquire much of it more expeditiously by imitating their outward habit an imitation which furthermore they have some means of exacting from him Wherever there is art there is a possibility of training A father who calls his idle sons from the jungle to help him hold the plough not only inures them to labour but compels them to observe the earth upturned and refreshed and to watch the germination there their wandering thought their incipient rebellions will be met by the hope of harvest and it will not be impossible for them when their father is dead to follow the plough of their own initiative and for their own children s sake So great is the sustained advance in rationality made possible by art which being embodied in matter is teachable and transmissible by training for in art the values secured are recognised the more easily for having been first enjoyed when other people furnished the means to them while the maintenance of these values is facilitated by an external tradition imposing itself contagiously or by force on each new generation Sidenote Beauty an incident in rational art Art is action which transcending the body makes the world a more congenial stimulus to the soul All art is therefore useful and practical and the notable aesthetic value which some works of art possess for reasons flowing for the most part out of their moral significance is itself one of the satisfactions which art offers to human nature as a whole Between sensation and abstract discourse lies a region of deployed sensibility or synthetic representation a region where more is seen at arm s length than in any one moment could be felt at close quarters and yet where the remote parts of experience which discourse reaches only through symbols are recovered and recomposed in something like their native colours and experienced relations This region called imagination has pleasures more airy and luminous than those of sense more massive and rapturous than those of intelligence The values inherent in imagination in instant intuition in sense endowed with form are called aesthetic values they are found mainly in nature and living beings but often also in man s artificial works in images evoked by language and in the realm of sound Sidenote Inseparable from the others Productions in which an aesthetic value is or is supposed to be prominent take the name of fine art but the work of fine art so defined is almost always an abstraction from the actual object which has many non aesthetic functions and values To separate the aesthetic element abstract and dependent as it often is is an artifice which is more misleading than helpful for neither in the history of art nor in a rational estimate of its value can the aesthetic function of things be divorced from the practical and moral What had to be done was by imaginative races done imaginatively what had to be spoken or made was spoken or made fitly lovingly beautifully Or to take the matter up on its psychological side the ceaseless experimentation and ferment of ideas in breeding what it had a propensity to breed came sometimes on figments that gave it delightful pause these beauties were the first knowledges and these arrests the first hints of real and useful things The rose s grace could more easily be plucked from its petals than the beauty of art from its subject occasion and use An aesthetic fragrance indeed all things may have if in soliciting man s senses or reason they can awaken his imagination as well but this middle zone is so mixed and nebulous and its limits are so vague that it cannot well be treated in theory otherwise than as it exists in fact as a phase of man s sympathy with the world he moves in If art is that element in the Life of Reason which consists in modifying its environment the better to attain its end art may be expected to subserve all parts of the human ideal to increase man s comfort knowledge and delight And as nature in her measure is wont to satisfy these interests together so art in seeking to increase that satisfaction will work simultaneously in every ideal direction Nor will any of these directions be on the whole good or tempt a well trained will if it leads to estrangement from all other interests The aesthetic good will be accordingly hatched in the same nest with the others and incapable of flying far in a different air CHAPTER II RATIONALITY OF INDUSTRIAL ART Sidenote Utility is ultimately ideal If there were anything wholly instrumental or merely useful its rationality such as it was would be perfectly obvious Such a thing would be exhaustively defined by its result and conditioned exclusively by its expediency Yet the value of most human arts mechanical as they may appear has a somewhat doubtful and mixed character Naval architecture for instance serves a clear immediate purpose Yet to cross the sea is not an ultimate good and the ambition or curiosity that first led man being a land animal to that now vulgar adventure has sometimes found moralists to condemn it A vessel s true excellence is more deeply conditioned than the ship wright may imagine when he prides himself on having made something that will float and go The best battle ship or racing yacht or freight steamer might turn out to be a worse thing for its specific excellence if the action it facilitated proved on the whole maleficent and if war or racing or trade could be rightly condemned by a philosopher The rationality of ship building has several sets of conditions the patron s demands must be first fulfilled then the patron s specifications have to be judged by the purpose he in turn has in mind this purpose itself has to be justified by his ideal in life and finally his ideal by its adequacy to his total or ultimate nature Error on any of these planes makes the ultimate product irrational and if a finer instinct even in the midst of absorbing subsidiary action warns a man that he is working against his highest good his art will lose its savour and its most skilful products will grow hateful even to his immediate apprehension infected as they will be by the canker of folly Sidenote Work wasted and chances missed Art thus has its casuistry no less than morals and philosophers in the future if man should at last have ceased to battle with ghosts might be called upon to review material civilisation from its beginnings testing each complication by its known ultimate fruits and reaching in this way a purified and organic ideal of human industry an ideal which education and political action might help to embody If nakedness or a single garment were shown to be wholesomer and more agreeable than complicated clothes weavers and tailors might be notably diminished in number If in another quarter popular fancy should sicken at last of its traditional round of games and fictions it might discover infinite entertainment in the play of reality and truth and infinite novelties to be created by fruitful labour so that many a pleasure might be found which is now clogged by mere apathy and unintelligence Human genius like a foolish Endymion lies fast asleep amid its opportunities wasting itself in dreams and disinheriting itself by negligence Sidenote Ideals must be interpreted not prescribed Descriptive economy however will have to make great progress before the concrete ethics of art can be properly composed History conceived hitherto as a barbarous romance does not furnish sufficient data by which the happiness of life under various conditions may be soberly estimated Politics has receded into the region of blind impulse and factional interests and would need to be reconstituted before it could approach again that scientific problem which Socrates and his great disciples would have wished it to solve Meantime it may not be premature to say something about another factor in practical philosophy namely the ultimate interests by which industrial arts and their products have to be estimated Even before we know the exact effects of an institution we can fix to some extent the purposes which in order to be beneficent it will have to subserve although in truth such antecedent fixing of aims cannot go far seeing that every operation reacts on the organ that executes it thereby modifying the ideal involved Doubtless the most industrial people would still wish to be happy and might accordingly lay down certain principles which its industry should never transgress as for instance that production should at any price leave room for liberty leisure beauty and a spirit of general company operation and goodwill But a people once having become industrial will hardly be happy if sent back to Arcadia it will have formed busy habits which it cannot relax without tedium it will have developed a restlessness and avidity which will crave matter like any other kind of hunger Every experiment in living qualifies the initial possibilities of life and the moralist would reckon without his host if he did not allow for the change which forced exercise makes in instinct adjusting it more or less to extant conditions originally perhaps unwelcome It is too late for the highest good to prescribe flying for quadrupeds or peace for the sea waves What antecedent interest does mechanical art subserve What is the initial and commanding ideal of life by which all industrial developments are to be proved rational or condemned as vain If we look to the most sordid and instrumental of industries we see that their purpose is to produce a foreordained result with the minimum of effort They serve in a word to cheapen commodities But the value of such an achievement is clearly not final it hangs on two underlying ideals one demanding abundance in the things produced and the other diminution in the toil required to produce them At least the latter interest may in turn be analysed further for to diminish toil is itself no absolute good it is a good only when such diminution in one sphere liberates energies which may be employed in other fields so that the total human accomplishment may be greater Doubtless useful labour has its natural limits for if overdone any activity may impair the power of enjoying both its fruits and its operation Yet in so far as labour can become spontaneous and in itself delightful it is a positive benefit and to its intrinsic value must be added all those possessions or useful dispositions which it may secure Thus one ideal to diminish labour falls back into the other to diffuse occasions for enjoyment The aim is not to curtail occupation but rather to render occupation liberal by supplying it with more appropriate objects Sidenote The aim of industry is to live well It is then liberal life fostered by industry and commerce or involved in them that alone can justify these instrumental pursuits Those philosophers whose ethics is nothing but sentimental physics like to point out that happiness arises out of work and that compulsory activities dutifully performed underlie freedom Of course matter or force underlies everything but rationality does not accrue to spirit because mechanism supports it it accrues to mechanism in so far as spirit is thereby called into existence so that while values derive existence only from their causes causes derive value only from their results Functions cannot be exercised until their organs exist and are in operation so that what is primary in the order of genesis is always last and most dependent in the order of worth The primary substance of things is their mere material their first cause is their lowest instrument Matter has only the values of the forms which it assumes and while each stratification may create some intrinsic ideal and achieve some good these goods are dull and fleeting in proportion to their rudimentary character and their nearness to protoplasmic thrills Where reason exists life cannot indeed be altogether slavish for any operation however menial and fragmentary when it is accompanied by ideal representation of the ends pursued and by felt success in attaining them becomes a sample and anagram of all freedom Nevertheless to arrest attention on a means is really illiberal though not so much by what such an interest contains as by what it ignores Happiness in a treadmill is far from inconceivable but for that happiness to be rational the wheel should be nothing less than the whole sky from which influences can descend upon us There would be meanness of soul in being content with a smaller sphere so that not everything that was relevant to our welfare should be envisaged in our thoughts and purposes To be absorbed by the incidental is the animal s portion to be confined to the instrumental is the slave s For though within such activity there may be a rational movement the activity ends in a fog and in mere physical drifting Happiness has to be begged of fortune or found in mystical indifference it is not yet subtended by rational art Sidenote Some arts but no men are slaves by nature The Aristotelian theory of slavery in making servile action wholly subservient sins indeed against persons but not against arts It sins against persons because there is inconsiderate haste in asserting that whole classes of men are capable of no activities except the physical which justify themselves inherently The lower animals also have physical interests and natural emotions A man if he deserves the name must be credited with some rational capacity prospect and retrospect hope and the ideal portraiture of things must to some extent employ him Freedom to cultivate these interests is then his inherent right As the lion vindicates his prerogative to ferocity and dignity so every rational creature vindicates his prerogative to spiritual freedom But a too summary classification of individuals covers in Aristotle a just discrimination among the arts In so far as a man s occupation is merely instrumental and justified only externally he is obviously a slave and his art at best an evil necessity For the operation is by hypothesis not its own end and if the product needful for some ulterior purpose had been found ready made in nature the other and self justifying activities could have gone on unimpeded without the arrest or dislocation which is involved in first establishing the needful conditions for right action If air had to be manufactured as dwellings must be or breathing to be learned like speech mankind would start with an even greater handicap and would never have come within sight of such goals as it can now pursue Thus all instrumental and remedial arts however indispensable are pure burdens and progress consists in abridging them as much as is possible without contracting the basis for moral life Sidenote Servile arts may grow spontaneous or their products may be renounced This needful abridgment can take place in two directions The art may become instinctive unconscious of the utility that backs it and conscious only of the solicitation that leads it on In that measure human nature is adapted to its conditions lessons long dictated by experience are actually learned and become hereditary habits So inclination to hunt and fondness for nursing children have passed into instincts in the human race and what if it were a forced art would be servile by becoming spontaneous has risen to be an ingredient in ideal life for sport and maternity are human ideals In an opposite direction servile arts may be abridged by a lapse of the demand which required them The servile art of vine dressers for instance would meet such a fate if the course of history instead of tending to make the vintage an ideal episode and to create worshippers of Bacchus and Priapus tended rather to bring about a distaste for wine and made the whole industry superfluous This solution is certainly less happy than the other insomuch as it suppresses a function instead of taking it up into organic life yet life to be organic has to be exclusive and finite it has to work out specific tendencies in a specific environment and therefore to surrender a particular impeded impulse may involve a clear gain if only a compensating unimpeded good thereby comes to light elsewhere If wine disappeared with all its humane and symbolic consecrations that loss might bring an ultimate gain could some less treacherous friend of frankness and merriment be thereby brought into the world In practice servile art is usually mitigated by combining these two methods the demand subserved being but ill supported learns to restrain itself and be less importunate while at the same time habit renders the labour which was once unwilling largely automatic and even overlays it with ideal associations Human nature is happily elastic there is hardly a need that may not be muffled or suspended and hardly an employment that may not be relieved by the automatic interest with which it comes to be pursued To this automatic interest other palliatives are often added sometimes religion sometimes mere dulness and resignation but in these cases the evil imposed is merely counterbalanced or forgotten it is not remedied Reflective and spiritual races minimise labour by renunciation for they find it easier to give up its fruits than to justify its exactions Among energetic and self willed men on the contrary the demand for material progress remains predominant and philosophy dwells by preference on the possibility that a violent and continual subjection in the present might issue in a glorious future dominion This possible result was hardly realised by the Jews nor long maintained by the Greeks and Romans and it remains to be seen whether modern industrialism can achieve it In fact we may suspect that success only comes when a nation s external task happens to coincide with its natural genius so that a minimum of its labour is servile and a maximum of its play is beneficial It is in such cases that we find colossal achievements and apparently inexhaustible energies Prosperity is indeed the basis of every ideal attainment so that prematurely to recoil from hardship or to be habitually conscious of hardship at all amounts to renouncing beforehand all earthly goods and all chance of spiritual greatness Yet a chance is no certainty When glory requires Titanic labours it often finds itself in the end buried under a pyramid rather than raised upon a pedestal Energies which are not from the beginning self justifying and flooded with light seldom lead to ideal greatness Sidenote Art starts from two potentialities its material and its problem The action to which industry should minister is accordingly liberal or spontaneous action and this one condition of rationality in from two the arts But a second condition is implicit in the first freedom means freedom in some operation ideality means the ideality of something embodied and material Activity achievement a passage from prospect to realisation is evidently essential to life If all ends were already reached and no art were requisite life could not exist at all much less a Life of Reason No politics no morals no thought would be possible for all these move towards some ideal and envisage a goal to which they presently pass The transition is the activity without which achievement would lose its zest and indeed its meaning for a situation could never be achieved which had been given from all eternity The ideal is a concomitant emanation from the natural and has no other possible status Those human possessions which are perennial and of inalienable value are in a manner potential possessions only Knowledge art love are always largely in abeyance while power is absolutely synonymous with potentiality Fruition requires a continual recovery a repeated re establishment of the state we enjoy So breath and nutrition feeling and thought come in pulsations they have only a periodic and rhythmic sort of actuality The operation may be sustained indefinitely but only if it admits a certain internal oscillation A creature like man whose mode of being is a life or experience and not a congealed ideality such as eternal truth might show must accordingly find something to do he must operate in an environment in which everything is not already what he is presently to make it In the actual world this first condition of life is only too amply fulfilled the real difficulty in man s estate the true danger to his vitality lies not in want of work but in so colossal a disproportion between demand and opportunity that the ideal is stunned out of existence and perishes for want of hope The Life of Reason is continually beaten back upon its animal sources and nations are submerged in deluge after deluge of barbarism Impressed as we may well be by this ancient experience we should not overlook the complementary truth which under more favourable circumstances would be as plain as the other namely that our deepest interest is after all to live and we could not live if all acquisition assimilation government and creation had been made impossible for us by their foregone realisation so that every operation was forestalled by the given fact The distinction between the ideal and the real is one which the human ideal itself insists should be preserved It is an essential expression of life and its disappearance would be tantamount to death making an end to voluntary transition and ideal representation All objects envisaged either in vulgar action or in the airiest cognition must be at first ideal and distinct from the given facts otherwise action would have lost its function at the same moment that thought lost its significance All life would have collapsed into a purposeless datum The ideal requires then that opportunities should be offered for realising it through action and that transition should be possible to it from a given state of things One form of such transition is art where the ideal is a possible and more excellent form to be given to some external substance or medium Art needs to find a material relatively formless which its business is to shape and this initial formlessness in matter is essential to art s existence Were there no stone not yet sculptured and built into walls no sentiment not yet perfectly uttered in poetry no distance or oblivion yet to be abolished by motion or inferential thought activity of all sorts would have lost its occasion Matter or actuality in what is only potentially ideal is therefore a necessary condition for realising an ideal at all Sidenote Each must be definite and congruous with the other This potentiality however in so far as the ideal requires it is a quite definite disposition Absolute chaos would defeat life as surely as would absolute ideality Activity in presupposing material conditions presupposes them to be favourable so that a movement towards the ideal may actually take place Matter which from the point of view of a given ideal is merely its potentiality is in itself the potentiality of every other ideal as well it is accordingly responsible to no ideal in particular and proves in some measure refractory to all It makes itself felt either as an opportune material or as an accidental hindrance only when it already possesses definite form and affinities given in a certain quantity quality and order matter feeds the specific life which if given otherwise it would impede or smother altogether Sidenote A sophism exposed Art in calling for materials calls for materials plastic to its influence and definitely predisposed to its ends Unsuitableness in the data far from grounding action renders it abortive and no expedient could be more sophistical than that into which theodicy in its desperate straits has sometimes been driven of trying to justify as conditions for ideal achievement the very conditions which make ideal achievement impossible The given state from which transition is to take place to the ideal must support that transition so that the desirable want of ideality which plastic matter should possess is merely relative and strictly determined Art and reason find in nature the background they require but nature to be wholly justified by its ideal functions would have to subserve them perfectly It would have to offer to reason and art a sufficient and favourable basis it would have to feed sense with the right stimuli at the right intervals so that art and reason might continually flourish and be always moving to some new success A poet needs emotions and perceptions to translate into language since these are his subject matter and his inspiration but starvation physical or moral will not help him to sing One thing is to meet with the conditions inherently necessary for a given action another thing is to meet with obstacles fatal to the same A propitious formlessness in matter is no sort of evil and evil is so far from being a propitious formlessness in matter that it is rather an impeding form which matter has already assumed Sidenote Industry prepares matter for the liberal arts Out of this appears with sufficient clearness the rational function which the arts possess They give as nature does a form to matter but they give it a more propitious form Such success in art is possible only when the materials and organs at hand are in a large measure already well disposed for it can as little exist with a dull organ as with no organ at all while there are winds in which every sail must be furled Art depends upon profiting by a bonanza and learning to sail in a good breeze strong enough for speed and conscious power but placable enough for dominion and liberty of soul Then perfection in action can be attained and a self justifying energy can emerge out of apathy on the one hand and out of servile and wasteful work on the other Art has accordingly two stages one mechanical or industrial in which untoward matter is better prepared or impeding media are overcome the other liberal in which perfectly fit matter is appropriated to ideal uses and endowed with a direct spiritual function A premonition or rehearsal of these two stages may be seen in nature where nutrition and reproduction fit the body for its ideal functions whereupon sensation and cerebration make it a direct organ of mind Industry merely gives nature that form which if more thoroughly humane she might have originally possessed for our benefit liberal arts bring to spiritual fruition the matter which either nature or industry has prepared and rendered propitious This spiritual fruition consists in the activity of turning an apt material into an expressive and delightful form thus filling the world with objects which by symbolising ideal energies tend to revive them under a favouring influence and therefore to strengthen and refine them Sidenote Each partakes of the other It remains merely to note that all industry contains an element of fine art and all fine art an element of industry since every proximate end in being attained satisfies the mind and manifests the intent that pursued it while every operation upon a material even one so volatile as sound finds that material somewhat refractory Before the product can attain its ideal function many obstacles to its transparency and fitness have to be removed A certain amount of technical and instrumental labour is thus involved in every work of genius and a certain genius in every technical success CHAPTER III EMERGENCE OF FINE ART Sidenote Art is spontaneous action made stable by success Action which is purely spontaneous is merely tentative Any experience of success or utility which might have preceded if it availed to make action sure would avail to make it also intentional and conscious of its ulterior results Now the actual issue which an action is destined to have since it is something future and problematical can exert no influence on its own antecedents but if any picture of what the issue is likely to be accompanies the heat and momentum of action that picture being of all antecedents in the operation the one most easily remembered and described may be picked out as essential and dignified with the name of motive or cause This will not happen to every prophetic idea we may live in fear and trembling as easily as with an arrogant consciousness of power The difference flows from the greater or lesser affinity that happens to exist between expectation and instinct Action remains always in its initial phase spontaneous and automatic it retains an inwardly grounded and perfectly blind tendency of its own but this tendency may agree or clash with the motor impulses subtending whatever ideas may at the same time people the fancy If the blind and the ideal impulses agree spontaneous action is voluntary and its result intentional if they clash the ideas remain speculative and idle random ineffectual wishes while the result not being referable to any idea is put down to fate The sense of power accordingly shows either that events have largely satisfied desire so that natural tendency goes hand in hand with the suggestions of experience or else that experience has not been allowed to count at all and that the future is being painted a priori In the latter case the sense of power is illusory Action will then never really issue in the way intended and even thought will only seem to make progress by constantly forgetting its original direction Though life however is initially experimental and always remains experimental at bottom yet experiment fortifies certain tendencies and cancels others so that a gradual sediment of habit and wisdom is formed in the stream of time Action then ceases to be merely tentative and spontaneous and becomes art Foresight begins to accompany practice and as we say to guide it Purpose thus supervenes on useful impulse and conscious expression on self sustaining automatism Art lies between two extremes On the one side is purely spontaneous fancy which would never foresee its own works and scarcely recognise or value them after they had been created since at the next moment the imaginative current would as likely as not have faced about and might be making in the opposite direction and on the other side is pure utility which would deprive the work of all inherent ideality and render it inexpressive of anything in man save his necessities War for instance is an art when having set itself an ideal end it devises means of attaining it but this ideal end has for its chief basis some failure in politics and morals War marks a weakness and disease in human society and its best triumphs are glorious evils cruel and treacherous remedies big with new germs of disease War is accordingly a servile art and not essentially liberal whatever inherent values its exercise may have would better be realised in another medium Yet out of the pomp and circumstance of war fine arts may arise music armoury heraldry and eloquence So utility leads to art when its vehicle acquires intrinsic value and becomes expressive On the other hand spontaneous action leads to art when it acquires a rational function Thus utterance which is primarily automatic becomes the art of speech when it serves to mark crises in experience making them more memorable and influential through their artificial expression but expression is never art while it remains expressive to no purpose Sidenote It combines utility and automatism A good way of understanding the fine arts would be to study how they grow now out of utility now out of automatism We should thus see more clearly how they approach their goal which can be nothing but the complete superposition of these two characters If all practice were art and all art perfect no action would remain compulsory and not justified inherently while no creative impulse would any longer be wasteful or like the impulse to thrum symptomatic merely and irrelevant to progress It is by contributing to the Life of Reason and merging into its substance that art like religion or science first becomes worthy of praise Each element comes from a different quarter bringing its specific excellence and needing its peculiar purification and enlightenment by company ordination with all the others and this process of enlightenment and purification is what we call development in each department The meanest arts are those which lie near the limit either of utility or of automatic self expression They become nobler and more rational as their utility is rendered spontaneous or their spontaneity beneficent Sidenote Automatism fundamental and irresponsible The spontaneous arts are older than the useful since man must live and act before he can devise instruments for living and acting better Both the power to construct machines and the end which to be useful they would have to serve need to be given in initial impulse There is accordingly a vast amount of irresponsible play and loose experiment in art as in consciousness before these gropings acquire a settled habit and function and rationality begins The farther back we go into barbarism the more we find life and mind busied with luxuries and though these indulgences may repel a cultivated taste and seem in the end cruel and monotonous their status is really nearer to that of religion and spontaneous art than to that of useful art or of science Ceremony for instance is compulsory in society and sometimes truly oppressive yet its root lies in self expression and in a certain ascendency of play which drags all life along into conventional channels originally dug out in irresponsible bursts of action This occurs inevitably and according to physical analogies Bodily organs grow automatically and become necessary moulds of life We must either find a use for them or bear as best we may the idle burden they impose Of such burdens the barbarian carries the greatest possible sum and while he paints the heavens with his grotesque mythologies he encumbers earth with inventions and prescriptions almost as gratuitous The fiendish dances and shouts the cruel initiations mutilations and sacrifices in which savages indulge are not planned by them deliberately nor justified in reflection Men find themselves falling into these practices driven by a tradition hardly distinguishable from instinct In its periodic fury the spirit hurries them into wars and orgies quite as it kindles sudden flaming visions in their brains habitually so torpid The spontaneous is the worst of tyrants for it exercises a needless and fruitless tyranny in the guise of duty and inspiration Without mitigating in the least the subjection to external forces under which man necessarily labours it adds a new artificial subjection to his own false steps and childish errors Sidenote It is tamed by contact with the world This mental vegetation this fitful nervous groping is nevertheless a sign of life out of which art emerges by discipline and by a gradual application to real issues An artist is a dreamer consenting to dream of the actual world he is a highly suggestible mind hypnotised by reality Even barbaric genius may find points of application in the world These points will be more numerous the more open the eyes have been the more docile and intelligent the mind is that gathers and renders back its impressions in a synthetic and ideal form Intuition will then represent at least symbolically an actual situation Grimace and gesture and ceremony will be modified by a sense of their effect they will become artful and will transform their automatic expressiveness into ideal expression They will become significant of what it is intended to communicate and important to know they will have ceased to be irresponsible exercises and vents for passing feeling by which feeling is dissipated as in tears without being embodied and intellectualised as in a work of art Sidenote The dance Sidenote Functions of gesture The dance is an early practice that passes after this fashion into an art A prancing stallion may transfigure his movements more beautifully than man is capable of doing for the springs and limits of effect are throughout mechanical and man in more than one respect would have to become a centaur before he could rival the horse s prowess Human instinct is very imperfect in this direction and grows less happy the more artificial society becomes most dances even the savage ones are somewhat ridiculous A rudimentary instinct none the less remains which not only involves a faculty of heightened and rhythmic motion but also assures a direct appreciation of such motion when seen in others The conscious agility fougue and precision which fill the performer become contagious and delight the spectator as well There are indeed dances so ugly that like those of contemporary society they cannot be enjoyed unless they are shared they yield pleasures of exercise only or at best of movement in unison But when man was nearer to the animal and his body and soul were in happier conjunction when society too was more compulsive over the individual he could lend himself more willingly and gracefully to being a figure in the general pageant of the world The dance could then detach itself from its early association with war and courtship and ally itself rather to religion and art From being a spontaneous vent for excitement or a blind means of producing it the dance became a form of discipline and conscious social control a cathartic for the soul and this by a quite intelligible transition Gesture of which the dance is merely a pervasive use is an incipient action It is conduct in the groping stage before it has lit on its purpose as can be seen unmistakably in all the gesticulation of love and defiance In this way the dance is attached to life initially by its physiological origin Being an incipient act it naturally leads to its own completion and may arouse in others the beginnings of an appropriate response Gesture is only less catching and less eloquent than action itself But gesture while it has this power of suggesting action and stimulating the response which would be appropriate if the action took place may be arrested in the process of execution since it is incipient only it will then have revealed an intention and betrayed a state of mind Thus it will have found a function which action itself can seldom fulfil When an act is done indications of what it was to be are superfluous but indications of possible acts are in the highest degree useful and interesting In this way gesture assumes the role of language and becomes a means of rational expression It remains suggestive and imitable enough to convey an idea but not enough to precipitate a full reaction it feeds that sphere of merely potential action which we call thought it becomes a vehicle for intuition Under these circumstances to tread the measures of a sacred dance to march with an army to bear one s share in any universal act fills the heart with a voluminous silent emotion The massive suggestion the pressure of the ambient will is out of all proportion to the present call for action Infinite resources and definite premonitions are thus stored up in the soul and merely to have moved solemnly together is the best possible preparation for living afterwards even if apart in the consciousness of a general monition and authority Sidenote Automatic music Parallel to this is the genesis and destiny of music an art originally closely intertwined with the dance The same explosive forces that agitate the limbs loosen the voice hand foot and throat mark their wild rhythm together Birds probably enjoy the pulsation of their singing rather than its sound Even human music is performed long before it is listened to and is at first no more an art than sighing The original emotions connected with it are felt by participation in the performance a participation which can become ideal only because at bottom it is always actual The need of exercise and self expression the force of contagion and unison bears the soul along before an artistic appreciation of music arises and we may still observe among civilised races how music asserts itself without any aesthetic intent as when the pious sing hymns in common or the sentimental at sea cannot refrain from whining their whole homely repertory in the moonlight Here as elsewhere instinct and habit are phases of the same inner disposition What has once occurred automatically on a given occasion will be repeated in much the same form when a similar occasion recurs Thus impulse reinforced by its own remembered expression passes into convention Savages have a music singularly monotonous automatic and impersonal they cannot resist the indulgence though they probably have little pleasure in it The same thing happens with customary sounds as with other prescribed ceremonies to omit them would be shocking and well nigh impossible yet to repeat them serves no end further than to avoid a sense of strangeness or inhibition These automatisms however in working themselves out are not without certain retroactive effects they leave the system exhausted or relieved and they have meantime played more or less agreeably on the senses The music we make automatically we cannot help hearing incidentally the sensation may even modify the expression since sensation too has its physical side The expression is reined in and kept from becoming vagrant in proportion as its form and occasion are remembered The automatic performer being henceforth controlled more or less by reflection and criticism becomes something of an artist he trains himself to be consecutive impressive agreeable he begins to compare his improvisation with its subject and function and thus he develops what is called style and taste CHAPTER IV MUSIC Sidenote Music is a world apart Sound readily acquires ideal values It has power in itself to engross attention and at the same time may be easily diversified so as to become a symbol for other things Its direct empire is to be compared with that of stimulants and opiates yet it presents to the mind as these do not a perception that corresponds part by part with the external stimulus To hear is almost to understand The process we undergo in mathematical or dialectical thinking is called understanding because a natural sequence is there adequately translated into ideal terms Logical connections seem to be internally justified while only the fact that we perceive them here and now with more or less facility is attributed to brute causes Sound approaches this sort of ideality it presents to sense something like the efficacious structure of the object It is almost mathematical but like mathematics it is adequate only by being abstract and while it discloses point by point one strain in existence it leaves many other strains which in fact are interwoven with it wholly out of account Music is accordingly like mathematics very nearly a world by itself it contains a whole gamut of experience from sensuous elements to ultimate intellectual harmonies Yet this second existence this life in music is no mere ghost of the other it has its own excitements its quivering alternatives its surprising turns the abstract energy of it takes on so much body that in progression or declension it seems quite as impassioned as any animal triumph or any moral drama Sidenote It justifies itself That a pattering of sounds on the ear should have such moment is a fact calculated to give pause to those philosophers who attempt to explain consciousness by its utility or who wish to make physical and moral processes march side by side from all eternity Music is essentially useless as life is but both have an ideal extension which lends utility to its conditions That the way in which idle sounds run together should matter so much is a mystery of the same order as the spirit s concern to keep a particular body alive or to propagate its life Such an interest is from an absolute point of view wholly gratuitous and so long as the natural basis and expressive function of spirit are not perceived this mystery is baffling In truth the order of values inverts that of causes and experience in which all values lie is an ideal resultant itself ineffectual of the potencies it can conceive Delight in music is liberal it makes useful the organs and processes that subserve it These agencies when they support a conscious interest in their operation give that operation its first glimmering justification and admit it to the rational sphere Just so when organic bodies generate a will bent on their preservation they add a value and a moral function to their equilibrium In vain should we ask for what purpose existences arise or become important that purpose to be such must already have been important to some existence and the only question that can be asked or answered is what recognised importance what ideal values actual existences involve Sidenote It is vital and transient We happen to breathe and on that account are interested in breathing and it is no greater marvel that happening to be subject to intricate musical sensations we should be in earnest about these too The human ear discriminates sounds with ease what it hears is so diversified that its elements can be massed without being confused or can form a sequence having a character of its own to be appreciated and remembered The eye too has a field in which clear distinctions and relations appear and for that reason is an organ favourable to intelligence but what gives music its superior emotional power is its rhythmic advance Time is a medium which appeals more than space to emotion Since life is itself a flux and thought an operation there is naturally something immediate and breathless about whatever flows and expands The visible world offers itself to our regard with a certain lazy indifference Peruse me it seems to say if you will I am here and even if you pass me by now and later find it to your advantage to resurvey me I may still be here The world of sound speaks a more urgent language It insinuates itself into our very substance and it is not so much the music that moves us as we that move with it Its rhythms seize upon our bodily life to accelerate or to deepen it and we must either become inattentive altogether or remain enslaved Sidenote Its physical affinities This imperious function in music has lent it functions which are far from aesthetic Song can be used to keep in unison many men s efforts as when sailors sing as they heave it can make persuasive and obvious sentiments which if not set to music might seem absurd as often in love songs and in psalmody It may indeed serve to prepare the mind for any impression whatever and render the same more intense when it comes Music was long used before it was loved or people took pains to refine it It would have seemed as strange in primitive times to turn utterance into a fine art as now to make aesthetic paces out of mourning or child birth Primitive music is indeed a wail and a parturition magical and suggestive as it may be for long ages it never bethinks itself to be beautiful It is content to furnish a contagious melancholy employment to souls without a language and with little interest in the real world Barbaric musicians singing and playing together more or less at random are too much carried away by their performance to conceive its effect they cry far too loud and too unceasingly to listen A contagious tradition carries them along and controls them in a way as they improvise the assembly is hardly an audience all are performers and the crowd is only a stimulus that keeps every one dancing and howling in emulation This unconsidered flow of early art remains present more or less to the end Instead of vague custom we have schools and instead of swaying multitudes academic example but many a discord and mannerism survive simply because the musician is so suggestible or so lost in the tumult of production as never to reconsider what he does or to perceive its wastefulness Nevertheless an inherent value exists in all emitted sounds although barbaric practice and theory are slow to recognise it Each tone has its quality like jewels of different water every cadence has its vital expression no less inherent in it than that which comes in a posture or in a thought Everything audible thrills merely by sounding and though this perceptual thrill be at first overpowered by the effort and excitement of action yet it eventually fights its way to the top Participation in music may become perfunctory or dull for the great majority as when hymns are sung in church a mere suggestion of action will doubtless continue to colour the impression received for a tendency to act is involved in perception but this suggestion will be only an over tone or echo behind an auditory feeling Some performers will be singled out from the crowd those whom the public likes to hear will be asked to continue alone and soon a certain suasion will be exerted over them by the approval or censure of others so that consciously or unconsciously they will train themselves to please Sidenote Physiology of music The musical quality of sounds has a simple physical measure for its basis and the rate of vibration is complicated by its sweep or loudness and by concomitant sounds What a rich note is to a pure and thin one that a chord is to a note nor is melody wholly different in principle for it is a chord rendered piece meal Time intervenes and the harmony is deployed so that in melody rhythm is added with its immense appeal to the cumulative effect already secured by rendering many notes together The heightened effect which a note gets by figuring in a phrase or a phrase in a longer passage comes of course from the tensions established and surviving in the sensorium a case differently shaded of chords and overtones The difference is only that the more emphatic parts of the melody survive clearly to the end while the detail which if perceived might now clash is largely lost and out of the preceding parts perhaps nothing but a certain swing and potency is present at the close The mind has been raked and set vibrating in an unusual fashion so that the finale comes like a fulfilment after much premonition and desire whereas the same event unprepared for might hardly have been observed The whole technique of music is but an immense elaboration of this principle It deploys a sensuous harmony by a sort of dialectic suspending and resolving it so that the parts become distinct and their relation vital Sidenote Limits of musical sensibility Such elaboration often exceeds the synthetic power of all but the best trained minds Both in scope and in articulation musical faculty varies prodigiously There is no fixed limit to the power of sustaining a given conscious process while new features appear in the same field nor is there any fixed limit to the power of recovering under changed circumstances a process that was formerly suspended A whole symphony might be felt at once if the musician s power of sustained or cumulative hearing could stretch so far As we all survey two notes and their interval in one sensation actual experience being always transitive and pregnant and its terms ideal so a trained mind might survey a whole composition This is not to say that time would be transcended in such an experience the apperception would still have duration and the object would still have successive features for evidently music not arranged in time would not be music while all sensations with a recognisable character occupy more than an instant in passing But the passing sensation throughout its lapse presents some experience and this experience taken at any point may present a temporal sequence with any number of members according to the synthetic and analytic power exerted by the given mind What is tedious and formless to the inattentive may seem a perfect whole to one who as they say takes it all in and similarly what is a frightful deafening discord to a sense incapable of discrimination for one who can hear the parts may break into a celestial chorus A musical education is necessary for musical judgment What most people relish is hardly music it is rather a drowsy revery relieved by nervous thrills Sidenote The value of music is relative to them The degree to which music should be elaborated depends on the capacity possessed by those it addresses There are limits to every man s synthetic powers and to stretch those powers to their limit is exhausting Excitement then becomes a debauch it leaves the soul less capable of habitual harmony Especially is such extreme tension disastrous when as in music nothing remains to be the fruit of that mighty victory the most pregnant revelation sinks to an illusion and is discredited when it cannot maintain its inspiration in the world s presence Everything has its own value and sets up its price but others must judge if that price is fair and sociability is the condition of all rational excellence There is therefore a limit to right complexity in music a limit set not by the nature of music itself but by its place in human economy This limit though clear in principle is altogether variable in practice duly cultivated people will naturally place it higher than the unmusical would In other words popular music needs to be simple although elaborate music may be beautiful to the few When elaborate music is the fashion among people to whom all music is a voluptuous mystery we may be sure that what they love is voluptuousness or fashion and not music itself Sidenote Wonders of musical structure Beneath its hypnotic power music for the musician has an intellectual essence Out of simple chords and melodies which at first catch only the ear he weaves elaborate compositions that by their form appeal also to the mind This side of music resembles a richer versification it may be compared also to mathematics or to arabesques A moving arabesque that has a vital dimension an audible mathematics adding sense to form and a versification that since it has no subject matter cannot do violence to it by its complex artifices these are types of pure living altogether joyful and delightful things They combine life with order precision with spontaneity the flux in them has become rhythmical and its freedom has passed into a rational choice since it has come in sight of the eternal form it would embody The musician like an architect or goldsmith working in sound but freer than they from material trammels can expand for ever his yielding labyrinth every step opens up new vistas every decision how unlike those made in real life multiplies opportunities and widens the horizon before him without preventing him from going back at will to begin afresh at any point to trace the other possible paths leading thence through various magic landscapes Pure music is pure art Its extreme abstraction is balanced by its entire spontaneity and while it has no external significance it bears no internal curse It is something to which a few spirits may well surrender themselves sure that in a liberal commonwealth they will be thanked for their ideal labour the fruits of which many may enjoy Such excursions into ultra mundane regions where order is free refine the mind and make it familiar with perfection By analogy an ideal form comes to be conceived and desiderated in other regions where it is not produced so readily and the music heard as the Pythagoreans hoped makes the soul also musical Sidenote Its inherent emotions It must be confessed however that a world of sounds and rhythms all about nothing is a by world and a mere distraction for a political animal Its substance is air though the spell of it may have moral affinities Nevertheless this ethereal art may be enticed to earth and married with what is mortal Music interests humanity most when it is wedded to human events The alliance comes about through the emotions which music and life arouse in common For sound in sweeping through the body and making felt there its kinetic and potential stress provokes no less interest than does any other physical event or premonition Music can produce emotion as directly as can fighting or love If in the latter instances the body s whole life may be in jeopardy this fact is no explanation of our concern for many a danger is not felt and there is no magic in the body s future condition that it should now affect the soul What touches the soul is the body s condition at the moment and this is altered no less truly by a musical impression than by some protective or reproductive act If emotions accompany the latter they might as well accompany the former and in fact they do Nor is music the only idle cerebral commotion that enlists attention and presents issues no less momentous for being quite imaginary dreams do the same and seldom can the real crises of life so absorb the soul or prompt it to such extreme efforts as can delirium in sickness or delusion in what passes for health Sidenote In growing specific they remain unearthly There is perhaps no emotion incident to human life that music cannot render in its abstract medium by suggesting the pang of it though of course music cannot describe the complex situation which lends earthly passions their specific colour It is by fusion with many suggested emotions that sentiment grows definite this fusion can hardly come about without ideas intervening and certainly it could never be sustained or expressed without them Occasions define feelings we can convey a delicate emotion only by delicately describing the situation which brings it on Music with its irrelevant medium can never do this for common life and the passions as music renders them are always general But music has its own substitute for conceptual distinctness It makes feeling specific nay more delicate and precise than association with things could make it by uniting it with musical form We may say that besides suggesting abstractly all ordinary passions music creates a new realm of form far more subtly impassioned than is vulgar experience Human life is confined to a dramatic repertory which has already become somewhat classical and worn but music has no end of new situations shaded in infinite ways it moves in all sorts of bodies to all sorts of adventures In life the ordinary routine of destiny beats so emphatic a measure that it does not allow free play to feeling we cannot linger on anything long enough to exhaust its meaning nor can we wander far from the beaten path to catch new impressions But in music there are no mortal obligations no imperious needs calling us back to reality Here nothing beautiful is extravagant nothing delightful unworthy Musical refinement finds no limit but its own instinct so that a thousand shades of what in our blundering words we must call sadness or mirth find in music their distinct expression Each phrase each composition articulates perfectly what no human situation could embody These fine emotions are really new they are altogether musical and unexampled in practical life they are native to the passing cadence absolute postures into which it throws the soul Sidenote They merge with common emotions and express such as find no object in nature There is enough likeness however between musical and mundane feeling for the first to be used in entertaining the second Hence the singular privilege of this art to give form to what is naturally inarticulate and express those depths of human nature which can speak no language current in the world Emotion is primarily about nothing and much of it remains about nothing to the end What rescues a part of our passions from this pathological plight and gives them some other function than merely to be is the ideal relevance the practical and mutually representative character which they sometimes acquire All experience is pathological if we consider its ground but a part of it is also rational if we consider its import The words I am now writing have a meaning not because at this moment they are fused together in my animal soul as a dream might fuse them however incongruous the situation they depict might be in waking life they are significant only if this moment s product can meet and conspire with some other thought speaking of what elsewhere exists and uttering an intuition that from time to time may be actually recovered The art of distributing interest among the occasions and vistas of life so as to lend them a constant worth and at the same time to give feeling an ideal object is at bottom the sole business of education but the undertaking is long and much feeling remains unemployed and unaccounted for This objectless emotion chokes the heart with its dull importunity now it impedes right action now it feeds and fattens illusion Much of it radiates from primary functions which though their operation is half known have only base or pitiful associations in human life so that they trouble us with deep and subtle cravings the unclaimed Hinterland of life When music either by verbal indications or by sensuous affinities or by both at once succeeds in tapping this fund of suppressed feeling it accordingly supplies a great need It makes the dumb speak and plucks from the animal heart potentialities of expression which might render it perhaps even more than human Sidenote Music lends elementary feelings an intellectual communicable form By its emotional range music is appropriate to all intense occasions we dance pray and mourn to music and the more inadequate words or external acts are to the situation the more grateful music is As the only bond between music and life is emotion music is out of place only where emotion itself is absent If it breaks in upon us in the midst of study or business it becomes an interruption or alternative to our activity rather than an expression of it we must either remain inattentive or pass altogether into the realm of sound which may be unemotional enough and become musicians for the nonce Music brings its sympathetic ministry only to emotional moments there it merges with common existence and is a welcome substitute for descriptive ideas since it company operates with us and helps to deliver us from dumb subjection to influences which we should not know how to meet otherwise There is often in what moves us a certain ruthless persistence together with a certain poverty of form the power felt is out of proportion to the interest awakened and attention is kept as in pain at once strained and idle At such a moment music is a blessed resource Without attempting to remove a mood that is perhaps inevitable it gives it a congruous filling Thus the mood is justified by an illustration or expression which seems to offer some objective and ideal ground for its existence and the mood is at the same time relieved by absorption in that impersonal object So entertained the feeling settles The passion to which at first we succumbed is now tamed and appropriated We have digested the foreign substance in giving it a rational form its energies are merged in that strength by which we freely operate In this way the most abstract of arts serves the dumbest emotions Matter which cannot enter the moulds of ordinary perception capacities which a ruling instinct usually keeps under flow suddenly into this new channel Music is like those branches which some trees put forth close to the ground far below the point where the other boughs separate almost a tree by itself it has nothing but the root in common with its parent Somewhat in this fashion music diverts into an abstract sphere a part of those forces which abound beneath the point at which human understanding grows articulate It nourishes on saps which other branches of ideation are too narrow or rigid to take up Those elementary substances the musician can spiritualise by his special methods taking away their reproach and redeeming them from blind intensity Sidenote All essences are in themselves good even the passions There is consequently in music a sort of Christian piety in that it comes not to call the just but sinners to repentance and understands the spiritual possibilities in outcasts from the respectable world If we look at things absolutely enough and from their own point of view there can be no doubt that each has its own ideal and does not question its own justification Lust and frenzy revery or despair fatal as they may be to a creature that has general ulterior interests are not perverse in themselves each searches for its own affinities and has a kind of inertia which tends to maintain it in being and to attach or draw in whatever is propitious to it Feelings are as blameless as so many forms of vegetation they can be poisonous only to a different life They are all primordial motions eddies which the universal flux makes for no reason since its habit of falling into such attitudes is the ground work and exemplar for nature and logic alike That such strains should exist is an ultimate datum justification cannot be required of them but must be offered to each of them in turn by all that enters its particular orbit There is no will but might find a world to disport itself in and to call good and thereupon boast to have created that in which it found itself expressed But such satisfaction has been denied to the majority the equilibrium of things has at least postponed their day Yet they are not altogether extinguished since the equilibrium of things is mechanical and results from no preconcerted harmony such as would have abolished everything contrary to its own perfection Many ill suppressed possibilities endure in matter and peep into being through the crevices as it were of the dominant world Weeds they are called by the tyrant but in themselves they are aware of being potential gods Why should not every impulse expand in a congenial paradise Why should each made evil now only by an adventitious appellation or a contrary fate not vindicate its own ideal If there is a piety towards things deformed because it is not they that are perverse but the world that by its laws and arbitrary standards decides to treat them as if they were how much more should there be a piety towards things altogether lovely when it is only space and matter that are wanting for their perfect realisation Sidenote Each impulse calls for a possible congenial world Philosophers talk of self contradiction but there is evidently no such thing if we take for the self what is really vital each propulsive definite strain of being each nucleus for estimation and for pleasure and pain Bach impulse may be contradicted but not by itself it may find itself opposed in a theatre which it has entered it knows not how by violent personages that it has never wished to encounter The environment it calls for is congenial with it and by that environment it could never be thwarted or condemned The lumbering course of events may indeed involve it in rum and a mind with permanent interests to defend may at once rule out everything inconsistent with possible harmonies but such rational judgments come from outside and represent a compromise struck with material forces Moral judgments and conflicts are possible only in the mind that represents many interests synthetically in nature where primary impulses collide all conflict is physical and all will innocent Imagine some ingredient of humanity loosed from its oppressive environment in human economy it would at once vegetate and flower into some ideal form such as we see exuberantly displayed in nature If we can only suspend for a moment the congested traffic in the brain these initial movements will begin to traverse it playfully and show their paces and we shall live in one of those plausible worlds which the actual world has made impossible Sidenote Literature incapable of expressing pure feelings Man possesses for example a native capacity for joy There are moments in friendship or in solitude when joy is realised but the occasions are often trivial and could never justify in reflection the feelings that then happen to bubble up Nor can pure joy be long sustained cross currents of lassitude or anxiety distracting incidents irrelevant associations trouble its course and make it languish turning it before long into dulness or melancholy Language cannot express a joy that shall be full and pure for to keep the purity nothing would have to be named which carried the least suggestion of sadness with it and in the world that human language refers to such a condition would exclude every situation possible O joy O joy would be the whole ditty hence some dialecticians whose experience is largely verbal think whatever is pure necessarily thin Sidenote Music may do so That feeling should be so quickly polluted is however a superficial and earthly accident Spirit is clogged by what it flows through but at its springs it is both limpid and abundant There is matter enough in joy for many a universe though the actual world has not a single form quite fit to embody it and its too rapid syllables are excluded from the current hexameter Music on the contrary has a more flexible measure its prosody admits every word Its rhythms can explicate every emotion through all degrees of complexity and volume without once disavowing it Thus unused matter which is not less fertile than that which nature has absorbed comes to fill out an infinity of ideal forms The joy condemned by practical exigencies to scintillate for a moment uncommunicated and then as it were to be buried alive may now find an abstract art to embody it and bring it before the public formed into a rich and constant object called a musical composition So art succeeds in vindicating the forgotten regions of spirit a new spontaneous creation shows how little authority or finality the given creation has Sidenote Instability the soul of matter What is true of joy is no less true of sorrow which though it arises from failure in some natural ideal carries with it a sentimental ideal of its own Even confusion can find in music an expression and a catharsis That death or change should grieve does not follow from the material nature of these phenomena To change or to disappear might be as normal a tendency as to move and it actually happens when nothing ideal has been attained that not to be thus is the whole law of being There is then a nameless satisfaction in passing on which is the virtual ideal of pain and mere willing Death and change acquire a tragic character when they invade a mind which is not ready for them in all its parts so that those elements in it which are still vigorous and would maintain somewhat longer their ideal identity suffer violence at the hands of the others already mastered by decay and willing to be self destructive Thus a man whose physiological complexion involves more poignant emotion than his ideas can absorb one who is sentimental will yearn for new objects that may explain embody and focus his dumb feelings and these objects if art can produce them will relieve and glorify those feelings in the act of expressing them Catharsis is nothing more Sidenote Peace the triumph of spirit There would be no pleasure in expressing pain if pain were not dominated through its expression To know how just a cause we have for grieving is already a consolation for it is already a shift from feeling to understanding By such consideration of a passion the intellectual powers turn it into subject matter to operate upon All utterance is a feat all apprehension a discovery and this intellectual victory sounding in the midst of emotional struggles hushes some part of their brute importunity It is at once sublime and beneficent like a god stilling a tempest Melancholy can in this way be the food of art and it is no paradox that such a material may be beautiful when a fit form is imposed upon it since a fit form turns anything into an agreeable object its beauty runs as deep as its fitness and stops where its adaptation to human nature begins to fail Whatever can interest may prompt to expression as it may have satisfied curiosity and the mind celebrates a little triumph whenever it can formulate a truth however unwelcome to the flesh or discover an actual force however unfavourable to given interests As meditation on death and on life make equally for wisdom so the expression of sorrow and joy make equally for beauty Meditation and expression are themselves congenial activities with an intrinsic value which is not lessened if what they deal with could have been abolished to advantage If once it exists we may understand and interpret it and this reaction will serve a double purpose At first in its very act it will suffuse and mollify the unwelcome experience by another digesting it which is welcome and later by the broader adjustment which it will bring into the mind it will help us to elude or confront the evils thus laid clearly before us Catharsis has no such effect as a sophistical optimism wishes to attribute to it it does not show us that evil is good or that calamity and crime are things to be grateful for so forced an apology for evil has nothing to do with tragedy or wisdom it belongs to apologetics and an artificial theodicy Catharsis is rather the consciousness of how evil evils are and how besetting and how possible goods lie between and involve serious renunciations To understand to accept and to use the situation in which a mortal may find himself is the function of art and reason Such mastery is desirable in itself and for its fruits it does not make itself responsible for the chaos of goods and evils that it supervenes upon Whatever writhes in matter art strives to give form to and however unfavourable the field may be for its activity it does what it can there since no other field exists in which it may labour Sidenote Refinement is true strength Sad music pleases the melancholy because it is sad and other men because it is music When a composer attempts to reproduce complex conflicts in his score he will please complex or disordered spirits for expressing their troubles but other men only for the order and harmony he may have brought out of that chaos The chaos in itself will offend and it is no part of rational art to produce it As well might a physician poison in order to give an antidote or maim in order to amputate The subject matter of art is life life as it actually is but the function of art is to make life better The depth to which an artist may find current experience to be sunk in discord and confusion is not his special concern his concern is in some measure to lift experience out The more barbarous his age the more drastic and violent must be his operation He will have to shout in a storm His strength must needs in such a case be very largely physical and his methods sensational In a gentler age he may grow nobler and blood and thunder will no longer seem impressive Only the weak are obliged to be violent the strong having all means at command need not resort to the worst Refined art is not wanting in power if the public is refined also And as refinement comes only by experience by comparison by subordinating means to ends and rejecting what hinders it follows that a refined mind will really possess the greater volume as well as the subtler discrimination Its ecstasy without grimace and its submission without tears will hold heaven and earth better together and hold them better apart than could a mad imagination CHAPTER V SPEECH AND SIGNIFICATION Sidenote Sounds well fitted to be symbols Music rationalises sound but a more momentous rationalising of sound is seen in language Language is one of the most useful of things yet the greater part of it still remains what it must all have been in the beginning useless and without ulterior significance The musical side of language is its primary and elementary side Man is endowed with vocal organs so plastic as to emit a great variety of delicately varied sounds and by good fortune his ear has a parallel sensibility so that much vocal expression can be registered and confronted by auditory feeling It has been said that man s pre eminence in nature is due to his possessing hands his modest participation in the ideal world may similarly be due to his possessing tongue and ear For when he finds shouting and vague moaning after a while fatiguing he can draw a new pleasure from uttering all sorts of labial dental and gutteral sounds Their rhythms and oppositions can entertain him and he can begin to use his lingual gamut to designate the whole range of his perceptions and passions Here we touch upon one of the great crises in creation As nutrition at first established itself in the face of waste and reproduction in the face of death so representation was able by help of vocal symbols to confront that dispersion inherent in experience which is something in itself ephemeral Merely to associate one thing with another brings little gain and merely to have added a vocal designation to fleeting things a designation which of course would have been taken for a part of their essence would in itself have encumbered phenomena without rendering them in any way more docile to the will But the encumbrance in this instance proved to be a wonderful preservative and means of comparison It actually gave each moving thing its niche and cenotaph in the eternal For the universe of vocal sounds was a field like that of colour or number in which the elements showed relations and transitions easy to dominate It was a key board over which attention could run back and forth eliciting many implicit harmonies Henceforth when various sounds had been idly associated with various things and identified with them the things could by virtue of their names be carried over mentally into the linguistic system they could be manipulated there ideally and vicariously preserved in representation Needless to say that the things themselves remained unchanged all the while in their efficacy and mechanical succession just as they remain unchanged in those respects when they pass for the mathematical observer into their measure or symbol but as this reduction to mathematical form makes them calculable so their earlier reduction to words rendered them comparable and memorable first enabling them to figure in discourse at all Sidenote Language has a structure independent of things Language had originally no obligation to subserve an end which we may sometimes measure it by now and depute to be its proper function namely to stand for things and adapt itself perfectly to their structure In language as in every other existence idealism precedes realism since it must be a part of nature living its own life before it can become a symbol for the rest and bend to external control The vocal and musical medium is and must always remain alien to the spatial What makes terms correspond and refer to one another is a relation eternally disparate from the relation of propinquity or derivation between existences Yet when sounds were attached to an event or emotion the sounds became symbols for that disparate fact The net of vocal relations caught that natural object as a cobweb might catch a fly without destroying or changing it The object s quality passed to the word at the same time that the word s relations enveloped the object and thus a new weight and significance was added to sound previously nothing but a dull music A conflict at once established itself between the drift proper to the verbal medium and that proper to the designated things a conflict which the whole history of language and thought has embodied and which continues to this day Sidenote Words remaining identical serve to identify things that change Suppose an animal going down to a frozen river which he had previously visited in summer Marks of all sorts would awaken in him an old train of reactions he would doubtless feel premonitions of satisfied thirst and the splash of water On finding however instead of the fancied liquid a mass of something like cold stone he would be disconcerted His active attitude would be pulled up short and contradicted In his fairyland of faith and magic the old river would have been simply annihilated the dreamt of water would have become a vanished ghost and this ice for the moment the hard reality He would turn away and live for a while on other illusions When this shock was overgrown by time and it was summer again the original habit might however reassert itself once more If he revisited the stream some god would seem to bring back something from an old familiar world and the chill of that temporary estrangement the cloud that for a while had made the good invisible would soon be gone and forgotten If we imagine on the contrary that this animal could speak and had from the first called his haunt the river he would have repeated its name on seeing it even when it was frozen for he had not failed to recognise it in that guise The variation afterwards noticed upon finding it hard would seem no total substitution but a change for it would be the same river once flowing that was now congealed An identical word covering all the identical qualities in the phenomena and serving to abstract them would force the inconsistent qualities in those phenomena to pass for accidents and the useful proposition could at once be framed that the same river may be sometimes free and sometimes frozen Sidenote Language the dialectical garment of facts This proposition is true yet it contains much that is calculated to offend a scrupulous dialectician Its language and categories are not purely logical but largely physical and representative The notion that what changes nevertheless endures is a remarkable hybrid It arises when rigid ideal terms are imposed on evanescent existence Feelings taken alone would show no identities they would be lost in changing or be woven into the infinite feeling of change Notions taken alone would allow no lapse but would merely lead attention about from point to point over an eternal system of relations Power to understand the world logical or scientific mastery of existence arises only by the forced and conventional marriage of these two essences when the actual flux is ideally suspended and an ideal harness is loosely flung upon things For this purpose words are an admirable instrument They have dialectical relations based on an ideal import or tendency to definition which makes their essence their signification yet they can be freely bandied about and applied for a moment to the ambiguous things that pass through existence Sidenote Words are wise men s counters Had men been dumb an exchange and circulation of images need not have been wanting and associations might have arisen between ideals in the mind and corresponding reactive habits in the body What words add is not power of discernment or action but a medium of intellectual exchange Language is like money without which specific relative values may well exist and be felt but cannot be reduced to a common denominator And as money must have a certain intrinsic value of its own in order that its relation to other values may be stable so a word by which a thing is represented in discourse must be a part of that thing s context an ingredient in the total apparition it is destined to recall Words in their existence are no more universal than gold by nature is a worthless standard of value in other things Words are a material accompaniment of phenomena at first an idle accompaniment but one which happens to subserve easily a universal function Some other element in objects might conceivably have served for a common denominator between them but words just by virtue of their adventitious detachable status and because they are so easily compared and manipulated in the world of sound were singularly well fitted for this office They are not vague as any common quality abstracted from things would necessarily become and though vagueness is a quality only too compatible with perception so that vague ideas can exist without end this vagueness is not what makes them universal in their functions It is one thing to perceive an ill determined form and quite another to attribute to it a precise general predicate Words distinct in their own category and perfectly recognisable can accordingly perform very well the function of embodying a universal for they can be identified in turn with many particulars and yet remain throughout particular themselves Sidenote Nominalism right in psychology and realism in logic The psychology of nominalism is undoubtedly right where it insists that every image is particular and every term in its existential aspect a flatum vocis but nominalists should have recognised that images may have any degree of vagueness and generality when measured by a conceptual standard A figure having obviously three sides and three corners may very well be present to the mind when it is impossible to say whether it is an equilateral or a rectangular triangle Functional or logical universality lies in another sphere altogether being a matter of intent and not of existence When we say that universals alone exist in the mind we mean by mind something unknown to Berkeley not a bundle of psychoses nor an angelic substance but quick intelligence the faculty of discourse Predication is an act understanding a spiritual and transitive operation its existential basis may well be counted in psychologically and reduced to a stream of immediate presences but its meaning can be caught only by another meaning as life only can exemplify life Vague or general images are as little universal as sounds are but a sound better than a flickering abstraction can serve the intellect in its operation of comparison and synthesis Words are therefore the body of discourse of which the soul is understanding Sidenote Literature moves between the extremes of music and denotation The categories of discourse are in part merely representative in part merely grammatical and in part attributable to both spheres Euphony and phonetic laws are principles governing language without any reference to its meaning here speech is still a sort of music At the other extreme lies that ultimate form of prose which we see in mathematical reasoning or in a telegraphic style where absolutely nothing is rhetorical and speech is denuded of every feature not indispensable to its symbolic role Between these two extremes lies the broad field of poetry or rather of imaginative or playful expression where the verbal medium is a medium indeed having a certain transparency a certain reference to independent facts but at the same time elaborates the fact in expressing it and endows it with affinities alien to its proper nature A pun is a grotesque example of such diremption where ambiguities belonging only to speech are used to suggest impossible substitutions in ideas Less frankly language habitually wrests its subject matter in some measure from its real context and transfers it to a represented and secondary world the world of logic and reflection Concretions in existence are subsumed when named under concretions in discourse Grammar lays violent hands upon experience and everything becomes a prey to wit and fancy a material for fiction and eloquence Man s intellectual progress has a poetic phase in which he imagines the world and then a scientific phase in which he sifts and tests what he has imagined Sidenote Sound and object in their sensuous presence may have affinity In what measure do inflection and syntax represent anything in the subject matter of discourse In what measure are they an independent play of expression a quasi musical quasi mathematical veil interposed between reflection and existence One who knows only languages of a single family can give but a biassed answer to this question There are doubtless many approaches to correct symbolism in language which grammar may have followed up at different times in strangely different ways That the medium in every art has a character of its own a character limiting its representative value may perhaps be safely asserted and this intrinsic character in the medium antedates and permeates all representation Phonetic possibilities and phonetic habits belong in language to this indispensable vehicle what the throat and lips can emit easily and distinguishably and what sequences can appeal to the ear and be retained depend alike on physiological conditions and no matter how convenient or inconvenient these conditions may be for signification they will always make themselves felt and may sometimes remain predominant In poetry they are still conspicuous Euphony metre and rhyme colour the images they transmit and add a charm wholly extrinsic and imputed In this immersion of the message in the medium and in its intrinsic movement the magic of poetry lies and the miracle grows as there is more or less native analogy between the medium s movement and that of the subject matter Both language and ideas involve processes in the brain The two processes may be wholly disparate if we regard their objects only and forget their seat as Athena is in no way linked to an elephant s tusk yet in perception all processes are contiguous and exercise a single organism in which they may find themselves in sympathetic or antipathetic vibration On this circumstance hangs that subtle congruity between subject and vehicle which is otherwise such a mystery in expression If to think of Athena and to look on ivory are congruous physiological processes if they sustain or heighten each other then to represent Athena in ivory will be a happy expedient in which the very nature of the medium will already be helping us forward Scent and form go better together for instance in the violet or the rose than in the hyacinth or the poppy and being better compacted for human perception they seem more expressive and can be linked more unequivocally with other sources of feeling So a given vocal sound may have more or less analogy to the thing it is used to signify this analogy may be obvious as in onomatopoeia or subtle as when short sharp sounds go with decision or involved rhythms and vague reverberations with a floating dream What seems exquisite to one poet may accordingly seem vapid to another when the texture of experience in the two minds differs so that a given composition rustles through one man s fancy as a wind might through a wood but finds no sympathetic response in the other organism nerved as it may be perhaps to precision in thought and action Sidenote Syntax positively representative The structure of language when it passes beyond the phonetic level begins at once to lean upon existences and to imitate the structure of things We distinguish the parts of speech for instance in subservience to distinctions which we make in ideas The feeling or quality represented by an adjective the relation indicated by a verb the substance or concretion of qualities designated by a noun are diversities growing up in experience by no means attributable to the mere play of sound The parts of speech are therefore representative Their inflection is representative too since tenses mark important practical differences in the distribution of the events described and cases express the respective roles played by objects in the operation I struck him and he will strike me renders in linguistic symbols a marked change in the situation the variation in phrase is not rhetorical Language here though borrowed no doubt from ancestral poetry has left all revery far behind and has been submerged in the Life of Reason Sidenote Yet it vitiates what it represents The medium however constantly reasserts itself An example may be found in gender which clearly representative in a measure cuts loose in language from all genuine representation and becomes a feature in abstract linguistic design a formal characteristic in expression Contrasted sentiments permeate an animal s dealings with his own sex and with the other nouns and adjectives represent this contrast by taking on masculine and feminine forms The distinction is indeed so important that wholly different words man and woman bull and cow stand for the best known animals of different sex while adjectives where declension is extinct as in English often take on a connotation of gender and are applied to one sex only as we say a beautiful woman but hardly a beautiful man But gender in language extends much farther than sex and even if by some subtle analogy all the masculine and feminine nouns in a language could be attached to something suggesting sex in the objects they designate yet it can hardly be maintained that the elaborate concordance incident upon that distinction is representative of any felt quality in the things So remote an analogy to sex could not assert itself pervasively Thus Horace says Quis multa gracilis te puer in rosa perfusis liquidis urget odoribus grato Pyrrha sub antro Here we may perceive why the rose was instinctively made feminine and we may grant that the bower though the reason escape us was somehow properly masculine but no one would urge that a profusion of roses was also intrinsically feminine or that the pleasantness of a bower was ever specifically masculine to sense The epithets multa and grato take their gender from the nouns even though the quality they designate fails to do so Their gender is therefore non representative and purely formal it marks an intra linguistic accommodation The medium has developed a syntactical structure apart from any intrinsic significance thereby accruing to its elements Artificial concordance in gender does not express gender it merely emphasises the grammatical links in the phrases and makes greater variety possible in the arrangement of words Sidenote Difficulty in subduing a living medium This example may prepare us to understand a general principle that language while essentially significant viewed in its function is indefinitely wasteful being mechanical and tentative in its origin It overloads itself and being primarily music and a labyrinth of sounds it develops an articulation and method of its own which only in the end and with much inexactness reverts to its function of expression How great the possibilities of effect are in developing a pure medium we can best appreciate in music but in language a similar development goes on while it is being applied to representing things The organ is spontaneous the function adventitious and superimposed Rhetoric and utility keep language going as centrifugal and centripetal forces keep a planet in its course Euphony verbal analogy grammatical fancy poetic confusion continually drive language afield in its own tangential direction while the business of life in which language is employed and the natural lapse of rhetorical fashions as continually draw it back towards convenience and exactitude Sidenote Language foreshortens experience Between music and bare symbolism language has its florid expansion Until music is subordinated speech has little sense it can hardly tell a story or indicate an object unequivocally Yet if music were left behind altogether language would pass into a sort of algebra or vocal shorthand without literary quality it would become wholly indicative and record facts without colouring them ideally This medium and its intrinsic development though they make the bane of reproduction make the essence of art they give representation a new and specific value such as the object before representation could not have possessed Consciousness itself is such a medium in respect to diffuse existence which it foreshortens and elevates into synthetic ideas Reason too by bringing the movement of events and inclinations to a head in single acts of reflection thus attaining to laws and purposes introduces into life the influence of a representative medium without which life could never pass from a process into an art Language acquires scope in the same way by its kindly infidelities its metaphors and syntax lend experience perspective Language vitiates the experience it expresses but thereby makes the burden of one moment relevant to that of another The two experiences identified roughly with the same concretion in discourse are pronounced similar or comparable in character Thus a proverb by its verbal pungency and rhythm becomes more memorable than the event it first described would ever have been if not translated into an epigram and rendered so to speak applicable to new cases for by that translation the event has become an idea Sidenote It is a perpetual mythology To turn events into ideas is the function of literature Music which in a certain sense is a mass of pure forms must leave its ideas imbedded in their own medium they are musical ideas and cannot impose them on any foreign material such as human affairs Science on the contrary seeks to disclose the bleak anatomy of existence stripping off as much as possible the veil of prejudice and words Literature takes a middle course and tries to subdue music which for its purposes would be futile and too abstract into conformity with general experience making music thereby significant Literary art in the end rejects all unmeaning nourishes all complications that have no counterpart in things or no use in expressing their relations at the same time it aspires to digest that reality to which it confines itself making it over into ideal substance and material for the mind It looks at things with an incorrigibly dramatic eye turning them into permanent unities which they never are and almost into persons grouping them by their imaginative or moral affinities and retaining in them chiefly what is incidental to their being namely the part they may chance to play in man s adventures Such literary art demands a subject matter other than the literary impulse itself The literary man is an interpreter and hardly succeeds as the musician may without experience and mastery of human affairs His art is half genius and half fidelity He needs inspiration he must wait for automatic musical tendencies to ferment in his mind proving it to be fertile in devices comparisons and bold assimilations Yet inspiration alone will lead him astray for his art is relative to something other than its own formal impulse it comes to clarify the real world not to encumber it and it needs to render its native agility practical and to attach its volume of feeling to what is momentous in human life Literature has its piety its conscience it cannot long forget without forfeiting all dignity that it serves a burdened and perplexed creature a human animal struggling to persuade the universal Sphinx to propose a more intelligible riddle Irresponsible and trivial in its abstract impulse man s simian chatter becomes noble as it becomes symbolic its representative function lends it a serious beauty its utility endows it with moral worth Sidenote It may be apt or inapt with equal richness Sidenote Absolute language a possible but foolish art These relations in determining the function of language determine the ideal which its structure should approach Any sort of grammar and rhetoric the most absurd and inapplicable as well as the most descriptive can be spontaneous fit organisms are not less natural than those that are unfit Felicitous genius is so called because it meets experience half way A genius which flies in the opposite direction though not less fertile internally is externally inept and is called madness Ineptitude is something which language needs to shake off Better surrender altogether some verbal categories and start again in that respect with a clean slate than persist in any line of development that alienates thought from reality The language of birds is excellent in its way and those ancient sages who are reported to have understood it very likely had merely perceived that it was not meant to be intelligible for it is not to understand nature to reduce her childishly to a human scale Man who is merged in universal nature at the roots of his being is not without profound irrational intuitions by which he can half divine her secret processes and his heart in its own singing and fluttering might not wholly misinterpret the birds But human discourse is not worth having if it is mere piping and helps not at all in mastering things for man is intelligent which is another way of saying that he aspires to envisage in thought what he is dealing with in action Discourse that absolved itself from that observant duty would not be cognitive and in failing to be cognitive it would fail to redeem the practical forces it ignored from their brute externality and to make them tributary to the Life of Reason Thus its own dignity and continued existence depend on its learning to express momentous facts facts important for action and happiness and there is nothing which so quickly discredits itself as empty rhetoric and dialectic or poetry that wanders in dim and private worlds If pure music even with its immense sensuous appeal is so easily tedious what a universal yawn must meet the verbiage which develops nothing but its own irridescence Absolute versification and absolute dialectic may have their place in society they give play to an organ that has its rights like any other and that after serving for a while in the economy of life may well claim a holiday in which to disport itself irresponsibly among the fowls of the air and the lilies of the field But the exercise is trivial and if its high priests go through their mummeries with a certain unction and pretend to be wafted by them into a higher world the phenomenon is neither new nor remarkable Language is a wonderful and pliant medium and why should it not lend itself to imposture A systematic abuse of words as of other things is never without some inner harmony or propriety that makes it prosper only the man who looks beyond and sees the practical results awakes to the villainy of it In the end however those who play with words lose their labour and pregnant as they feel themselves to be with new and wonderful universes they cannot humanise the one in which they live and rather banish themselves from it by their persistent egotism and irrelevance CHAPTER VI POETRY AND PROSE Sidenote Force of primary expressions There is both truth and illusion in the saying that primitive poets are sublime Genesis and the Iliad works doubtless backed by a long tradition are indeed sublime Primitive men having perhaps developed language before the other arts used it with singular directness to describe the chief episodes of life which was all that life as yet contained They had frank passions and saw things from single points of view A breath from that early world seems to enlarge our natures and to restore to language which we have sophisticated all its magnificence and truth But there is more for as we have seen language is spontaneous it constitutes an act before it registers an observation It gives vent to emotion before it is adjusted to things external and reduced as it were to its own echo rebounding from a refractory world The lion s roar the bellowing of bulls even the sea s cadence has a great sublimity Though hardly in itself poetry an animal cry when still audible in human language renders it also the unanswerable the ultimate voice of nature Nothing can so pierce the soul as the uttermost sigh of the body There is no utterance so thrilling as that of absolute impulse if absolute impulse has learned to speak at all An intense inhospitable mind filled with a single idea in which all animal social and moral interests are fused together speaks a language of incomparable force Thus the Hebrew prophets in their savage concentration poured into one torrent all that their souls possessed or could dream of What other men are wont to pursue in politics business religion or art they looked for from one wave of national repentance and consecration Their age swept by this ideal passion possessed at the same time a fresh and homely vocabulary and the result was an eloquence so elemental and combative so imaginative and so bitterly practical that the world has never heard its like Such single mindedness with such heroic simplicity in words and images is hardly possible in a late civilisation Cultivated poets are not unconsciously sublime Sidenote Its exclusiveness and narrowness The sublimity of early utterances should not be hailed however with unmixed admiration It is a sublimity born of defect or at least of disproportion The will asserts itself magnificently images like thunder clouds seem to cover half the firmament at once But such a will is sadly inexperienced it has hardly tasted or even conceived any possible or high satisfactions Its lurid firmament is poor in stars To throw the whole mind upon something is not so great a feat when the mind has nothing else to throw itself upon Every animal when goaded becomes intense and it is perhaps merely the apathy in which mortals are wont to live that keeps them from being habitually sublime in their sentiments The sympathy that makes a sheep hasten after its fellows in vague alarm or in vague affection the fierce premonitions that drive a bull to the heifer the patience with which a hen sits on her eggs the loyalty which a dog shows to his master what thoughts may not all these instincts involve which it needs only a medium of communication to translate into poetry Man though with less wholeness of soul enacts the same dramas He hears voices on all occasions he incorporates what little he observes of nature into his verbal dreams and as each new impulse bubbles to the surface he feels himself on the verge of some inexpressible heaven or hell He needs but to abandon himself to that seething chaos which perpetually underlies conventional sanity a chaos in which memory and prophecy vision and impersonation sound and sense are inextricably jumbled together to find himself at once in a magic world irrecoverable largely unmeaning terribly intricate but as he will conceive deep inward and absolutely real He will have reverted in other words to crude experience to primordial illusion The movement of his animal or vegetative mind will be far from delightful it will be unintelligent and unintelligible nothing in particular will be represented therein but it will be a movement in the soul and for the soul as exciting and compulsive as the soul s volume can make it In this muddy torrent words also may be carried down and if these words are by chance strung together into a cadence and are afterwards written down they may remain for a memento of that turbid moment Such words we may at first hesitate to call poetry since very likely they are nonsense but this nonsense will have some quality some rhyme or rhythm that makes it memorable else it would not have survived and moreover the words will probably show in their connotation and order some sympathy with the dream that cast them up For the man himself in whom such a dream may be partly recurrent they may consequently have a considerable power of suggestion and they may even have it for others whenever the rhythm and incantation avail to plunge them also into a similar trance Sidenote Rudimentary poetry an incantation or charm Memorable nonsense or sound with a certain hypnotic power is the really primitive and radical form of poetry Nor is such poetry yet extinct children still love and compose it and every genuine poet on one side of his genius reverts to it from explicit speech As all language has acquired its meaning and did not have it in the beginning so the man who launches a new locution the poet who creates a symbol must do so without knowing what significance it may eventually acquire and conscious at best only of the emotional background from which it emerged Pure poetry is pure experiment and it is not strange that nine tenths of it should be pure failure For it matters little what unutterable things may have originally gone together with a phrase in the dreamer s mind if they were not uttered and the phrase cannot call them back this verbal relic is none the richer for the high company it may once have kept Expressiveness is a most accidental matter What a line suggests at one reading it may never suggest again even to the same person For this reason among others poets are partial to their own compositions they truly discover there depths of meaning which exist for nobody else Those readers who appropriate a poet and make him their own fall into a similar illusion they attribute to him what they themselves supply and whatever he reels out lost in his own personal revery seems to them like sortes biblicoe written to fit their own case Sidenote Inspiration irresponsible Justice has never been done to Plato s remarkable consistency and boldness in declaring that poets are inspired by a divine madness and yet when they transgress rational bounds are to be banished from an ideal republic though not without some marks of Platonic regard Instead of fillets a modern age might assign them a coterie of flattering dames and instead of banishment starvation but the result would be the same in the end A poet is inspired because what occurs in his brain is a true experiment in creation His apprehension plays with words and their meanings as nature in any spontaneous variation plays with her own structure A mechanical force shifts the kaleidoscope a new direction is given to growth or a new gist to signification This inspiration moreover is mad being wholly ignorant of its own issue and though it has a confused fund of experience and verbal habit on which to draw it draws on this fund blindly and quite at random consciously possessed by nothing but a certain stress and pregnancy and the pains as it were of parturition Finally the new birth has to be inspected critically by the public censor before it is allowed to live most probably it is too feeble and defective to prosper in the common air or is a monster that violates some primary rule of civic existence tormenting itself to disturb others Sidenote Plato s discriminating view Plato seems to have exaggerated the havoc which these poetic dragons can work in the world They are in fact more often absurd than venomous and no special legislation is needed to abolish them They soon die quietly of universal neglect The poetry that ordinarily circulates among a people is poetry of a secondary and conventional sort that propagates established ideas in trite metaphors Popular poets are the parish priests of the Muse retailing her ancient divinations to a long since converted public Plato s quarrel was not so much with poetic art as with ancient myth and emotional laxity he was preaching a crusade against the established church For naturalistic deities he wished to substitute moral symbols for the joys of sense austerity and abstraction To proscribe Homer was a marked way of protesting against the frivolous reigning ideals The case is much as if we should now proscribe the book of Genesis on account of its mythical cosmogony or in order to proclaim the philosophic truth that the good being an adequate expression to be attained by creation could not possibly have preceded it or been its source We might admit at the same time that Genesis contains excellent images and that its poetic force is remarkable so that if serious misunderstanding could be avoided the censor might be glad to leave it in everybody s hands Plato in some such way recognised that Homer was poetical and referred his works mischievous as they might prove incidentally to divine inspiration Poetic madness like madness in prophecy or love bursts the body of things to escape from it into some ideal and even the Homeric world though no model for a rational state was a cheerful heroic vision congenial to many early impulses and dreams of the mind Sidenote Explosive and pregnant expression Homer indeed was no primitive poet he was a consummate master the heir to generations of discipline in both life and art This appears in his perfect prosody in his limpid style in his sense for proportion his abstentions and the frank pathos of his portraits and principles in which there is nothing gross subjective or arbitrary The inspirations that came to him never carried him into crudeness or absurdity Every modern poet though the world he describes may be more refined in spots and more elaborate is less advanced in his art for art is made rudimentary not by its date but by its irrationality Yet even if Homer had been primitive he might well have been inspired in the same way as a Bacchic frenzy or a mystic trance the most blundering explosions may be justified antecedently by the plastic force that is vented in them They may be expressive in the physical sense of this ambiguous word for far as they may be from conveying an idea they may betray a tendency and prove that something is stirring in the soul Expressiveness is often sterile but it is sometimes fertile and capable of reproducing in representation the experience from which it sprang As a tree in the autumn sheds leaves and seeds together so a ripening experience comes indifferently to various manifestations some barren and without further function others fit to carry the parent experience over into another mind and give it a new embodiment there Expressiveness in the former case is dead like that of a fossil in the latter it is living and efficacious recreating its original The first is idle self manifestation the second rational art Sidenote Natural history of inspiration Self manifestation so soon as it is noted and accepted as such seems to present the same marvel as any ideal success Such self manifestation is incessant many sided unavoidable yet it seems a miracle when its conditions are looked back upon from the vantage ground of their result By reading spirit out of a work we turn it into a feat of inspiration Thus even the crudest and least coherent utterances when we suspect some soul to be groping in them and striving to address us become oracular a divine afflatus breathes behind their gibberish and they seem to manifest some deep intent The miracle of creation or inspiration consists in nothing but this that an external effect should embody an inner intention The miracle of course is apparent only and due to an inverted and captious point of view In truth the tendency that executed the work was what first made its conception possible but this conception finding the work responsive in some measure to its inner demand attributes that response to its own magic prerogative Hence the least stir and rumble of formative processes when it generates a soul makes itself somehow that soul s interpreter and dim as the spirit and its expression may both remain they are none the less in profound concord a concord which wears a miraculous providential character when it is appreciated without being understood Sidenote Expressions to be understood must be recreated and so changed Primitive poetry is the basis of all discourse If we open any ancient book we come at once upon an elaborate language and on divers conventional concepts of whose origin and history we hear nothing We must read on until by dint of guessing and by confronting instances we grow to understand those symbols The writer was himself heir to a linguistic tradition which he made his own by the same process of adoption and tentative use by which we in turn interpret his phrases he understood what he heard in terms of his own experience and attributed to his predecessors no matter what their incommunicable feelings may have been such ideas as their words generated in his own thinking In this way expressions continually change their sense they can communicate a thought only by diffusing a stimulus and in passing from mouth to mouth they will wholly reverse their connotation unless some external object or some recurring human situation gives them a constant standard by which private aberrations may be checked Thus in the first phrase of Genesis In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth the words have a stable meaning only in so far as they are indicative and bring us back to a stable object What heavens and earth stand for can be conveyed by gestures by merely pointing up and down but beyond that sensuous connotation their meaning has entirely changed since they were here written and no two minds even to day will respond to these familiar words with exactly the same images Beginning and created have a superficial clearness though their implications cannot be defined without precipitating the most intricate metaphysics which would end in nothing but a proof that both terms were ambiguous and unthinkable As to the word God all mutual understanding is impossible It is a floating literary symbol with a value which if we define it scientifically becomes quite algebraic As no experienced object corresponds to it it is without fixed indicative force and admits any sense which its context in any mind may happen to give it In the first sentence of Genesis its meaning we may safely say is a masculine being by whom heaven and earth were created To fill out this implication other instances of the word would have to be gathered in each of which of course the word would appear with a new and perhaps incompatible meaning Sidenote Expressions may be recast perversely humorously or sublimely Whenever a word appears in a radically new context it has a radically new sense the expression in which it so figures is a poetic figment a fresh literary creation Such invention is sometimes perverse sometimes humorous sometimes sublime that is it may either buffet old associations without enlarging them or give them a plausible but impossible twist or enlarge them to cover with unexpected propriety a much wider or more momentous experience The force of experience in any moment if we abstract from represented values is emotional so that for sublime poetry what is required is to tap some reservoir of feeling If a phrase opens the flood gates of emotion it has made itself most deeply significant Its discursive range and clearness may not be remarkable its emotional power will quite suffice For this reason again primitive poetry may be sublime in its inchoate phrases there is affinity to raw passion and their very blindness may serve to bring that passion back Poetry has body it represents the volume of experience as well as its form and to express volume a primitive poet will rely rather on rhythm sound and condensed suggestion than on discursive fulness or scope Sidenote The nature of prose The descent from poetry to prose is in one sense a progress When use has worn down a poetic phrase to its external import and rendered it an indifferent symbol for a particular thing that phrase has become prosaic it has also become by the same process transparent and purely instrumental In poetry feeling is transferred by contagion in prose it is communicated by bending the attention upon determinate objects the one stimulates and the other informs Under the influence of poetry various minds radiate from a somewhat similar core of sensation from the same vital mood into the most diverse and incommunicable images Interlocutors speaking prose on the contrary pelt and besiege one another with a peripheral attack they come into contact at sundry superficial points and thence push their agreement inwards until perhaps a practical coincidence is arrived at in their thought Agreement is produced by controlling each mind externally through a series of checks and little appeals to possible sensation whereas in poetry the agreement where it exists is vague and massive there is an initial fusion of minds under hypnotic musical influences from which each listener as he awakes passes into his own thoughts and interpretations In prose the vehicle for communication is a conventional sign standing in the last analysis for some demonstrable object or controllable feeling By marshalling specific details a certain indirect suasion is exercised on the mind as nature herself by continual checks and denials gradually tames the human will The elements of prose are always practical if we run back and reconstruct their primitive essence for at bottom every experience is an original and not a copy a nucleus for ideation rather than an object to which ideas may refer It is when these stimulations are shaken together and become a system of mutual checks that they begin to take on ideally a rhythm borrowed from the order in which they actually recurred Then a prophetic or representative movement arises in thought Before this comes about experience remains a constantly renovated dream as poetry to the end conspires to keep it For poetry while truly poetical never loses sight of initial feelings and underlying appeals it is incorrigibly transcendental and takes every present passion and every private dream in turn for the core of the universe By creating new signs or by recasting and crossing those which have become conventional it keeps communication massive and instinctive immersed in music and inexhaustible by clear thought Sidenote It is more advanced and responsible than poetry Lying is a privilege of poets because they have not yet reached the level on which truth and error are discernible Veracity and significance are not ideals for a primitive mind we learn to value them as we learn to live when we discover that the spirit cannot be wholly free and solipsistic To have to distinguish fact from fancy is so great a violence to the inner man that not only poets but theologians and philosophers still protest against such a distinction They urge what is perfectly true for a rudimentary creature that facts are mere conceptions and conceptions full fledged facts but this interesting embryonic lore they apply in their intellectual weakness to retracting or undermining those human categories which though alone fruitful or applicable in life are not congenial to their half formed imagination Retreating deeper into the inner chaos they bring to bear the whole momentum of an irresponsible dialectic to frustrate the growth of representative ideas In this they are genuine if somewhat belated poets experimenting anew with solved problems and fancying how creation might have moved upon other lines The great merit that prose shares with science is that it is responsible Its conscience is a new and wiser imagination by which creative thought is rendered cumulative and progressive for a man does not build less boldly or solidly if he takes the precaution of building in baked brick Prose is in itself meagre and bodiless merely indicating the riches of the world Its transparency helps us to look through it to the issue and the signals it gives fill the mind with an honest assurance and a prophetic art far nobler than any ecstasy Sidenote Maturity brings love of practical truth As men of action have a better intelligence than poets if only their action is on a broad enough stage so the prosaic rendering of experience has the greater value if only the experience rendered covers enough human interests Youth and aspiration indulge in poetry a mature and masterful mind will often despise it and prefer to express itself laconically in prose It is clearly proper that prosaic habits should supervene in this way on the poetical for youth being as yet little fed by experience can find volume and depth only in the soul the half seen the supra mundane the inexpressible seem to it alone beautiful and worthy of homage Time modifies this sentiment in two directions It breeds lassitude and indifference towards impracticable ideals originally no less worthy than the practicable Ideals which cannot be realised and are not fed at least by partial realisations soon grow dormant Life blood passes to other veins the urgent and palpitating interests of life appear in other quarters While things impossible thus lose their serious charm things actual reveal their natural order and variety these not only can entertain the mind abstractly but they can offer a thousand material rewards in observation and action In their presence a private dream begins to look rather cheap and hysterical Not that existence has any dignity or prerogative in the presence of will but that will itself being elastic grows definite and firm when it is fed by success and its formed and expressible ideals then put to shame the others which have remained vague for want of practical expression Mature interests centre on soluble problems and tasks capable of execution it is at such points that the ideal can be really served The individual s dream straightens and reassures itself by merging with the dream of humanity To dwell as irrational poets do on some private experience on some emotion without representative or ulterior value then seems a waste of time Fiction becomes less interesting than affairs and poetry turns into a sort of incompetent whimper a childish fore shortening of the outspread world Sidenote Pure prose would tend to efface itself On the other hand prose has a great defect which is abstractness It drops the volume of experience in finding bodiless algebraic symbols by which to express it The verbal form instead of transmitting an image seems to constitute it in so far as there is an image suggested at all and the ulterior situation is described only in the sense that a change is induced in the hearer which prepares him to meet that situation Prose seems to be a use of language in the service of material life It would tend in that case to undermine its own basis for in proportion as signals for action are quick and efficacious they diminish their sensuous stimulus and fade from consciousness Were language such a set of signals it would be something merely instrumental which if made perfect ought to be automatic and unconscious It would be a buzzing in the ears not a music native to the mind Such a theory of language would treat it as a necessary evil and would look forward hopefully to the extinction of literature in which it would recognise nothing ideal There is of course no reason to deprecate the use of vocables or of any other material agency to expedite affairs but an art of speech if it is to add any ultimate charm to life has to supervene upon a mere code of signals Prose could it be purely representative would be ideally superfluous A literary prose accordingly owns a double allegiance and its life is amphibious It must convey intelligence but intelligence clothed in a language that lends the message an intrinsic value and makes it delightful to apprehend apart from its importance in ultimate theory or practice Prose is in that measure a fine art It might be called poetry that had become pervasively representative and was altogether faithful to its rational function Sidenote Form alone or substance alone may be poetical We may therefore with good reason distinguish prosaic form from prosaic substance A novel a satire a book of speculative philosophy may have a most prosaic exterior every phrase may convey its idea economically but the substance may nevertheless be poetical since these ideas may be irrelevant to all ulterior events and may express nothing but the imaginative energy that called them forth On the other hand a poetic vehicle in which there is much ornamental play of language and rhythm may clothe a dry ideal skeleton So those tremendous positivists the Hebrew prophets had the most prosaic notions about the goods and evils of life So Lucretius praised I will not say the atoms merely but even fecundity and wisdom The motives to take another example which Racine attributed to his personages were prosaically conceived a physiologist could not be more exact in his calculations for even love may be made the mainspring in a clock work of emotions Yet that Racine was a born poet appears in the music nobility and tenderness of his medium he clothed his intelligible characters in magical and tragic robes the aroma of sentiment rises like a sort of pungent incense between them and us and no dramatist has ever had so sure a mastery over transports and tears Sidenote Poetry has its place in the medium In the medium a poet is at home in the world he tries to render he is a child and a stranger Poetic notions are false notions in so far as their function is representative they are vitiated by containing elements not present in things Truth is a jewel which should not be painted over but it may be set to advantage and shown in a good light The poetic way of idealising reality is dull bungling and impure a better acquaintance with things renders such flatteries ridiculous That very effort of thought by which opaque masses of experience were first detached from the flux and given a certain individuality seeks to continue to clarify them until they become as transparent as possible To resist this clarification to love the chance incrustations that encumber human ideas is a piece of timid folly and poetry in this respect is nothing but childish confusion Poetic apprehension is a makeshift in so far as its cognitive worth is concerned it is exactly in this respect what myth is to science Approaching its subject matter from a distance with incongruous categories it translates it into some vague and misleading symbol rich in emotions which the object as it is could never arouse and is sure presently to contradict What lends these hybrid ideas their temporary eloquence and charm is their congruity with the mind that breeds them and with its early habits Falsification or rather clouded vision gives to poetry a more human accent and a readier welcome than to truth In other words it is the medium that asserts itself the apperceptive powers indulge their private humours and neglect the office to which they were assigned once for all by their cognitive essence Sidenote It is the best medium possible That the medium should so assert itself however is no anomaly the cognitive function being an ulterior one to which ideas are by no means obliged to conform Apperception is itself an activity or art and like all others terminates in a product which is a good in itself apart from its utilities If we abstract then from the representative function which may perhaps accrue to speech and regard it merely as an operation absorbing energy and occasioning delight we see that poetic language is language at its best Its essential success consists in fusing ideas in charming sounds or in metaphors that shine by their own brilliance Poetry is an eloquence justified by its spontaneity as eloquence is a poetry justified by its application The first draws the whole soul into the situation and the second puts the whole situation before the soul Sidenote Might it not convey what it is best to know Is there not we may ask some ideal form of discourse in which apperceptive life could be engaged with all its volume and transmuting power and in which at the same time no misrepresentation should be involved Transmutation is not erroneous when it is intentional misrepresentation does not please for being false but only because truth would be more congenial if it resembled such a fiction Why should not discourse then have nothing but truth in its import and nothing but beauty in its form With regard to euphony and grammatical structure there is evidently nothing impossible in such an ideal for these radical beauties of language are independent of the subject matter They form the body of poetry but the ideal and emotional atmosphere which is its soul depends on things external to language which no perfection in the medium could modify It might seem as if the brilliant substitutions the magic suggestions essential to poetry would necessarily vanish in the full light of day The light of day is itself beautiful but would not the loss be terrible if no other light were ever suffered to shine Sidenote A rational poetry would exclude much now thought poetical The Life of Reason involves sacrifice What forces yearn for the ideal being many and incompatible have to yield and partly deny themselves in order to attain any ideal at all There is something sad in all possible attainment so long as the rational virtue which wills such attainment is not pervasive and even then there is limitation to put up with and the memory of many a defeat Rational poetry is possible and would be infinitely more beautiful than the other but the charm of unreason if unreason seem charming it certainly could not preserve In what human fancy demands as at present constituted there are irrational elements The given world seems insufficient impossible things have to be imagined both to extend its limits and to fill in and vivify its texture Homer has a mythology without which experience would have seemed to him undecipherable Dante has his allegories and his mock science Shakespeare has his romanticism Goethe his symbolic characters and artificial machinery All this lumber seems to have been somehow necessary to their genius they could not reach expression in more honest terms If such indirect expression could be discarded it would not be missed but while the mind for want of a better vocabulary is reduced to using these symbols it pours into them a part of its own life and makes them beautiful Their loss is a real blow while the incapacity that called for them endures and the soul seems to be crippled by losing its crutches Sidenote All apperception modifies its object There are certain adaptations and abbreviations of reality which thought can never outgrow Thought is representative it enriches each soul and each moment with premonitions of surrounding existences If discourse is to be significant it must transfer to its territory and reduce to its scale whatever objects it deals with in other words thought has a point of view and cannot see the world except in perspective This point of view is not for reason locally or naturally determined sense alone is limited in that material fashion being seated in the body and looking thence centrifugally upon things in so far as they come into dynamic relations with that body Intelligence on the contrary sallies from that physical stronghold and consists precisely in shifting and universalising the point of view neutralising all local temporal or personal conditions Yet intelligence notwithstanding has its own centre and point of origin not explicitly in space or in a natural body but in some specific interest or moral aim It translates animal life into moral endeavour and what figured in the first as a local existence figures in the second as a specific good Reason accordingly has its essential bias and looks at things as they affect the particular form of life which reason expresses and though all reality should be ultimately swept by the eye of reason the whole would still be surveyed by a particular method from a particular starting point for a particular end nor would it take much shrewdness to perceive that this nucleus for discourse and estimation this ideal life corresponds in the moral world to that animal body which gave sensuous experience its seat and centre so that rationality is nothing but the ideal function or aspect of natural life Reason is universal in its outlook and in its sympathies it is the faculty of changing places ideally and representing alien points of view but this very self transcendence manifests a certain special method in life an equilibrium which a far sighted being is able to establish between itself and its comprehended conditions Reason remains to the end essentially human and in its momentary actuality necessarily personal Sidenote Reason has its own bias and method We have here an essential condition of discourse which renders it at bottom poetical Selection and applicability govern all thinking and govern it in the interests of the soul Reason is itself a specific medium so that prose can never attain that perfect transparency and mere utility which we were attributing to it We should not wish to know things in themselves even if we were able What it concerns us to know about them is merely the service or injury they are able to do us and in what fashion they can affect our lives To know this would be in so far truly to know them but it would be to know them through our own faculties and through their supposed effects it would be to know them by their appearance A singular proof of the frivolous way in which philosophers often proceed when they think they are particularly profound is seen in this puzzle on which they solemnly ask us to fix our thoughts How is it possible to know reality if all we can attain in experience is but appearance The meaning of knowledge which is an intellectual and living thing is here forgotten and the notion of sensation or bodily possession is substituted for it so what we are really asked to consider is how had we no understanding we should be able to understand what we endure It is by conceiving what we endure to be the appearance of something beyond us that we reach knowledge that something exists beyond us and that it plays in respect to us a determinate role There could be no knowledge of reality if what conveyed that knowledge were not felt to be appearance nor can a medium of knowledge better than appearance be by any possibility conceived To have such appearances is what makes realities knowable Knowledge transcends sensation by relating it to other sensation and thereby rising to a supersensuous plane the plane of principles and causes by which sensibles are identified in character and distributed in existence These principles and causes are what we call the intelligible or the real world and the sensations when they have been so interpreted and underpinned are what we call experience Sidenote Rational poetry would envelop exact knowledge in ultimate emotions If a poet could clarify the myths he begins with so as to reach ultimate scientific notions of nature and life he would still be dealing with vivid feeling and with its imaginative expression The prosaic landscape before him would still be a work of art painted on the human brain by human reason If he found that landscape uninteresting it would be because he was not really interested in life if he found it dull and unpoetical he would be manifesting his small capacity and childish whims Tragic fatal intractable he might well feel that the truth was but these qualities have never been absent from that half mythical world through which poets for want of a rational education have hitherto wandered A rational poet s vision would have the same moral functions which myth was asked to fulfil and fulfilled so treacherously it would employ the same ideal faculties which myth expressed in a confused and hasty fashion More detail would have been added and more variety in interpretation To deal with so great an object and retain his mastery over it a poet would doubtless need a robust genius If he possessed it and in transmuting all existence falsified nothing giving that picture of everything which human experience in the end would have drawn he would achieve an ideal result In prompting mankind to imagine he would be helping them to live His poetry without ceasing to be a fiction in its method and ideality would be an ultimate truth in its practical scope It would present in graphic images the total efficacy of real things Such a poetry would be more deeply rooted in human experience than is any casual fancy and therefore more appealing to the heart Such a poetry would represent more thoroughly than any formula the concrete burden of experience it would become the most trustworthy of companions The images it had worked out would confront human passion more intelligibly than does the world as at present conceived with its mechanism half ignored and its ideality half invented they would represent vividly the uses of nature and thereby make all natural situations seem so many incentives to art Sidenote An illustration Rational poetry is not wholly unknown When Homer mentions an object how does he render it poetical First doubtless by the euphony of its name or the sensuous glow of some epithet coupled with it Sometimes however even this ornamental epithet is not merely sensuous it is very likely a patronymic the name of some region or some mythical ancestor In other words it is a signal for widening our view and for conceiving the object not only vividly and with pause but in an adequate historic setting Macbeth tells us that his dagger was unmannerly breeched in gore Achilles would not have amused himself with such a metaphor even if breeches had existed in his day but would rather have told us whose blood on other occasions had stained the same blade and perhaps what father or mother had grieved for the slaughtered hero or what brave children remained to continue his race Shakespeare s phrase is ingenious and fanciful it dazzles for a moment but in the end it seems violent and crude What Homer would have said on the contrary being simple and true might have grown as we dwelt upon it always more noble pathetic and poetical Shakespeare too beneath his occasional absurdities of plot and diction ennobles his stage with actual history with life painted to the quick with genuine human characters politics and wisdom and surely these are not the elements that do least credit to his genius In every poet indeed there is some fidelity to nature mixed with that irrelevant false fancy with which poetry is sometimes identified and the degree in which a poet s imagination dominates reality is in the end the exact measure of his importance and dignity Sidenote Volume can be found in scope better than in suggestion Before prosaic objects are descried the volume and richness needful for poetry lie in a blurred and undigested chaos but after the common world has emerged and has called on prose to describe it the same volume and richness may be recovered and a new and clarified poetry may arise through synthesis Scope is a better thing than suggestion and more truly poetical It has expressed what suggestion pointed to and felt in the bulk it possesses what was yearned for A real thing when all its pertinent natural associates are discerned touches wonder pathos and beauty on every side the rational poet is one who without feigning anything unreal perceives these momentous ties and presents his subject loaded with its whole fate missing no source of worth which is in it no ideal influence which it may have Homer remains perhaps the greatest master in this art The world he glorified by showing in how many ways it could serve reason and beauty was but a simple world and an equal genius in these days might be distracted by the Babel about him and be driven as poets now are into incidental dreams Yet the ideal of mastery and idealisation remains the same if any one could only attain it mastery to see things as they are and dare to describe them ingenuously idealisation to select from this reality what is pertinent to ultimate interests and can speak eloquently to the soul CHAPTER VII PLASTIC CONSTRUCTION Sidenote Automatic expression often leaves traces in the outer world We have seen how arts founded on exercise and automatic self expression develop into music poetry and prose By an indirect approach they come to represent outer conditions till they are interwoven in a life which has in some measure gone out to meet its opportunities and learned to turn them to an ideal use We have now to see how man s reactive habits pass simultaneously into art in a wholly different region Spontaneous expression such as song comes when internal growth in an animal system vents itself as it were by the way At the same time animal economy has playful manifestations concerned with outer things such as burrowing or collecting objects These practices are not less spontaneous than the others and no less expressive but they seem more external because the traces they leave on the environment are more clearly marked To change an object is the surest and most glorious way of changing a perception A shift in posture may relieve the body and in that way satisfy but the new attitude is itself unstable Its pleasantness like its existence is transient and scarcely is a movement executed when both its occasion and its charm are forgotten Self expression by exercise in spite of its pronounced automatism is therefore something comparatively passive and inglorious A man has hardly done anything when he has laughed or yawned Even the inspired poet retains something of this passivity his work is not his but that of a restless irresponsible spirit passing through him and hypnotising him for its own ends Of the result he has no profit no glory and little understanding So the mystic also positively gloats on his own nothingness and puts his whole genuine being in a fancied instrumentality and subordination to something else Far more virile and noble is the sense of having actually done something and left at least the temporary stamp of one s special will on the world To chop a stick to catch a fly to pile a heap of sand is a satisfying action for the sand stays for a while in its novel arrangement proclaiming to the surrounding level that we have made it our instrument while the fly will never stir nor the stick grow together again in all eternity If the impulse that has thus left its indelible mark on things is constant in our own bosom the world will have been permanently improved and humanised by our action Nature cannot but be more favourable to those ideas which have once found an efficacious champion Sidenote Such effects fruitful Plastic impulses find in this way an immediate sanction in the sense of victory and dominion which they carry with them it is so evident a proof of power in ourselves to see things and animals bent out of their habitual form and obedient instead to our idea But a far weightier sanction immediately follows Man depends on things for his experience yet by automatic action he changes these very things so that it becomes possible that by his action he should promote his welfare He may of course no less readily precipitate his ruin The animal is more subject to vicissitudes than the plant which makes no effort to escape them or to give chase to what it feeds upon The greater perils of action however are in animals covered partly by fertility partly by adaptability partly by success The mere possibility of success in a world governed by natural selection is an earnest of progress Sometimes in impressing the environment a man will improve it which is merely to say that a change may sometimes fortify the impulse which brought it about As soon as this retroaction is perceived and the act is done with knowledge of its ensuing benefits plastic impulse becomes art and the world begins actually to change in obedience to reason One respect for instance in which man depends on things is for the aesthetic quality of his perceptions If he happens by a twist of the hand to turn a flowering branch into a wreath thereby making it more interesting he will have discovered a decorative art and initiated himself auspiciously into the practice of it Experimentation may follow and whenever the new form given to the object improves it i e increases its interest for the eye the experimenter will triumph and will congratulate himself on his genius The garland so arranged will be said to express the taste it satisfies insight and reason will be mythically thought to have guided the work by which they are sustained in being It is no small harmony however that they should be sustained by it The consonances man introduces into nature will follow him wherever he goes It will no longer be necessary that nature should supply them spontaneously by a rare adventitious harmony with his demands His new habit will habitually rear range her chance arrangements and his path will be marked by the beauties he has strewn it with So long as the same plastic impulse continues operative it will be accompanied by knowledge and criticism of its happy results Self criticism being a second incipient artistic impulse contrasting itself with the one which a work embodies may to some extent modify the next performance If life is drawn largely into this deepening channel physical proficiency and its ideal sanctions will develop more or less harmoniously into what is called a school of art Sidenote Magic authority of man s first creations The first felt utilities by which plastic instinct is sanctioned are of course not distinctly aesthetic much less distinctly practical they are magical A stone cut into some human or animal semblance fascinates the savage eye much more than would a useful tool or a beautiful idol The man wonders at his own work and petrifies the miracle of his art into miraculous properties in its product Primitive art is incredibly conservative its first creations having once attracted attention monopolise it henceforth and nothing else will be trusted to work the miracle It is a sign of stupidity in general to stick to physical objects and given forms apart from their ideal functions as when a child cries for a broken doll even if a new and better one is at hand to replace it Inert associations establish themselves in such a case with that part of a thing which is irrelevant to its value its material substance or perhaps its name Art can make no progress in such a situation A man remains incorrigibly unhappy and perplexed cowed and helpless because not intelligent enough to readjust his actions his idol must be the self same hereditary stock or at least it must have the old sanctified rigidity and stare Plastic impulse as yet sporadic is overwhelmed by a brute idolatrous awe at mere existence and actuality What is what has always been what chance has associated with one person alone seems acceptable or conceivable Sidenote Art brings relief from idolatry Idolatry is by no means incident to art art on the contrary is a release from idolatry A cloud an animal a spring a stone or the whole heaven will serve the pure idolater s purpose to perfection these things have existence and a certain hypnotic power so that he may make them a focus for his dazed contemplation When the mind takes to generalities it finds the same fascination in Being or in the Absolute something it needs no art to discover The more indeterminate immediate and unutterable the idol is the better it induces panic self contraction and a reduction of all discourse to the infinite intensity of zero When idolaters pass from trying to evoke the Absolutely Existent to apostrophising the sun or an ithyphallic bull they have made an immense progress in art and religion for now their idols represent some specific and beneficent function in nature something propitious to ideal life and to its determinate expression Isaiah is very scornful of idols made with hands because they have no physical energy He forgets that perhaps they represent something and so have a spiritual dignity which things living and powerful never have unless they too become representative and express some ideal Isaiah s conception of Jehovah for instance is itself a poetic image the work of man s brain and the innocent worship of it would not be idolatry if that conception represented something friendly to human happiness and to human art The question merely is whether the sculptor s image or the prophet s stands for the greater interest and is a more adequate symbol for the good The noblest art will be the one whether plastic or literary or dialectical which creates figments most truly representative of what is momentous in human life Similarly the least idolatrous religion would be the one which used the most perfect art and most successfully abstracted the good from the real Sidenote Inertia in technique Conservatism rules also in those manufactures which are tributary to architecture and the smaller plastic arts Utility makes small headway against custom not only when custom has become religion but even when it remains inert and without mythical sanction To admit or trust anything new is to overcome that inertia which is a general law in the brain no less than elsewhere and which may be distinguished in reflection into a technical and a social conservatism Technical conservatism appears for instance in a man s handwriting which is so seldom improved even when admitted perhaps to be execrable Every artist has his tricks of execution every school its hereditary irrational processes These refractory habits are to blame for the rare and inimitable quality of genius they impose excellence on one man and refuse it to a million A happy physiological structure by creating a mannerism under the special circumstances favourable to expression may lift a man perhaps inferior in intelligence to heights which no insight can attain with inferior organs As a voice is necessary for singing so a certain quickness of eye and hand is needed for good execution in the plastic arts The same principle goes deeper Conception and imagination are themselves automatic and run in grooves so that only certain forms in certain combinations will ever suggest themselves to a given designer Every writer s style too however varied within limits is single and monotonous compared with the ideal possibilities of expression Genius at every moment is confined to the idiom it is creating Sidenote Inertia in appreciation Social inertia is due to the same causes working in the community at large The fancy for instance of building churches in the shape of a cross has largely determined Christian architecture Builders were prevented by a foregone suggestion in themselves and by their patrons demands from conceiving any alternative to that convention Early pottery they say imitates wicker work and painted landscape was for ages not allowed to exist without figures although even the old masters show plainly enough in their backgrounds that they could love landscape for its own sake When one link with humanity has been rendered explicit and familiar people assume that by no other means can humanity be touched at all even if at the same time their own heart is expanding to the highest raptures in a quite different region The severer Greeks reprobated music without words Saint Augustine complained of chants that rendered the sacred text unintelligible the Puritans regarded elaborate music as diabolical little knowing how soon some of their descendants would find religion in nothing else A stupid convention still looks on material and mathematical processes as somehow distressing and ugly and systems of philosophy artificially mechanical are invented to try to explain natural mechanism away whereas in no region can the spirit feel so much at home as among natural causes or realise so well its universal affinities or so safely enlarge its happiness Mechanism is the source of beauty It is not necessary to look so high as the stars to perceive this truth the action of an animal s limbs or the movement of a waterfall will prove it to any one who has eyes and can shake himself loose from verbal prejudices those debris of old perceptions which choke all fresh perception in the soul Irrational hopes irrational shames irrational decencies make man s chief desolation A slight knocking of fools heads together might be enough to break up the ossifications there and start the blood coursing again through possible channels Art has an infinite range nothing shifts so easily as taste and yet nothing so persistently avoids the directions in which it might find most satisfaction Sidenote Adventitious effects appreciated first Since construction grows rational slowly and by indirect pressure we may expect that its most superficial merits will be the first appreciated Ultimate beauty in a building would consist of course in responding simultaneously to all the human faculties affected to the eye by the building s size form and colour to the imagination by its fitness and ideal expression Of all grounds for admiration those most readily seized are size elaboration splendour of materials and difficulties or cost involved Having built or dug in the conventional way a man may hang before his door some trophy of battle or the chase bearing witness to his prowess just as people now not thinking of making their rooms beautiful fill them with photographs of friends or places they have known to suggest and reburnish in their minds their interesting personal history which even they unstimulated might tend to forget That dwelling will seem best adorned which contains most adventitious objects bare and ugly will be whatever is not concealed by something else Again a barbarous architect without changing his model may build in a more precious material and his work will be admired for the evidence it furnishes of wealth and wilfulness As a community grows luxurious and becomes accustomed to such display it may come to seem strange and hideous to see a wooden plate or a pewter spoon A beautiful house will need to be in marble and the sight of plebeian brick will banish all satisfaction Less irrational and therefore less vulgar is the wonder aroused by great bulk or difficulty in the work Exertions to produce a great result even if it be material must be allied to perseverance and intelligent direction Roman bridges and aqueducts for instance gain a profound emotional power when we see in their monotonous arches a symbol of the mightiest enterprise in history and in their decay an evidence of its failure Curiosity is satisfied historic imagination is stimulated tragic reflection is called forth We cannot refuse admiration to a work so full of mind even if no great plastic beauty happens to distinguish it It is at any rate beautiful enough like the sea or the skeleton of a mountain We may rely on the life it has made possible to add more positive charms and clothe it with imaginative functions Modern engineering works often have a similar value the force and intelligence they express merge in an aesthetic essence and the place they hold in a portentous civilisation lends them an almost epic dignity New York since it took to doing business in towers has become interesting to look at from the sea nor is it possible to walk through the overshadowed streets without feeling a pleasing wonder A city when enough people swarm in it is as fascinating as an ant hill and its buildings whatever other charms they may have are at least as curious and delightful as sea shells or birds nests The purpose of improvements in modern structures may be economic just as the purpose of castles was military but both may incidentally please the contemplative mind by their huge forms and human associations Sidenote Approach to beauty through useful structure Of the two approaches which barbaric architecture makes to beauty one through ornamentation and the other through mass the latter is in general the more successful An engineer fights with nature hand to hand he is less easily extravagant than a decorator he can hardly ever afford to be absurd He becomes accordingly more rapidly civilised and his work acquires in spite of itself more rationality and a more permanent charm A self sustaining structure in art as in life is the only possible basis for a vital ideal When the framework is determined when it is tested by trial and found to stand and serve it will gradually ingratiate itself with the observer affinities it may have in his memory or apperceptive habits will come to light they will help him to assimilate the new vision and will define its aesthetic character Whatever beauty its lines may have will become a permanent possession and whatever beauties they exclude will be rejected by a faithful artist no matter how sorely at first they may tempt him Not that these excluded beauties would not be really beautiful like fashions they would truly please in their day and very likely would contain certain absolute excellences of form or feeling which an attentive eye could enjoy at any time Yet if appended to a structure they have no function in these excellences will hardly impose themselves on the next builder Being adventitious they will remain optional and since fancy is quick and exotic beauties are many there will be no end to the variations in endless directions which art will undergo Caprice will follow caprice and no style will be developed Sidenote Failure of adapted styles A settled style is perhaps in itself no desideratum A city that should be a bazaar of all possible architectures adding a multitude of new inventions to samples of every historical style might have a certain interest yet carnival can hardly be enjoyed all the year round and there is a certain latent hideousness in masquerades in spite of their glitter Not only are the effects juxtaposed incongruous but each apart is usually shallow and absurd A perruque cannot bring back courtly manners and a style of architecture when revived is never quite genuine adaptations have to be introduced and every adaptation the bolder it is runs the greater risk of being extravagant Nothing is more pitiable than the attempts people make who think they have an exquisite sensibility to live in a house all of one period The connoisseur like an uncritical philosopher boasts to have patched his dwelling perfectly together but he has forgotten himself its egregious inhabitant Nor is he merely a blot in his own composition his presence secretly infects and denaturalises everything in it Ridiculous himself in such a setting he makes it ridiculous too by his aesthetic pose and appreciations for the objects he has collected or reproduced were once used and prized in all honesty when life and inevitable tradition had brought them forth while now they are studied and exhibited relics of a dead past and evidences of a dead present Historic remains and restorations might well be used as one uses historic knowledge to serve some living interest and equip the mind for the undertakings of the hour An artist may visit a museum but only a pedant can live there Ideas that have long been used may be used still if they remain ideas and have not been congealed into memories Incorporated into a design that calls for them traditional forms cease to be incongruous as words that still have a felt meaning may be old without being obsolete All depends on men subserving an actual ideal and having so firm and genuine an appreciation of the past as to distinguish at once what is still serviceable in it from what is already ghostly and dead Sidenote Not all structure beautiful nor all beauty structural An artist may be kept true to his style either by ignorance of all others or by love of his own This fidelity is a condition of progress When he has learned to appreciate whatever is aesthetically appreciable in his problem he can go on to refine his construction to ennoble and finally to decorate it As fish flesh and fowl have specific forms each more or less beautiful and adorned so every necessary structure has its specific character and its essential associations Taking his cue from these an artist may experiment freely he may emphasise the structure in the classic manner and turn its lines into ornament adding only what may help to complete and unite its suggestions This puritanism in design is rightly commended but its opposite may be admirable too We may admit that nudity is the right garment for the gods but it would hardly serve the interests of beauty to legislate that all mortals should always go naked The veil that conceals natural imperfections may have a perfection of its own Maxims in art are pernicious beauty is here the only commandment And beauty is a free natural gift When it has appeared we may perceive that its influence is rational since it both expresses and fosters a harmony of impressions and impulses in the soul but to take any mechanism whatever and merely because it is actual or necessary to insist that it is worth exhibiting and that by divine decree it shall be pronounced beautiful is to be quite at sea in moral philosophy Beauty is adventitious occasional incidental in human products no less than in nature Works of art are automatic figments which nature fashions through man It is impossible they should be wholly beautiful as it is impossible that they should offer no foothold or seed plot for beauty at all Beauty is everywhere potential and in a way pervasive because existence itself presupposes a modicum of harmony first within the thing and then between the thing and its environment Of this environment the observer s senses are in this case an important part Man can with difficulty maintain senses quite out of key with the stimuli furnished by the outer world They would then be useless burdens to his organism On the other side even artificial structures must be somehow geometrical or proportional because only such structures hold physically together Objects that are to be esteemed by man must further possess or acquire some function in his economy otherwise they would not be noticed nor be so defined as to be recognisable Out of these physical necessities beauty may grow but an adjustment must first take place between the material stimulus and the sense it affects Beauty is something spiritual and being such it rests not on the material constitution of each existence taken apart but on their conspiring ideally together so that each furthers the other s endeavour Structure by itself is no more beautiful than existence by itself is good They are only potentialities or conditions of excellence Sidenote Structures designed for display An architect when his main structure is uninteresting may have recourse to a subsidiary construction The facade or a part of it or the interior may still have a natural form that lends itself to elaboration This beautiful feature may be developed so as to ignore or even conceal the rest then the visible portion may be entirely beautiful like the ideal human figure though no pledges be given concerning the anatomy within Many an Italian palace has a false front in itself magnificent We may chance to observe however that it overtops its backing perhaps an amorphous rambling pile in quite another material What we admire is not so much a facade as a triumphal gateway set up in front of the house to be its ambassador to the world wearing decidedly richer apparel than its master can afford at home This was not vanity in the Italians so much as civility to the public to whose taste this flattering embassy was addressed However our moral sense may judge the matter it is clear that two separate monuments occupied the architect in such cases if indeed inside and outside were actually designed by the same hand Structure may appear in each independently and may be frankly enough expressed The most beautiful facades even if independent of their building are buildings themselves and since their construction is decorative there is the greater likelihood that their decoration should be structural In relation to the house however the facade in such an extreme case would be an abstract ornament and so though the ornament be structural within its own lines we have reverted to the style of building where construction is one thing and decoration another Applied ornament has an indefinite range and there would be little profit in reasoning about it Philosophy can do little more at this point than expose the fallacies into which dogmatic criticism is apt to fall Everything is true decoration which truly adorns and everything adorns which enriches the impression and pleasantly entertains the eye There is a decorative impulse as well as a sense for decoration As I sit idle my stick makes meaningless marks upon the sand or what is nearer to the usual origin of ornament I make a design out of somebody s initials or symbolise fantastically something lying in my thoughts We place also one thing upon another the better to see and to think of two things at once Sidenote Appeal made by decoration To love decoration is to enjoy synthesis in other words it is to have hungry senses and unused powers of attention This hunger when it cannot well be fed by recollecting things past relishes a profusion of things simultaneous Nothing is so much respected by unintelligent people as elaboration and complexity They are simply dazed and overawed at seeing at once so much more than they can master To overwhelm the senses is for them the only way of filling the mind It takes cultivation to appreciate in art as in philosophy the consummate value of what is simple and finite because it has found its pure function and ultimate import in the world What is just what is delicately and silently adjusted to its special office and thereby in truth to all ultimate issues seems to the vulgar something obvious and poor What astonishes them is the crude and paradoxical jumble of a thousand suggestions in a single view As the mystic yearns for an infinitely glutted consciousness that feels everything at once and is not put to the inconvenience of any longer thinking or imagining so the barbarian craves the assault of a myriad sensations together and feels replete and comfortable when a sort of infinite is poured into him without ideal mediation As ideal mediation is another name for intelligence so it is the condition of elegance Intelligence and elegance naturally exist together since they both spring from a subtle sense for absent and eventual processes They are sustained by experience by nicety in foretaste and selection Before ideality however is developed volume and variety must be given bodily or they cannot be given at all At that earlier stage a furious ornamentation is the chief vehicle for beauty Sidenote Its natural rights That the ornate may be very beautiful that in fact what is to be completely beautiful needs to be somehow rich is a fact of experience which further justifies the above analysis For sensation is the matter of ideas all representation is such only in its function in its existence it remains mere feeling Decoration by stimulating the senses not only brings a primary satisfaction with it independent of any that may supervene but it furnishes an element of effect which no higher beauty can ever render unwelcome or inappropriate since any higher beauty in moving the mind must give it a certain sensuous and emotional colouring Decoration is accordingly an independent art to be practised for its own sake in obedience to elementary plastic instincts It is fundamental in design for everything structural or significant produces in the first instance some sensuous impression and figures as a spot or pattern in the field of vision The fortunate architect is he who has for structural skeleton in his work a form in itself decorative and beautiful who can carry it out in a beautiful material and who finally is suffered to add so much decoration as the eye may take in with pleasure without losing the expression and lucidity of the whole It is impossible however to imagine beforehand what these elements should be or how to combine them The problem must exist before its solution can be found The forms of good taste and beauty which a man can think of or esteem are limited by the scope of his previous experience It would be impossible to foresee or desire a beauty which had not somehow grown up of itself and been recognised receptively A satisfaction cannot be conceived ideally when neither its organ nor its occasion has as yet arisen That ideal conception to exist would have to bring both into play The fine arts are butter to man s daily bread there is no conceiving or creating them except as they spring out of social exigencies Their types are imposed by utility their ornamentation betrays the tradition that happens to envelop and diversify them their expression and dignity are borrowed from the company they keep in the world Sidenote Its alliance with structure in Greek architecture The Greek temple for instance if we imagine it in its glory with all its colour and furniture was a type of human art at its best where decoration without in the least restricting itself took naturally an exquisitely subordinate and pervasive form each detail had its own splendour and refinement yet kept its place in the whole Structure and decoration were alike traditional and imposed by ulterior practical or religious purposes yet by good fortune and by grace of that rationality which unified Greek life they fell together easily into a harmony such as imagination could never have devised had it been invited to decree pleasure domes for non existent beings Had the Greek gods been hideous their images and fable could not so readily have beautified the place where they were honoured and had the structural theme and uses of the temple been more complicated they would not have lent themselves so well to decoration without being submerged beneath it Sidenote Relations of the two in Gothic art In some ways the ideal Gothic church attained a similar perfection because there too the structure remained lucid and predominant while it was enriched by many necessary appointments altars stalls screens chantries which while really the raison d etre of the whole edifice aesthetically regarded served for its ornaments It may be doubted however whether Gothic construction was well grounded enough in utility to be a sound and permanent basis for beauty and the extreme instability of Gothic style the feverish inconstancy of architects straining after effects never apparently satisfactory when achieved shows that something was wrong and artificial in the situation The structure in becoming an ornament ceased to be anything else and could be discarded by any one whose fancy preferred a different image For this reason a building like the cathedral of Amiens where a structural system is put through consistently is far from representing mediaeval art in its full and ideal essence it is rather an incidental achievement a sport in which an adventitious interest is for a moment emphasised overwhelmingly Intelligence here comes to the fore and a sort of mathematical virtuosity but it was not mathematical virtuosity nor even intelligence to which in Christian art the leading role properly belonged What structural elucidation did for church architecture was much like what scholastic elucidation did for church dogma it insinuated a logic into the traditional edifice which was far from representing its soul or its genuine value The dialectic introduced might be admirable in itself in its lay and abstruse rationality but it could not be applied to the poetic material in hand without rendering it absurd and sterile The given problem was scientifically carried out but the given problem was itself fantastic To vault at such heights and to prop that vault with external buttresses was a gratuitous undertaking The result was indeed interesting the ingenuity and method exhibited were masterly in their way yet the result was not proportionate in beauty to the effort required it was after all a technical and a vain triumph Sidenote The result here romantic The true magic of that very architecture lay not in its intelligible structure but in the bewildering incidental effects which that structure permitted The part in such churches is better than the symmetrical whole often incompleteness and accretions alone give grace or expression to the monument A cross vista where all is wonder a side chapel where all is peace strike the key note here not that punctilious and wooden repetition of props and arches as a builder s model might boast to exhibit them Perhaps the most beautiful Gothic interiors are those without aisles if what we are considering is their proportion and majesty elsewhere the structure if perceived at all is too artificial and strange to be perceived intuitively and to have the glow of a genuine beauty There is an over ingenious mechanism redeemed by its colour and the thousand intervening objects when these have not been swept away Glazed and painted as Gothic churches were meant to be they were no doubt exceedingly gorgeous When we admire their structural scheme we are perhaps nursing an illusion like that which sentimental classicists once cherished when they talked about the purity of white marble statues and the ideality of their blank and sightless eyes What we treat as a supreme quality may have been a mere means to mediaeval builders and a mechanical expedient their simple hearts were set on making their churches for God s glory and their own as large as high and as rich as possible After all an uninterrupted tradition attached them to Byzantium and it was the sudden passion for stained glass and the goldsmith s love of intricate fineness which the Saracens also had shown that carried them in a century from Romanesque to flamboyant The structure was but the inevitable underpinning for the desired display If these sanctuaries in their spoliation and ruin now show us their admirable bones we should thank nature for that rational skeleton imposed by material conditions on an art which in its life time was goaded on only by a pious and local emulation and wished at all costs to be sumptuous and astonishing Sidenote The mediaeval artist It was rather in another direction that groping mediaeval art reached its most congenial triumphs That was an age so to speak of epidemic privacy social contagion was irresistible yet it served only to make each man s life no less hard narrow and visionary than that of every one else Like bees in a hive each soul worked in its separate cell by the same impulse as every other Each was absorbed in saving itself only but according to a universal prescription This isolation in unanimity appears in those patient and childlike artists who copied each his leaf or flower or imagined each his curious angels and devils taking what was told of them so much to heart that his rendering became deeply individual The lamp of sacrifice or perhaps rather of ignorance burned in every workshop much labour was wasted in forgetfulness of the function which the work was to perform yet a certain pathos and expression was infused into the detail on which all invention and pride had to be lavished Carvings and statues at impossible elevations minute symbols hidden in corners the choice for architectural ornament of animal and vegetable forms copied as attentively and quaintly as possible all this shows how abstractedly the artist surrendered himself to the given task He dedicated his genius like the widow s mite and left the universal composition to Providence Nor was this humility on another side wholly pious and sacrificial The Middle Ages were in their way merry sturdy and mischievous A fresh breath as of convalescence breathed through their misery Never was spring so green and lovely as when men greeted it in a cloistered garden with hearts quite empty and clean only half awakened from a long trance of despair It mattered little at such a moment where a work was to figure or whether any one should ever enjoy it The pleasure and the function lay here in this private revelation in this playful dialogue between a bit of nature and a passing mood When a Greek workman cut a volute or a moulding he was not asked to be a poet he was merely a scribe writing out what some master had composed before him The spirit of his art if that was called forth consciously at all could be nothing short of intelligence Those lines and none other he would say to himself are requisite and sufficient to do less would be unskilful to do more would be perverse But the mediaeval craftsman was irresponsible in his earnestness The whole did not concern him for the whole was providential and therefore to the artist irrelevant He was only responsible inwardly to his casual inspiration to his individual model and his allotted block of stone With these he carried on as it were an ingenuous dialectic asking them questions by a blow of the hammer and gathering their oracular answers experimentally from the result Art like salvation proceeded by a series of little miracles it was a blind work half stubborn patience half unmerited grace If the product was destined to fill a niche in the celestial edifice that was God s business and might be left to him what concerned the sculptor was to day s labour and joy with the shrewd wisdom they might bring after them Sidenote Representation introduced Gothic ornament was accordingly more than ornament it was sculpture To the architect sculpture and painting are only means of variegating a surface light and shade depth and elaboration are thereby secured and aid him in distributing his masses For this reason geometrical or highly conventionalised ornament is all the architect requires If his decorators furnish more if they insist on copying natural forms or illustrating history that is their own affair Their humanity will doubtless give them as representative artists a new claim on human regard and the building they enrich in their pictorial fashion will gain a new charm just as it would gain by historic associations or by the smell of incense clinging to its walls When the arts superpose their effects the total impression belongs to none of them in particular it is imaginative merely or in the broadest sense poetical So the monumental function of Greek sculpture and the interpretations it gave to national myths made every temple a storehouse of poetic memories In the same way every great cathedral became a pious story book Construction by admitting applied decoration offers a splendid basis and background for representative art It is in their decorative function that construction and representation meet they are able to conspire in one ideal effect by virtue of the common appeal which they unwittingly make to the senses If construction were not decorative it could never ally itself imaginatively to decoration and decoration in turn would never be willingly representative if the forms which illustration requires were not decorative in themselves Sidenote Transition to illustration Illustration has nevertheless an intellectual function by which it diverges altogether from decoration and even in the narrowest sense of the word from art for the essence of illustration lies neither in use nor in beauty The illustrator s impulse is to reproduce and describe given objects He wishes in the first place to force observers overlooking all logical scruples to call his work by the name of its subject matter and then he wishes to inform them further through his representation and to teach them to apprehend the real object as in its natural existence it might never have been apprehended His first task is to translate the object faithfully into his special medium his second task somewhat more ambitious is so to penetrate into the object during that process of translation that this translation may become at the same time analytic and imaginative in that it signalises the object s structure and emphasises its ideal suggestions In such reproduction both hand and mind are called upon to construct and build up a new apparition but here construction has ceased to be chiefly decorative or absolute in order to become representative The aesthetic element in art has begun to recede before the intellectual and sensuous effects while of course retained and still studied seem to be impressed into the service of ideas CHAPTER VIII PLASTIC REPRESENTATION Sidenote Psychology of imitation Imitation is a fertile principle in the Life of Reason We have seen that it furnishes the only rational sanction for belief in any fellow mind now we shall see how it creates the most glorious and interesting of plastic arts The machinery of imitation is obscure but its prevalence is obvious and even in the present rudimentary state of human biology we may perhaps divine some of its general features In a motor image the mind represents prophetically what the body is about to execute but all images are more or less motor so that no idea apparently can occupy the mind unless the body has received some impulse to enact the same The plastic instinct to reproduce what is seen is therefore simply an uninterrupted and adequate seeing these two phenomena separable logically and divided in Cartesian psychology by an artificial chasm are inseparable in existence and are for natural history two parts of the same event That an image should exist for consciousness is abstractly regarded a fact which neither involves motion nor constitutes knowledge but that natural relation to ulterior events which endows that image with a cognitive function identifies it at the same time with the motor impulse which accompanies the idea If the image involved no bodily attitude and prophesied no action it would refer to no eventual existence and would have no practical meaning Even if it meant to refer to something ulterior it would under those circumstances miss its aim seeing that no natural relation connected it with any object which could support or verify its asseverations It might feel significant like a dream but its significance would be vain and not really self transcendent for it is in the world of events that logic must find application if it cares for applicability at all This needful bond between ideas and the further existences they forebode is not merely a logical postulate taken on trust because the ideas in themselves assert it it is a previous and genetic bond proper to the soil in which the idea flourishes and a condition of its existence For the idea expresses unawares a present cerebral event of which the ulterior event consciously looked to is a descendant or an ancestor so that the ripening of that idea or its prior history leads materially to the fact which the idea seeks to represent ideally Sidenote Sustained sensation involves reproduction In some such fashion we may come to conceive how imitative art is simply the perfection and fulfilment of sensation The act of apperception in which a sensation is reflected upon and understood is already an internal reproduction The object is retraced and gone over in the mind not without quite perceptible movements in the limbs which sway as it were in sympathy with the object s habit Presumably this incipient imitation of the object is the physical basis for apperception itself the stimulus whatever devious courses it may pursue reconstitutes itself into an impulse to render the object again as we acquire the accent which we often hear This imitation sometimes has the happiest results in that the animal fights with one that fights and runs after one that runs away from him All this happens initially as we may still observe in ourselves quite without thought of eventual profit although if chase leads to contact and contact stimulates hunger or lust movements important for preservation will quickly follow Such eventual utilities however like all utilities are supported by a prodigious gratuitous vitality and long before a practical or scientific use of sensation is attained its artistic force is in full operation If art be play it is only because all life is play in the beginning Rational adjustments to truth and to benefit supervene only occasionally and at a higher level Sidenote Imitative art repeats with intent to repeat and in a new material Imitation cannot of course result in a literal repetition of the object that suggests it The copy is secondary it does not iterate the model by creating a second object on the same plane of reality but reproduces the form in a new medium and gives it a different function In these latter circumstances lies the imitative essence of the second image for one leaf does not imitate another nor is each twin the other s copy Like sensibility imitation remodels a given being so that it becomes in certain formal respects like another being in its environment It is a response and an index by which note is taken of a situation or of its possible developments When a man involuntarily imitates other men he does not become those other persons he is simply modified by their presence in a manner that allows him to conceive their will and their independent existence not without growing similar to them in some measure and framing a genuine representation of them in his soul He enacts what he understands and his understanding consists precisely in knowing that he is re enacting something which has its collateral existence elsewhere in nature An element in the percipient repeats the total movement and tendency of the person perceived The imitation though akin to what it imitates and reproducing it lies in a different medium and accordingly has a specific individuality and specific effects Imitation is far more than similarity nor does its ideal function lie in bringing a flat and unmeaning similarity about It has a representative and intellectual value because in reproducing the forms of things it reproduces them in a fresh substance to a new purpose If I imitate mankind by following their fashions I add one to the million and improve nothing but if I imitate them under proper inhibitions and in the service of my own ends I really understand them and by representing what I do not bodily become I preserve and enlarge my own being and make it relevant ideally to what it physically depends upon Assimilation is a way of drifting through the flux or of letting it drift through oneself representation on the contrary is a principle of progress To grow by accumulating passions and fancies is at best to grow in bulk it is to become what a colony or a hydra might be But to make the accretions which time brings to your being representative of what you are not and do not wish to be is to grow in dignity It is to be wise and prepared It is to survey a universe without ceasing to be a mind Sidenote Imitation leads to adaptation and to knowledge A product of imitative sensibility is accordingly on a higher plane than the original existences it introduces to one another the ignorant individual and the unknown world Imitation in softening the body into physical adjustment stimulates the mind to ideal representation This is the case even when the stimulus is a contagious influence or habit though the response may then be slavish and the representation vague Sheep jumping a wall after their leader doubtless feel that they are not alone and though their action may have no purpose it probably has a felt sanction and reward Men also think they invoke an authority when they appeal to the quod semper et ubique et ab omnibus and a conscious unanimity is a human if not a rational joy When however the stimulus to imitation is not so pervasive and touches chiefly a single sense when what it arouses is a movement of the hand or eye retracing the object then the response becomes very definitely cognitive It constitutes an observation of fact an acquaintance with a thing s structure amounting to technical knowledge for such a survey leaves behind it a power to reconstitute the process it involved It leaves an efficacious idea In an idle moment when the information thus acquired need not be put to instant use the new born faculty may work itself out spontaneously The sound heard is repeated the thing observed is sketched the event conceived is acted out in pantomime Then imitation rounds itself out an uninhibited sensation has become an instinct to keep that sensation alive and plastic representation has begun Sidenote How the artist is inspired and irresponsible The secret of representative genius is simple enough All hangs on intense exhaustive rehearsed sensation To paint is a way of letting vision work nor should the amateur imagine that while he lacks technical knowledge he can have in his possession all the ideal burden of an art His reaction will be personal and adventitious and he will miss the artist s real inspiration and ignore his genuine successes You may instruct a poet about literature but his allegiance is to emotion You may offer the sculptor your comparative observations on style and taste he may or may not care to listen but what he knows and loves is the human body Critics are in this way always one stage behind or beyond the artist their operation is reflective and his is direct In transferring to his special medium what he has before him his whole mind is lost in the object as the marksman to shoot straight looks at the mark How successful the result is or how appealing to human nature he judges afterwards as an outsider might and usually judges ill since there is no life less apt to yield a broad understanding for human affairs or even for the residue of art itself than the life of a man inspired a man absorbed as the genuine artist is in his own travail But into this travail into this digestion and reproduction of the thing seen a critic can hardly enter Having himself the ulterior office of judge he must not hope to rival nature s children in their sportiveness and intuition In an age of moral confusion these circumstances may lead to a strange shifting of roles The critic feeling that something in the artist has escaped him may labour to put himself in the artist s place If he succeeded the result would only be to make him a biographer he would be describing in words the very intuitions which the artist had rendered in some other medium To understand how the artist felt however is not criticism criticism is an investigation of what the work is good for Its function may be chiefly to awaken certain emotions in the beholder to deepen in him certain habits of apperception but even this most aesthetic element in a work s operation does not borrow its value from the possible fact that the artist also shared those habits and emotions If he did and if they are desirable so much the better for him but his work s value would still consist entirely in its power to propagate such good effects whether they were already present in him or not All criticism is therefore moral since it deals with benefits and their relative weight Psychological penetration and reconstructed biography may be excellent sport if they do not reach historic truth they may at least exercise dramatic talent Criticism on the other hand is a serious and public function it shows the race assimilating the individual dividing the immortal from the mortal part of a soul Sidenote Need of knowing and loving the subject rendered Representation naturally repeats those objects which are most interesting in themselves Even the medium when a choice is possible is usually determined by the sort of objects to be reproduced Instruments lose their virtue with their use and a medium of representation together with its manipulation is nothing but a vehicle It is fit if it makes possible a good rendition All accordingly hangs on what life has made interesting to the senses on what presents itself persuasively to the artist for imitation and living arts exist only while well known much loved things imperatively demand to be copied so that their reproduction has some honest non aesthetic interest for mankind Although subject matter is often said to be indifferent to art and an artist when his art is secondary may think of his technique only nothing is really so poor and melancholy as art that is interested in itself and not in its subject If any remnant of inspiration or value clings to such a performance it comes from a surviving taste for something in the real world Thus the literature that calls itself purely aesthetic is in truth prurient without this half avowed weakness to play upon the coloured images evoked would have had nothing to marshall or to sustain them Sidenote Public interests determine the subject of art and the subject the medium A good way to understand schools and styles and to appreciate their respective functions and successes is to consider first what region of nature preoccupied the age in which they arose Perception can cut the world up into many patterns which it isolates and dignifies with the name of things It must distinguish before it can reproduce and the objects which attention distinguishes are of many strange sorts Thus the single man the hero in his acts of prowess or in his readiness may be the unit and standard in discourse It will then be his image that will preoccupy the arts For such a task the most adequate art is evidently sculpture for sculpture is the most complete of imitations In no other art can apprehension render itself so exhaustively and with such recuperative force Sculpture retains form and colour with all that both can suggest and it retains them in their integrity leaving the observer free to resurvey them from any point of view and drink in their quality exhaustively Sidenote Reproduction by acting ephemera The movement and speech which are wanting the stage may be called upon to supply but it cannot supply them without a terrible sacrifice for it cannot give permanence to it expression Acting is for this reason an inferior art not perhaps in difficulty and certainly not in effect but inferior in dignity since the effort of art is to keep what is interesting in existence to recreate it in the eternal and this ideal is half frustrated if the representation is itself fleeting and the rendering has no firmer subsistence than the inspiration that gave it birth By making himself almost in his entirety the medium of his art the actor is morally diminished and as little of him remains in his work when this is good as of his work in history He lends himself without interest and after being Brutus at one moment and Falstaff at another he is not more truly himself He is abolished by his creations which nevertheless cannot survive him Sidenote High demands of sculpture Being so adequate a rendering of its object sculpture demands a perfect mastery over it and is correspondingly difficult It requires taste and training above every other art for not only must the material form be reproduced but its motor suggestions and moral expression must be rendered things which in the model itself are at best transitory and which may never be found there if a heroic or ideal theme is proposed The sculptor is obliged to have caught on the wing attitudes momentarily achieved or vaguely imagined yet these must grow firm and harmonious under his hand Nor is this enough for sculpture is more dependent than other arts on its model If the statue is to be ideal i e if it is to express the possible motions and vital character of its subject the model must itself be refined Training must have cut in the flesh those lines which are to make the language and eloquence of the marble Trivial and vulgar forms such as modern sculpture abounds in reflect an undisciplined race of men one in which neither soul nor body has done anything well because the two have done nothing together The frame has remained gross or awkward while the face has taken on a tense expression betraying loose and undignified habits of mind To carve such a creature is to perpetuate a caricature The modern sculptor is stopped short at the first conception of a figure if he gives it its costume it is grotesque if he strips it it is unmeaning and pitiful Sidenote It is essentially obsolete Greece was in all these respects a soil singularly favourable to sculpture The success there achieved was so conspicuous that two thousand years of essential superfluity have not availed to extirpate the art Plastic impulse is indeed immortal and many a hand even without classic example would have fallen to modelling In the middle ages while monumental sculpture was still rudely reminiscent ornamental carving arose spontaneously Yet at every step the experimental sculptor would run up against disaster What could be seen in the streets while it offered plenty of subjects offered none that could stimulate his talent His patrons asked only for illustration and applied ornament his models offered only the smirk and sad humour of a stunted life Here and there his statues might attain a certain sweetness and grace such as painting might perfectly well have rendered but on the whole sculpture remained decorative and infantile The Renaissance brought back technical freedom and a certain inspiration unhappily a retrospective and exotic one The art cut praiseworthy capers in the face of the public but nobody could teach the public itself to dance If several great temperaments under the auspices of fashion could then call up a magic world in which bodies still spoke a heroic language that was a passing dream Society could not feed such an artificial passion nor the schools transmit an arbitrary personal style that responded to nothing permanent in social conditions Academies continued to offer prizes for sculpture the nude continued to be seen in studios and equestrian or other rhetorical statues continued occasionally to be erected in public squares Heroic sculpture however in modern society is really an anomaly and confesses as much by being a failure No personal talent avails to rescue an art from laboured insignificance when it has no steadying function in the moral world and must waver between caprice and convention Where something modest and genuine peeped out was in portraiture and also at times in that devotional sculpture in wood which still responded to a native interest and consequently kept its sincerity and colour Pious images may be feeble in the extreme but they have not the weakness of being merely aesthetic The purveyor of church wares has a stated theme he is employed for a purpose and if he has enough technical resource his work may become truly beautiful which is not to say that he will succeed if his conceptions are without dignity or his style without discretion There are good Mater dolorosas there is no good Sacred Heart Sidenote When men see groups and backgrounds they are natural painters It may happen however that people are not interested in subjects that demand or allow reproduction in bulk The isolated figure or simple group may seem cold apart from its natural setting In rendering an action you may need to render its scene if it is the circumstance that gives it value rather than the hero You may also wish to trace out the action through a series of episodes with many figures In the latter case you might have recourse to a bas relief which although durable is usually a thankless work there is little in it that might not be conveyed in a drawing with distinctness As some artists like Michael Angelo have carried the sculptor s spirit into painting many more when painting is the prevalent and natural art have produced carved pictures It may be said that any work is essentially a picture which is conceived from a single quarter and meant to be looked at only in one light Objects in such a case need not be so truly apperceived and appropriated as they would have to be in true sculpture One aspect suffices the subject presented is not so much constructed as dreamt Sidenote Evolution of painting The whole history of painting may be strung on this single thread the effort to reconstitute impressions first the dramatic impression and then the sensuous A summary and symbolic representation of things is all that at first is demanded the point is to describe something pictorially and recall people s names and actions It is characteristic of archaic painting to be quite discursive and symbolic each figure is treated separately and stuck side by side with the others upon a golden ground The painter is here smothered in the recorder in the annalist only those perceptions are allowed to stand which have individual names or chronicle facts mentioned in the story But vision is really more sensuous and rich than report if art is only able to hold vision in suspense and make it explicit When painting is still at this stage and is employed on hieroglyphics it may reach the maximum of decorative splendour Whatever sensuous glow finer representations may later acquire will be not sensuous merely but poetical Titians Murillos or Turners are colourists in representation and their canvases would not be particularly warm or luminous if they represented nothing human or mystical or atmospheric A stained glass window or a wall of tiles can outdo them for pure colour and decorative magic Leaving decoration accordingly to take care of itself and be applied as sense may from time to time require painting goes on to elaborate the symbols with which it begins to make them symbolise more and more of what their object contains A catalogue of persons will fall into a group a group will be fused into a dramatic action Conventional as the separate figures may still be their attitudes and relations will reconstitute the dramatic impression The event will be rendered in its own language it will not to be recognised have to appeal to words Thus a symbolic crucifixion is a crucifixion only because we know by report that it is a plastic crucifixion would first teach us on the contrary what a real crucifixion might be It only remains to supply the aerial medium and make dramatic truth sensuous truth also Sidenote Sensuous and dramatic adequacy approached To work up a sensation intellectually and reawaken all its passionate associations is to reach a new and more exciting sensation which we call emotion or thought As in poetry there are two stages one pregnant and prior to prose and another posterior and synthetic so in painting we have not only a reversion to sense but an ulterior synthesis of the sensuous its interpretation in a dramatic or poetic vision Archaic painting with its abstract rendering of separate things is the prose of design It would not be beautiful at all but for its colour and technical feeling that expression of candour and satisfaction which may pervade it as it might a Latin rhyme To correct this thinness and dislocation to restore life without losing significance painting must proceed to accumulate symbol upon symbol till the original impression is almost restored but so restored that it contains all the articulation which a thorough analysis had given it Such painting as Tintoretto s or Paolo Veronese s records impressions as a cultivated sense might receive them It glows with visible light and studies the sensuous appearance but it contains at the same time an intelligent expression of all those mechanisms those situations and passions with which the living world is diversified It is not a design in spots meant merely to outdo a sunset it is a richer dream of experience meant to outshine the reality In order to reconstitute the image we may take an abstract representation or hieroglyphic and gradually increase its depth and its scope As the painter becomes aware of what at first he had ignored he adds colour to outline modelling to colour and finally an observant rendering of tints and values This process gives back to objects their texture and atmosphere and the space in which they lie From a representation which is statuesque in feeling and which renders figures by furnishing a visible inventory of their parts and attributes the artist passes to considering his figures more and more as parts of a whole and as moving in an ambient ether They tend accordingly to lose their separate emphasis in order to be like flowers in a field or trees in a forest They become elements interesting chiefly by their interplay and shining by a light which is mutually reflected Sidenote Essence of landscape painting When this transformation is complete the painting is essentially a landscape It may not represent precisely the open country it may even depict an interior like Velasquez s Meninas But the observer even in the presence of men and artificial objects has been overcome by the medium in which they swim He is seeing the air and what it happens to hold He is impartially recreating from within all that nature puts before him quite as if his imagination had become their diffused material substance Whatever individuality and moral value these bits of substance may have they acquire for him as for nature incidentally and by virtue of ulterior relations consequent on their physical being If this physical being is wholly expressed the humanity and morality involved will be expressed likewise even if expressed unawares Thus a profound and omnivorous reverie overflows the mind it devours its objects or is absorbed into them and the mood which this active self alienation brings with it is called the spirit of the scene the sentiment of the landscape Perception and art in this phase easily grow mystical they are readily lost in primordial physical sympathies Although at first a certain articulation and discursiveness may be retained in the picture so that the things seen in their atmosphere and relations may still be distinguished clearly the farther the impartial absorption in them goes the more what is inter individual rises and floods the individual over All becomes light and depth and air and those particular objects threaten to vanish which we had hoped to make luminous breathing and profound The initiated eye sees so many nameless tints and surfaces that it can no longer select any creative limits for things There cease to be fixed outlines continuous colours or discrete existences in nature Sidenote Its threatened dissolution An artist however cannot afford to forget that even in such a case units and divisions would have to be introduced by him into his work A man in falling back on immediate reality or immediate appearance may well feel his mind s articulate grammar losing its authority but that grammar must evidently be reasserted if from the immediate he ever wishes to rise again to articulate mind and art after all exists for the mind and must speak humanly If we crave something else we have not so far to go there is always the infinite about us and the animal within us to absolve us from human distinctions Moreover it is not quite true that the immediate has no real diversity It evidently suggests the ideal terms into which we divide it and it sustains our apprehension itself with all the diversities this may create To what I call right and left light and darkness a real opposition must correspond in any reality which is at all relevant to my experience so that I should fail to integrate my impression and to absorb the only reality that concerns me if I obliterated those points of reference which originally made the world figured and visible Space remains absolutely dark for all the infinite light which we may declare to be radiating through it until this light is concentrated in one body or reflected from another and a landscape cannot be so much as vaporous unless mists are distinguishable in it and through them some known object which they obscure In a word landscape is always in spite of itself a collection of particular representations It is a mass of hieroglyphics each the graphic symbol for some definite human sensation or reaction only these symbols have been extraordinarily enriched and are fused in representation so that like instruments in an orchestra they are merged in the voluminous sensation they constitute together a sensation in which for attentive perception they never cease to exist Sidenote Reversion to pure decorative design Impatience of such control as reality must always exercise over representation may drive painting back to a simpler function When a designer following his own automatic impulse conventionalises a form he makes a legitimate exchange substituting fidelity to his apperceptive instincts for fidelity to his external impressions When a landscape painter revolting against a tedious discursive style studies only masses of colour and abstract systems of lines he retains something in itself beautiful although no longer representative perhaps of anything in nature A pure impression cannot be illegitimate it cannot be false until it pretends to represent something and then it will have ceased to be a simple feeling since something in it will refer to an ulterior existence to which it ought to conform This ulterior existence since intelligence is life understanding its own conditions can be nothing in the end but what produced that impression Sensuous life however has its value within itself its pleasures are not significant Representative art is accordingly in a sense secondary beauty and expression begin farther back They are present whenever the outer stimulus agreeably strikes an organ and thereby arouses a sustained image in which the consciousness of both stimulation and reaction is embodied An abstract design in outline and colour will amply fulfil these conditions if sensuous and motor harmonies are preserved in it and if a sufficient sweep and depth of reaction is secured Stained glass tapestry panelling and in a measure all objects by their mere presence and distribution have a decorative function When sculpture and painting cease to be representative they pass into the same category Decoration in turn merges in construction and so all art like the whole Life of Reason is joined together at its roots and branches out from the vital processes of sensation and reaction Diversity arises centrifugally according to the provinces explored and the degree of mutual checking and control to which the various extensions are subjected Sidenote Sensuous values are primordial and so indispensable Organisation both internal and adaptive marks the dignity and authority which each art may have attained but this advantage important as is must seem to a philosopher or a legislator is not what the artist chiefly considers His privilege is to remain capricious in his response to the full blown universe of science and passion and to be still sensuous in his highest imaginings He cares for structure only when it is naturally decorative He thinks gates were invented for the sake of triumphal arches and forests for the sake of poets and deer Representation with all it may represent means to him simply what it says to his emotions In all this the artist though in one sense foolish in another way is singularly sane for after all everything must pass through the senses and life whatever its complexity remains always primarily a feeling To render this feeling delightful to train the senses to their highest potency and harmony in operation is to begin life well Were the foundations defective and subject to internal strain there could be little soundness in the superstructure AEsthetic activity is far from being a late or adventitious ornament in human economy it is an elementary factor the perfection of an indispensable vehicle Whenever science or morals have done violence to sense they have decreed their own dissolution To sense a rebellious appeal will presently be addressed and the appeal will go against rash and empty dogmas A keen aesthetic sensibility and a flourishing art mark the puberty of reason Fertility comes later after a marriage with the practical world But a sensuous ripening is needed first such as myth and ornament betray in their exuberance A man who has no feeling for feeling and no felicity in expression will hardly know what he is about in his further undertakings He will have missed his first lesson in living spontaneously and well Not knowing himself he will be all hearsay and pedantry He may fall into the superstition of supposing that what gives life value can be something external to life Science and morals are themselves arts that express natural impulses and find experimental rewards This fact in betraying their analogy to aesthetic activity enables them also to vindicate their excellence CHAPTER IX JUSTIFICATION OF ART Sidenote Art is subject to moral censorship It is no longer the fashion among philosophers to decry art Either its influence seems to them too slight to excite alarm or their systems are too lax to subject anything to censure which has the least glamour or ideality about it Tired perhaps of daily resolving the conflict between science and religion they prefer to assume silently a harmony between morals and art Moral harmonies however are not given they have to be made The curse of superstition is that it justifies and protracts their absence by proclaiming their invisible presence Of course a rational religion could not conflict with a rational science and similarly an art that was wholly admirable would necessarily play into the hands of progress But as the real difficulty in the former case lies in saying what religion and what science would be truly rational so here the problem is how far extant art is a benefit to mankind and how far perhaps a vice or a burden Sidenote Its initial or specific excellence is not enough That art is prima facie and in itself a good cannot be doubted It is a spontaneous activity and that settles the question Yet the function of ethics is precisely to revise prima facie judgments of this kind and to fix the ultimate resultant of all given interests in so far as they can be combined In the actual disarray of human life and desire wisdom consists in knowing what goods to sacrifice and what simples to pour into the supreme mixture The extent to which aesthetic values are allowed to colour the resultant or highest good is a point of great theoretic importance not only for art but for general philosophy If art is excluded altogether or given only a trivial role perhaps as a necessary relaxation we feel at once that a philosophy so judging human arts is ascetic or post rational It pretends to guide life from above and from without it has discredited human nature and mortal interests and has thereby undermined itself since it is at best but a partial expression of that humanity which it strives to transcend If on the contrary art is prized as something supreme and irresponsible if the poetic and mystic glow which it may bring seems its own complete justification then philosophy is evidently still prerational or rather non existent for the beasts that listened to Orpheus belong to this school To be bewitched is not to be saved though all the magicians and aesthetes in the world should pronounce it to be so Intoxication is a sad business at least for a philosopher for you must either drown yourself altogether or else when sober again you will feel somewhat fooled by yesterday s joys and somewhat lost in to day s vacancy The man who would emancipate art from discipline and reason is trying to elude rationality not merely in art but in all existence He is vexed at conditions of excellence that make him conscious of his own incompetence and failure Rather than consider his function he proclaims his self sufficiency A way foolishness has of revenging itself is to excommunicate the world It is in the world however that art must find its level It must vindicate its function in the human commonwealth What direct acceptable contribution does it make to the highest good What sacrifices if any does it impose What indirect influence does it exert on other activities Our answer to these questions will be our apology for art our proof that art belongs to the Life of Reason Sidenote All satisfactions however hurtful have an initial worth When moralists deprecate passion and contrast it with reason they do so if they are themselves rational only because passion is so often guilty because it works havoc so often in the surrounding world and leaves among other ruins a heart high sorrowful and cloyed Were there no danger of such after effects within and without the sufferer no passion would be reprehensible Nature is innocent and so are all her impulses and moods when taken in isolation it is only on meeting that they blush If it be true that matter is sinful the logic of this truth is far from being what the fanatics imagine who commonly propound it Matter is sinful only because it is insufficient or is wastefully distributed There is not enough of it to go round among the legion of hungry ideas To embody or enact an idea is the only way of making it actual but its embodiment may mutilate it if the material or the situation is not propitious So an infant may be maimed at birth when what injures him is not being brought forth but being brought forth in the wrong manner Matter has a double function in respect to existence essentially it enables the spirit to be yet chokes it incidentally Men sadly misbegotten or those who are thwarted at every step by the times penury may fall to thinking of matter only by its defect ignoring the material ground of their own aspirations All flesh will seem to them weak except that forgotten piece of it which makes their own spiritual strength Every impulse however had initially the same authority as this censorious one by which the others are now judged and condemned Sidenote But on the whole artistic activity is innocent If a practice can point to its innocence if it can absolve itself from concern for a world with which it does not interfere it has justified itself to those who love it though it may not yet have recommended itself to those who do not Now art more than any other considerable pursuit more even than speculation is abstract and inconsequential Born of suspended attention it ends in itself It encourages sensuous abstraction and nothing concerns it less than to influence the world Nor does it really do so in a notable degree Social changes do not reach artistic expression until after their momentum is acquired and their other collateral effects are fully predetermined Scarcely is a school of art established giving expression to prevailing sentiment when this sentiment changes and makes that style seem empty and ridiculous The expression has little or no power to maintain the movement it registers as a waterfall has little or no power to bring more water down Currents may indeed cut deep channels but they cannot feed their own springs at least not until the whole revolution of nature is taken into account In the individual also art registers passions without stimulating them on the contrary in stopping to depict them it steals away their life and whatever interest and delight it transfers to their expression it subtracts from their vital energy This appears unmistakably in erotic and in religious art Though the artist s avowed purpose here be to arouse a practical impulse he fails in so far as he is an artist in truth for he then will seek to move the given passions only through beauty but beauty is a rival object of passion in itself Lascivious and pious works when beauty has touched them cease to give out what is wilful and disquieting in their subject and become altogether intellectual and sublime There is a high breathlessness about beauty that cancels lust and superstition The artist in taking the latter for his theme renders them innocent and interesting because he looks at them from above composes their attitudes and surroundings harmoniously and makes them food for the mind Accordingly it is only in a refined and secondary stage that active passions like to amuse themselves with their aesthetic expression Unmitigated lustiness and raw fanaticism will snarl at pictures Representations begin to interest when crude passions recede and feel the need of conciliating liberal interests and adding some intellectual charm to their dumb attractions Thus art while by its subject it may betray the preoccupations among which it springs up embodies a new and quite innocent interest Sidenote It is liberal This interest is more than innocent it is liberal Not being concerned with material reality so much as with the ideal it knows neither ulterior motives nor quantitative limits the more beauty there is the more there can be and the higher one artist s imagination soars the better the whole flock flies In aesthetic activity we have accordingly one side of rational life sensuous experience is dominated there as mechanical or social realities ought to be dominated in science and politics Such dominion comes of having faculties suited to their conditions and consequently finding an inherent satisfaction in their operation The justification of life must be ultimately intrinsic and wherever such self justifying experience is attained the ideal has been in so far embodied To have realised it in a measure helps us to realise it further for there is a cumulative fecundity in those goods which come not by increase of force or matter but by a better organisation and form Sidenote and typical of perfect activity Art has met on the whole with more success than science or morals Beauty gives men the best hint of ultimate good which their experience as yet can offer and the most lauded geniuses have been poets as if people felt that those seers rather than men of action or thought had lived ideally and known what was worth knowing That such should be the case if the fact be admitted would indeed prove the rudimentary state of human civilisation The truly comprehensive life should be the statesman s for whom perception and theory might be expressed and rewarded in action The ideal dignity of art is therefore merely symbolic and vicarious As some people study character in novels and travel by reading tales of adventure because real life is not yet so interesting to them as fiction or because they find it cheaper to make their experiments in their dreams so art in general is a rehearsal of rational living and recasts in idea a world which we have no present means of recasting in reality Yet this rehearsal reveals the glories of a possible performance better than do the miserable experiments until now executed on the reality When we consider the present distracted state of government and religion there is much relief in turning from them to almost any art where what is good is altogether and finally good and what is bad is at least not treacherous When we consider further the senseless rivalries the vanities the ignominy that reign in the practical world how doubly blessed it becomes to find a sphere where limitation is an excellence where diversity is a beauty and where every man s ambition is consistent with every other man s and even favourable to it It is indeed so in art for we must not import into its blameless labours the bickerings and jealousies of criticism Critics quarrel with other critics and that is a part of philosophy With an artist no sane man quarrels any more than with the colour of a child s eyes As nature being full of seeds rises into all sorts of crystallisations each having its own ideal and potential life each a nucleus of order and a habitation for the absolute self so art though in a medium poorer than pregnant matter and incapable of intrinsic life generates a semblance of all conceivable beings What nature does with existence art does with appearance and while the achievement leaves us unhappily much where we were before in all our efficacious relations it entirely renews our vision and breeds a fresh world in fancy where all form has the same inner justification that all life has in the real world As no insect is without its rights and every cripple has his dream of happiness so no artistic fact no child of imagination is without its small birthright of beauty In this freer element competition does not exist and everything is Olympian Hungry generations do not tread down the ideal but only its spokesmen or embodiments that have cast in their lot with other material things Art supplies constantly to contemplation what nature seldom affords in concrete experience the union of life and peace Sidenote The ideal when incarnate becomes subject to civil society Sidenote Plato s strictures he exaggerates the effect of myths The ideal however would not come down from the empyrean and be conceived unless somebody s thought were absorbed in the conception Art actually segregates classes of men and masses of matter to serve its special interests This involves expense it impedes some possible activities and imposes others On this ground from the earliest times until our own art has been occasionally attacked by moralists who have felt that it fostered idolatry or luxury or irresponsible dreams Of these attacks the most interesting is Plato s because he was an artist by temperament bred in the very focus of artistic life and discussion and at the same time a consummate moral philosopher His aethetic sensibility was indeed so great that it led him perhaps into a relative error in that he overestimated the influence which art can have on character and affairs Homer s stories about the gods can hardly have demoralised the youths who recited them No religion has ever given a picture of deity which men could have imitated without the grossest immorality Yet these shocking representations have not had a bad effect on believers The deity was opposed to their own vices those it might itself be credited with offered no contagious example In spite of the theologians we know by instinct that in speaking of the gods we are dealing in myths and symbols Some aspect of nature or some law of life expressed in an attribute of deity is what we really regard and to regard such things however sinister they may be cannot but chasten and moralise us The personal character that such a function would involve if it were exercised willingly by a responsible being is something that never enters our thoughts No such painful image comes to perplex the plain sense of instinctive poetic religion To give moral importance to myths as Plato tended to do is to take them far too seriously and to belittle what they stand for Left to themselves they float in an ineffectual stratum of the brain They are understood and grow current precisely by not being pressed like an idiom or a metaphor The same aesthetic sterility appears at the other end of the scale where fancy is anything but sacred A Frenchman once saw in Punch and Judy a shocking proof of British brutality destined further to demoralise the nation and yet the scandal may pass That black tragedy reflects not very pretty manners but puppets exercise no suasion over men Sidenote His deeper moral objections To his supersensitive censure of myths Plato added strictures upon music and the drama to excite passions idly was to enervate the soul Only martial or religious strains should be heard in the ideal republic Furthermore art put before us a mere phantom of the good True excellence was the function things had in use the horseman knew the bridle s value and essence better than the artisan did who put it together but a painted bridle would lack even this relation to utility It would rein in no horse and was an impertinent sensuous reduplication of what even when it had material being was only an instrument and a means This reasoning has been little understood because Platonists so soon lost sight of their master s Socratic habit and moral intent They turned the good into an existence making it thereby unmeaning Plato s dialectic if we do not thus abolish the force of its terms is perfectly cogent representative art has indeed no utility and if the good has been identified with efficiency in a military state it can have no justification Plato s Republic was avowedly a fallen state a church militant coming sadly short of perfection and the joy which Plato as much as any one could feel in sensuous art he postponed as a man in mourning might until life should be redeemed from baseness Sidenote Their rightness Never have art and beauty received a more glowing eulogy than is implied in Plato s censure To him nothing was beautiful that was not beautiful to the core and he would have thought to insult art the remodelling of nature by reason if he had given it a narrower field than all practice As an architect who had fondly designed something impossible or which might not please in execution would at once erase it from the plan and abandon it for the love of perfect beauty and perfect art so Plato wished to erase from pleasing appearance all that when its operation was completed would bring discord into the world This was done in the ultimate interest of art and beauty which in a cultivated mind are inseparable from the vitally good It is mere barbarism to feel that a thing is aesthetically good but morally evil or morally good but hateful to perception Things partially evil or partially ugly may have to be chosen under stress of unfavourable circumstances lest some worse thing come but if a thing were ugly it would thereby not be wholly good and if it were altogether good it would perforce be beautiful To criticise art on moral grounds is to pay it a high compliment by assuming that it aims to be adequate and is addressed to a comprehensive mind The only way in which art could disallow such criticism would be to protest its irresponsible infancy and admit that it was a more or less amiable blatancy in individuals and not art at all Young animals often gambol in a delightful fashion and men also may though hardly when they intend to do so Sportive self expression can be prized because human nature contains a certain elasticity and margin for experiment in which waste activity is inevitable and may be precious for this license may lead amid a thousand failures to some real discovery and advance Art like life should be free since both are experimental But it is one thing to make room for genius and to respect the sudden madness of poets through which possibly some god may speak and it is quite another not to judge the result by rational standards The earth s bowels are full of all sorts of rumblings which of the oracles drawn thence is true can be judged only by the light of day If an artist s inspiration has been happy it has been so because his work can sweeten or ennoble the mind and because its total effect will be beneficent Art being a part of life the criticism of art is a part of morals Sidenote Importance of aesthetic alternatives Maladjustments in human society are still so scandalous they touch matters so much more pressing than fine art that maladjustments in the latter are passed over with a smile as if art were at any rate an irresponsible miraculous parasite that the legislator had better not meddle with The day may come however if the state is ever reduced to a tolerable order when questions of art will be the most urgent questions of morals when genius at last will feel responsible and the twist given to imagination will seem the most crucial thing in life Under a thin disguise the momentous character of imaginative choices has already been fully recognised by mankind Men have passionately loved their special religions languages and manners and preferred death to a life flowering in any other fashion In justifying this attachment forensically with arguments on the low level of men s named and consecrated interests people have indeed said and perhaps come to believe that their imaginative interests were material interests at bottom thinking thus to give them more weight and legitimacy whereas in truth material life itself would be nothing worth were it not in its essence and its issue ideal It was stupidly asserted however that if a man omitted the prescribed ceremonies or had unauthorised dreams about the gods he would lose his battles in this world and go to hell in the other He who runs can see that these expectations are not founded on any evidence on any observation of what actually occurs they are obviously a mirage arising from a direct ideal passion that tries to justify itself by indirection and by falsehoods as it has no need to do We all read facts in the way most congruous with our intellectual habit and when this habit drives us to effulgent creations absorbing and expressing the whole current of our being it not merely biasses our reading of this world but carries us into another world altogether which we posit instead of the real one or beside it Grotesque as the blunder may seem by which we thus introduce our poetic tropes into the sequence of external events or existences the blunder is intellectual only morally zeal for our special rhetoric may not be irrational The lovely Phoebus is no fact for astronomy nor does he stand behind the material sun in some higher heaven physically superintending its movements but Phoebus is a fact in his own region a token of man s joyful piety in the presence of the forces that really condition his welfare In the region of symbols in the world of poetry Phoebus has his inalienable rights Forms of poetry are forms of human life Languages express national character and enshrine particular ways of seeing and valuing events To make substitutions and extensions in expression is to give the soul in her inmost substance a somewhat new constitution A method of apperception is a spontaneous variation in mind perhaps the origin of a new moral species The value apperceptive methods have is of course largely representative in that they serve more or less aptly to dominate the order of events and to guide action but quite apart from this practical value expressions possess a character of their own a sort of vegetative life as languages possess euphony Two reports of the same fact may be equally trustworthy equally useful as information yet they may embody two types of mental rhetoric and this diversity in genius may be of more intrinsic importance than the raw fact it works upon The non representative side of human perception may thus be the most momentous side of it because it represents or even constitutes the man After all the chief interest we have in things lies in what we can make of them or what they can make of us There is consequently nothing fitted to colour human happiness more pervasively than art does nor to express more deeply the mind s internal habit In educating the imagination art crowns all moral endeavour which from the beginning is a species of art and which becomes a fine art more completely as it works in a freer medium Sidenote The importance of aesthetic goods varies with temperaments How great a portion of human energies should be spent on art and its appreciation is a question to be answered variously by various persons and nations There is no ideal a priori an ideal can but express if it is genuine the balance of impulses and potentialities in a given soul A mind at once sensuous and mobile will find its appropriate perfection in studying and reconstructing objects of sense Its rationality will appear chiefly on the plane of perception to render the circle of visions which makes up its life as delightful as possible For such a man art will be the most satisfying the most significant activity and to load him with material riches or speculative truths or profound social loyalties will be to impede and depress him The irrational is what does not justify itself in the end and the born artist repelled by the soberer and bitterer passions of the world may justly call them irrational They would not justify themselves in his experience they make grievous demands and yield nothing in the end which is intelligible to him His picture of them if he be a dramatist will hardly fail to be satirical fate frailty illusion will be his constant themes If his temperament could find political expression he would minimise the machinery of life and deprecate any calculated prudence He would trust the heart enjoy nature and not frown too angrily on inclination Such a Bohemia he would regard as an ideal world in which humanity might flourish congenially Sidenote The aesthetic temperament requires tutelage A puritan moralist before condemning such an infantile paradise should remember that a commonwealth of butterflies actually exists It is not any inherent wrongness in such an ideal that makes it unacceptable but only the fact that human butterflies are not wholly mercurial and that even imperfect geniuses are but an extreme type in a society whose guiding ideal is based upon a broader humanity than the artist represents Men of science or business will accuse the poet of folly on the very grounds on which he accuses them of the same Each will seem to the other to be obeying a barren obsession The statesman or philosopher who should aspire to adjust their quarrel could do so only by force of intelligent sympathy with both sides and in view of the common conditions in which they find themselves What ought to be done is that which when done will most nearly justify itself to all concerned Practical problems of morals are judicial and political problems Justice can never be pronounced without hearing the parties and weighing the interests at stake Sidenote AEsthetic values everywhere interfused A circumstance that complicates such a calculation is this aeesthetic and other interests are not separable units to be compared externally they are rather strands interwoven in the texture of everything AEsthetic sensibility colours every thought qualifies every allegiance and modifies every product of human labour Consequently the love of beauty has to justify itself not merely intrinsically or as a constituent part of life more or less to be insisted upon it has to justify itself also as an influence A hostile influence is the most odious of things The enemy himself the alien creature lies in his own camp and in a speculative moment we may put ourselves in his place and learn to think of him charitably but his spirit in our own souls is like a private tempter a treasonable voice weakening our allegiance to our own duty A zealot might allow his neighbours to be damned in peace did not a certain heretical odour emitted by them infect the sanctuary and disturb his own dogmatic calm In the same way practical people might leave the artist alone in his oasis and even grant him a pittance on which to live as they feed the animals in a zoological garden did he not intrude into their inmost conclave and vitiate the abstract cogency of their designs It is not so much art in its own field that men of science look askance upon as the love of glitter and rhetoric and false finality trespassing upon scientific ground while men of affairs may well deprecate a rooted habit of sensuous absorption and of sudden transit to imaginary worlds a habit which must work havoc in their own sphere In other words there is an element of poetry inherent in thought in conduct in affection and we must ask ourselves how far this ingredient is an obstacle to their proper development Sidenote They are primordial The fabled dove who complained in flying of the resistance of the air was as wise as the philosopher who should lament the presence and influence of sense Sense is the native element and substance of experience all its refinements are still parts of it existentially and whatever excellence belongs specifically to sense is a preliminary excellence a value antecedent to any which thought or action can achieve Science and morals have but representative authority they are principles of ideal synthesis and safe transition they are bridges from moment to moment of sentience Their function is indeed universal and their value overwhelming yet their office remains derivative or secondary and what they serve to put in order has previously its intrinsic worth An aesthetic bias is native to sense being indeed nothing but its form and potency and the influence which aesthetic habits exercise on thought and action should not be regarded as an intrusion to be resented but rather as an original interest to be built upon and developed Sensibility contains the distinctions which reason afterward carries out and applies it is sensibility that involves and supports primitive diversities such as those between good and bad here and there fast and slow light and darkness There are complications and harmonies inherent in these oppositions harmonies which aesthetic faculty proceeds to note and from these we may then construct others not immediately presentable which we distinguish by attributing them to reason Reason may well outflank and transform aesthetic judgments but can never undermine them Its own materials are the perceptions which if full and perfect are called beauties Its function is to endow the parts of sentience with a consciousness of the system in which they lie so that they may attain a mutual relevance and ideally support one another But what could relevance or support be worth if the things to be buttressed were themselves worthless It is not to organise pain ugliness and boredom that reason can be called into the world Sidenote To superpose them adventitiously is to destroy them When a practical or scientific man boasts that he has laid aside aesthetic prejudices and is following truth and utility with a single eye he can mean if he is judicious only that he has not yielded to aesthetic preference after his problem was fixed nor in an arbitrary and vexatious fashion He has not consulted taste when it would have been in bad taste to do so If he meant that he had rendered himself altogether insensible to aesthetic values and that he had proceeded to organise conduct or thought in complete indifference to the beautiful he would be simply proclaiming his inhumanity and incompetence A right observance of aesthetic demands does not obstruct utility nor logic for utility and logic are themselves beautiful while a sensuous beauty that ran counter to reason could never be in the end pleasing to an exquisite sense AEsthetic vice is not favourable to aesthetic faculty it is an impediment to the greatest aesthetic satisfactions And so when by yielding to a blind passion for beauty we derange theory and practice we cut ourselves off from those beauties which alone could have satisfied our passion What we drag in so obstinately will bring but a cheap and unstable pleasure while a double beauty will thereby be lost or obscured first the unlooked for beauty which a genuine and stable system of things could not but betray and secondly the coveted beauty itself which being imported here into the wrong context will be rendered meretricious and offensive to good taste If a jewel worn on the wrong finger sends a shiver through the flesh how disgusting must not rhetoric be in diplomacy or unction in metaphysics Sidenote They flow naturally from perfect function The poetic element inherent in thought affection and conduct is prior to their prosaic development and altogether legitimate Clear well digested perception and rational choices follow upon those primary creative impulses and carry out their purpose systematically At every stage in this development new and appropriate materials are offered for aesthetic contemplation Straightness for instance symmetry and rhythm are at first sensuously defined they are characters arrested by aesthetic instinct but they are the materials of mathematics And long after these initial forms have disowned their sensuous values and suffered a wholly dialectical expansion or analysis mathematical objects again fall under the aesthetic eye and surprise the senses by their emotional power A mechanical system such as astronomy in one region has already unveiled is an inexhaustible field for aesthetic wonder Similarly in another sphere sensuous affinity leads to friendship and love and makes us huddle up to our fellows and feel their heart beats but when human society has thereupon established a legal and moral edifice this new spectacle yields new imaginative transports tragic lyric and religious AEsthetic values everywhere precede and accompany rational activity and life is in one aspect always a fine art not by introducing inaptly aesthetic vetoes or aesthetic flourishes but by giving to everything a form which implying a structure implies also an ideal and a possible perfection This perfection being felt is also a beauty since any process though it may have become intellectual or practical remains for all that a vital and sentient operation with its inherent sensuous values Whatever is to be representative in import must first be immediate in existence whatever is transitive in operation must be at the same time actual in being So that an aesthetic sanction sweetens all successful living animal efficiency cannot be without grace nor moral achievement without a sensible glory Sidenote Even inhibited functions when they fall into a new rhythm yield new beauties These vital harmonies are natural they are neither perfect nor preordained We often come upon beauties that need to be sacrificed as we come upon events and practical necessities without number that are truly regrettable There are a myriad conflicts in practice and in thought conflicts between rival possibilities knocking inopportunely and in vain at the door of existence Owing to the initial disorganisation of things some demands continually prove to be incompatible with others arising no less naturally Reason in such cases imposes real and irreparable sacrifices but it brings a stable consolation if its discipline is accepted Decay for instance is a moral and aesthetic evil but being a natural necessity it can become the basis for pathetic and magnificent harmonies when once imagination is adjusted to it The hatred of change and death is ineradicable while life lasts since it expresses that self sustaining organisation in a creature which we call its soul yet this hatred of change and death is not so deeply seated in the nature of things as are death and change themselves for the flux is deeper than the ideal Discipline may attune our higher and more adaptable part to the harsh conditions of being and the resulting sentiment being the only one which can be maintained successfully will express the greatest satisfactions which can be reached though not the greatest that might be conceived or desired To be interested in the changing seasons is in this middling zone a happier state of mind than to be hopelessly in love with spring Wisdom discovers these possible accommodations as circumstances impose them and education ought to prepare men to accept them Sidenote He who loves beauty must chasten it It is for want of education and discipline that a man so often insists petulantly on his random tastes instead of cultivating those which might find some satisfaction in the world and might produce in him some pertinent culture Untutored self assertion may even lead him to deny some fact that should have been patent and plunge him into needless calamity His Utopias cheat him in the end if indeed the barbarous taste he has indulged in clinging to them does not itself lapse before the dream is half formed So men have feverishly conceived a heaven only to find it insipid and a hell to find it ridiculous Theodicies that were to demonstrate an absolute cosmic harmony have turned the universe into a tyrannous nightmare from which we are glad to awake again in this unintentional and somewhat tractable world Thus the fancies of effeminate poets in violating science are false to the highest art and the products of sheer confusion instigated by the love of beauty turn out to be hideous A rational severity in respect to art simply weeds the garden it expresses a mature aesthetic choice and opens the way to supreme artistic achievements To keep beauty in its place is to make all things beautiful CHAPTER X THE CRITERION OF TASTE Sidenote Dogmatism is inevitable but may be enlightened Dogmatism in matters of taste has the same status as dogmatism in other spheres It is initially justified by sincerity being a systematic expression of a man s preferences but it becomes absurd when its basis in a particular disposition is ignored and it pretends to have an absolute or metaphysical scope Reason with the order which in every region it imposes on life is grounded on an animal nature and has no other function than to serve the same and it fails to exercise its office quite as much when it oversteps its bounds and forgets whom it is serving as when it neglects some part of its legitimate province and serves its master imperfectly without considering all his interests Dialectic logic and morals lose their authority and become inept if they trespass upon the realm of physics and try to disclose existences while physics is a mere idea in the realm of poetic meditation So the notorious diversities which human taste exhibits do not become conflicts and raise no moral problem until their basis or their function has been forgotten and each has claimed a right to assert itself exclusively This claim is altogether absurd and we might fail to understand how so preposterous an attitude could be assumed by anybody did we not remember that every young animal thinks himself absolute and that dogmatism in the thinker is only the speculative side of greed and courage in the brute The brute cannot surrender his appetites nor abdicate his primary right to dominate his environment What experience and reason may teach him is merely how to make his self assertion well balanced and successful In the same way taste is bound to maintain its preferences but free to rationalise them After a man has compared his feelings with the no less legitimate feelings of other creatures he can reassert his own with more complete authority since now he is aware of their necessary ground in his nature and of their affinities with whatever other interests his nature enables him to recognise in others and to company ordinate with his own Sidenote Taste gains in authority as it is more and more widely based A criterion of taste is therefore nothing but taste itself in its more deliberate and circumspect form Reflection refines particular sentiments by bringing them into sympathy with all rational life There is consequently the greatest possible difference in authority between taste and taste and while delight in drums and eagle s feathers is perfectly genuine and has no cause to blush for itself it cannot be compared in scope or representative value with delight in a symphony or an epic The very instinct that is satisfied by beauty prefers one beauty to another and we have only to question and purge our aesthetic feelings in order to obtain our criterion of taste This criterion will be natural personal autonomous a circumstance that will give it authority over our own judgment which is all moral science is concerned about and will extend its authority over other minds also in so far as their constitution is similar to ours In that measure what is a genuine instance of reason in us others will recognise for a genuine expression of reason in themselves also Sidenote Different aesthetic endowments may be compared in quantity or force AEsthetic feeling in different people may make up a different fraction of life and vary greatly in volume The more nearly insensible a man is the more incompetent he becomes to proclaim the values which sensibility might have To beauty men are habitually insensible even while they are awake and rationally active Tomes of aesthetic criticism hang on a few moments of real delight and intuition It is in rare and scattered instants that beauty smiles even on her adorers who are reduced for habitual comfort to remembering her past favours An aesthetic glow may pervade experience but that circumstance is seldom remarked it figures only as an influence working subterraneously on thoughts and judgments which in themselves take a cognitive or practical direction Only when the aesthetic ingredient becomes predominant do we exclaim How beautiful Ordinarily the pleasures which formal perception gives remain an undistinguished part of our comfort or curiosity Sidenote Authority of vital over verbal judgments Taste is formed in those moments when aesthetic emotion is massive and distinct preferences then grown conscious judgments then put into words will reverberate through calmer hours they will constitute prejudices habits of apperception secret standards for all other beauties A period of life in which such intuitions have been frequent may amass tastes and ideals sufficient for the rest of our days Youth in these matters governs maturity and while men may develop their early impressions more systematically and find confirmations of them in various quarters they will seldom look at the world afresh or use new categories in deciphering it Half our standards come from our first masters and the other half from our first loves Never being so deeply stirred again we remain persuaded that no objects save those we then discovered can have a true sublimity These high water marks of aesthetic life may easily be reached under tutelage It may be some eloquent appreciations read in a book or some preference expressed by a gifted friend that may have revealed unsuspected beauties in art or nature and then since our own perception was vicarious and obviously inferior in volume to that which our mentor possessed we shall take his judgments for our criterion since they were the source and exemplar of all our own Thus the volume and intensity of some appreciations especially when nothing of the kind has preceded makes them authoritative over our subsequent judgments On those warm moments hang all our cold systematic opinions and while the latter fill our days and shape our careers it is only the former that are crucial and alive A race which loves beauty holds the same place in history that a season of love or enthusiasm holds in an individual life Such a race has a pre eminent right to pronounce upon beauty and to bequeath its judgments to duller peoples We may accordingly listen with reverence to a Greek judgment on that subject expecting that what might seem to us wrong about it is the expression of knowledge and passion beyond our range it will suffice that we learn to live in the world of beauty instead of merely studying its relics for us to understand for instance that imitation is a fundamental principle in art and that any rational judgment on the beautiful must be a moral and political judgment enveloping chance aesthetic feelings and determining their value What most German philosophers on the contrary have written about art and beauty has a minimal importance it treats artificial problems in a grammatical spirit seldom giving any proof of experience or imagination What painters say about painting and poets about poetry is better than lay opinion it may reveal of course some petty jealousy or some partial incapacity because a special gift often carries with it complementary defects in apprehension yet what is positive in such judgments is founded on knowledge and avoids the romancing into which litterateurs and sentimentalists will gladly wander The specific values of art are technical values more permanent and definite than the adventitious analogies on which a stray observer usually bases his views Only a technical education can raise judgments on musical compositions above impertinent auto biography The Japanese know the beauty of flowers and tailors and dressmakers have the best sense for the fashions We ask them for suggestions and if we do not always take their advice it is not because the fine effects they love are not genuine but because they may not be effects which we care to produce Sidenote Tastes differ also in purity or consistency This touches a second consideration besides the volume and vivacity of feeling which enters into good taste What is voluminous may be inwardly confused or outwardly confusing Excitement though on the whole and for the moment agreeable may verge on pain and may be when it subsides a little a cause of bitterness A thing s attractions may be partly at war with its ideal function In such a case what in our haste we call a beauty becomes hateful on a second view and according to the key of our dissatisfaction we pronounce that effect meretricious harsh or affected These discords appear when elaborate things are attempted without enough art and refinement they are essentially in bad taste Rudimentary effects on the contrary are pure and though we may think them trivial when we are expecting something richer their defect is never intrinsic they do not plunge us as impure excitements do into a corrupt artificial conflict So wild flowers plain chant or a scarlet uniform are beautiful enough their simplicity is a positive merit while their crudity is only relative There is a touch of sophistication and disease in not being able to fall back on such things and enjoy them thoroughly as if a man could no longer relish a glass of water Your true epicure will study not to lose so genuine a pleasure Better forego some artificial stimulus though that too has its charm than become insensible to natural joys Indeed ability to revert to elementary beauties is a test that judgment remains sound Vulgarity is quite another matter An old woman in a blonde wig a dirty hand covered with jewels ostentation without dignity rhetoric without cogency all offend by an inner contradiction To like such things we should have to surrender our better intuitions and suffer a kind of dishonour Yet the elements offensively combined may be excellent in isolation so that an untrained or torpid mind will be at a loss to understand the critic s displeasure Oftentimes barbaric art almost succeeds by dint of splendour in banishing the sense of confusion and absurdity for everything even reason must bow to force Yet the impression remains chaotic and we must be either partly inattentive or partly distressed Nothing could show better than this alternative how mechanical barbaric art is Driven by blind impulse or tradition the artist has worked in the dark He has dismissed his work without having quite understood it or really justified it to his own mind It is rather his excretion than his product Astonished very likely at his own fertility he has thought himself divinely inspired little knowing that clear reason is the highest and truest of inspirations Other men observing his obscure work have then honoured him for profundity and so mere bulk or stress or complexity have produced a mystical wonder by which generation after generation may be enthralled Barbaric art is half necromantic its ascendancy rests in a certain measure on bewilderment and fraud To purge away these impurities nothing is needed but quickened intelligence a keener spiritual flame Where perception is adequate expression is so too and if a man will only grow sensitive to the various solicitations which anything monstrous combines he will thereby perceive its monstrosity Let him but enact his sensations let him pause to make explicit the confused hints that threaten to stupefy him he will find that he can follow out each of them only by rejecting and forgetting the others To free his imagination in any direction he must disengage it from the contrary intent and so he must either purify his object or leave it a mass of confused promptings Promptings essentially demand to be carried out and when once an idea has become articulate it is not enriched but destroyed if it is still identified with its contrary Any complete expression of a barbarous theme will therefore disengage its incompatible elements and turn it into a number of rational beauties Sidenote They differ finally in pertinence and in width of appeal When good taste has in this way purified and digested some turgid medley it still has a progress to make Ideas like men live in society Not only has each a will of its own and an inherent ideal but each finds itself conditioned for its expression by a host of other beings on whose company operation it depends Good taste besides being inwardly clear has to be outwardly fit A monstrous ideal devours and dissolves itself but even a rational one does not find an immortal embodiment simply for being inwardly possible and free from contradiction It needs a material basis a soil and situation propitious to its growth This basis as it varies makes the ideal vary which is simply its expression and therefore no ideal can be ultimately fixed in ignorance of the conditions that may modify it It subsists to be sure as an eternal possibility independently of all further earthly revolutions Once expressed it has revealed the inalienable values that attach to a certain form of being whenever that form is actualised But its expression may have been only momentary and that eternal ideal may have no further relevance to the living world A criterion of taste however looks to a social career it hopes to educate and to judge In order to be an applicable and a just law it must represent the interests over which it would preside There are many undiscovered ideals There are many beauties which nothing in this world can embody or suggest There are also many once suggested or even embodied which find later their basis gone and evaporate into their native heaven The saddest tragedy in the world is the destruction of what has within it no inward ground of dissolution death in youth and the crushing out of perfection Imagination has its bereavements of this kind A complete mastery of existence achieved at one moment gives no warrant that it will be sustained or achieved again at the next The achievement may have been perfect nature will not on that account stop to admire it She will move on and the meaning which was read so triumphantly in her momentary attitude will not fit her new posture Like Polonius s cloud she will always suggest some new ideal because she has none of her own In lieu of an ideal however nature has a constitution and this which is a necessary ground for ideals is what it concerns the ideal to reckon with A poet spokesman of his full soul at a given juncture cannot consider eventualities or think of anything but the message he is sent to deliver whether the world can then hear it or not God he may feel sure understands him and in the eternal the beauty he sees and loves immortally justifies his enthusiasm Nevertheless critics must view his momentary ebullition from another side They do not come to justify the poet in his own eyes he amply relieves them of such a function They come only to inquire how significant the poet s expressions are for humanity at large or for whatever public he addresses They come to register the social or representative value of the poet s soul His inspiration may have been an odd cerebral rumbling a perfectly irrecoverable and wasted intuition the exquisite quality it doubtless had to his own sense is now not to the purpose A work of art is a public possession it is addressed to the world By taking on a material embodiment a spirit solicits attention and claims some kinship with the prevalent gods Has it critics should ask the affinities needed for such intercourse Is it humane is it rational is it representative To its inherent incommunicable charms it must add a kind of courtesy If it wants other approval than its own it cannot afford to regard no other aspiration This scope this representative faculty or wide appeal is necessary to good taste All authority is representative force and inner consistency are gifts on which I may well congratulate another but they give him no right to speak for me Either aesthetic experience would have remained a chaos which it is not altogether or it must have tended to conciliate certain general human demands and ultimately all those interests which its operation in any way affects The more conspicuous and permanent a work of art is the more is such an adjustment needed A poet or philosopher may be erratic and assure us that he is inspired if we cannot well gainsay it we are at least not obliged to read his works An architect or a sculptor however or a public performer of any sort that thrusts before us a spectacle justified only in his inner consciousness makes himself a nuisance A social standard of taste must assert itself here or else no efficacious and cumulative art can exist at all Good taste in such matters cannot abstract from tradition utility and the temper of the world It must make itself an interpreter of humanity and think esoteric dreams less beautiful than what the public eye might conceivably admire Sidenote Art may grow classic by idealising the familiar There are various affinities by which art may acquire a representative or classic quality It may do so by giving form to objects which everybody knows by rendering experiences that are universal and primary The human figure elementary passions common types and crises of fate these are facts which pass too constantly through apperception not to have a normal aethetic value The artist who can catch that effect in its fulness and simplicity accordingly does immortal work This sort of art immediately becomes popular it passes into language and convention so that its aesthetic charm is apparently worn down The old images after a while hardly stimulate unless they be presented in some paradoxical way but in that case attention will be diverted to the accidental extravagance and the chief classic effect will be missed It is the honourable fate or euthanasia of artistic successes that they pass from the field of professional art altogether and become a portion of human faculty Every man learns to be to that extent an artist approved figures and maxims pass current like the words and idioms of a mother tongue themselves once brilliant inventions The lustre of such successes is not really dimmed however when it becomes a part of man s daily light a retrogression from that habitual style or habitual insight would at once prove by the shock it caused how precious those ingrained apperceptions continued to be Sidenote or by reporting the ultimate Universality may also be achieved in a more heroic fashion by art that expresses ultimate truths cosmic laws great human ideals Virgil and Dante are classic poets in this sense and a similar quality belongs to Greek sculpture and architecture They may not cause enthusiasm in everybody but in the end experience and reflection renew their charm and their greatness like that of high mountains grows more obvious with distance Such eminence is the reward of having accepted discipline and made the mind a clear anagram of much experience There is a great difference between the depth of expression so gained and richness or realism in details A supreme work presupposes minute study sympathy with varied passions many experiments in expression but these preliminary things are submerged in it and are not displayed side by side with it like the foot notes to a learned work so that the ignorant may know they have existed Some persons themselves inattentive imagine for instance that Greek sculpture is abstract that it has left out all the detail and character which they cannot find on the surface as they might in a modern work In truth it contains those features as it were in solution and in the resultant which when reduced to harmony they would produce It embodies a finished humanity which only varied exercises could have attained for as the body is the existent ground for all possible actions in which as actions they exist only potentially so a perfect body such as a sculptor might conceive which ought to be ready for all excellent activities cannot present them all in act but only the readiness for them The features that might express them severally must be absorbed and mastered hidden like a sword in its scabbard and reduced to a general dignity or grace Though such immersed eloquence be at first overlooked and seldom explicitly acknowledged homage is nevertheless rendered to it in the most unmistakable ways When lazy artists backed by no great technical or moral discipline think they too can produce masterpieces by summary treatment their failure shows how pregnant and supreme a thing simplicity is Every man in proportion to his experience and moral distinction returns to the simple but inexhaustible work of finished minds and finds more and more of his own soul responsive to it Human nature for all its margin of variability has a substantial core which is invariable as the human body has a structure which it cannot lose without perishing altogether for as creatures grow more complex a greater number of their organs become vital and indispensable Advanced forms will rather die than surrender a tittle of their character a fact which is the physical basis for loyalty and martyrdom Any deep interpretation of oneself or indeed of anything has for that reason a largely representative truth Other men if they look closely will make the same discovery for themselves Hence distinction and profundity in spite of their rarity are wont to be largely recognised The best men in all ages keep classic traditions alive These men have on their side the weight of superior intelligence and though they are few they might even claim the weight of numbers since the few of all ages added together may be more than the many who in any one age follow a temporary fashion Classic work is nevertheless always national or at least characteristic of its period as the classic poetry of each people is that in which its language appears most pure and free To translate it is impossible but it is easy to find that the human nature so inimitably expressed in each masterpiece is the same that under different circumstance dictates a different performance The deviations between races and men are not yet so great as is the ignorance of self the blindness to the native ideal which prevails in most of them Hence a great man of a remote epoch is more intelligible than a common man of our own time Sidenote Good taste demands that art should be rational i e harmonious with all other interests Both elementary and ultimate judgments then contribute to a standard of taste yet human life lies between these limits and an art which is to be truly adjusted to life should speak also for the intermediate experience Good taste is indeed nothing but a name for those appreciations which the swelling incidents of life recall and reinforce Good taste is that taste which is a good possession a friend to the whole man It must not alienate him from anything except to ally him to something greater and more fertile in satisfactions It will not suffer him to dote on things however seductive which rob him of some nobler companionship To have a foretaste of such a loss and to reject instinctively whatever will cause it is the very essence of refinement Good taste comes therefore from experience in the best sense of that word it comes from having united in one s memory and character the fruit of many diverse undertakings Mere taste is apt to be bad taste since it regards nothing but a chance feeling Every man who pursues an art may be presumed to have some sensibility the question is whether he has breeding too and whether what he stops at is not in the end vulgar and offensive Chance feeling needs to fortify itself with reasons and to find its level in the great world When it has added fitness to its sincerity beneficence to its passion it will have acquired a right to live Violence and self justification will not pass muster in a moral society for vipers possess both and must nevertheless be stamped out Citizenship is conferred only on creatures with human and company operative instincts A civilised imagination has to understand and to serve the world The great obstacle which art finds in attempting to be rational is its functional isolation Sense and each of the passions suffers from a similar independence The disarray of human instincts lets every spontaneous motion run too far life oscillates between constraint and unreason Morality too often puts up with being a constraint and even imagines such a disgrace to be its essence Art on the contrary as often hugs unreason for fear of losing its inspiration and forgets that it is itself a rational principle of creation and order Morality is thus reduced to a necessary evil and art to a vain good all for want of harmony among human impulses If the passions arose in season if perception fed only on those things which action should be adjusted to turning them while action proceeded into the substance of ideas then all conduct would be voluntary and enlightened all speculation would be practical all perceptions beautiful and all operations arts The Life of Reason would then be universal To approach this ideal so far as art is concerned would involve diffusing its processes and no longer confining them to a set of dead and unproductive objects called works of art Sidenote A mere work of art a baseless artifice Why art the most vital and generative of activities should produce a set of abstract images monuments to lost intuitions is a curious mystery Nature gives her products life and they are at least equal to their sources in dignity Why should mind the actualisation of nature s powers produce something so inferior to itself reverting in its expression to material being so that its witnesses seem so many fossils with which it strews its path What we call museums mausoleums rather in which a dead art heaps up its remains are those the places where the Muses intended to dwell We do not keep in show cases the coins current in the world A living art does not produce curiosities to be collected but spiritual necessaries to be diffused Artificial art made to be exhibited is something gratuitous and sophisticated and the greater part of men s concern about it is affectation There is a genuine pleasure in planning a work in modelling and painting it there is a pleasure in showing it to a sympathetic friend who associates himself in this way with the artist s technical experiment and with his interpretation of some human episode and there might be a satisfaction in seeing the work set up in some appropriate space for which it was designed where its decorative quality might enrich the scene and the curious passer by might stop to decipher it The pleasures proper to an ingenuous artist are spontaneous and human but his works once delivered to his patrons are household furniture for the state Set up to day they are outworn and replaced to morrow like trees in the parks or officers in the government A community where art was native and flourishing would have an uninterrupted supply of such ornaments furnished by its citizens in the same modest and cheerful spirit in which they furnish other commodities Every craft has its dignity and the decorative and monumental crafts certainly have their own but such art is neither singular nor pre eminent and a statesman or reformer who should raise somewhat the level of thought or practice in the state would do an infinitely greater service Sidenote Human uses give to works of art their highest expression and charm The joys of creating are not confined moreover to those who create things without practical uses The merely aesthetic like rhyme and fireworks is not the only subject that can engage a playful fancy or be planned with a premonition of beautiful effects Architecture may be useful sculpture commemorative poetry reflective even music by its expression religious or martial In a word practical exigencies in calling forth the arts give them moral functions which it is a pleasure to see them fulfil Works may not be aesthetic in their purpose and yet that fact may be a ground for their being doubly delightful in execution and doubly beautiful in effect A richer plexus of emotions is concerned in producing or contemplating something humanly necessary than something idly conceived What is very rightly called a sense for fitness is a vital experience involving aesthetic satisfactions and aesthetic shocks The more numerous the rational harmonies are which are present to the mind the more sensible movements will be going on there to give immediate delight for the perception or expectation of an ulterior good is a present good also Accordingly nothing can so well call forth or sustain attention as what has a complex structure relating it to many complex interests A work woven out of precious threads has a deep pertinence and glory the artist who creates it does not need to surrender his practical and moral sense in order to indulge his imagination The truth is that mere sensation or mere emotion is an indignity to a mature human being When we eat we demand a pleasant vista flowers or conversation and failing these we take refuge in a newspaper The monks knowing that men should not feed silently like stalled oxen appointed some one to read aloud in the refectory and the Fathers obeying the same civilised instinct had contrived in their theology intelligible points of attachment for religious emotion A refined mind finds as little happiness in love without friendship as in sensuality without love it may succumb to both but it accepts neither What is true of mere sensibility is no less true of mere fancy The Arabian Nights futile enough in any case would be absolutely intolerable if they contained no Oriental manners no human passions and no convinced epicureanism behind their miracles and their tattle Any absolute work of art which serves no further purpose than to stimulate an emotion has about it a certain luxurious and visionary taint We leave it with a blank mind and a pang bubbles up from the very fountain of pleasures Art so long as it needs to be a dream will never cease to prove a disappointment Its facile cruelty its narcotic abstraction can never sweeten the evils we return to at home it can liberate half the mind only by leaving the other half in abeyance In the mere artist too there is always something that falls short of the gentleman and that defeats the man Sidenote The sad values of appearance Surely it is not the artistic impulse in itself that involves such lack of equilibrium To impress a meaning and a rational form on matter is one of the most masterful of actions The trouble lies in the barren and superficial character of this imposed form fine art is a play of appearance Appearance for a critical philosophy is distinguished from reality by its separation from the context of things by its immediacy and insignificance A play of appearance is accordingly some little closed circle in experience some dream in which we lose ourselves by ignoring most of our interests and from which we awake into a world in which that lost episode plays no further part and leaves no heirs Art as mankind has hitherto practised it falls largely under this head and too much resembles an opiate or a stimulant Life and history are not thereby rendered better in their principle but a mere ideal is extracted out of them and presented for our delectation in some cheap material like words or marble The only precious materials are flesh and blood for these alone can defend and propagate the ideal which has once informed them Artistic creation shows at this point a great inferiority to natural reproduction since its product is dead Fine art shapes inert matter and peoples the mind with impotent ghosts What influence it has for every event has consequences is not pertinent to its inspiration The art of the past is powerless even to create similar art in the present unless similar conditions recur independently The moments snatched for art have been generally interludes in life and its products parasites in nature the body of them being materially functionless and the soul merely represented To exalt fine art into a truly ideal activity we should have to knit it more closely with other rational functions so that to beautify things might render them more useful and to represent them most imaginatively might be to see them in their truth Something of the sort has been actually attained by the noblest arts in their noblest phases A Sophocles or a Leonardo dominates his dreamful vehicle and works upon the real world by its means These small centres where interfunctional harmony is attained ought to expand and cover the whole field Art like religion needs to be absorbed in the Life of Reason Sidenote They need to be made prophetic of practical goods What might help to bring about this consummation would be on the one side more knowledge on the other better taste When a mind is filled with important and true ideas and sees the actual relations of things it cannot relish pictures of the world which wantonly misrepresent it Myth and metaphor remain beautiful so long as they are the most adequate or graphic means available for expressing the facts but so soon as they cease to be needful and sincere they become false finery The same thing happens in the plastic arts Unless they spring from love of their subject and employ imagination only to penetrate into that subject and interpret it with a more inward sympathy and truth they become conventional and overgrown with mere ornament They then seem ridiculous to any man who can truly conceive what they represent So in putting antique heroes on the stage we nowadays no longer tolerate a modern costume because the externals of ancient life are too well known to us but in the seventeenth century people demanded in such personages intelligence and nobleness since these were virtues which the ancients were clothed with in their thought A knowledge that should be at once full and appreciative would evidently demand fidelity in both matters Knowledge where it exists undermines satisfaction in what does violence to truth and it renders such representations grotesque If knowledge were general and adequate the fine arts would accordingly be brought round to expressing reality Sidenote which in turn would be suffused with beauty At the same time if the rendering of reality is to remain artistic it must still study to satisfy the senses but as this study would now accompany every activity taste would grow vastly more subtle and exacting Whatever any man said or did or made he would be alive to its aesthetic quality and beauty would be a pervasive ingredient in happiness No work would be called in a special sense a work of art for all works would be such intrinsically and even instinctive mimicry and reproduction would themselves operate not when mischief or idleness prompted but when some human occasion and some general utility made the exercise of such skill entirely delightful Thus there would need to be no division of mankind into mechanical blind workers and half demented poets and no separation of useful from fine art such as people make who have understood neither the nature nor the ultimate reward of human action All arts would be practised together and merged in the art of life the only one wholly useful or fine among them CHAPTER XI ART AND HAPPINESS Sidenote AEsthetic harmonies are parodies of real ones The greatest enemy harmony can have is a premature settlement in which some essential force is wholly disregarded This excluded element will rankle in the flesh it will bring about no end of disorders until it is finally recognised and admitted into a truly comprehensive regimen The more numerous the interests which a premature settlement combines the greater inertia will it oppose to reform and the more self righteously will it condemn the innocent pariah that it leaves outside Art has had to suffer much Pharisaical opposition of this sort Sometimes political systems sometimes religious zeal have excluded it from their programme thereby making their programme unjust and inadequate Yet of all premature settlements the most premature is that which the fine arts are wont to establish A harmony in appearance only one that touches the springs of nothing and has no power to propagate itself is so partial and momentary a good that we may justly call it an illusion To gloat on rhythms and declamations to live lost in imaginary passions and histrionic woes is an unmanly life cut off from practical dominion and from rational happiness A lovely dream is an excellent thing in itself but it leaves the world no less a chaos and makes it by contrast seem even darker than it did By dwelling in its mock heaven art may inflict on men the same kind of injury that any irresponsible passion or luxurious vice might inflict For this reason it sometimes passes for a misfortune in a family if a son insists on being a poet or an actor Such gifts suggest too much incompetence and such honours too much disrepute A man does not avoid real evils by having visionary pleasures but besides exposing himself to the real evils quite unprotected he probably adds fancied evils to them in generous measure He becomes supersensitive envious hysterical the world which was perhaps carried away at first by his ecstasies at the next moment merely applauds his performance then criticises it superciliously and very likely ends by forgetting it altogether Thus the fine arts are seldom an original factor in human progress If they express moral and political greatness and serve to enhance it they acquire a certain dignity but so soon as this expressive function is abandoned they grow meretricious The artist becomes an abstracted trifler and the public is divided into two camps the dilettanti who dote on the artist s affectations and the rabble who pay him to grow coarse Both influences degrade him and he helps to foster both An atmosphere of dependence and charlatanry gathers about the artistic attitude and spreads with its influence Religion philosophy and manners may in turn be infected with this spirit being reduced to a voluntary hallucination or petty flattery Romanticism ritualism aestheticism symbolism are names this disease has borne at different times as it appeared in different circles or touched a different object Needless to say that the arts themselves are the first to suffer That beauty which should have been an inevitable smile on the face of society an overflow of genuine happiness and power has to be imported stimulated artificially and applied from without so that art becomes a sickly ornament for an ugly existence Sidenote yet prototypes of true perfections Nevertheless aesthetic harmony so incomplete in its basis as to be fleeting and deceptive is most complete in its form This so partial synthesis is a synthesis indeed and just because settlements made in fancy are altogether premature and ignore almost everything in the world in type they can be the most perfect settlements The artist being a born lover of the good a natural breeder of perfections clings to his insight If the world calls his accomplishments vain he can with better reason call vain the world s cumbrous instrumentalities by which nothing clearly good is attained Appearances he may justly urge are alone actual All forces substances realities and principles are inferred and potential only and in the moral scale mere instruments to bring perfect appearances about To have grasped such an appearance to have embodied a form in matter is to have justified for the first time whatever may underlie appearance and to have put reality to some use It is to have begun to live As the standard of perfection is internal and is measured by the satisfaction felt in realising it every artist has tasted in his activity what activity essentially is He has moulded existence into the likeness of thought and lost himself in that ideal achievement which so to speak beckons all things into being Even if a thousand misfortunes await him and a final disappointment he has been happy once He may be inclined to rest his case there and challenge practical people to justify in the same way the faith that is in them Sidenote Pros and cons of detached indulgences That a moment of the most perfect happiness should prove a source of unhappiness is no paradox to any one who has observed the world A hope a passion a crime is a flash of vitality It is inwardly congruous with the will that breeds it yet the happiness it pictures is so partial that even while it is felt it may be overshadowed by sinister forebodings A certain unrest and insecurity may consciously harass it With time or by a slight widening in the field of interest this submerged unhappiness may rise to the surface If as is probable it is caused or increased by the indulgence which preceded then the only moment in which a good was tasted the only vista that had opened congenially before the mind will prove a new and permanent curse In this way love often misleads individuals ambition cities and religion whole races of men That art also should often be an indulgence a blind that hides reality from ill balanced minds and ultimately increases their confusion is by no means incompatible with art s ideal essence On the contrary such a result is inevitable when ideality is carried at all far upon a narrow basis The more genuine and excellent the vision the greater havoc it makes if being inadequate it establishes itself authoritatively in the soul Art in the better sense is a condition of happiness for a practical and labouring creature since without art he remains a slave but it is one more source of unhappiness for him so long as it is not squared with his necessary labours and merely interrupts them It then alienates him from his world without being able to carry him effectually into a better one Sidenote The happy imagination is one initially in line with things The artist is in many ways like a child He seems happy because his life is spontaneous yet he is not competent to secure his own good To be truly happy he must be well bred reared from the cradle as it were under propitious influences so that he may have learned to love what conduces to his development In that rare case his art will expand as his understanding ripens he will not need to repent and begin again on a lower key The ideal artist like the ideal philosopher has all time and all existence for his virtual theme Fed by the world he can help to mould it and his insight is a kind of wisdom preparing him as science might for using the world well and making it more fruitful He can then be happy not merely in the sense of having now and then an ecstatic moment but happy in having light and resource enough within him to cope steadily with real things and to leave upon them the vestige of his mind Sidenote and brought always closer to them by experience One effect of growing experience is to render what is unreal uninteresting Momentous alternatives in life are so numerous and the possibilities they open up so varied that imagination finds enough employment of a historic and practical sort in trying to seize them A child plans Towers of Babel a mature architect in planning would lose all interest if he were bidden to disregard gravity and economy The conditions of existence after they are known and accepted become conditions for the only pertinent beauty In each place for each situation the plastic mind finds an appropriate ideal It need not go afield to import something exotic It need make no sacrifices to whim and to personal memories It rather breeds out of the given problem a new and singular solution thereby exercising greater invention than would be requisite for framing an arbitrary ideal and imposing it at all costs on every occasion Sidenote Reason is the principle of both art and happiness In other words a happy result can be secured in art as in life only by intelligence Intelligence consists in having read the heart and deciphered the promptings latent there and then in reading the world and deciphering its law and constitution to see how and where the heart s ideal may be embodied Our troubles come from the colossal blunders made by our ancestors who had worse ancestors of their own in both these interpretations blunders which have come down to us in our blood and in our institutions The vices thus transmitted cloud our intelligence We fail in practical affairs when we ignore the conditions of action and we fail in works of imagination when we concoct what is fantastic and without roots in the world The value of art lies in making people happy first in practising the art and then in possessing its product This observation might seem needless and ought to be so but if we compare it with what is commonly said on these subjects we must confess that it may often be denied and more often perhaps may not be understood Happiness is something men ought to pursue although they seldom do so they are drawn away from it at first by foolish impulses and afterwards by perverse laws To secure happiness conduct would have to remain spontaneous while it learned not to be criminal but the fanatical attachment of men now to a fierce liberty now to a false regimen keeps them barbarous and wretched A rational pursuit of happiness which is one thing with progress or with the Life of Reason would embody that natural piety which leaves to the episodes of life their inherent values mourning death celebrating love sanctifying civic traditions enjoying and correcting nature s ways To discriminate happiness is therefore the very soul of art which expresses experience without distorting it as those political or metaphysical tyrannies distort it which sanctify unhappiness A free mind like a creative imagination rejoices at the harmonies it can find or make between man and nature and where it finds none it solves the conflict so far as it may and then notes and endures it with a shudder A morality organised about the human heart in an ingenuous and sincere fashion would involve every fine art and would render the world pervasively beautiful beautiful in its artificial products and beautiful in its underlying natural terrors The closer we keep to elementary human needs and to the natural agencies that may satisfy them the closer we are to beauty Industry sport and science with the perennial intercourse and passions of men swarm with incentives to expression because they are everywhere creating new moulds of being and compelling the eye to observe those forms and to recast them ideally Art is simply an adequate industry it arises when industry is carried out to the satisfaction of all human demands even of those incidental sensuous demands which we call aesthetic and which a brutal industry in its haste may despise or ignore Arts responsive in this way to all human nature would be beautiful according to reason and might remain beautiful long Poetic beauty touches the world whenever it attains some unfeigned harmony either with sense or with reason and the more unfeignedly human happiness was made the test of all institutions and pursuits the more beautiful they would be having more numerous points of fusion with the mind and fusing with it more profoundly To distinguish and to create beauty would then be no art relegated to a few abstracted spirits playing with casual fancies it would be a habit inseparable from practical efficiency All operations all affairs would then be viewed in the light of ultimate interests and in their deep relation to human good The arts would thus recover their Homeric glory touching human fate as they clearly would they would borrow something of its grandeur and pathos and yet the interest that worked in them would be warm because it would remain unmistakably animal and sincere Sidenote Only a rational society can have sure and perfect arts The principle that all institutions should subserve happiness runs deeper than any cult for art and lays the foundation on which the latter might rest safely If social structure were rational its free expression would be so too Many observers with no particular philosophy to adduce feel that the arts among us are somehow impotent and they look for a better inspiration now to ancient models now to the raw phenomena of life A dilettante may indeed summon inspiration whence he will and a virtuoso will never lack some material to keep him busy but if what is hoped for is a genuine native inevitable art a great revolution would first have to be worked in society We should have to abandon our vested illusions our irrational religions and patriotisms and schools of art and to discover instead our genuine needs the forms of our possible happiness To call for such self examination seems revolutionary only because we start from a sophisticated system a system resting on traditional fashions and superstitions by which the will of the living generation is misinterpreted and betrayed To shake off that system would not subvert order but rather institute order for the first time it would be an Instauratio Magna a setting things again on their feet We in Christendom are so accustomed to artificial ideals and to artificial institutions kept up to express them that we hardly conceive how anomalous our situation is sorely as we may suffer from it We found academies and museums as we found missions to fan a flame that constantly threatens to die out for lack of natural fuel Our overt ideals are parasites in the body politic while the ideals native to the body politic those involved in our natural structure and situation are either stifled by that alien incubus leaving civic life barbarous or else force their way up unremarked or not justly honoured as ideals Industry and science and social amenities with all the congruous comforts and appurtenances of contemporary life march on their way as if they had nothing to say to the spirit which remains entangled in a cobweb of dead traditions An idle pottering of the fancy over obsolete forms theological dramatic or plastic makes that by play to the sober business of life which men call their art or their religion and the more functionless and gratuitous this by play is the more those who indulge in it think they are idealists They feel they are champions of what is most precious in the world as a sentimental lady might fancy herself a lover of flowers when she pressed them in a book instead of planting their seeds in the garden Sidenote Why art is now empty and unstable It is clear that gratuitous and functionless habits cannot bring happiness they do not constitute an activity at once spontaneous and beneficent such as noble art is an instance of Those habits may indeed give pleasure they may bring extreme excitement as madness notably does though it is in the highest degree functionless and gratuitous Nor is such by play without consequences some of which might conceivably be fortunate What is functionless is so called for being worthless from some ideal point of view and not conducing to the particular life considered But nothing real is dissociated from the universal flux everything madness and all unmeaning cross currents in being count in the general process and discharge somewhere not without effect the substance they have drawn for a moment into their little vortex So our vain arts and unnecessary religions are not without real effects and not without a certain internal vitality When life is profoundly disorganised it may well happen that only in detached episodes only in moments snatched for dreaming in can men see the blue or catch a glimpse of something like the ideal In that case their esteem for their irrelevant visions may be well grounded and their thin art and far fetched religion may really constitute what is best in their experience In a pathetic way these poor enthusiasms may be justified but only because the very conception of a rational life lies entirely beyond the horizon Sidenote Anomalous character of the irrational artist It is no marvel when art is a brief truancy from rational practice that the artist himself should be a vagrant and at best as it were an infant prodigy The wings of genius serve him only for an escapade enabling him to skirt the perilous edge of madness and of mystical abysses But such an erratic workman does not deserve the name of artist or master he has burst convention only to break it not to create a new convention more in harmony with nature His originality though it may astonish for a moment will in the end be despised and will find no thoroughfare He will meantime be wretched himself torn from the roots of his being by that cruel unmeaning inspiration or if too rapt to see his own plight he will be all the more pitied by practical men who cannot think it a real blessing to be lost in joys that do not strengthen the character and yield nothing for posterity Art in its nobler acceptation is an achievement not an indulgence It prepares the world in some sense to receive the soul and the soul to master the world it disentangles those threads in each that can be woven into the other That the artist should be eccentric homeless dreamful may almost seem a natural law but it is none the less a scandal An artist s business is not really to cut fantastical capers or be licensed to play the fool His business is simply that of every keen soul to build well when it builds and to speak well when it speaks giving practice everywhere the greatest possible affinity to the situation the most delicate adjustment to every faculty it affects The wonder of an artist s performance grows with the range of his penetration with the instinctive sympathy that makes him in his mortal isolation considerate of other men s fate and a great diviner of their secret so that his work speaks to them kindly with a deeper assurance than they could have spoken with to themselves And the joy of his great sanity the power of his adequate vision is not the less intense because he can lend it to others and has borrowed it from a faithful study of the world Sidenote True art measures and completes happiness If happiness is the ultimate sanction of art art in turn is the best instrument of happiness In art more directly than in other activities man s self expression is cumulative and finds an immediate reward for it alters the material conditions of sentience so that sentience becomes at once more delightful and more significant In industry man is still servile preparing the materials he is to use in action In action itself though he is free he exerts his influence on a living and treacherous medium and sees the issue at each moment drift farther and farther from his intent In science he is an observer preparing himself for action in another way by studying its results and conditions But in art he is at once competent and free he is creative He is not troubled by his materials because he has assimilated them and may take them for granted nor is he concerned with the chance complexion of affairs in the actual world because he is making the world over not merely considering how it grew or how it will consent to grow in future Nothing accordingly could be more delightful than genuine art nor more free from remorse and the sting of vanity Art springs so completely from the heart of man that it makes everything speak to him in his own language it reaches nevertheless so truly to the heart of nature that it company operates with her becomes a parcel of her creative material energy and builds by her instinctive hand If the various formative impulses afoot in the world never opposed stress to stress and made no havoc with one another nature might be called an unconscious artist In fact just where such a formative impulse finds support from the environment a consciousness supervenes If that consciousness is adequate enough to be prophetic an art arises Thus the emergence of arts out of instincts is the token and exact measure of nature s success and of mortal happiness End of Volume Four REASON IN SCIENCE Volume Five of The Life of Reason

Approach to irrelevant sentience Perception represents things in their practical relation to the body Mind the existence in which form becomes actual Attempt at idealistic physics Association not

constructive impotence Its dependence on common sense Its futility Ideal science is self justified Physical science is presupposed in scepticism It recurs in all understanding of perception Science contains all trustworthy knowledge It suffices for the Life of Reason Pages three hundred one three hundred twenty REASON IN SCIENCE CHAPTER I TYPES AND AIMS OF SCIENCE Sidenote Science still young Science is so new a thing and so far from final it seems to the layman so hopelessly accurate and extensive that a moralist may well feel some diffidence in trying to estimate its achievements and promises at their human worth The morrow may bring some great revolution in science and is sure to bring many a correction and many a surprise Religion and art have had their day indeed a part of the faith they usually inspire is to believe that they have long ago revealed their secret A critic may safely form a judgment concerning them for even if he dissents from the orthodox opinion and ventures to hope that religion and art may assume in the future forms far nobler and more rational than any they have hitherto worn still he must confess that art and religion have had several turns at the wheel they have run their course through in various ages and climes with results which anybody is free to estimate if he has an open mind and sufficient interest in the subject Science on the contrary which apparently cannot exist where intellectual freedom is denied has flourished only twice in recorded times once for some three hundred years in ancient Greece and again for about the same period in modern Christendom Its fruits have scarcely begun to appear the lands it is discovering have not yet been circumnavigated and there is no telling what its ultimate influence will be on human practice and feeling Sidenote Its miscarriage in Greece The first period in the life of science was brilliant but ineffectual The Greeks energy and liberty were too soon spent and the very exuberance of their genius made its expression chaotic Where every mind was so fresh and every tongue so clever no scientific tradition could arise and no laborious applications could be made to test the value of rival notions and decide between them Men of science were mere philosophers Each began not where his predecessor had ended but at the very beginning Another circumstance that impeded the growth of science was the forensic and rhetorical turn proper to Greek intelligence This mental habit gave a tremendous advantage in philosophy to the moralist and poet over the naturalist or mathematician Hence what survived in Greece after the heyday of theoretic achievement was chiefly philosophies of life and these at the death of liberty grew daily more personal and ascetic Authority in scientific matters clung chiefly to Plato and Aristotle and this not for the sake of their incomparable moral philosophy for in ethics that decadent age preferred the Stoics and Epicureans but just for those rhetorical expedients which in the Socratic school took the place of natural science Worse influences in this field could hardly be imagined since Plato s physics ends in myth and apologue while Aristotle s ends in nomenclature and teleology All that remained of Greek physics therefore was the conception of what physics should be a great achievement due to the earlier thinkers and certain hints and guesses in that field The elements of geometry had also been formulated while the Socratic school bequeathed to posterity a well developed group of moral sciences rational in principle but destined to be soon overlaid with metaphysical and religious accretions so that the dialectical nerve and reasonableness of them were obliterated and there survived only miscellaneous conclusions fragments of wisdom built topsy turvy into the new mythical edifice It is the sad task reserved for historical criticism to detach those sculptured stones from the rough mass in which they have been embedded and to rearrange them in their pristine order thus rediscovering the inner Socratic principle of moral philosophy which is nothing but self knowledge a circumspect systematic utterance of the speaker s mind disclosing his implicit meaning and his ultimate preferences Sidenote Its timid reappearance in modern times At its second birth science took a very different form It left cosmic theories to pantheistic enthusiasts like Giordano Bruno while in sober laborious circles it confined itself to specific discoveries the earth s roundness and motion about the sun the laws of mechanics the development and application of algebra the invention of the calculus and a hundred other steps forward in various disciplines It was a patient siege laid to the truth which was approached blindly and without a general as by an army of ants it was not stormed imaginatively as by the ancient Ionians who had reached at once the notion of nature s dynamic unity but had neglected to take possession in detail of the intervening tracts whence resources might be drawn in order to maintain the main position Nevertheless as discoveries accumulated they fell insensibly into a system and philosophers like Descartes and Newton arrived at a general physics This physics however was not yet meant to cover the whole existent world or to be the genetic account of all things in their system Descartes excluded from his physics the whole mental and moral world which became so far as his science went an inexplicable addendum Similarly Newton s mechanical principles broad as they were were conceived by him merely as a parenthesis in theology Not until the nineteenth century were the observations that had been accumulated given their full value or in fact understood for Spinoza s system though naturalistic in spirit was still dialectical in form and had no influence on science and for a long time little even on speculation Indeed the conception of a natural order like the Greek cosmos which shall include all existences gods no less than men if gods actually exist is one not yet current although it is implied in every scientific explanation and is favoured by two powerful contemporary movements which coming from different quarters are leading men s minds back to the same ancient and obvious naturalism One of these movements is the philosophy of evolution to which Darwin gave such an irresistible impetus The other is theology itself where it has been emancipated from authority and has set to work to square men s conscience with history and experience This theology has generally passed into speculative idealism which under another name recognises the universal empire of law and conceives man s life as an incident in a prodigious natural process by which his mind and his interests are produced and devoured This idealism is in truth a system of immaterial physics like that of Pythagoras or Heraclitus While it works with fantastic and shifting categories which no plain naturalist would care to use it has nothing to apply those categories to except what the naturalist or historian may already have discovered and expressed in the categories of common prose German idealism is a translation of physical evolution into mythical language which presents the facts now in the guise of a dialectical progression now in that of a romantic drama In either case the facts are the same and just those which positive knowledge has come upon Thus many who are not brought to naturalism by science are brought to it quite unwillingly and unawares by their religious speculations Sidenote Distinction between science and myth The gulf that yawns between such idealistic cosmogonies and a true physics may serve to make clear the divergence in principle which everywhere divides natural science from arbitrary conceptions of things This divergence is as far as possible from lying in the merit of the two sorts of theory Their merit and the genius and observation required to frame them may well be equal or an imaginative system may have the advantage in these respects It may even be more serviceable for a while and have greater pragmatic value so long as knowledge is at best fragmentary and no consecutive or total view of things is attempted by either party Thus in social life a psychology expressed in terms of abstract faculties and personified passions may well carry a man farther than a physiological psychology would Or again we may say that there was more experience and love of nature enshrined in ancient mythology than in ancient physics the observant poet might then have fared better in the world than the pert and ignorant materialist Nor does the difference between science and myth lie in the fact that the one is essentially less speculative than the other They are differently speculative it is true since myth terminates in unverifiable notions that might by chance represent actual existences while science terminates in concepts or laws themselves not possibly existent but verified by recurring particular facts belonging to the same experience as those from which the theory started Sidenote Platonic status of hypothesis The laws formulated by science the transitive figments describing the relation between fact and fact possess only a Platonic sort of reality They are more real if you will than the facts themselves because they are more permanent trustworthy and pervasive but at the same time they are if you will not real at all because they are incompatible with immediacy and alien to brute existence In declaring what is true of existences they altogether renounce existence on their own behalf This situation has made no end of trouble in ill balanced minds not docile to the diversities and free complexity of things but bent on treating everything by a single method They have asked themselves persistently the confusing question whether the matter or the form of things is the reality whereas of course both elements are needed each with its incommensurable kind of being The material element alone is existent while the ideal element is the sum of all those propositions which are true of what exists materially Anybody s knowledge of the truth being a complex and fleeting feeling is of course but a moment of existence or material being which whether found in God or man is as far as possible from being that truth itself which it may succeed in knowing Sidenote Meaning of verification The true contrast between science and myth is more nearly touched when we say that science alone is capable of verification Some ambiguity however lurks in this phrase since verification comes to a method only vicariously when the particulars it prophesies are realised in sense To verify a theory as if it were not a method but a divination of occult existences would be to turn the theory into a myth and then to discover that what the myth pictured had by a miracle an actual existence also There is accordingly a sense in which myth admits substantiation of a kind that science excludes The Olympic hierarchy might conceivably exist bodily but gravitation and natural selection being schemes of relation can never exist substantially and on their own behoof Nevertheless the Olympic hierarchy even if it happened to exist could not be proved to do so unless it were a part of the natural world open to sense while gravitation and natural selection without being existences can be verified at every moment by concrete events occurring as those principles require A hypothesis being a discursive device gains its utmost possible validity when its discursive value is established It is not it merely applies and every situation in which it is found to apply is a proof of its truth The case would not be different with fables were their basis and meaning remembered But fables when hypostatised forget that they too were transitive symbols and boast to reveal an undiscoverable reality A dogmatic myth is in this sorry plight that the more evidence it can find to support it the more it abrogates its metaphysical pretensions while the more it insists on its absolute truth the less relevance it has to experience and the less meaning To try to support fabulous dogmas by evidence is tantamount to acknowledging that they are merely scientific hypotheses instruments of discourse and methods of expression But in that case their truth would no longer be supposed to lie in the fact that somewhere beyond the range of human observation they descended bodily to the plane of flying existence and were actually enacted there They would have ceased to resemble the society of Olympus which to prove itself real would need to verify itself since only the gods and those mortals admitted to their conclave could know for a fact that that celestial gathering existed On the contrary a speculation that could be supported by evidence would be one that might be made good without itself descending to the plane of immediacy but would be sufficiently verified when diffuse facts fall out as it had led us to expect The myth in such a case would have become transparent again and relevant to experience which could continually serve to support or to correct it Even if somewhat overloaded and poetical it would be in essence a scientific theory It would no longer terminate in itself it would point forward leading the thinker that used it to eventual facts of experience facts which his poetic wisdom would have prepared him to meet and to use Sidenote Possible validity of myths If I say for instance that Punishment limping in one leg patiently follows every criminal the myth is obvious and innocent enough It reveals nothing but what is far better it means something I have expressed a truth of experience and pointed vaguely to the course which events may be expected to take under given circumstances The expression though mythical in form is scientific in effect because it tends to surround a given phenomenon the crime with objects on its own plane other passions and sensations to follow upon it What would be truly mythical would be to stop at the figure of speech and maintain by way of revealed dogma that a lame goddess of vindictive mind actually follows every wicked man her sword poised in mid air Sinking into that reverie and trembling at its painted truth I should be passing to the undiscoverable and forgetting the hard blows actually awaiting me in the world Fable detaining the mind too long in the mesh of expression would have become metaphysical dogma I should have connected the given fact with imagined facts which even if by chance real for such a goddess may for all we know actually float in the fourth dimension are quite supernumerary in my world and never by any possibility can become parts or extensions of the experience they are thought to explain The gods are demonstrable only as hypotheses but as hypotheses they are not gods Sidenote Any dreamed of thing might be experienced The same distinction is sometimes expressed by saying that science deals only with objects of possible experience But this expression is unfortunate because everything thinkable no matter how mythical and supernatural or how far beyond the range of mortal senses is an object of possible experience Tritons and sea horses might observe one another and might feel themselves live The thoughts and decrees said to occupy the divine mind from all eternity would certainly be phenomena there they would be experienced things Were fables really as metaphysical and visionary as they pretend to be were they not all the while and in essence mere symbols for natural situations they would be nothing but reports about other alleged parts of experience A real Triton a real Creator a real heaven would obviously be objects open to properly equipped senses and seats of much vivid experience But a Triton after all has something to do with the AEgean and other earthly waters a Creator has something to do with the origin of man and of his habitat heaven has something to do with the motives and rewards of moral action This relevance to given experience and its objects is what cuts those myths off from their blameless and gratuitous role of reporting experiences that might be going on merrily enough somewhere else in the universe In calling them myths and denying that what they describe falls within the purview of science we do not assert that absolutely taken they could not be objects of a possible experience What we mean is rather that no matter how long we searched the sea waves in which it is the essence of our Tritons to disport themselves we should never find Tritons there and that if we traced back the history of man and nature we should find them always passing by natural generation out of slightly different earlier forms and never appearing suddenly at the fiat of a vehement Jehovah swimming about in a chaos and finally that if we considered critically our motives and our ideals we should find them springing from and directed upon a natural life and its functions and not at all on a disembodied and timeless ecstasy Those myths then while they intrinsically refer to facts in the given world describe those facts in incongruous terms They are symbols not extensions for the experience we know Sidenote But science follows the movement of its subject matter A chief characteristic of science then is that in supplementing given facts it supplements them by adding other facts belonging to the same sphere and eventually discoverable by tracing the given object in its own plane through its continuous transformations Science expands speculatively by the aid of merely instrumental hypotheses objects given in perception until they compose a congruous self supporting world all parts of which might be observed consecutively What a scientific hypothesis interpolates among the given facts the atomic structure of things for instance might come in time under the direct fire of attention fixed more scrupulously longer or with better instruments upon those facts themselves Otherwise the hypothesis that assumed that structure would be simply false just as a hypothesis that the interior of the earth is full of molten fire would be false if on inspection nothing were found there but solid rock Science does not merely prolong a habit of inference it verifies and solves the inference by reaching the fact inferred The contrast with myth at this point is very interesting for in myth the facts are themselves made vehicles and knowledge is felt to terminate in an independent existence on a higher or deeper level than any immediate fact and this circumstance is what makes myth impossible to verify and except by laughter to disprove If I attributed the stars shining to the diligence of angels who lighted their lamps at sunset lest the upper reaches of the world should grow dangerous for travellers and if I made my romance elaborate and ingenious enough I might possibly find that the stars appearance and disappearance could continue to be interpreted in that way My myth might always suggest itself afresh and might be perennially appropriate But it would never descend with its charming figures into the company of its evidences It would never prove that what it terminated in was a fact as in my metaphysical faith I had deputed and asserted it to be The angels would remain notional while my intent was to have them exist so that the more earnestly I held to my fable the more grievously should I be deceived For even if seraphic choirs existed in plenty on their own emotional or musical plane of being it would not have been their hands if they had hands that would have lighted the stars I saw and this after all was the gist and starting point of my whole fable and its sole witness in my world A myth might by chance be a revelation did what it talks of have an actual existence somewhere else in the universe but it would need to be a revelation in order to be true at all and would then be true only in an undeserved and spurious fashion Any representative and provable validity which it might possess would assimulate it to science and reduce it to a mere vehicle and instrument for human discourse It would evaporate as soon as the prophecies it made were fulfilled and it would claim no being and no worship on its own account Science might accordingly be called a myth conscious of its essential ideality reduced to its fighting weight and valued only for its significance Sidenote Moral value of science A symptom of the divergence between myth and science may be found in the contrary emotions which they involve Since in myth we interpret experience in order to interpret it in order to delight ourselves by turning it poetically into the language and prosody of our own life the emotion we feel when we succeed is artistic myth has a dramatic charm Since in science on the contrary we employ notional machinery in itself perhaps indifferent enough in order to arrive at eventual facts and to conceive the aspect which given things would actually wear from a different point of view in space or time the emotion we feel when we succeed is that of security and intellectual dominion science has a rational value To see better what we now see to see by anticipation what we should see actually under other conditions is wonderfully to satisfy curiosity and to enlighten conduct At the same time scientific thinking involves no less inward excitement than dramatic fiction does It summons before us an even larger number of objects in their fatal direction upon our interests Were science adequate it would indeed absorb those passions which now since they must be satisfied somehow have to be satisfied by dramatic myths To imagine how things might have been would be neither interesting nor possible if we knew fully how things are All pertinent dramatic emotion joyous or tragic would then inhere in practical knowledge As it is however science abstracts from the more musical overtones of things in order to trace the gross and basal processes within them so that the pursuit of science seems comparatively dry and laborious except where at moments the vista opens through to the ultimate or leads back to the immediate Then perhaps we recognise that in science we are surveying all it concerns us to know and in so doing are becoming all that it profits us to be Mere amusement in thought as in sportive action is tedious and illiberal it marks a temperament so imperfectly educated that it prefers idle to significant play and a flimsy to a solid idea Sidenote Its continuity with common knowledge The fact that science follows the subject matter in its own movement involves a further consequence science differs from common knowledge in scope only not in nature When intelligence arises when the flux of things begins to be mitigated by representation of it and objects are at last fixed and recognisable there is science For even here in the presence of a datum something virtual and potential is called up namely what the given thing was a moment ago what it is growing into or what it is contrasted with in character As I walk round a tree I learn that the parts still visible those that have just disappeared and those now coming into view are continuous and belong to the same tree This declaration though dialectic might find many a mare s nest in its language is a safe and obvious enough expression of knowledge It involves terms however which are in the act of becoming potential What is just past what is just coming though sensibly continuous with what is present are partially infected with nonentity After a while human apprehension can reach them only by inference and to count upon them is frankly to rely on theory The other side of the tree which common sense affirms to exist unconditionally will have to be represented in memory or fancy and it may never actually be observed by any mortal Yet if I continued my round I should actually observe it and know it by experience and I should find that it had the same status as the parts now seen and was continuous with them My assertion that it exists while certainly theoretical and perhaps false is accordingly scientific in type Science when it has no more scope than this is indistinguishable from common sense The two become distinct only when the facts inferred cannot be easily verified or have not yet been merged with the notion representing the given object in most men s minds Where science remains consciously theoretical being as yet contrasted with ordinary apperception and current thought it is ideally considered a pis aller an expedient to which a mind must have recourse when it lacks power and scope to hold all experience in hand and to view the wide world in its genuine immediacy As oblivescence is a gradual death proper to a being not ideally master of the universal flux but swamped within it so science is an artificial life in which what cannot be perceived directly because personal limitations forbid may be regarded abstractly yet efficaciously in what we think and do With better faculties the field of possible experience could be better dominated and fewer of its parts being hidden from sight would need to be mapped out symbolically on that sort of projection which we call scientific inference The real relations between the parts of nature would then be given in intuition from which hypothesis after all has borrowed its schemata Sidenote Its intellectual essence Science is a half way house between private sensation and universal vision We should not forget to add however that the universal vision in question if it were to be something better than private sensation or passive feeling in greater bulk would have to be intellectual just as science is that is it would have to be practical and to survey the flux from a given standpoint in a perspective determined by special and local interests Otherwise the whole world when known would merely be re enacted in its blind immediacy without being understood or subjected to any purpose The critics of science when endowed with any speculative power have always seen that what is hypothetical and abstract in scientific method is somehow servile and provisional science being a sort of telegraphic wire through which a meagre report reaches us of things we would fain observe and live through in their full reality This report may suffice for approximately fit action it does not suffice for ideal knowledge of the truth nor for adequate sympathy with the reality What commonly escapes speculative critics of science however is that in transcending hypothesis and reaching immediacy again we should run a great risk of abandoning knowledge and sympathy altogether for if we became what we now represent so imperfectly we should evidently no longer represent it at all We should not at the end of our labours have at all enriched our own minds by adequate knowledge of what surrounds us nor made our wills just in view of alien but well considered interests We should have lost our own essence and substituted for it not something higher than indiscriminate being but only indiscriminate being in its flat blind and selfish infinity The ideality the representative faculty would have gone out in our souls and our perfected humanity would have brought us back to protoplasm In transcending science therefore we must not hope to transcend knowledge nor in transcending selfishness to abolish finitude Finitude is the indispensable condition of unselfishness as well as of selfishness and of speculative vision no less than of hypothetical knowledge The defect of science is that it is inadequate or abstract that the account it gives of things is not full and sensuous enough but its merit is that like sense it makes external being present to a creature that is concerned in adjusting itself to its environment and informs that creature about things other than itself Science if brought to perfection would not lose its representative or ideal essence It would still survey and inform but it would survey everything at once and inform the being it enlightened about all that could affect its interests It would thus remain practical in effect and speculative in character In losing its accidental limitations it would not lose its initial bias its vital function It would continue to be a rational activity guiding and perfecting a natural being Perfect knowledge of things would be as far as possible from identifying the knower with them seeing that for the most part even when we call them human they have no knowledge of themselves Science accordingly even when imperfect is a tremendous advance on absorption in sense and a dull immediacy It begins to enrich the mind and gives it some inkling at least of that ideal dominion which each centre of experience might have if it had learned to regard all others and the relation connecting it with them both in thought and in action Ideal knowledge would be an inward state corresponding to a perfect adjustment of the body to all forces affecting it If the adjustment was perfect the inward state would regard every detail in the objects envisaged but it would see those details in a perspective of its own adding to sympathetic reproduction of them a consciousness of their relation to its own existence and perfection Sidenote Unity of science The fact that science expresses the character and relation of objects in their own terms has a further important consequence which serves again to distinguish science from metaphorical thinking If a man tries to illustrate the nature of a thing by assimilating it to something else which he happens to have in mind at the same time it is obvious that a second man whose mind is differently furnished may assimilate the same object to a quite different idea so myths are centrifugal and the more elaborate and delicate they are the more they diverge like well developed languages The rude beginnings of myth in every age and country bear a certain resemblance because the facts interpreted are similar and the minds reading them have not yet developed their special grammar of representation But two highly developed mythical systems two theologies for instance like the Greek and the Indian will grow every day farther and farther apart Science on the contrary whatever it may start with runs back into the same circle of facts because it follows the lead of the subject matter and is attentive to its inherent transformations If men s fund of initial perceptions then is alike their science is sure to be so while the embroideries they make upon perception out of their own resources will differ as much as do the men themselves Men asleep said Heraclitus live each in his own world but awake they live in the same world together To be awake is nothing but to be dreaming under control of the object it is to be pursuing science to the comparative exclusion of mere mental vegetation and spontaneous myth Thus if our objects are the same our science and our waking lives will coincide or if there is a natural diversity in our discoveries because we occupy different points in space and time and have a varying range of experience these diversities will nevertheless supplement one another the discovery that each has made will be a possible discovery for the others also So a geographer in China and one in Babylonia may at first make wholly unlike maps but in time both will take note of the Himalayas and the side each approaches will slope up to the very crest approached by the other So science is self confirming and its most disparate branches are mutually illuminating while in the realm of myth until it is surveyed scientifically there can be nothing but mutual repulsion and incapacity to understand Languages and religions are necessarily rivals but sciences are necessarily allies Sidenote In existence judged by reflection there is a margin of waste The unity of science can reach no farther than does coherent experience and though coherence be a condition of experience in the more pregnant sense of the word in the sense in which the child or the fool has no experience existence is absolutely free to bloom as it likes and no logic can set limits or prescribe times for its irresponsible presence A great deal may accordingly exist which cannot be known by science or be reached from the outside at all This fact perhaps explains why science has as yet taken so little root in human life for even within the limits of human existence which are tolerably narrow there is probably no little incoherence no little lapsing into what from any other point of view is inconceivable and undiscoverable Science for instance can hardly reach the catastrophes and delights often so vivid which occur in dreams for even if a physiological psychology should some day be able to find the causes of these phenomena and so to predict them it would never enter the dream world persuasively in a way that the dreamer could appreciate and understand while he continued to dream This is because that dream world and the waking world present two disjointed landscapes and the figures they contain belong to quite different genealogies like the families of Zeus and of Abraham Science is a great disciplinarian and misses much of the sport which the absolute is free to indulge in If there is no inner congruity and communion between two fields science cannot survey them both at best in tracing the structure of things presented in one of them it may come upon some detail which may offer a basis or lodgment for the entire fabric of the other which will thus be explained ab extra as the children of Abraham might give an explanation for Zeus and his progeny treating them as a phenomenon in the benighted minds of some of Japhet s children This brings the Olympian world within the purview of science but does so with a very bad grace For suppose the Olympian gods really existed and there is nothing impossible in that supposition they would not be allowed to have any science of their own or if they did it would threaten the children of Abraham with the same imputed unreality with which the latter boast to have extinguished Olympus In order then that two regions of existence should be amenable to a science common to both and establishing a mutual rational representation between them it is requisite that the two regions should be congruous in texture and continuous inwardly the objects present in each must be transformations of the objects present in the other As this condition is not always fulfilled even within a man s personal fortunes it is impossible that all he goes through should be mastered by science or should accrue to him ideally and become part of his funded experience Much must be lost left to itself and resigned to the unprofitable flux that produced it Sidenote Sciences converge from different points of origin A consequence of this incoherence in experience is that science is not absolutely single but springs up in various places at once as a certain consistency or method becomes visible in this or that direction These independent sciences might conceivably never meet at all each might work out an entirely different aspect of things and cross the other as it were at a different level This actually happens for instance in mathematics as compared with history or psychology and in morals as compared with physics Nevertheless the fact that these various sciences are all human and that here for instance we are able to mention them in one breath and to compare their natures is proof that their spheres touch somehow even if only peripherally Since common knowledge which knows of them all is itself an incipient science we may be sure that some continuity and some congruity obtains between their provinces Some aspect of each must coincide with some aspect of some other else nobody who pursued any one science would so much as suspect the existence of the rest Great as may be the aversion of learned men to one another and comprehensive as may be their ignorance they are not positively compelled to live in solitary confinement and the key of their prison cells is at least in their own pocket Sidenote Two chief kinds of science physics and dialectic Some sciences like chemistry and biology or biology and anthropology are parted only we presume by accidental gaps in human knowledge a more minute and better directed study of these fields would doubtless disclose their continuity with the fields adjoining But there is one general division in science which cuts almost to the roots of human experience Human understanding has used from the beginning a double method of surveying and arresting ideally the irreparable flux of being One expedient has been to notice and identify similarities of character recurrent types in the phenomena that pass before it or in its own operations the other expedient has been to note and combine in one complex object characters which occur and reappear together The latter feat which is made easy by the fact that when various senses are stimulated at once the inward instinctive reaction which is felt by a primitive mind more powerfully than any external image is one and not consciously divisible The first expedient imposes on the flux what we call ideas which are concretions in discourse terms employed in thought and language The second expedient separates the same flux into what we call things which are concretions in existence complexes of qualities subsisting in space and time having definable dynamic relations there and a traceable history Carrying out this primitive diversity in reflection science has moved in two different directions By refining concretions in discourse it has attained to mathematics logic and the dialectical developments of ethics by tracing concretions in existence it has reached the various natural and historical sciences Following ancient usage I shall take the liberty of calling the whole group of sciences which elaborates ideas dialectic and the whole group that describes existences physics The contrast between ideal science or dialectic and natural science or physics is as great as the understanding of a single experience could well afford yet the two kinds of science are far from independent They touch at their basis and they company operate in their results Were dialectic made clearer or physics deeper than it commonly is these points of contact would doubtless be multiplied but even as they stand they furnish a sufficient illustration of the principle that all science develops objects in their own category and gives the mind dominion over the flux of matter by discovering its form Sidenote Their mutual implication That physics and dialectic touch at their basis may be shown by a double analysis In the first place it is clear that the science of existence like all science is itself discourse and that before concretions in existence can be discovered and groups of coexistent qualities can be recognised these qualities themselves must be arrested by the mind noted and identified in their recurrences But these terms bandied about in scientific discourse are so many essences and pure ideas so that the inmost texture of natural science is logical and the whole force of any observation made upon the outer world lies in the constancy and mutual relations of the terms it is made in If down did not mean down and motion motion Newton could never have taken note of the fall of his apple Now the constancy and relation of meanings is something meant it is something created by insight and intent and is altogether dialectical so that the science of existence is a portion of the art of discourse On the other hand discourse in its operation is a part of existence That truth or logical cogency is not itself an existence can be proved dialectically A and is obvious to any one who sees for a moment what truth means especially if he remembers at the same time that all existence is mutable which it is the essence of truth not to be But the knowledge or discovery of truth is an event in time an incident in the flux of existence and therefore a matter for natural science to study Furthermore every term which dialectic uses is originally given embodied in other words it is given as an element in the actual flux it conies by illustration Though meaning is the object of an ideal function and signification is inwardly appreciable only in terms of signification yet the ideal leap is made from a material datum that in which signification is seen is a fact Or to state the matter somewhat differently truth is not self generating if it were it would be a falsehood Its eternity and the infinitude of propositions it contains remain potential and unapproachable until their incidence is found in existence Form cannot of itself decide which of all possible forms shall be real in their ideality and without reference to their illustration in things all consistent propositions would be equally valid and equally trivial Important truth is truth about something not truth about truth and although a single datum might suffice to give foothold and pertinence to an infinity of truths as one atom would posit all geometry geometry if there were no space would be if I may say so all of the fourth dimension and arithmetic if there were no pulses or chasms in being would be all algebra Truth depends upon facts for its perspective since facts select truths and decide which truths shall be mere possibilities and which shall be the eternal forms of actual things The dialectical world would be a trackless desert if the existent world had no arbitrary constitution Living dialectic comes to clarify existence it turns into meanings the actual forms of things by reflecting upon them and by making them intended subjects of discourse Sidenote Their company operation Dialectic and physics thus united at their basis meet again in their results In mechanical science which is the best part of physics mathematics which is the best part of dialectic plays a predominant role it furnishes the whole method of understanding wherever there is any real understanding at all In psychology and history too although dialectic is soon choked by the cross currents of nature it furnishes the little perspicuousness which there is We understand actions and mental developments when the purposes or ideas contained in any stage are carried out logically in the sequel it is when conduct and growth are rational that is when they are dialectical that we think we have found the true secret and significance of them It is the evident ideal of physics in every department to attain such an insight into causes that the effects actually given may be thence deduced and deduction is another name for dialectic To be sure the dialectic applicable to material processes and to human life is one in which the terms and the categories needed are still exceedingly numerous and vague a little logic is all that can be read into the cataract of events But the hope of science a hope which is supported by every success it scores is that a simpler law than has yet been discovered will be found to connect units subtler than those yet known and that in these finer terms the universal mechanism may be exhaustively rendered Mechanism is the ideal of physics because it is the infusion of a maximum of mathematical necessity into the flux of real things It is the aspiration of natural science to be as dialectical as possible and thus in their ideal both branches of science are brought together That the ideal of dialectic is to apply to existence and thereby to coincide with physics is in a sense no less true although dialecticians may be little inclined to confess it The direct purpose of deduction is to elucidate an idea to develop an import and nothing can be more irrelevant in this science than whether the conclusion is verified in nature or not But the direct purpose of dialectic is not its ultimate justification Dialectic is a human pursuit and has at bottom a moral function otherwise at bottom it would have no value And the moral function and ultimate justification of dialectic is to further the Life of Reason in which human thought has the maximum practical validity and may enjoy in consequence the richest ideal development If dialectic takes a turn which makes it inapplicable in physics which makes it worthless for mastering experience it loses all its dignity for abstract cogency has no dignity if the subject matter into which it is introduced is trivial In fact were dialectic a game in which the counters were not actual data and the conclusions were not possible principles for understanding existence it would not be a science at all It would resemble a counterfeit paper currency without intrinsic value and without commercial convenience Just as a fact without implications is not a part of science so a method without application would not be The free excursions of dialectic into non natural regions may be wisely encouraged when they satisfy an interest which is at bottom healthy and may at least indirectly bring with it excellent fruits As musicians are an honour to society so are dialecticians that have a single heart and an exquisite patience But somehow the benefit must redound to society and to practical knowledge or these abstracted hermits will seem at first useless and at last mad The logic of nonsense has a subtle charm only because it can so easily be turned into the logic of common sense Empty dialectic is as it were the ballet of science it runs most neatly after nothing at all Sidenote No science a priori Both physics and dialectic are contained in common knowledge and when carried further than men carry them daily life these sciences remain essentially inevitable and essentially fallible If science deserves respect it is not for being oracular but for being useful and delightful as seeing is Understanding is nothing but seeing under and seeing far There is indeed a great mystery in knowledge but this mystery is present in the simplest memory or presumption The sciences have nothing to supply more fundamental than vulgar thinking or as it were preliminary to it They are simply elaborations of it they accept its pre suppositions and carry on its ordinary processes A pretence on the philosopher s part that he could get behind or below human thinking that he could underpin so to speak his own childhood and the inherent conventions of daily thought would be pure imposture A philosopher can of course investigate the history of knowledge he can analyse its method and point out its assumptions but he cannot know by other authority than that which the vulgar know by nor can his knowledge begin with other unheard of objects or deploy itself in advance over an esoteric field Every deeper investigation presupposes ordinary perception and uses some at least of its data Every possible discovery extends human knowledge None can base human knowledge anew on a deeper foundation or prefix an ante experimental episode to experience We may construct a theory as disintegrating as we please about the dialectical or empirical conditions of the experience given we may disclose its logical stratification or physical antecedents but every idea and principle used in such a theory must be borrowed from current knowledge as it happens to lie in the philosopher s mind Sidenote Role of criticism If these speculative adventures do not turn out well the scientific man is free to turn about and become the critic and satirist of his foiled ambitions He may exhaust scepticism and withdraw into the citadel of immediate feeling yielding bastion after bastion to the assaults of doubt When he is at last perfectly safe from error and reduced to speechless sensibility he will perceive however that he is also washed clean of every practical belief he would declare himself universally ignorant but for a doubt whether there be really anything to know This metaphysical exercise is simply one of those fallings from us vanishings blank misgivings of a creature moving about in worlds not realised which may visit any child So long as the suspension of judgment lasts knowledge is surely not increased but when we remember that the enemy to whom we have surrendered is but a ghost of our own evoking we easily reoccupy the lost ground and fall back into an ordinary posture of belief and expectation This recovered faith has no new evidences to rest on We simply stand where we stood before we began to philosophise only with a better knowledge of the lines we are holding and perhaps with less inclination to give them up again for no better reason than the undoubted fact that in a speculative sense it is always possible to renounce them Science then is the attentive consideration of common experience it is common knowledge extended and refined Its validity is of the same order as that of ordinary perception memory and understanding Its test is found like theirs in actual intuition which sometimes consists in perception and sometimes in intent The flight of science is merely longer from perception to perception and its deduction more accurate of meaning from meaning and purpose from purpose It generates in the mind for each vulgar observation a whole brood of suggestions hypotheses and inferences The sciences bestow as is right and fitting infinite pains upon that experience which in their absence would drift by unchallenged or misunderstood They take note infer and prophesy They compare prophecy with event and altogether they supply so intent are they on reality every imaginable background and extension for the present dream FOOTNOTES Footnote A For instance in Plato s Parmenides where it is shown that the ideas are not in the mind We may gather from what is there said that the ideas cannot be identified with any embodiment of them however perfect since an idea means a nature common to all its possible embodiments and remains always outside of them This is what Plato meant by saying that the ideas lay apart from phenomena and were what they were in and for themselves They were mere forms and not as a materialised Platonism afterward fancied images in the mind of some psychological deity The gods doubtless know the ideas as Plato tells us in the same place these are the common object of their thought and of ours hence they are not anybody s thinking process which of course would be in flux and phenomenal Only by being ideal i e by being a goal of intellectual energy and no part of sensuous existence can a term be common to various minds and serve to make their deliverances pertinent to one another That truth is no existence might also be proved as follows Suppose that nothing existed or if critics carp at that phrase that a universe did not exist It would then be true that all existences were wanting yet this truth itself would endure therefore truth is not an existence An attempt might be made to reverse this argument by saying that since it would still be true that nothing existed the supposition is self contradictory for the truth would be or exist in any case Truth would thus be turned into an opinion supposed to subsist eternally in the ether The argument however is a bad sophism because it falsifies the intent of the terms used Somebody s opinion is not what is meant by the truth since every opinion however long lived may be false Furthermore the notion that it might have been true that nothing existed is a perfectly clear notion The nature of dialectic is entirely corrupted when sincerity is lost No intent can be self contradictory since it fixes its own object but a man may easily contradict himself by wavering between one intent and another CHAPTER II HISTORY Sidenote History an artificial memory The least artificial extension of common knowledge is history Personal recollection supplies many an anecdote anecdotes collected and freely commented upon make up memoirs and memoirs happily combined make not the least interesting sort of history When a man recalls any episode in his career describes the men that flourished in his youth or laments the changes that have since taken place he is an informal historian He would become one in a formal and technical sense if he supplemented and controlled his memory by ransacking papers and taking elaborate pains to gather evidence on the events he wished to relate This systematic investigation especially when it goes back to first sources widens the basis for imaginative reconstruction It buttresses somewhat the frail body of casual facts that in the first instance may have engaged an individual s attention History is nothing but assisted and recorded memory It might almost be said to be no science at all if memory and faith in memory were not what science necessarily rests on In order to sift evidence we must rely on some witness and we must trust experience before we proceed to expand it The line between what is known scientifically and what has to be assumed in order to support that knowledge is impossible to draw Memory itself is an internal rumour and when to this hearsay within the mind we add the falsified echoes that reach us from others we have but a shifting and unseizable basis to build upon The picture we frame of the past changes continually and grows every day less similar to the original experience which it purports to describe Sidenote Second sight requires control It is true that memory sometimes as in a vision seems to raise the curtain upon the past and restore it to us in its pristine reality We may imagine at such moments experience can never really perish but though hidden by chance from the roving eye endures eternally in some spiritual sphere Such bodily recovery of the past however like other telepathic visions can never prove its own truth A lapse into by gone perception a sense of living the past over with all its vivid minutiae and trivial concomitants might involve no true repetition of anything that had previously existed It might be a fresh experience altogether The sense of knowing constitutes only a working presumption for experiment to start with until corroboration comes that presumption can claim no respect from the outsider Sidenote Nature the theme common to various memories While memory remains a private presumption therefore it can be compared with nothing else that might test its veracity Only when memory is expressed and in the common field of expression finds itself corroborated by another memory does it rise somewhat in dignity and approach scientific knowledge Two presumptions when they coincide make a double assurance While memory then is the basis of all historical knowledge it is not called history until it enters a field where it can be supported or corrected by evidence This field is that natural world which all experiences in so far as they are rational envisage together Assertions relating to events in that world can corroborate or contradict one another something that would be impossible if each memory like the plot of a novel moved in a sphere of its own For memory to meet memory the two must present objects which are similar or continuous then they can corroborate or correct each other and help to fix the order of events as they really happened that is as they happened independently of what either memory may chance to represent Thus even the most miraculous and direct recovery of the past needs corroboration if it is to be systematically credited but to receive corroboration it must refer to some event in nature in that common world in space and time to which other memories and perceptions may refer also In becoming history therefore memory becomes a portion of natural science Its assertions are such that any natural science may conceivably support or contradict them Sidenote Growth of legend Nature and its transformations however form too serried and complicated a system for our wayward minds to dominate if left to their spontaneous workings Whatever is remembered or conceived is at first vaguely believed to have its place in the natural order all myth and fable being originally localised within the confines of the material world and made to pass for a part of early history The method by which knowledge of the past is preserved is so subject to imaginative influence that it cannot avail to exclude from history anything that the imagination may supply In the growth of legend a dramatic rhythm becomes more and more marked What falls in with this rhythm is reproduced and accentuated whenever the train of memory is started anew The absence of such cadences would leave a sensible gap a gap which the momentum of ideation is quick to fill up with some appropriate image Whatever on the other hand cannot be incorporated into the dominant round of fancies is consigned more and more to oblivion This consolidation of legend is not intentional It is ingenuous and for the most part inevitable When we muse about our own past we are conscious of no effort to give it dramatic unity on the contrary the excitement and interest of the process consist in seeming to discover the hidden eloquence and meaning of the events themselves When a man of experience narrates the wonders he has seen we listen with a certain awe and believe in him for his miracles as we believe in our own memory for its arts A bard s mechanical and ritualistic habits usually put all judgment on his own part to sleep while the sanctity attributed to the tale as it becomes automatically more impressive precludes tinkering with it intentionally Especially the allegories and marvels with which early history is adorned are not ordinarily invented with malice prepense They are rather discovered in the mind like a foundling between night and morning They are divinely vouchsafed Each time the tale is retold it suffers a variation which is not challenged since it is memory itself that has varied The change is discoverable only if some record of the narrative in its former guise or some physical memorial of the event related survives to be confronted with the modified version The modified version itself can make no comparisons It merely inherits the name and authority of its ancestor The innocent poet believes his own lies Legends consequently acquire a considerable eloquence and dramatic force These beauties accrue spontaneously because rhythm and ideal pertinence in which poetic merit largely lies are natural formative principles for speech and memory As symmetry in material structures is a ground for strength and hills by erosion are worn to pyramids so it is in thoughts Yet the stability attained is not absolute but only such stability as the circumstances require Dramatic effect is not everywhere achieved nor is it missed by the narrator where it is wanting so that even the oldest and best pruned legends are full of irrelevant survivals contradictions and scraps of nonsense These literary blemishes are like embedded fossils and tell of facts which the mechanism of reproduction for some casual reason has not obliterated The recorder of verbal tradition religiously sets down its inconsistencies and leaves in the transfigured chronicle many tell tale incidents and remarks which like atrophied organs in an animal body reveal its gradual formation Art and a deliberate pursuit of unction or beauty would have thrown over this baggage The automatic and pious minstrel carries it with him to the end Sidenote No history without documents For these reasons there can be no serious history until there are archives and preserved records although sometimes a man in a privileged position may compose interesting essays on the events and persons of his own time as his personal experience has presented them to him Archives and records moreover do not absolve a speculative historian from paying the same toll to the dramatic unities and making the same concessions to the laws of perspective which in the absence of documents turn tradition so soon into epic poetry The principle that elicits histories out of records is the same that breeds legends out of remembered events In both cases the facts are automatically foreshortened and made to cluster as it were providentially about a chosen interest The historian s politics philosophy or romantic imagination furnishes a vital nucleus for reflection All that falls within that particular vortex is included in the mental picture the rest is passed over and tends to drop out of sight It is not possible to say nor to think everything at once and the private interest which guides a man in selecting his materials imposes itself inevitably on the events he relates and especially on their grouping and significance History is always written wrong and so always needs to be rewritten The conditions of expression and even of memory dragoon the facts and put a false front on diffuse experience What is interesting is brought forward as if it had been central and efficacious in the march of events and harmonies are turned into causes Kings and generals are endowed with motives appropriate to what the historian values in their actions plans are imputed to them prophetic of their actual achievements while the thoughts that really preoccupied them remain buried in absolute oblivion Such falsification is inevitable and an honest historian is guilty of it only against his will He would wish as he loves the truth to see and to render it entire But the limits of his book and of his knowledge force him to be partial It is only a very great mind seasoned by large wisdom that can lend such an accent and such a carrying power to a few facts as to make them representative of all reality Sidenote The aim is truth Some historians indeed are so frankly partisan or cynical that they avowedly write history with a view to effect either political or literary Moralising historians belong to this school as well as those philosophers who worship evolution They sketch every situation with malice and twist it as if it were an argument to bring out a point much as fashionable portrait painters sometimes surcharge the characteristic in order to make a bold effect at a minimum expense of time and devotion And yet the truly memorable aspect of a man is that which he wears in the sunlight of common day with all his generic humanity upon him His most interesting phase is not that which he might assume under the lime light of satirical or literary comparisons The characteristic is after all the inessential It marks a peripheral variation in the honest and sturdy lump To catch only the heartless shimmer of individuality is to paint a costume without the body that supports it Therefore a broad and noble historian sets down all within his apperception His literary interests are forgotten he is wholly devoted to expressing the passions of the dead His ideal emanating from his function and chosen for no extraneous reason is to make his heroes think and act as they really thought and acted in the world Nevertheless the opposite happens sometimes to a marked and even scandalous degree As legend becomes in a few generations preposterous myth so history after a few rehandlings and condensations becomes unblushing theory Now theory when we use the word for a schema of things relations and not for contemplation of them in their detail and fulness is an expedient to cover ignorance and remedy confusion The function of history if it could be thoroughly fulfilled would be to render theory unnecessary Did we possess a record of all geological changes since the creation we should need no geological theory to suggest to us what those changes must have been Hypothesis is like the rule of three it comes into play only when one of the terms is unknown and needs to be inferred from those which are given The ideal historian since he would know all the facts would need no hypotheses and since he would imagine and hold all events together in their actual juxtapositions he would need no classifications The intentions acts and antecedents of every mortal would be seen in their precise places with no imputed qualities or scope and when those intentions had been in fact fulfilled the fulfilments too would occupy their modest position in the rank and file of marching existence To omniscience the idea of cause and effect would be unthinkable If all things were perceived together and company existed for thought as they actually flow through being on one flat phenomenal level what sense would there be in saying that one element had compelled another to appear The relation of cause is an instrument necessary to thought only when thought is guided by presumption We say If this thing had happened that other thing would have followed a hypothesis which would lapse and become unmeaning had we always known all the facts For no supposition contrary to fact would then have entered discourse Sidenote Indirect methods of attaining it This ideal of direct omniscience is however impossible to attain not merely accidental frailties but the very nature of things stands in the way Experience cannot be suspended or sustained in being because its very nucleus is mobile and in shifting cannot retain its past phases bodily but only at best some trace or representation of them Memory itself is an expedient by which what is hopelessly lost in its totality may at least be partly kept in its beauty or significance and experience can be enlarged in no other way than by carrying into the moving present the lesson and transmitted habit of much that is past History is naturally reduced to similar indirect methods of recovering what has lapsed The historian s object may be to bring the past again before the mind in all its living reality but in pursuing that object he is obliged to appeal to inference to generalisation and to dramatic fancy We may conveniently distinguish in history as it is perforce written by men three distinct elements which we may call historical investigation historical theory and historical romance Sidenote Historical research a part of physics Historical investigation is the natural science of the past The circumstance that its documents are usually literary may somewhat disguise the physical character and the physical principles of this science but when a man wishes to discover what really happened at a given moment even if the event were somebody s thought he has to read his sources not for what they say but for what they imply In other words the witnesses cannot be allowed merely to speak for themselves after the gossiping fashion familiar in Herodotus their testimony has to be interpreted according to the laws of evidence The past needs to be reconstructed out of reports as in geology or archaeology it needs to be reconstructed out of stratifications and ruins A man s memory or the report in a newspaper is a fact justifying certain inferences about its probable causes according to laws which such phenomena betray in the present when they are closely scrutinised This reconstruction is often very difficult and sometimes all that can be established in the end is merely that the tradition before us is certainly false somewhat as a perplexed geologist might venture on no conclusion except that the state of the earth s crust was once very different from what it is now Sidenote Verification here indirect A natural science dealing with the past labours under the disadvantage of not being able to appeal to experiment The facts it terminates upon cannot be recovered so that they may verify in sense the hypothesis that had inferred them The hypothesis can be tested only by current events it is then turned back upon the past to give assurance of facts which themselves are hypothetical and remain hanging as it were to the loose end of the hypothesis itself A hypothetical fact is a most dangerous creature since it lives on the credit of a theory which in turn would be bankrupt if the fact should fail Inferred past facts are more deceptive than facts prophesied because while the risk of error in the inference is the same there is no possibility of discovering that error and the historian while really as speculative as the prophet can never be found out Most facts known to man however are reached by inference and their reality may be wisely assumed so long as the principle by which they are inferred when it is applied in the present finds complete and constant verification Presumptions involved in memory and tradition give the first hypothetical facts we count upon the relations which these first facts betray supply the laws by which facts are to be concatenated and these laws may then be used to pass from the first hypothetical facts to hypothetical facts of a second order forming a background and congruous extension to those originally assumed This expansion of discursive science can go on for ever unless indeed the principles of inference employed in it involve some present existence such as a skeleton in a given tomb which direct experience fails to verify Then the theory itself is disproved and the whole galaxy of hypothetical facts which clustered about it forfeit their credibility Sidenote Futile ideal to survey all facts Historical investigation has for its aim to fix the order and character of events throughout past time in all places The task is frankly superhuman because no block of real existence with its infinitesimal detail can be recorded nor if somehow recorded could it be dominated by the mind and to carry on a survey of this social continuum ad infinitum would multiply the difficulty The task might also be called infrahuman because the sort of omniscience which such complete historical science would achieve would merely furnish materials for intelligence it would be inferior to intelligence itself There are many things which as Aristotle says it is better not to know than to know namely those things which do not count in controlling the mind s fortunes nor enter into its ideal expression Such is the whole flux of immediate experience in other minds or in one s own past and just as it is better to forget than to remember a nightmare or the by gone sensations of sea sickness so it is better not to conceive the sensuous pulp of alien experience something infinite in amount and insignificant in character An attempt to rehearse the inner life of everybody that has ever lived would be no rational endeavour Instead of lifting the historian above the world and making him the most consummate of creatures it would flatten his mind out into a passive after image of diffuse existence with all its horrible blindness strain and monotony Reason is not come to repeat the universe but to fulfil it Besides a complete survey of events would perforce register all changes that have taken place in matter since time began the fields of geology astronomy palaeontology and archaeology being all in a sense included in history Such learning would dissolve thought in a vertigo if it had not already perished of boredom Historical research is accordingly a servile science which may enter the Life of Reason to perform there some incidental service but which ought to lapse as soon as that service is performed Sidenote Historical theory The profit of studying history lies in something else than in a dead knowledge of what happens to have happened A seductive alternative might be to say that the profit of it lies in understanding what has happened in perceiving the principles and laws that govern social evolution or the meaning which events have We are hereby launched upon a region of physico ethical speculation where any man with a genius for quick generalisation can swim at ease To find the one great cause why Borne fell especially if no one has ever thought of it before or to expound the true import of the French Revolution or to formulate in limpid sentences the essence of Greek culture what could be more tempting or more purely literary It would ill become the author of this book to decry allegorical expressions or a cavalierlike fashion of dismissing whole periods and tendencies with a verbal antithesis We must have exercises in apperception a work of imagination must be taken imaginatively and a landscape painter must be suffered to be at his own risk as impressionistic as he will If Raphael when he was designing the School of Athens had said to himself that Aristotle should point down to a fact and Plato up to a meaning or when designing the Disputa had conceived that the proudest of intellects weary of argument and learning should throw down his books and turn to revelation for guidance there would have been much historical pertinence in those conceptions yet the figures would have been allegorical contracting into a decorative design events that had been dispersed through centuries and emotions that had only cropped up here and there with all manner of variations and alloys when the particular natural situation had made them inevitable So the Renaissance might be spoken of as a person and the Reformation as her step sister and something might be added about the troubles of their home life but would it be needful in that case to enter a warning that these units were verbal merely and that the phenomena and the forces really at work had been multitudinous and infinitesimal Sidenote It is arbitrary In fine historical terms mark merely rhetorical unities which have no dynamic cohesion and there are no historical laws which are not at bottom physical like the laws of habit those expressions of Newton s first law of motion An essayist may play with historical apperception as long as he will and always find something new to say discovering the ideal nerve and issue of a movement in a different aspect of the facts The truly proportionate constant efficacious relations between things will remain material Physical causes traverse the moral units at which history stops determining their force and duration and the order so irrelevant to intent in which they succeed one another Even the single man s life and character have subterranean sources how should the outer expression and influence of that character have sources more superficial than its own Yet we cannot trace mechanical necessity down to the more stable units composing a personal mechanism and much less therefore to those composing a complex social evolution We accordingly translate the necessity obviously lurking under life s commonplace yet unaccountable shocks into verbal principles names for general impressive results that play some role in our ideal philosophy Each of these idols of the theatre is visible only on a single stage and to duly predisposed spectators The next passion affected will throw a differently coloured calcium light on the same pageant and there will be no end of rival evolutions and incompatible ideal principles crossing one another at every interesting event Such a manipulation of history when made by persons who underestimate their imaginative powers ends in asserting that events have directed themselves prophetically upon the interests which they arouse Apart from the magic involved and the mockery of all science there is a difficulty here which even a dramatic idealist ought to feel The interests affected are themselves many and contrary If history is to be understood teleologically which of all the possible ends it might be pursuing shall we think really endowed with regressive influence and responsible for the movement that is going to realise it Did Columbus for instance discover America so that George Washington might exist and that some day football and the Church of England may prevail throughout the world Or was it as has been seriously maintained in order that the converted Indians of South America might console Saint Peter for the defection of the British and Germans Or was America as Hegel believed ideally superfluous the absolute having become self conscious enough already in Prussia Or shall we say that the real goal is at an infinite distance and unimaginable by us and useless therefore for understanding anything In truth whatever plausibility the providential view of a given occurrence may have is dependent on the curious limitation and selfishness of the observer s estimations Sheep are providentially designed for men but why not also for wolves and men for worms and microbes If the historian is willing to accept such a suggestion and to become a blind worshipper of success applauding every issue however lamentable for humanity and calling it admirable tragedy he may seem for a while to save his theory by making it mystical yet presently this last illusion will be dissipated when he loses his way in the maze and finds that all victors perish in their turn and everything if you look far enough falls back into the inexorable vortex This is the sort of observation that the Indian sages made long ago it is what renders their philosophy for all its practical impotence such an irrefragable record of experience such a superior definitive perception of the flux Beside it our progresses of two centuries and our philosophies of history embracing one quarter of the earth for three thousand years seem puerile vistas indeed Shall all eternity and all existence be for the sake of what is happening here to day and to me Shall we strive manfully to the top of this particular wave on the ground that its foam is the culmination of all things for ever There is a sense of course in which definite political plans and moral aspirations may well be fulfilled by events Our ancestors sharing and anticipating our natures may have had in many respects our actual interests in view as we may have those of posterity Such ideal company operation extends far where primary interests are concerned it is rarer and more qualified where a fine and fragile organisation is required to support the common spiritual life Even in these cases the aim pursued and attained is not the force that operates since the result achieved had many other conditions besides the worker s intent and that intent itself had causes which it knew nothing of Every historical force pompously appealed to breaks up on inspection into a cataract of miscellaneous natural processes and minute particular causes It breaks into its mechanical constituents and proves to have been nothing but an effet d ensemble produced on a mind whose habits and categories are essentially rhetorical Sidenote A moral critique of the past is possible This sort of false history or philosophy of history might be purified like so many other things by self knowledge If the philosopher in reviewing events confessed that he was scrutinising them in order to abstract from them whatever tended to illustrate his own ideals as he might look over a crowd to find his friends the operation would become a perfectly legitimate one The events themselves would be left for scientific inference to discover where credible reports did not testify to them directly and the causes of events would be left to some theory of natural evolution to be stated according to the degree of knowledge attained in terms more and more exact and mechanical In the presence of the past so defined imagination and will however would not abdicate their rights and a sort of retrospective politics an estimate of events in reference to the moral ideal which they embodied or betrayed might supervene upon positive history This estimate of evolution might well be called a philosophy of history since it would be a higher operation performed on the results of natural science to give a needful basis and illustration to the ideal The present work is an essay in that direction Sidenote How it might be just The ideal which in such a review would serve as the touchstone for estimation if it were an enlightened ideal would recognise its own natural basis and therefore would also recognise that under other conditions other ideals no less legitimate may have arisen and may have been made the standard for a different judgment on the world Historical investigation were its resources adequate would reveal to us what these various ideals have been Every animal has his own and whenever individuals or nations have become reflective they have known how to give articulate expression to theirs That all these ideals could not have been realised in turn or together is an immense misfortune the irremediable half tragedy of life by which we also suffer In estimating the measure of success achieved anywhere a liberal historian who does not wish to be bluntly irrational will of course estimate it from all these points of view considering all real interests affected in so far as he can appreciate them This is what is meant by putting the standard of value not in some arbitrary personal dogma but in a variegated omnipresent happiness It is by no means requisite therefore in disentangling the Life of Reason to foresee what ultimate form the good might some day take much less to make the purposes of the philosopher himself his time or his nation the test of all excellence This test is the perpetual concomitant ideal of the life it is applied to As all could not be well in the world if my own purposes were defeated so the general excellence of things would be heightened if other men s purposes also had been fulfilled Each will is a true centre for universal estimation As each will therefore comes to expression real and irreversible values are introduced into the world and the historian in estimating what has been hitherto achieved needs to make himself the spokesman for all past aspirations If the Egyptian poets sang well though that conduces not at all to our advantage and though all those songs are now dumb the Life of Reason was thereby increased once for all in pith and volume Brief erratic experiments made in living if they were somewhat successful in their day remain successes always and this is the only kind of success that in the end can be achieved at all The philosopher that looks for what is good in history and measures the past by the scale of reason need be no impertinent dogmatist on that account Reason would not be reason but passion if it did not make all passions in all creatures constituents of its own authority The judgments it passes on existence are only the judgments which existence so far has passed on itself and these are indelible and have their proportionate weight though others of many different types may surround or succeed them Sidenote Transition to historical romance To inquire what everybody has thought about the world and into what strange shapes every passionate dream would fain have transformed existence might be merely a part of historical investigation These facts of preference and estimation might be made to stand side by side with all other facts in that absolute physical order which the universe must somehow possess In the reference book of science they would all find their page and line But it is not for the sake of making vain knowledge complete that historians are apt to linger over heroic episodes and commanding characters in the world s annals It is not even in the hope of discovering just to what extent and in how many directions experience has been a tragedy The mathematical balance of failure and success even if it could be drawn with accuracy would not be a truth of moral importance since whatever that balance might be for the world at large success and benefit here from the living point of view would be equally valid and delightful and however good or however bad the universe may be it is always worth while to make it better What engages the historian in the reconstruction of moral life such as the past contained is that he finds in that life many an illustration of his own ideals or even a necessary stimulus in defining what his ideals are Where his admiration and his sympathy are awakened he sees noble aims and great achievements worthy of being minutely studied and brought vividly before later generations Very probably he will be led by moral affinities with certain phases of the past to attribute to those phases in their abstraction and by virtue of their moral dignity a material efficacy which they did not really have and his interest in history s moral will make him turn history itself into a fable This abuse may be abated however by having recourse to impartial historical investigation that will restore to the hero all his circumstantial impotence and to the glorious event all its insignificant causes Certain men and certain episodes will retain notwithstanding their intrinsic nobility and the historian who is often a politician and a poet rather than a man of science will dwell on those noble things so as to quicken his own sense for greatness and to burnish in his soul ideals that may have remained obscure for want of scrutiny or may have been tarnished by too much contact with a sordid world Sidenote Possibility of genuine epics History so conceived has the function of epic or dramatic poetry The moral life represented may actually have been lived through but that circumstance is incidental merely and what makes the story worth telling is its pertinence to the political or emotional life of the present To revive past moral experience is indeed wellnigh impossible unless the living will can still covet or dread the same issues historical romance cannot be truthful or interesting when profound changes have taken place in human nature The reported acts and sentiments of early peoples lose their tragic dignity in our eyes when they lose their pertinence to our own aims So that a recital of history with an eye to its dramatic values is possible only when that history is so to speak our own or when we assimilate it to ours by poetic license The various functions of history have been generally carried on simultaneously and with little consciousness of their profound diversity Since historical criticism made its appearance the romantic interest in the past far from abating has fed eagerly on all the material incidents and private gossip of remote times This sort of petty historical drama has reflected contemporary interests which have centred so largely in material possessions and personal careers while at the same time it has kept pace with the knowledge of minutiae attained by archaeology When historical investigation has reached its limits a period of ideal reconstruction may very likely set in Indeed were it possible to collect in archives exhaustive accounts of everything that has ever happened so that the curious man might always be informed on any point of fact that interested him historical imagination might grow free again in its movements Not being suspected of wishing to distort facts which could so easily be pointed to it might become more conscious of its own moral function and it might turn unblushingly to what was important and inspiring in order to put it with dramatic force before the mind Such a treatment of history would reinstate that epic and tragic poetry which has become obsolete it might well be written in verse and would at any rate be frankly imaginative it might furnish a sort of ritual with scientific and political sanctions for public feasts Tragedies and epics are such only in name if they do not deal with the highest interests and destinies of a people and they could hardly deal with such ideals in an authoritative and definite way unless they found them illustrated in that people s traditions Sidenote Literal truth abandoned Historic romance is a work of art not of science and its fidelity to past fact is only an expedient often an excellent and easy one for striking the key note of present ideals The insight attained even when it is true insight into what some one else felt in some other age draws its force and sublimity from current passions passions potential in the auditor s soul Mary Queen of Scots for instance doubtless repeated in many a fancied dialogue with Queen Elizabeth the very words that Schiller puts into her mouth in the central scene of his play Denn ich bin Euer Koenig Yet the dramatic force of that expression its audacious substitution of ideals for facts depends entirely on the scope which we lend it Different actors and different readers would interpret it differently Some might see in it nothing but a sally in a woman s quarrel reading it with the accent of mere spite and irritation Then the tragedy not perhaps without historic truth would be reduced to a loud comedy Other interpreters might find in the phrase the whole feudal system all the chivalry legality and foolishness of the Middle Ages Then the drama would become more interesting and the poor queen s cry while that of a mind sophisticated and fanatical would have great pathos and keenness To reach sublimity however that moment would have to epitomise ideals which we deeply respected We should have to believe in the sanctity of canon law and in the divine right of primogeniture That a woman may have been very unhappy or that a state may have been held together by personal allegiance does not raise the fate of either to the tragic plane unless laws that are not of to day nor yesterday aspirations native to the heart shine through those legendary misfortunes It would matter nothing to the excellence of Schiller s drama which of these interpretations might have been made by Mary Stuart herself at any given moment doubtless her attitude toward her rival was coloured on different occasions by varying degrees of political insight and moral fervour The successful historical poet would be he who caught the most significant attitude which a person in that position could possibly have assumed and his Mary Stuart whether accidentally resembling the real woman or not would be essentially a mythical person So Electra and Antigone and Helen of Troy are tragic figures absolved from historical accuracy although possibly if the personages of heroic times were known to us we might find that our highest imagination had been anticipated in their consciousness Sidenote History exists to be transcended Of the three parts into which the pursuit of history may be divided investigation theory and story telling not one attains ideal finality Investigation is merely useful because its intrinsic ideal to know every detail of everything is not rational and its acceptable function can only be to offer accurate information upon such points as are worth knowing for some ulterior reason Historical theory in turn is a falsification of causes since no causes are other than mechanical it is an arbitrary foreshortening of physics and it dissolves in the presence either of adequate knowledge or of clear ideals Finally historical romance passes as it grows mature into epics and tragedies where the moral imagination disengages itself from all allegiance to particular past facts Thus history proves to be an imperfect field for the exercise of reason it is a provisional discipline its values with the mind s progress would empty into higher activities The function of history is to lend materials to politics and to poetry These arts need to dominate past events the better to dominate the present situation and the ideal one A good book of history is one that helps the statesman to formulate and to carry out his plans or that helps the tragic poet to conceive what is most glorious in human destiny Such a book as knowledge and ignorance are now mingled will have to borrow something from each of the methods by which history is commonly pursued Investigation will be necessary since the needful facts are not all indubitably known theory will be necessary too so that those facts may be conceived in their pertinence to public interests and the latter may thereby be clarified and romance will not be wholly excluded because the various activities of the mind about the same matter cannot be divided altogether and a dramatic treatment is often useful in summarising a situation when all the elements of it cannot be summoned up in detail before the mind Sidenote Its great role Fragmentary arbitrary and insecure as historical conceptions must remain they are nevertheless highly important In human consciousness the indispensable is in inverse ratio to the demonstrable Sense is the foundation of everything Without sense memory would be both false and useless Yet memory rather than sense is knowledge in the pregnant acceptation of the word for in sense object and process are hardly distinguished whereas in memory significance inheres in the datum and the present vouches for the absent Similarly history which is derived from memory is superior to it for while it merely extends memory artificially it shows a higher logical development than memory has and is riper for ideal uses Trivial and useless matter has dropped out Inference has gone a step farther thought is more largely representative and testimony conveyed by the reports of others or found in monuments leads the speculative mind to infer events that must have filled the remotest ages This information is not passive or idle knowledge it truly informs or shapes the mind giving it new aptitudes As an efficacious memory modifies instinct by levelling it with a wider survey of the situation so a memory of what human experience has been a sense of what it is likely to be under specific circumstances gives the will a new basis What politics or any large drama deals with is a will cast into historic moulds an imagination busy with what we call great interests Great interests are a gift which history makes to the heart A barbarian is no less subject to the past than is the civic man who knows what his past is and means to be loyal to it but the barbarian for want of a trans personal memory crawls among superstitions which he cannot understand or revoke and among persons whom he may hate or love but whom he can never think of raising to a higher plane to the level of a purer happiness The whole dignity of human endeavour is thus bound up with historic issues and as conscience needs to be controlled by experience if it is to become rational so personal experience itself needs to be enlarged ideally if the failures and successes it reports are to touch impersonal interests CHAPTER III MECHANISM Sidenote Recurrent forms in nature A retrospect over human experience if a little extended can hardly fail to come upon many interesting recurrences The seasons make their round and the generations of men like the forest leaves repeat their career In this its finer texture history undoubtedly repeats itself A study of it in registering so many recurrences leads to a description of habit or to natural history To observe a recurrence is to divine a mechanism It is to analyse a phenomenon distinguishing its form which alone recurs from its existence which is irrevocable and that the flux of phenomena should turn out on closer inspection to be composed of a multitude of recurring forms regularly interwoven is the ideal of mechanism The forms taken ideally and in themselves are what reflection first rescues from the flux and makes a science of they constitute that world of eternal relations with which dialectic is conversant To note here and there some passing illustration of these forms is one way of studying experience The observer the poet the historian merely define what they see But these incidental illustrations of form called by Plato phenomena may have a method in their comings and goings and this method may in turn be definable It will be a new sort of constant illustrated in the flux and this we call a law If events could be reduced to a number of constant forms moving in a constant medium according to a constant law a maximum of constancy would be introduced into the flux which would thereby be proved to be mechanical The form of events abstracted from their material presence becomes a general mould to which we tend to assimilate new observations Whatever in particular instances may contravene the accredited rule we attribute without a qualm to unknown variations in the circumstances thus saving our faith in order at all hazards and appealing to investigation to justify the same Only when another rule suggests itself which leaves a smaller margin unaccounted for in the phenomena do we give up our first generalisation Not even the rudest superstition can be criticised or dislodged scientifically save by another general rule more exact and trustworthy than the superstition The scepticism which comes from distrust of abstraction and disgust with reckoning of any sort is not a scientific force it is an intellectual weakness Generalities are indeed essential to understanding which is apt to impose them hastily upon particulars Confirmation is not needed to create prejudice It suffices that a vivid impression should once have cut its way into the mind and settled there in a fertile soil it will entwine itself at once with its chance neighbours and these adventitious relations will pass henceforth for a part of the fact Repetition however is a good means of making or keeping impressions vivid and almost the only means of keeping them unchanged Prejudices however refractory to new evidence evolve inwardly of themselves The mental soil in which they lie is in a continual ferment and their very vitality will extend their scope and change their application Generalisations therefore when based on a single instance will soon forget it and shift their ground as unchecked words shift their meaning But when a phenomenon actually recurs the generalisations founded on it are reinforced and kept identical and prejudices so sustained by events make man s knowledge of nature Sidenote Their discovery makes the flux calculable Natural science consists of general ideas which look for verification in events and which find it The particular instance once noted is thrown aside like a squeezed orange its significance in establishing some law having once been extracted Science by this flight into the general lends immediate experience an interest and scope which its parts taken blindly could never possess since if we remained sunk in the moments of existence and never abstracted their character from their presence we should never know that they had any relation to one another We should feel their incubus without being able to distinguish their dignities or to give them names By analysing what we find and abstracting what recurs from its many vain incidents we can discover a sustained structure within which enables us to foretell what we may find in future Science thus articulates experience and reveals its skeleton Skeletons are not things particularly congenial to poets unless it be for the sake of having something truly horrible to shudder at and to frighten children with and so a certain school of philosophers exhaust their rhetoric in convincing us that the objects known to science are artificial and dead while the living reality is infinitely rich and absolutely unutterable This is merely an ungracious way of describing the office of thought and bearing witness to its necessity A body is none the worse for having some bones in it even if they are not all visible on the surface They are certainly not the whole man who nevertheless runs and leaps by their leverage and smooth turning in their sockets and a surgeon s studies in dead anatomy help him excellently to set a living joint The abstractions of science are extractions of truths Truths cannot of themselves constitute existence with its irrational concentration in time place and person its hopeless flux and its vital exuberance but they can be true of existence they can disclose that structure by which its parts cohere materially and become ideally inferable from one another Sidenote Looser principles tried first Science becomes demonstrable in proportion as it becomes abstract It becomes in the same measure applicable and useful as mathematics witnesses whenever the abstraction is judiciously made and has seized the profounder structural features in the phenomenon These features are often hard for human eyes to discern buried as they may be in the internal infinitesimal texture of things Things accordingly seem to move on the world s stage in an unaccountable fashion and to betray magic affinities to what is separated from them by apparent chasms The types of relation which the mind may observe are multifarious Any chance conjunction any incidental harmony will start a hypothesis about the nature of the universe and be the parent image of a whole system of philosophy In self indulgent minds most of these standard images are dramatic and the cue men follow in unravelling experience is that offered by some success or failure of their own The sanguine having once found a pearl in a dunghill feel a glorious assurance that the world s true secret is that everything in the end is ordered for everybody s benefit and that is optimism The atrabilious being ill at ease with themselves see the workings everywhere of insidious sin and conceive that the world is a dangerous place of trial A somewhat more observant intellect may decide that what exists is a certain number of definite natures each striving to preserve and express itself and in such language we still commonly read political events and our friend s actions At the dawn of science a Thales observing the ways and the conditions of things somewhat more subtly will notice that rain something quite adventitious to the fields is what covers them with verdure that the slime breeds life that a liquid will freeze to stone and melt to air and his shrewd conclusion will be that everything is water in one disguise or another It is only after long accumulated observation that we can reach any exact law of nature and this law we hardly think of applying to living things These have not yet revealed the secret of their structure and clear insight is vouchsafed us only in such regions as that of mathematical physics where cogency in the ideal system is combined with adequacy to explain the phenomena Sidenote Mechanism for the most part hidden These exact sciences cover in the gross the field in which human life appears the antecedents of this life and its instruments To a speculative mind that had retained an ingenuous sense of nature s inexhaustible resources and of man s essential continuity with other natural things there could be no ground for doubting that similar principles could they be traced in detail would be seen to preside over all man s action and passion A thousand indications drawn from introspection and from history would be found to confirm this speculative presumption It is not only earthquakes and floods summer and winter that bring human musings sharply to book Love and ambition are unmistakable blossomings of material forces and the more intense and poetical a man s sense is of his spiritual condition the more loudly will he proclaim his utter dependence on nature and the identity of the moving principle in him and in her Mankind and all its works are undeniably subject to gravity and to the law of projectiles yet what is true of these phenomena in bulk seems to a superficial observation not to be true of them in detail and a person may imagine that he subverts all the laws of physics whenever he wags his tongue Only in inorganic matter is the ruling mechanism open to human inspection here changes may be seen to be proportionate to the elements and situation in which they occur Habit here seems perfectly steady and is called necessity since the observer is able to deduce it unequivocally from given properties in the body and in the external bodies acting upon it In the parts of nature which we call living and to which we impute consciousness habit though it be fatal enough is not so exactly measurable and perspicuous Physics cannot account for that minute motion and pullulation in the earth s crust of which human affairs are a portion Human affairs have to be surveyed under categories lying closer to those employed in memory and legend These looser categories are of every sort grammatical moral magical and there is no knowing when any of them will apply or in what measure Between the matters covered by the exact sciences and vulgar experience there remains accordingly a wide and nebulous gulf Where we cannot see the mechanism involved in what happens we have to be satisfied with an empirical description of appearances as they first fall together in our apprehension and this want of understanding in the observer is what popular philosophy calls intelligence in the world Sidenote Yet presumably pervasive That this gulf is apparent only being due to inadequacy and confusion in human perception rather than to incoherence in things is a speculative conviction altogether trustworthy Any one who can at all catch the drift of experience moral no less than physical must feel that mechanism rules the whole world There are doubleness and diversity enough in things to satiate the greatest lover of chaos but that a cosmos nevertheless underlies the superficial play of sense and opinion is what all practical reason must assume and what all comprehended experience bears witness to A cosmos does not mean a disorder with which somebody happens to be well pleased it means a necessity from which every one must draw his happiness If a principle is efficacious it is to that extent mechanical For to be efficacious a principle must apply necessarily and proportionately it must assure us that where the factors are the same as on a previous occasion the quotient will be the same also Now in order that the flux of things should contain a repetition elements must be identified within it these identical elements may then find themselves in an identical situation on which the same result may ensue which ensued before If the elements were not constant and recognisable or if their relations did not suffice to determine the succeeding event no observation could be transferred with safety from the past to the future Thus art and comprehension would be defeated together Novelties in the world are not lacking because the elements entering at any moment into a given combination have never before entered into a combination exactly similar Mechanism applies to the matter and minute texture of things but its applying there will create at each moment fresh ideal wholes formal unities which mind emanates from and represents The result will accordingly always be unprecedented in the total impression it produces in exact proportion to the singularity of the situation in hand Mechanical processes are not like mathematical relations because they happen What they express the form of is a flux not a truth or an ideal necessity The situation may therefore always be new though produced from the preceding situation by rules which are invariable since the preceding situation was itself novel Mechanism might be called the dialectic of the irrational It is such a measure of intelligibility as is compatible with flux and with existence Existence itself being irrational and change unintelligible the only necessity they are susceptible of is a natural or empirical necessity impinging at both ends upon brute matters of fact The existential elements their situation number affinities and mutual influence all have to be begged before calculation can begin When these surds have been accepted at their face value inference may set to work among them yet the inference that mechanism will continue to reign will not amount to certain knowledge until the event inferred has come to give it proof Calculation in physics differs from pure dialectic in that the ultimate object it looks to is not ideal Theory here must revert to the immediate flux for its sanction whereas dialectic is a centrifugal emanation from existence and never returns to its point of origin It remains suspended in the ether of those eternal relations which forms have even when found embedded in matter Sidenote Inadequacy of consciousness If the total flux is continuous and naturally intelligible why is the part felt by man so disjointed and opaque An answer to this question may perhaps be drawn from the fact that consciousness apparently arises to express the functions only of extremely complicated organisms The basis of thought is vastly more elaborate than its deliverance It takes a wonderful brain and exquisite senses to produce a few stupid ideas The mind starts therefore with a tremendous handicap In order to attain adequate practical knowledge it would have to represent clearly its own conditions for the purpose of mind is its own furtherance and perfection and before that purpose could be fulfilled the mind s interests would have to become parallel to the body s fortunes This means that the body s actual relations in nature would have to become the mind s favourite themes in discourse Had this harmony been attained the more accurately and intensely thought was exercised the more stable its status would become and the more prosperous its undertakings since lively thought would then be a symptom of health in the body and of mechanical equilibrium with the environment The body s actual relations however on which health depends are infinitely complex and immensely extended They sweep the whole material universe and are intertwined most closely with all social and passionate forces with their incalculable mechanical springs Meantime the mind begins by being a feeble and inconsequent ghost Its existence is intermittent and its visions unmeaning It fails to conceive its own interests or the situations that might support or defeat those interests If it pictures anything clearly it is only some phantastic image which in no way represents its own complex basis Thus the parasitical human mind finding what clear knowledge it has laughably insufficient to interpret its destiny takes to neglecting knowledge altogether and to hugging instead various irrational ideas On the one hand it lapses into dreams which while obviously irrelevant to practice express the mind s vegetative instincts hence art and mythology which substitute play worlds for the real one on correlation with which human prosperity and dignity depend On the other hand the mind becomes wedded to conventional objects which mark perhaps the turning points of practical life and plot the curve of it in a schematic and disjointed fashion but which are themselves entirely opaque and as we say material Now as matter is commonly a name for things not understood men materially minded are those whose ideas while practical are meagre and blind so that their knowledge of nature if not invalid is exceedingly fragmentary This grossness in common sense like irrelevance in imagination springs from the fact that the mind s representative powers are out of focus with its controlling conditions Sidenote Its articulation inferior to that of its objects In other words sense ought to correspond in articulation with the object to be represented otherwise the object s structure with the fate it imports cannot be transferred into analogous ideas Now the human senses are not at all fitted to represent an organism on the scale of the human body They catch its idle gestures but not the inner processes which control its action The senses are immeasurably too gross What to them is a minimum visibile a just perceptible atom is in the body s structure very likely a system of worlds the inner cataclysms of which count in producing that so called atom s behaviour and endowing it with affinities apparently miraculous What must the seed of animals contain for instance to be the ground as it notoriously is for every physical and moral property of the offspring Or what must the system of signals and the reproductive habit in a brain be for it to company ordinate instinctive movements learn tricks and remember Our senses can represent at all adequately only such objects as the solar system or a work of human architecture where the unit s inner structure and fermentation may be provisionally neglected in mastering the total The architect may reckon in bricks and the astronomer in planets and yet foresee accurately enough the practical result In a word only what is extraordinarily simple is intelligible to man while only what is extraordinarily complex can support intelligence Consciousness is essentially incompetent to understand what most concerns it its own vicissitudes and sense is altogether out of scale with the objects of practical interest in life Sidenote Science consequently retarded One consequence of this profound maladjustment is that science is hard to attain and is at first paradoxical The change of scale required is violent and frustrates all the mind s rhetorical habits There is a constant feeling of strain and much flying back to the mother tongue of myth and social symbol Every wrong hypothesis is seized upon and is tried before any one will entertain the right one Enthusiasm for knowledge is chilled by repeated failures and a great confusion cannot but reign in philosophy A man with an eye for characteristic features in various provinces of experience is encouraged to deal with each upon a different principle and where these provinces touch or actually fuse he is at a loss what method of comprehension to apply There sets in accordingly a tendency to use various methods at once or a different one on each occasion as language custom or presumption seems to demand Science is reduced by philosophers to plausible discourse and the more plausible the discourse is by leaning on all the heterogeneous prejudices of the hour the more does it foster the same and discourage radical investigation Thus even Aristotle felt that good judgment and the dramatic habit of things altogether excluded the simple physics of Democritus Indeed as things then stood Democritus had no right to his simplicity except that divine right which comes of inspiration His was an indefensible faith in a single radical insight which happened nevertheless to be true To justify that insight forensically it would have been necessary to change the range of human vision making it telescopic in one region and microscopic in another whereby the objects so transfigured would have lost their familiar aspect and their habitual context in discourse Without such a startling change of focus nature can never seem everywhere mechanical Hence even to this day people with broad human interests are apt to discredit a mechanical philosophy Seldom can penetration and courage in thinking hold their own against the miscellaneous habits of discourse and nobody remembers that moral values must remain captious and imaginative life ignoble and dark so long as the whole basis and application of them is falsely conceived Discoveries in science are made only by near sighted specialists while the influence of public sentiment and policy still works systematically against enlightenment Sidenote and speculation rendered necessary The maladaptation of sense to its objects has a second consequence that speculation is in a way nobler for man than direct perception For direct perception is wholly inadequate to render the force the reality the subtle relations of the object perceived unless this object be a shell only like a work of fine art where nothing counts but the surface Since the function of perception is properly to give understanding and dominion direct perception is a defeat and as it were an insult to the mind thus forced to busy itself about so unintelligible and dense an apparition AEsthetic enthusiasm cares nothing about what the object inwardly is what is its efficacious movement and real life It revels selfishly in the harmonies of perception itself harmonies which perhaps it attributes to the object through want of consideration These aesthetic objects which have no intrinsic unity or cohesion lapse in the most melancholy and inexplicable fashion before our eyes Then we cry that beauty wanes that life is brief and that its prizes are deceptive Our minds have fed on casual aspects of nature like tints in sunset clouds Imaginative fervour has poured itself out exclusively on these apparitions which are without relevant backing in the world and long perhaps before this life is over which we called too brief we begin to pine for another where just those images which here played so deceptively on the surface of the flux may be turned into fixed and efficacious realities Meantime speculation amuses us with prophecies about what such realities might be We look for them very likely in the wrong place namely in human poetry and eloquence or at best in dialectic yet even when stated in these mythical terms the hidden world divined in meditation seems nobler and as we say more real than the objects of sense For we hope in those speculative visions to reach the permanent the efficacious the stanch principles of experience something to rely on in prospect and appeal to in perplexity Science in its prosaic but trustworthy fashion passes likewise beyond the dreamlike unities and cadences which sense discloses only as science aims at controlling its speculation by experiment the hidden reality it discloses is exactly like what sense perceives though on a different scale and not observable perhaps without a magic carpet of hypothesis to carry the observer to the ends of the universe or changing his dimensions to introduce him into those infinitesimal abysses where nature has her workshop In this region were it sufficiently explored we might find just those solid supports and faithful warnings which we were looking for with such ill success in our rhetorical speculations The machinery disclosed would not be human it would be machinery But it would for that very reason serve the purpose which made us look for it instead of remaining like the lower animals placidly gazing on the pageants of sense till some unaccountable pang forced us to spasmodic movement It is doubtless better to find material engines not necessarily inanimate either which may really serve to bring order security and progress into our lives than to find impassioned or ideal spirits that can do nothing for us except at best assure us that they are perfectly happy Sidenote Dissatisfaction with mechanism partly natural The reigning aversion to mechanism is partly natural and partly artificial The natural aversion cannot be wholly overcome Like the aversion to death to old age to labour it is called forth by man s natural situation in a world which was not made for him but in which he grew That the efficacious structure of things should not be intentionally spectacular nor poetical that its units should not be terms in common discourse nor its laws quite like the logic of passion is of course a hard lesson to learn The learning however not to speak of its incidental delights is so extraordinarily good for people that only with that instruction and the blessed renunciations it brings can clearness dignity or virility enter their minds And of course if the material basis of human strength could be discovered and better exploited the free activity of the mind would be not arrested but enlarged Geology adds something to the interest of landscape and botany much to the charm of flowers natural history increases the pleasure with which we view society and the justice with which we judge it An instinctive sympathy a solicitude for the perfect working of any delicate thing as it makes the ruffian tender to a young child is a sentiment inevitable even toward artificial organisms Could we better perceive the fine fruits of order the dire consequences of every specific cruelty or jar we should grow doubly considerate toward all forms for we exist through form and the love of form is our whole real inspiration Sidenote and partly artificial The artificial prejudice against mechanism is a fruit of party spirit When a myth has become the centre or sanction for habits and institutions these habits and institutions stand against any conception incompatible with that myth It matters nothing that the values the myth was designed to express may remain standing without it or may be transferred to its successor Social and intellectual inertia is too great to tolerate so simple an evolution It divides opinions not into false and true but into high and low or even more frankly into those which are acceptable and comforting to its ruffled faith and those which are dangerous alarming and unfortunate Imagine Socrates viewing with alarm the implications of an argument This artificial prejudice is indeed modern and will not be eternal Ancient sages when they wished to rebuke the atheist pointed to the very heavens which a sentimental religion would nowadays gladly prove to be unreal lest the soul should learn something of their method Yet the Ptolemaic spheres were no more manlike and far less rich in possibilities of life than the Copernican star dust The ancients thought that what was intelligible was divine Order was what they meant by intelligence and order productive of excellence was what they meant by reason When they noticed that the stars moved perpetually and according to law they seriously thought they were beholding the gods The stars as we conceive them are not in that sense perfect But the order which nature does not cease to manifest is still typical of all order and is sublime It is from these regions of embodied law that intelligibility and power combined come to make their covenant with us as with all generations Sidenote Biassed judgments inspired by moral inertia The emotions and the moral principles that are naturally allied to materialism suffer an eclipse when materialism which is properly a primary or dogmatic philosophy breathing courage and victory appears as a destructive force and in the incongruous role of a critic One dogmatism is not fit to criticise another their conflict can end only in insults sullenness and an appeal to that physical drift and irrational selection which may ultimately consign one party to oblivion But a philosophy does ill to boast of such borrowed triumphs The next turn of the wheel may crush the victor and the opinions hastily buried may rise again to pose as the fashionable and superior insights of a later day To criticise dogmatism it is necessary to be a genuine sceptic an honest transcendentalist that falls back on the immediate and observes by what principles of logical architecture the ultimate the reality discovered has been inferred from it Such criticism is not necessarily destructive some construction and some belief being absolutely inevitable if reason and life are to operate at all criticism merely offers us the opportunity of revising and purifying our dogmas so as to make them reasonable and congruous with practice Materialism may thus be reinstated on transcendental grounds and the dogma at first uttered in the flush of intelligent perception with no scruple or self consciousness may be repeated after a thorough examination of heart on the ground that it is the best possible expression of experience the inevitable deliverance of thought So approached a dogmatic system will carry its critical justification with it and the values it enshrines and secures will not be doubtful The emotions it arouses will be those aroused by the experience it explains Causes having been found for what is given these causes will be proved to have just that beneficent potency and just that distressing inadequacy which the joys and failures of life show that the reality has whatever this reality may otherwise be The theory will add nothing except the success involved in framing it Life being once for all what it is no physics can render it worse or better save as the knowledge of physics with insight into the causes of our varied fortunes is itself an achievement and a new resource Sidenote Positive emotions proper to materialism A theory is not an unemotional thing If music can be full of passion merely by giving form to a single sense how much more beauty or terror may not a vision be pregnant with which brings order and method into everything that we know Materialism has its distinct aesthetic and emotional colour though this may be strangely affected and even reversed by contrast with systems of an incongruous hue jostling it accidentally in a confused and amphibious mind If you are in the habit of believing in special providences or of expecting to continue your romantic adventures in a second life materialism will dash your hopes most unpleasantly and you may think for a year or two that you have nothing left to live for But a thorough materialist one born to the faith and not half plunged into it by an unexpected christening in cold water will be like the superb Democritus a laughing philosopher His delight in a mechanism that can fall into so many marvellous and beautiful shapes and can generate so many exciting passions should be of the same intellectual quality as that which the visitor feels in a museum of natural history where he views the myriad butterflies in their cases the flamingoes and shell fish the mammoths and gorillas Doubtless there were pangs in that incalculable life but they were soon over and how splendid meantime was the pageant how infinitely interesting the universal interplay and how foolish and inevitable those absolute little passions Somewhat of that sort might be the sentiment that materialism would arouse in a vigorous mind active joyful impersonal and in respect to private illusions not without a touch of scorn To the genuine sufferings of living creatures the ethics that accompanies materialism has never been insensible on the contrary like other merciful systems it has trembled too much at pain and tended to withdraw the will ascetically lest the will should be defeated Contempt for mortal sorrows is reserved for those who drive with hosannas the Juggernaut car of absolute optimism But against evils born of pure vanity and self deception against the verbiage by which man persuades himself that he is the goal and acme of the universe laughter is the proper defence Laughter also has this subtle advantage that it need not remain without an overtone of sympathy and brotherly understanding as the laughter that greets Don Quixote s absurdities and misadventures does not mock the hero s intent His ardour was admirable but the world must be known before it can be reformed pertinently and happiness to be attained must be placed in reason Sidenote The material world not dead nor ugly Oblivious of Democritus the unwilling materialists of our day have generally been awkwardly intellectual and quite incapable of laughter If they have felt anything they have felt melancholy Their allegiance and affection were still fixed on those mythical sentimental worlds which they saw to be illusory The mechanical world they believed in could not please them in spite of its extent and fertility Giving rhetorical vent to their spleen and prejudice they exaggerated nature s meagreness and mathematical dryness When their imagination was chilled they spoke of nature most unwarrantably as dead and when their judgment was heated they took the next step and called it unreal A man is not blind however because every part of his body is not an eye nor every muscle in his eye a nerve sensitive to light Why then is nature dead although it swarms with living organisms if every part is not obviously animate And why is the sun dark and cold if it is bright and hot only to animal sensibility This senseless lamentation is like the sophism of those Indian preachers who to make men abandon the illusions of self love dilated on the shocking contents of the human body Take off the skin they cried and you will discover nothing but loathsome bleeding and quivering substances Yet the inner organs are well enough in their place and doubtless pleasing to the microbes that inhabit them and a man is not hideous because his cross section would not offer the features of a beautiful countenance So the structure of the world is not therefore barren or odious because if you removed its natural outer aspect and effects it would not make an interesting landscape Beauty being an appearance and life an operation that is surely beautiful and living which so operates and so appears as to manifest those qualities Sidenote nor especially cruel It is true that materialism prophesies an ultimate extinction for man and all his works The horror which this prospect inspires in the natural man might be mitigated by reflection but granting the horror is it something introduced by mechanical theories and not present in experience itself Are human things inwardly stable Do they belong to the eternal in any sense in which the operation of material forces can touch their immortality The panic which seems to seize some minds at the thought of a merely natural existence is something truly hysterical and yet one wonders why ultimate peace should seem so intolerable to people who not so many years ago found a stern religious satisfaction in consigning almost the whole human race to perpetual torture the Creator as Saint Augustine tells us having in his infinite wisdom and justice devised a special kind of material fire that might avail to burn resurrected bodies for ever without consuming them A very real truth might be read into this savage symbol if we understood it to express the ultimate defeats and fruitless agonies that pursue human folly and so we might find that it gave mythical expression to just that conditioned fortune and inexorable flux which a mechanical philosophy shows us the grounds of Our own vices in another man seem particularly hideous and so those actual evils which we take for granted when incorporated in the current system strike us afresh when we see them in a new setting But it is not mechanical science that introduced mutability into things nor materialism that invented death Sidenote Mechanism to be judged by its fruits The death of individuals as we observe daily in nature does not prevent the reappearance of life and if we choose to indulge in arbitrary judgments on a subject where data fail us we may as reasonably wish that there might be less life as that there might be more The passion for a large and permanent population in the universe is not obviously rational at a great distance a man must view everything including himself under the form of eternity and when life is so viewed its length or its diffusion becomes a point of little importance What matters then is quality The reasonable and humane demand to make of the world is that such creatures as exist should not be unhappy and that life whatever its quantity should have a quality that may justify it in its own eyes This just demand made by conscience and not by an arbitrary fancy the world described by mechanism does not fulfil altogether for adjustments in it are tentative and much friction must precede and follow upon any vital equilibrium attained This imperfection however is actual and no theory can overcome it except by verbal fallacies and scarcely deceptive euphemisms What mechanism involves in this respect is exactly what we find a tentative appearance of life in many quarters its disappearance in some and its reinforcement and propagation in others where the physical equilibrium attained insures to it a natural stability and a natural prosperity CHAPTER IV HESITATIONS IN METHOD Sidenote Mechanism restricted to one half of existence When Democritus proclaimed the sovereignty of mechanism he did so in the oracular fashion proper to an ancient sage He found it no harder to apply his atomic theory to the mind and to the gods than to solids and fluids It sufficed to conceive that such an explanation might be possible and to illustrate the theory by a few scattered facts and trenchant hypotheses When Descartes after twenty centuries of verbal physics reintroduced mechanism into philosophy he made a striking modification in its claims He divided existence into two independent regions and it was only in one in the realm of extended things that mechanism was expected to prevail Mental facts which he approached from the side of abstracted reflection and Platonic ideas seemed to him obviously non extended even when they represented extension and with them mechanism could have nothing to do Descartes had recovered in the science of mechanics a firm nucleus for physical theory a stronghold from which it had become impossible to dislodge scientific methods There at any rate form mass distance and other mathematical relations governed the transformation of things Yet the very clearness and exhaustiveness of this mechanical method as applied to gross masses in motion made it seem essentially inapplicable to anything else Descartes was far too radical and incisive a thinker however not to feel that it must apply throughout nature Imaginative difficulties due to the complexity of animal bodies could not cloud his rational insight Animal bodies then were mere machines cleancut and cold engines like so many anatomical manikins They explained themselves and all their operations talking and building temples being just as truly a matter of physics as the revolution of the sky But the soul had dropped out and Descartes was the last man to ignore the soul There had dropped out also the secondary qualities of matter all those qualities namely which are negligible in mechanical calculations Mechanism was in truth far from universal all mental facts and half the properties of matter as matter is revealed to man came into being without asking leave they were interlopers in the intelligible universe Indeed Descartes was willing to admit that these inexplicable bystanders might sometimes put their finger in the pie and stir the material world judiciously so as to give it a new direction although without adding to its substance or to its force The situation so created gave the literary philosophers an excellent chance to return to the attack and to swallow and digest the new born mechanism in their facile systems Theologians and metaphysicians in one quarter and psychologists in another found it easy and inevitable to treat the whole mechanical world as a mere idea In that case it is true the only existences that remained remained entirely without calculable connections everything was a divine trance or a shower of ideas falling by chance through the void But this result might not be unwelcome It fell in well enough with that love of emotional issues that want of soberness and want of cogency which is so characteristic of modern philosophers Christian theology still remained the background and chief point of reference for speculation if its eclectic dogmas could be in part supported or in part undermined that constituted a sufficient literary success and what became of science was of little moment in comparison Sidenote Men of science not speculative Science to be sure could very well take care of itself and proceeded in its patient course without caring particularly what status the metaphysicians might assign to it Not to be a philosopher is even an advantage for a man of science because he is then more willing to adapt his methods to the state of knowledge in his particular subject without insisting on ultimate intelligibility and he has perhaps more joy of his discoveries than he might have if he had discounted them in his speculations Darwin for instance did more than any one since Newton to prove that mechanism is universal but without apparently believing that it really was so or caring about the question at all In natural history observation has not yet come within range of accurate processes it merely registers habits and traces empirical derivations Even in chemistry while measure and proportion are better felt the ultimate units and the radical laws are still problematical The recent immense advances in science have been in acquaintance with nature rather than in insight Greater complexity greater regularity greater naturalness have been discovered everywhere the profound analogies in things their common evolution have appeared unmistakably but the inner texture of the process has not been laid bare This cautious peripheral attack which does so much honour to the scientific army and has won it so many useful victories is another proof that science is nothing but common knowledge extended It is willing to reckon in any terms and to study any subject matter where it cannot see necessity it will notice law where laws cannot be stated it will describe habits where habits fail it will classify types and where types even are indiscernible it will not despise statistics In this way studies which are scientific in spirit however loose their results may be carried on in social matters in political economy in anthropology in psychology The historical sciences also philology and archaeology have reached tentatively very important results it is enough that an intelligent man should gather in any quarter a rich fund of information for the movement of his subject to pass somehow to his mind and if his apprehension follows that movement not breaking in upon it with extraneous matter it will be scientific apprehension Sidenote Confusion in semi moral subjects What confuses and retards science in these ambiguous regions is the difficulty of getting rid of the foreign element or even of deciding what the element native to the object is In political economy for instance it is far from clear whether the subject is moral and therefore to be studied and expressed dialectically or whether it is descriptive and so in the end a matter of facts and of mechanics Are you formulating an interest or tracing a sequence of events And if both simultaneously are you studying the world in order to see what acts in a given situation would serve your purpose and so be right or are you taking note of your own intentions and of those of other people in order to infer from them the probable course of affairs In the first case you are a moralist observing nature in order to use it you are defining a policy and that definition is not knowledge of anything except of your own heart Neither you nor any one else may ever take such a single minded and unchecked course in the world as the one you are excogitating No one may ever have been guided in the past by any such absolute plan For this same reason if to take up the other supposition you are a naturalist studying the actual movement of affairs you would do well not to rely on the conscious views or intentions of anybody A natural philosopher is on dangerous ground when he uses psychological or moral terms in his calculation If you use such terms and to forbid their use altogether would be pedantic you should take them for conventional literary expressions covering an unsolved problem for these views and intentions have a brief and inconsequential tenure of life and their existence is merely a sign for certain conjunctions in nature where processes hailing from afar have met in a man soon to pass beyond him If they figure as causes in nature it is only because they represent the material processes that have brought them into being The existential element in mental facts is not so remote from matter as Descartes imagined Even if we are not prepared to admit with Democritus that matter is what makes them up as it well might if matter were taken in a logical sense B we should agree that their substance is in mechanical flux and that their form by which they become moral unities is only an ideal aspect of that moving substance Moral unities are created by a point of view as right and left are and for that reason are not efficacious though of course the existences they enclose like the things lying to the left and to the right move in unison with the rest of nature People doubtless do well to keep an eye open for morals when they study physics and vice versa since it is only by feeling how the two spheres hang together that the Life of Reason can be made to walk on both feet Yet to discriminate between the two is no scholastic subtlety There is the same practical inconvenience in taking one for the other as in trying to gather grapes from thistles A hybrid science is sterile If the reason escapes us history should at least convince us of the fact when we remember the issue of Aristotelian physics and of cosmological morals Where the subject matter is ambiguous and the method double you have scarcely reached a result which seems plausible for the moment when a rival school springs up adopting and bringing forward the submerged element in your view and rejecting your achievement altogether A seesaw and endless controversy thus take the place of a steady company operative advance This disorder reigns in morals metaphysics and psychology and the conflicting schools of political economy and of history loudly proclaim it to the world Sidenote Physic of metaphysic begs defence The modesty of men of science their aversion or incapacity to carry their principles over into speculation has left the greater part of physics or the theory of existence to the metaphysicians What they have made of it does not concern us here since the result has certainly not been a science indeed they have obscured the very notion that there should be a science of all existence and that metaphysics if it is more than a name for ultimate physics can be nothing but dialectic which does not look toward existence at all But the prevalence of a mythical physics purporting to describe the structure of the universe in terms quite other than those which scientific physics could use has affected this scientific physics and seriously confused it Its core in mechanics to be sure could not be touched and the detail even of natural history and chemistry could not be disfigured but the general aspect of natural history could be rendered ambiguous in the doctrine of evolution while in psychology which attempted to deal with that half of the world which Descartes had not subjected to mechanism confusion could hold undisputed sway Sidenote Evolution by mechanism There is a sense in which the notion of evolution is involved in any mechanical system Descartes indeed had gone so far as to describe in strangely simple terms how the world with all its detail might have been produced by starting any motion anywhere in the midst of a plenum at rest The idea of evolution could not be more curtly put forth so much so that Descartes had to arm himself against the inevitable charge that he was denying the creation by protesting that his doctrine was a supposition contrary to fact and that though the world might have been so formed it was really created as Genesis recorded Moreover in antiquity every Ionian philosopher had conceived a gradual crystallisation of nature while Empedocles in his magnificent oracles had anticipated Darwin s philosophy without Darwin s knowledge It is clear that if the forces that hold an organism together are mechanical and therefore independent of the ideal unities they subtend those forces suffice to explain the origin of the organism and can have produced it Darwin s discoveries like every other advance in physical insight are nothing but filling for that abstract assurance They show us how the supposed mechanism really works in one particular field in one stage of its elaboration As earlier naturalists had shown us how mechanical causes might produce the miracle of the sunrise and the poetry of the seasons so Darwin showed us how similar causes might secure the adaptation of animals to their habitat Evolution so conceived is nothing but a detailed account of mechanical origins Sidenote Evolution by ideal attraction At the same time the word evolution has a certain pomp and glamour about it which fits ill with so prosaic an interpretation In the unfolding of a bud we are wont to see as it were the fulfilment of a predetermined and glorious destiny for the seed was an epitome or condensation of a full blown plant and held within it in some sort of potential guise the very form which now peeps out in the young flower Evolution suggests a prior involution or contraction and the subsequent manifestation of an innate ideal Evolution should move toward a fixed consummation the approaches to which we might observe and measure Yet evolution in this prophetic sense of the word would be the exact denial of what Darwin for instance was trying to prove It would be a return to Aristotelian notions of heredity and potential being for it was the essence of Aristotle s physics of which his theology was an integral part and a logical capping that the forms which beings approached pre existed in other beings from which they had been inherited and that the intermediate stages during which the butterfly shrank to a grub could not be understood unless we referred them to their origin and their destiny The physical essence and potency of seeds lay in their ideal relations not in any actual organisation they might possess in the day of their eclipse and slumber An egg evolved into a chicken not by mechanical necessity for an egg had a comparatively simple structure but by virtue of an ideal harmony in things since it was natural and fitting that what had come from a hen should lead on to a hen again The ideal nature possessed by the parent hovering over the passive seed magically induced it to grow into the parent s semblance and growth was the gradual approach to the perfection which this ancestral essence prescribed This was why Aristotle s God though in character an unmistakable ideal had to be at the same time an actual existence since the world would not have known which way to move or what was its inner ideal unless this ideal already embodied somewhere else drew it on and infused movement and direction into the world s structureless substance The underlying Platonism in this magical physics is obvious since the natures that Aristotle made to rule the world were eternal natures An individual might fail to be a perfect man or a perfect monkey but the specific human or simian ideal by which he had been formed in so far as he was formed at all was not affected by this accidental resistance in the matter at hand as an adamantine seal even if at times the wax by defect or impurity failed to receive a perfect impression would remain unchanged and ready to be stamped perpetually on new material Sidenote If species are evolved they cannot guide evolution The contrast is obvious between this Platonic physics and a naturalism like that of Darwin The point of evolution as selection produces it is that new species may arise The very title of Darwin s book The Origin of Species is a denial of Aristotelianism and in the pregnant sense of evolution It suggests that the type approached by each generation may differ from that approached by the previous one that not merely the degree of perfection but the direction of growth may vary The individual is not merely unfolded from an inner potentiality derived from a like ancestor and carrying with it a fixed eternal ideal but on the contrary the very ground plan of organisation may gradually change and a new form and a new ideal may appear Spontaneous variations of course mechanically caused C may occur and may modify the hereditary form of animals These variations superposed upon one another may in time constitute a nature wholly unlike its first original This accidental cumulative evolution accordingly justifies a declaration of moral liberty I am not obliged to aspire to the nature my father aspired to for the ground of my being is partly new In me nature is making a novel experiment I am the adoring creator of a new spiritual good My duties have shifted with my shifting faculties and the ideal which I propose to myself and alone can honestly propose is unprecedented the expression of a moving existence and without authority beyond the range of existences congruous with mine Sidenote Intrusion of optimism All that is scientific or Darwinian in the theory of evolution is accordingly an application of mechanism a proof that mechanism lies at the basis of life and morals The Aristotelian notion of development however was too deeply rooted in tradition for it to disappear at a breath Evolution as conceived by Hegel for instance or even by Spencer retained Aristotelian elements though these were disguised and hidden under a cloud of new words Both identify evolution with progress with betterment a notion which would naturally be prominent in any one with enlightened sympathies living in the nineteenth century when a new social and intellectual order was forcing itself on a world that happened largely to welcome the change but a notion that has nothing to do with natural science The fittest to live need not be those with the most harmonious inner life nor the best possibilities The fitness might be due to numbers as in a political election or to tough fibre as in a tropical climate Of course a form of being that circumstances make impossible or hopelessly laborious had better dive under and cease for the moment to be but the circumstances that render it inopportune do not render it essentially inferior Circumstances have no power of that kind and perhaps the worst incident in the popular acceptance of evolution has been a certain brutality thereby introduced into moral judgment an abdication of human ideals a mocking indifference to justice under cover of respect for what is bound to be and for the rough economy of the world Disloyalty to the good in the guise of philosophy had appeared also among the ancients when their political ethics had lost its authority just as it appeared among us when the prestige of religion had declined The Epicureans sometimes said that one should pursue pleasure because all the animals did so and the Stoics that one should fill one s appointed place in nature because such was the practice of clouds and rivers Sidenote Evolution according to Hegel Hegel possessed a keen scent for instability in men s attitudes and opinions he had no need of Darwin s facts to convince him that in moral life at least there were no permanent species and that every posture of thought was an untenable half way station between two others His early contact with Protestant theology may have predisposed him to that opinion At any rate he had no sympathy with that Platonism that allowed everything to have its eternal ideal with which it might ultimately be identified Such ideals would be finite they would arrest the flux and they would try to break loose from their enveloping conditions Hegel was no moralist in the Socratic sense but a naturalist seeking formulas for the growth of moral experience Instead of questioning the heart he somewhat satirically described its history At the same time he was heir to that mythology which had deified the genetic or physical principle in things and though the traditional myths suffered cruel operations at his hands and often died of explanation the mythical principle itself remained untouched and was the very breath of his nostrils He never doubted that the formula he might find for the growth of experience would be also the ultimate good What other purpose could the world have than to express the formula according to which it was being generated In this honest conviction we see the root perhaps of that distaste for correct physics that prevails among many who call themselves idealists If physics were for some reason to be adored it would be disconcerting to find in physics nothing but atoms and a void It is hard to understand however why a fanciful formula expressing the evolution of this perturbed universe and painting it no better than it is should be more worshipful than an exact formula meant to perform the same office A myth that enlarged the world and promised a complete transformation of its character might have its charms but the improvement is not obvious that accrues by making the drift of things just as it drifts its own standard Yet for Hegel it mattered nothing how unstable all ideals might be since the only use of them was to express a principle of transition and this principle was being realised eternally and unawares by the self devouring and self transcending purposes rolling in the flux Sidenote The conservative interpretation This philosophy might not be much relished if it were more frankly expressed yet something of the sort floats vaguely before most minds when they think of evolution The types of being change they say in this sense the Aristotelian notion of a predetermined form unfolding itself in each species has yielded to a more correct and more dynamic physics But the changes so people imagine express a predetermined ideal no longer of course the ideal of these specific things but one overarching the cosmic movement The situation might be described by saying that this is Aristotle s view adapted to a world in which there is only one species or only one individual The earlier phases of life are an imperfect expression of the same nature which the later phases express more fully Hence the triumphant march of evolution and the assumption that whatever is later is necessarily better than what went before If a child were simply the partial expression of a man his single desire would be to grow up and when he was grown up he would embody all he had been striving for and would be happy for ever after So if man were nothing but a halting reproduction of divinity and destined to become God his whole destiny would be fulfilled by apotheosis If this apotheosis moreover were an actual future event something every man and animal was some day to experience evolution might really have a final goal and might lead to a new and presumably better sort of existence existence in the eternal Somewhat in this fashion evolution is understood by the party that wish to combine it with a refreshed patristic theology Sidenote The radical one There is an esoteric way however of taking these matters which is more in sympathy both with natural evolution and with transcendental philosophy If we assert that evolution is infinite no substantive goal can be set to it The goal will be the process itself if we could only open our eyes upon its beauty and necessity The apotheosis will be retroactive nay it has already taken place The insight involved is mystical yet in a way more just to the facts than any promise of ulterior blisses For it is not really true that a child has no other ideal than to become a man Childhood has many an ideal of its own many a beauty and joy irrelevant to manhood and such that manhood is incapable of retaining or containing them If the ultimate good is really to contain and retain all the others it can hardly be anything but their totality the infinite history of experience viewed under the form of eternity At that remove however the least in the kingdom of Heaven is even as the greatest and the idea of evolution as of time is taken up into a higher unity There could be no real pre eminence in one man s works over those of another and if faith or insight into the equal service done by all still seemed a substantial privilege reserved for the elect this privilege too must be an illusion since those who do not know how useful and necessary they are must be as useful and necessary as those who do An absolute preference for knowledge or self consciousness would be an unmistakably human and finite ideal something to be outgrown Sidenote Megalomania What practically survives in these systems when their mysticism and naturalism have had time to settle is a clear enough standard It is a standard of inclusion and quantity Since all is needful and the justifying whole is infinite there would seem to be a greater dignity in the larger part As the best copy of a picture other things being equal would be one that represented it all so the best expression of the world next to the world itself would be the largest portion of it any one could absorb Progress would then mean annexation Growth would not come by expressing better an innate soul which involved a particular ideal but by assimilating more and more external things till the original soul by their influence was wholly recast and unrecognisable This moral agility would be true merit we should always be striving onward Life would be a sort of demonic vortex boiling at the centre and omnivorous at the circumference till it finally realised the supreme vocation of vortices to have their centre everywhere and their circumference nowhere This somewhat troubled situation might seem sublime to us transformed as we too should be and so we might reach the most remarkable and doubtless the highest form of optimism optimism in hell Sidenote Chaos in the theory of mind Confusing as these cross currents and revulsions may prove in the field where mechanism is more or less at home in the field of material operations they are nothing to the primeval chaos that still broods over the other hemisphere over the mental phase of existence The difficulty is not merely that no mechanism is discovered or acknowledged here but that the phenomena themselves are ambiguous and no one seems to know when he speaks of mind whether he means something formal and ideal like Platonic essences and mathematical truths or reflection and intelligence or sensation possessing external causes and objects or finally that ultimate immediacy or brute actuality which is characteristic of any existence Other even vaguer notions are doubtless often designated by the word psychical but these may suffice for us to recognise the initial dilemmas in the subject and the futility of trying to build a science of mind or defining the relation of mind to matter when it is not settled whether mind means the form of matter as with the Platonists or the effect of it as with the materialists or the seat and false knowledge of it as with the transcendentalists or perhaps after all as with the pan psychists mind means exactly matter itself D Sidenote Origin of self consciousness To see how equivocal everything is in this region and possibly to catch some glimpse of whatever science or sciences might some day define it we may revert for a moment to the origin of human notions concerning the mind If either everything or nothing that men came upon in their primitive day dream had been continuous in its own category and traceable through the labyrinth of the world no mind and no self consciousness need ever have appeared at all The world might have been as magical as it pleased it would have remained single one budding sequence of forms with no transmissible substance beneath them These forms might have had properties we now call physical and at the same time qualities we now call mental or emotional there is nothing originally incongruous in such a mixture chaotic and perverse as it may seem from the vantage ground of subsequent distinctions Existence might as easily have had any other form whatsoever as the one we discover it to have in fact And primitive men not having read Descartes and not having even distinguished their waking from their dreaming life nor their passions from their environment might well stand in the presence of facts that seem to us full of inward incongruity and contradiction indeed it is only because original data were of that chaotic sort that we call ourselves intelligent for having disentangled them and assigned them to distinct sequences and alternative spheres The ambiguities and hesitations of theory down to our own day are not all artificial or introduced gratuitously by sophists Even where prejudice obstructs progress that prejudice itself has some ancient and ingenuous source Our perplexities are traces of a primitive total confusion our doubts are remnants of a quite gaping ignorance It was impossible to say whether the phantasms that first crossed this earthly scene were merely instinct with passion or were veritable passions stalking through space Material and mental elements connections natural and dialectical existed mingled in that chaos Light was as yet inseparable from inward vitality and pain drew a visible cloud across the sky Civilised life is that early dream partly clarified science is that dense mythology partly challenged and straightened out The flux however was meantime full of method if only discrimination and enlarged experience could have managed to divine it Its inconstancy for one thing was not so entire that no objects could be fixed within it or marshalled in groups like the birds that flock together Animals could be readily distinguished from the things about them their rate of mobility being so much quicker and one animal in particular would at once be singled out a more constant follower than any dog and one whose energies were not merely felt but often spontaneously exerted a phenomenon which appeared in no other part of the world This singular animal every one called himself One object was thus discovered to be the vehicle for perceiving and affecting all the others a movable seat or tower from which the world might be surveyed Sidenote The notion of spirit The external influences to which this body with its discoursing mind seemed to be subject were by no means all visible and material Just as one s own body was moved by passions and thoughts which no one else could see and this secrecy was a subject for much wonder and self congratulation so evidently other things had a spirit within or above them to endow them with wit and power It was not so much to contain sensation that this spirit was needed for the body could very well feel as to contrive plans of action and discharge sudden force into the world on momentous occasions How deep drawn how far reaching this spirit might be was not easily determined but it seemed to have unaccountable ways and to come and go from distant habitations Things past for instance were still open to its inspection the mind was not credited with constructing a fresh image of the past which might more or less resemble that past a ray of supernatural light rather sometimes could pierce to the past itself and revisit its unchangeable depths The future though more rarely was open to spirit in exactly the same fashion destiny could on occasion be observed Things distant and preternatural were similarly seen in dreams There could be no doubt that all those objects existed the only question was where they might lie and in what manner they might operate A vision was a visitation and a dream was a journey The spirit was a great traveller and just as it could dart in every direction over both space and time so it could come thence into a man s presence or even into his body to take possession of it Sense and fancy in a word had not been distinguished As to be aware of vision is a great sign of imagination so to be aware of imagination is a great sign of understanding The spirit had other prerogatives of a more rational sort The truth the right were also spirits for though often invisible and denied by men they could emerge at times from their invisible lairs to deal some quick blow and vindicate their divinity The intermittance proper to phenomena is universal and extreme only the familiar conception of nature in which the flux becomes continuous now blinds us in part to that fact But before the days of scientific thinking only those things which were found unchanged and which seemed to lie passive were conceived to have had in the interval a material existence More stirring apparitions instead of being referred to their material constituents and continuous basis in nature were referred to spirit We still say for instance that war comes on That phrase would once have been understood literally War being something intermittent must exist somehow unseen in the interval else it would not return that rage so people would have fancied is therefore a spirit it is a god Mars and Ares long survived the phase of thought to which they owed their divinity and believers had to rely on habit and the witness of antiquity to support their irrational faith They little thought how absolutely simple and inevitable had been the grammar by which those figures since grown rhetorical had been first imposed upon the world Sidenote The notion of sense Another complication soon came to increase this confusion When material objects were discovered and it became clear that they had comparatively fixed natures it also became clear that with the motions of one s body all other things seemed to vary in ways which did not amount to a permanent or real metamorphosis in them for these things might be found again unchanged Objects for instance seemed to grow smaller when we receded from them though really as we discovered by approaching and measuring them anew they had remained unchanged These private aspects or views of things were accordingly distinguished from the things themselves which were lodged in an intelligible sphere raised above anybody s sensibility and existing independently The variable aspects were due to the body they accompanied its variations and depended on its presence and organs They were conceived vaguely to exist in one s head or if they were emotional in one s heart but anatomy would have had some difficulty in finding them there They constituted what is properly called the mind the region of sentience emotion and soliloquy The mind was the region where those aspects which real things present to the body might live and congregate So understood it was avowedly and from the beginning a realm of mere appearance and depended entirely on the body It should be observed however that the limbo of divine and ideal things which is sometimes also called the mind is very far from depending obviously on the body and is said to do so only by a late school of psychological sceptics To primitive apprehension spirit with its ideal prerogatives was something magical and oracular Its prophetic intuitions were far from being more trivial than material appearances On the contrary those intuitions were momentous and inspiring Their scope was indefinite and their value incalculable in every sense of the word The disembodied spirit might well be immortal since absent and dead things were familiar to it It was by nature present wherever truth and reality might be found It was prophetic the dreams it fell into were full of auguries and secret affinities with things to come Myth and legend hatched in its womb were felt to be divinely inspired and genius seemed to be the Muses voice heard in a profound abstraction when vulgar perception yielded to some kind of clairvoyance having a higher authority than sense Such a spirit might naturally be expected to pass into another world since it already dwelt there at intervals and brought thence its mysterious reports Its incursions into the physical sphere alone seemed miraculous and sent a thrill of awe through the unaccustomed flesh Sidenote Competition between the two The ideal element in the world was accordingly regarded at first as something sacred and terrifying It was no vulgar presence or private product and though its destiny might be to pass half the time like Persephone under ground it could not really be degraded The human mind on the other hand the region of sentience and illusion was a familiar affair enough This familiarity indeed for a long time bred contempt and philosophers did not think the personal equation of individuals or the refraction of things in sense a very important or edifying subject for study In time however sentience had its revenge As each man s whole experience is bound to his body no less than is the most trivial optical illusion the sphere of sense is the transcendental ground or ratio cognoscendi of every other sphere It suffices therefore to make philosophy retrospective and to relax the practical and dogmatic stress under which the intellect operates for all the discoveries made through experience to collapse into the experience in which they were made A complete collapse of objects is indeed inconvenient because it would leave no starting point for reasoning and no faith in the significance of reason itself but partial collapses now in the region of physics now in that of logic and morals are very easy and exciting feats for criticism to perform Passions when abstracted from their bodily causes and values when removed from their objects will naturally fall into the body s mind and be allied with appearances Shrewd people will bethink themselves to attribute almost all the body s acts to some preparatory intention or motive in its mind and thus attain what they think knowledge of human nature They will encourage themselves to live among dramatic fictions as when absorbed in a novel and having made themselves at home in this upper story of their universe they will find it amusing to deny that it has a ground floor The chance of conceiving by these partial reversals of science a world composed entirely without troublesome machinery is too tempting not to be taken up whatever the ulterior risks and accordingly when once psychological criticism is put in play the sphere of sense will be enlarged at the expense of the two rational worlds the material and the ideal Sidenote The rise of scepticism Consciousness thus qualified by all the sensible qualities of things will exercise an irresistible attraction over the supernatural and ideal realm so that all the gods all truths and all ideals as they have no place among the sufficing causes of experience will be identified with decaying sensations And presently those supposed causes themselves will be retraced and drawn back into the immediate vortex until the sceptic has packed away nature with all space and time into the sphere of sensuous illusion the distinguishing characteristic of which was that it changed with the changes in the human body The personal idealists will declare that all body is a part of some body s mind Thus by a curious reversion the progress of reflection has led to hopeless contradictions Sense which was discovered by observing the refraction and intermittence to which appearances were subject in seeming to be quite different from what things were now tries to subsist when the things it was essentially contrasted with have been abolished The intellect becomes a Penelope whose secret pleasure lies in undoing its ostensible work and science becoming pensive loves to relapse into the dumb actuality and nerveless reverie from which it had once extricated a world The occasion for this sophistication is worth noting for if we follow the thread which we have trailed behind us in entering the labyrinth we shall be able at any moment to get out especially as the omnivorous monster lurking in its depths is altogether harmless A moral and truly transcendental critique of science as of common sense is never out of place since all such a critique does is to assign to each conception or discovery its place and importance in the Life of Reason So administered the critical cathartic will not prove a poison and will not inhibit the cognitive function it was meant to purge Every belief will subsist that finds an empirical and logical warrant while that a belief is a belief and not a sensation will not seem a ground for not entertaining it nor for subordinating it to some gratuitous assurance But a psychological criticism if it is not critical of psychology itself and thinks to substitute a science of absolute sentience for physics and dialectic would rest on sophistry and end wholly in bewilderment The subject matter of an absolute psychology would vanish in its hands since there is no sentience which is not at once the effect of something physical and the appearance of something ideal A calculus of feelings uninterpreted and referred to nothing ulterior would furnish no alternative system to substitute for the positive sciences it was seeking to dislodge In fact those who call ordinary objects unreal do not on that account find anything else to think about Their exorcism does not lay the ghost and they are limited to addressing it in uncivil language It was not idly that reason in the beginning excogitated a natural and an ideal world a labour it might well have avoided if appearance as it stands made a thinkable or a practical universe FOOTNOTES Footnote B The term matter which ought before long to reappear in philosophy has two meanings In popular science and theology it commonly means a group of things in space like the atoms of Democritus or the human body and its members Such matter plainly exists Its particles are concretions in existence like the planets and if a given hypothesis describing them turns out to be wrong it is wrong only because this matter exists so truly and in such discoverable guise that the hypothesis in question may be shown to misrepresent its constitution On the other hand in Aristotle and in literary speech matter means something good to make other things out of Here it is a concretion in discourse a dialectical term being only an aspect or constituent of every existence it cannot exist by itself A state of mind like everything not purely formal has matter of this sort in it Actual love for instance differs materially from the mere idea or possibility of love which is all love would be if the matter or body of it were removed This matter is what idealists bent on giving it a grander name call pure feeling absolute consciousness or metaphysical will These phrases are all used improperly to stand for the existence or presence of things apart from their character or for the mere strain and dead weight of being Matter is a far better term to use in the premises for it suggests the method as well as the fact of brute existence The surd in experience its non ideal element is not an indifferent vehicle for what it brings as would be implied by calling it pure feeling or absolute consciousness Nor is it an act accepting or rejecting objects as would be implied by calling it will In truth the surd conditions not merely the being of objects but their possible quantity the time and place of their appearance and their degree of perfection compared with the ideals they suggest These important factors in whatever exists are covered by the term matter and give it a serious and indispensable role in describing and feeling the world Aristotle it may be added did not adhere with perfect consistency to the dialectical use of this word Matter is sometimes used by him for substance or for actual beings having both matter and form The excuse for this apparent lapse is of course that what taken by itself is a piece of formed matter or an individual object may be regarded as mere material for something else which it helps to constitute as wheat is matter for flour and flour for bread Thus the dialectical and non demonstrative use of the term to indicate one aspect of everything could glide into its vulgar acceptation to indicate one class of things Footnote C It has been suggested what will not party spirit contrive that these variations called spontaneous by Darwin because not predetermined by heredity might be spontaneous in a metaphysical sense free acts with no material basis or cause whatsoever Being free these acts might deflect evolution like Descartes soul acting on the pineal gland into wonderful new courses prevent dissolution and gradually bring on the kingdom of Heaven all as the necessary implication of the latest science and the most atheistic philosophy It may not be needless to observe that if the variations were absolutely free i e intrusions of pure chance they would tend every which way quite as much as if they were mechanically caused while if they were kept miraculously in line with some far off divine event they would not be free at all but would be due to metaphysical attraction and a magic destiny prepared in the eternal and so we should be brought round to Aristotelian physics again Footnote D The monads of Leibniz could justly be called minds because they had a dramatic destiny and the most complex experience imaginable was the state of but one monad not an aggregate view or effect of a multitude in fusion But the recent improvements on that system take the latter turn Mind stuff or the material of mind is supposed to be contained in large quantities within any known feeling Mind stuff we are given to understand is diffused in a medium corresponding to apparent space what else would a real space be it forms quantitative aggregates its transformations or aggregations are mechanically governed it endures when personal consciousness perishes it is the substance of bodies and when duly organised the potentiality of thought One might go far for a better description of matter That any material must be material might have been taken for an axiom but our idealists in their eagerness to show that Gefuehl ist Alles have thought to do honour to feeling by forgetting that it is an expression and wishing to make it a stuff There is a further circumstance showing that mind stuff is but a bashful name for matter Mind stuff like matter can be only an element in any actual being To make a thing or a thought out of mind stuff you have to rely on the system into which that material has fallen the substantive ingredients from which an actual being borrows its intensive quality do not contain its individuating form This form depends on ideal relations subsisting between the ingredients relations which are not feelings but can be rendered only by propositions CHAPTER V PSYCHOLOGY Sidenote Mind reading not science If psychology is a science many things that books of psychology contain should be excluded from it One is social imagination Nature besides having a mechanical form and wearing a garment of sensible qualities makes a certain inner music in the beholder s mind inciting him to enter into other bodies and to fancy the new and profound life which he might lead there Who as he watched a cat basking in the sun has not passed into that vigilant eye and felt all the leaps potential in that luxurious torpor Who has not attributed some little romance to the passer by Who has not sometimes exchanged places even with things inanimate and drawn some new moral experience from following the movement of stars or of daffodils All this is idle musing or at best poetry yet our ordinary knowledge of what goes on in men s minds is made of no other stuff True we have our own mind to go by which presumably might be a fair sample of what men s minds are but unfortunately our notion of ourselves is of all notions the most biassed and idealistic If we attributed to other men only such obvious reasoning sound judgment just preferences honest passions and blameless errors as we discover in ourselves we should take but an insipid and impractical view of mankind In fact we do far better for what we impute to our fellow men is suggested by their conduct or by an instant imitation of their gesture and expression These manifestations striking us in all their novelty and alien habit and affecting our interests in all manner of awkward ways create a notion of our friends natures which is extremely vivid and seldom extremely flattering Such romancing has the cogency proper to dramatic poetry it is persuasive only over the third person who has never had but has always been about to have the experience in question Drawn from the potential in one s self it describes at best the possible in others The thoughts of men are incredibly evanescent merely the foam of their labouring natures and they doubtless vary much more than our trite classifications allow for This is what makes passions and fashions religions and philosophies so hard to conceive when once the trick of them is a little antiquated Languages are hardly more foreign to one another than are the thoughts uttered in them We should give men credit for originality at least in their dreams even if they have little of it to show elsewhere and as it was discovered but recently that all memories are not furnished with the like material images but often have no material images whatever so it may have to be acknowledged that the disparity in men s soliloquies is enormous and that some races perhaps live content without soliloquising at all Sidenote Experience a reconstruction Nevertheless in describing what happens or in enforcing a given view of things we constantly refer to universal experience as if everybody was agreed about what universal experience is and had personally gathered it all since the days of Adam In fact each man has only his own the remnant saved from his personal acquisitions On the basis of this his residual endowment he has to conceive all nature with whatever experiences may have fallen there to the lot of others Universal experience is a comfortable fiction a distinctly ideal construction and no fund available for any one to draw from which of course is not to deny that tradition and books in transmitting materially the work of other generations tend to assimilate us also to their mind The result of their labours in language learning and institutions forms a hothouse in which to force our seedling fancy to a rational growth but the influence is physical the environment is material and its ideal background or significance has to be inferred by us anew according to our imaginative faculty and habits Past experience apart from its monuments is fled for ever out of mortal reach It is now a parcel of the motionless ether of the ineffectual truth about what once was To know it we must evoke it within ourselves starting from its inadequate expressions still extant in the world This reconstruction is highly speculative and as Spinoza noted better evidence of what we are than of what other men have been Sidenote The honest art of education When we appeal to general experience then what we really have to deal with is our interlocutor s power of imagining that experience for the real experience is dead and ascended into heaven where it can neither answer nor hear Our agreements or divergences in this region do not touch science they concern only friendship and unanimity All our proofs are as they say in Spain pure conversation and as the purpose and best result can be only to kindle intelligence and propagate an ideal art the method should be Socratic genial literary In these matters the alternative to imagination is not science but sophistry We may perhaps entangle our friends in their own words and force them for the moment to say what they do not mean and what it is not in their natures to think but the bent bow will spring back perhaps somewhat sharply and we shall get little thanks for our labour There would be more profit in taking one another frankly by the hand and walking together along the outskirts of real knowledge pointing to the material facts which we all can see nature the monuments the texts the actual ways and institutions of men and in the presence of such a stimulus with the contagion of a common interest the plastic mind would respond of itself to the situation and we should be helping one another to understand whatever lies within the range of our fancy be it in antiquity or in the human heart That would be a true education and while the result could not possibly be a science not even a science of people s states of mind it would be a deepening of humanity in ourselves and a wholesome knowledge of our ignorance Sidenote Arbitrary readings of the mind In what is called psychology this loose imaginative method is often pursued although the field covered may be far narrower Any generic experience of which a writer pretends to give an exact account must be reconstructed ad hoc it is not the experience that necessitates the description but the description that recalls the experience defining it in a novel way When La Rochefoucauld says for instance that there is something about our friend s troubles that secretly pleases us many circumstances in our own lives or in other people s may suddenly recur to us to illustrate that apercu and we may be tempted to say There is a truth But is it a scientific truth Or is it merely a bit of satire a ray from a literary flashlight giving a partial clearness for a moment to certain jumbled memories If the next day we open a volume of Adam Smith and read that man is naturally benevolent that he cannot but enact and share the vicissitudes of his fellow creatures and that another man s imminent danger or visible torment will cause in him a distress little inferior to that felt by the unfortunate sufferer we shall probably think this a truth also and a more normal and a profounder truth than the other But is it a law Is it a scientific discovery that can lead us to definite inferences about what will happen or help us to decompose a single event accurately and without ambiguity into its component forces Not only is such a thing impossible but the Scotch philosopher s amiable generalities perhaps largely applicable to himself and to his friends of the eighteenth century may fail altogether to fit an earlier or a later age and every new shade of brute born into the world will ground a new theory of the moral sentiments The whole cogency of such psychology therefore lies in the ease with which the hearer on listening to the analysis recasts something in his own past after that fashion These endless rival apperceptions regard facts that until they are referred to their mechanical ground show no continuity and no precision in their march The apperception of them consequently must be doubly arbitrary and unstable for there is no method in the subject matter and there is less in the treatment of it The views however are far from equal in value Some may be more natural eloquent enlightening than others they may serve better the essential purpose of reflection which is to pick out and bring forward continually out of the past what can have a value for the present The spiritual life in which this value lies is practical in its associations because it understands and dominates what touches action yet it is contemplative in essence since successful action consists in knowing what you are attempting and in attempting what you can find yourself achieving Plan and performance will alike appeal to imagination and be appreciated through it so that what trains imagination refines the very stuff that life is made of Science is instrumental in comparison since the chief advantage that comes of knowing accurately is to be able with safety to imagine freely But when it is science and accurate knowledge that we pursue we should not be satisfied with literature Sidenote Human nature appealed to rather than described When discourse on any subject would be persuasive it appeals to the interlocutor to think in a certain dynamic fashion inciting him not without leading questions to give shape to his own sentiments Knowledge of the soul insight into human nature and experience are no doubt requisite in such an exercise yet this insight is in these cases a vehicle only an instinctive method while the result aimed at is agreement on some further matter conviction and enthusiasm rather than psychological information Thus if I declare that the storms of winter are not so unkind as benefits forgot I say something which if true has a certain psychological value for it could be inferred from that assertion that resentment is generally not proportionate to the injury received but rather to the surprise caused so that it springs from our own foolishness more than from other people s bad conduct Yet my observation was not made in the interest of any such inferences it was made to express an emotion of my own in hopes of kindling in others a similar emotion It was a judgment which others were invited to share There was as little exact science about it as if I had turned it into frank poetry and exclaimed Blow blow thou winter s wind Knowledge of human nature might be drawn even from that apostrophe and a very fine shade of human feeling is surely expressed in it as Shakespeare utters it but to pray or to converse is not for that reason the same thing as to pursue science Now it constantly happens in philosophic writing that what is supposed to go on in the human mind is described and appealed to in order to support some observation or illustrate some argument as continually for instance in the older English critics of human nature or in these very pages What is offered in such cases is merely an invitation to think after a certain fashion A way of grasping or interpreting some fact is suggested with a more or less civil challenge to the reader to resist the suasion of his own experience so evoked and represented Such a method of appeal may be called psychological in the sense that it relies for success on the total movement of the reader s life and mind without forcing a detailed assent through ocular demonstration or pure dialectic but the psychology of it is a method and a resource rather than a doctrine The only doctrine aimed at in such philosophy is a general reasonableness a habit of thinking straight from the elements of experience to its ultimate and stable deliverance This is what in his way a poet or a novelist would do Fiction swarms with such sketches of human nature and such renderings of the human mind as a critical philosopher depends upon for his construction He need not be interested in the pathology of individuals nor even in the natural history of man his effort is wholly directed toward improving the mind s economy and infusing reason into it as one might religion not without diligent self examination and a public confession of sin The human mind is nobody s mind in particular and the science of it is necessarily imaginative No one can pretend in philosophic discussion any more than in poetry that the experience described is more than typical It is given out not for a literal fact existing in particular moments or persons but for an imaginative expression of what nature and life have impressed on the speaker In so far as others live in the same world they may recognise the experience so expressed by him and adopt his interpretation but the aptness of his descriptions and analyses will not constitute a science of mental states but rather what is a far greater thing the art of stimulating and consolidating reflection in general Sidenote Dialectic in psychology There is a second constituent of current psychology which is indeed a science but not a science of matters of fact I mean the dialectic of ideas The character of father for example implies a son and this relation involved in the ideas both of son and of father implies further that a transmitted essence or human nature is shared by both Every idea if its logical texture is reflected upon will open out into a curious world constituted by distinguishing the constituents of that idea more clearly and making explicit its implicit structure and relations When an idea has practical intent and is a desire its dialectic is even more remarkable If I love a man I thereby love all those who share whatever makes me love him and I thereby hate whatever tends to deprive him of this excellence If it should happen however that those who resembled him most in amiability say by flattering me no less than he did were precisely his mortal enemies the logic of my affections would become somewhat involved I might end either by striving to reconcile the rivals or by discovering that what I loved was not the man at all but only an office exercised by him in my regard which any one else might also exercise These inner lucubrations however while they lengthen the moment s vista and deepen present intent give no indication whatever about the order or distribution of actual feelings They are out of place in a psychology that means to be an account of what happens in the world For these dialectical implications do not actually work themselves out They have no historical or dynamic value The man that by mistake or courtesy I call a father may really have no son any more than Herodotus for being the father of history or having had a son he may have lost him or the creature sprung from his loins may be a misshapen idiot having nothing ideal in common with his parent Similarly my affection for a friend having causes much deeper than discourse may cling to him through all transformations in his qualities and in his attitude toward me and it may never pass to others for resembling him nor take in all its days a Platonic direction The impulse on which that dialectic was based may exhaust its physical energy and all its implications may be nipped in the bud and be condemned for ever to the limbo of things unborn Sidenote Spinoza on the passions Spinoza s account of the passions is a beautiful example of dialectical psychology beautiful because it shows so clearly the possibilities and impossibilities in such a method Spinoza began with self preservation which was to be the principle of life and the root of all feelings The violence done to physics appears in this beginning Self preservation taken strictly is a principle not illustrated in nature where everything is in flux and where habits destructive or dangerous to the body are as conspicuous as protective instincts Physical mechanism requires reproduction which implies death and it admits suicide Spinoza himself far too noble a mind to be fixed solely on preserving its own existence was compelled to give self preservation an extravagant meaning in order to identify it with intellectual love of God or the happy contemplation of that natural law which destroyed all individuals To find the self preserving man you must take him after he has ceased to grow and before he has begun to love Self preservation being thus no principle of natural history the facts or estimations classed under that head need to be referred instead to one of two other principles either to mechanical equilibrium and habit or to dialectical consistency in judgment Self preservation might express perhaps the values which conceived events acquire in respect to a given attitude of will to an arrested momentary ideal The actual state of any animal his given instincts and tensions are undoubtedly the point of origin from which all changes and relations are morally estimated and if this attitude is afterward itself subjected to estimation that occurs by virtue of its affinity or conflict with the living will of another moment Valuation is dialectical not descriptive nor contemplative of a natural process It might accordingly be developed by seeing what is implied in the self preservation or rather expression of a will which by that dialectic would discover its ideal scope Such a principle however could never explain the lapse of that attitude itself A natural process cannot be governed by the ideal relations which conceived things acquire by being represented in one of its moments Spinoza however let himself wander into this path and made the semblance of an attempt indeed not very deceptive to trace the sequence of feelings by their mutual implication The changes in life were to be explained by what the crystallised posture of life might be at a single instant The arrow s flight was to be deduced from its instantaneous position A passion s history was to be the history of what would have been its expression if it had had no history at all Sidenote A principle of estimation cannot govern events A man suffered by destiny to maintain for ever a single unchanged emotion might indeed think out its multifarious implications much in Spinoza s way It is in that fashion that parties and sects when somewhat stable come to define their affinities and to know their friends and enemies all over the universe of discourse Suppose for instance that I feel some titillation on reading a proposition concerning the contrast between Paul s idea of Peter and Peter s idea of himself a titillation which is accompanied by the idea of Spinoza its external cause Now he who loves an effect must proportionately love its cause and titillation accompanied by the idea of its external cause is Spinoza has proved what men call love I therefore find that I love Spinoza Having got so far I may consider further referring to another demonstration in the book that if some one gives Spinoza joy Hobbes for instance my delight in Spinoza s increased perfection consequent upon his joy and my love of him accompanied by the idea of Hobbes its external cause constitutes love on my part for the redoubtable Hobbes as well Thus the periphery of my affections may expand indefinitely till it includes the infinite the ultimate external cause of all my titillations But how these interesting discoveries are interrupted before long by a desire for food or by an indomitable sense that Hobbes and the infinite are things I do not love is something that my dialectic cannot deduce for it was the values radiating from a given impulse the implications of its instant object that were being explicated not at all the natural forces that carry a man through that impulse and beyond it to the next phase of his dream a phase which if it continues the former episode must continue it spontaneously by grace of mechanical forces When dialectic is thus introduced into psychology an intensive knowledge of the heart is given out for distributive knowledge of events Such a study when made by a man of genius may furnish good spiritual reading for it will reveal what our passions mean and what sentiments they would lead to if they could remain fixed and dictate all further action This insight may make us aware of strange inconsistencies in our souls and seeing how contrary some of our ideals are to others and how horrible in some cases would be their ultimate expression we may be shocked into setting our house in order and in trying to understand ourselves we may actually develop a self that can be understood Meantime this inner discipline will not enlighten us about the march of affairs It will not give us a key to evolution either in ourselves or in others Even while we refine our aspirations the ground they sprang from will be eaten away beneath our feet Instead of developing yesterday s passion to day may breed quite another in its place and if having grown old and set in our mental posture we are incapable of assuming another and are condemned to carrying on the dialectic of our early visions into a new born world to be a schoolmaster s measuring rod for life s infinite exuberance we shall find ourselves at once in a foreign country speaking a language that nobody understands No destiny is more melancholy than that of the dialectical prophet who makes more rigid and tyrannous every day a message which every day grows less applicable and less significant Sidenote Scientific psychology a part of biology That remaining portion of psychology which is a science and a science of matters of fact is physiological it belongs to natural history and constitutes the biology of man Soul which was not originally distinguished from life is there studied in its natural operation in the body and in the world Psychology then remains what it was in Aristotle s De Anima an ill developed branch of natural science pieced out with literary terms and perhaps enriched by occasional dramatic interpretations The specifically mental or psychic element consists in the feeling which accompanies bodily states and natural situations This feeling is discovered and distributed at the same time that bodies and other material objects are defined for when a man begins to decipher permanent and real things and to understand that they are merely material he thereby sets apart in contrast with such external objects those images and emotions which can no longer enter into the things texture The images and emotions remain however attached to those things for they are refractions of them through bodily organs or effects of their presence on the will or passions fixed upon them as their object In parts of biology which do not deal with man observers do not hesitate to refer in the same way to the pain the desire the intention which they may occasionally read in an animal s aspect Darwin for instance constantly uses psychical language his birds love one another s plumage and their aesthetic charms are factors in natural selection Such little fables do not detract from the scientific value of Darwin s observations because we see at once what the fables mean The description keeps close enough to the facts observed for the reader to stop at the latter rather than at the language in which they are stated In the natural history of man such interpretation into mental terms such microscopic romance is even easier and more legitimate because language allows people perhaps before their feelings are long past to describe them in terms which are understood to refer directly to mental experience The sign s familiarity to be sure often hides in these cases a great vagueness and unseizableness in the facts yet a beginning in defining distinctly the mental phase of natural situations has been made in those small autobiographies which introspective writers sometimes compose or which are taken down in hospitals and laboratories from the lips of subjects What a man under special conditions may say he feels or thinks adds a constituent phase to his natural history and were these reports exact and extended enough it would become possible to enumerate the precise sensations and ideas which accompany every state of body and every social situation Sidenote Confused attempt to detach the psychic element This advantage however is the source of that confusion and sophistry which distinguish the biology of man from the rest of physics Attention is there arrested at the mental term in forgetfulness of the situation which gave it warrant and an invisible world composed of these imagined experiences begins to stalk behind nature and may even be thought to exist independently This metaphysical dream may be said to have two stages the systematic one which is called idealism and an incidental one which pervades ordinary psychology in so far as mental facts are uprooted from their basis and deprived of their expressive or spiritual character in order to be made elements in a dynamic scheme This battle of feelings whether with atoms or exclusively with their own cohorts might be called a primitive materialism rather than an idealism if idealism were to retain its Platonic sense for forms and realisations are taken in this system for substantial elements and are made to figure either as a part or as the whole of the world s matter Sidenote Differentia of the psychic Phenomena specifically mental certainly exist since natural phenomena and ideal truths are concentrated and telescoped in apprehension besides being weighted with an emotion due to their effect on the person who perceives them This variation which reality suffers in being reported to perception turns the report into a mental fact distinguishable from its subject matter When the flux is partly understood and the natural world has become a constant presence the whole flux itself as it flowed originally comes to be called a mental flux because its elements and method are seen to differ from the elements and method embodied in material objects or in ideal truth The primitive phenomena are now called mental because they all deviate from the realities to be ultimately conceived To call the immediate mental is therefore correct and inevitable when once the ultimate is in view but if the immediate were all to call it mental would be unmeaning The visual image of a die for instance has at most three faces none of them quite square no hired artificer is needed to produce it it cannot be found anywhere nor shaken in any box it lasts only for an instant thereafter it disappears without a trace unless it flits back unaccountably through the memory and it leaves no ponderable dust or ashes to attest that it had a substance The opposite of all this is true of the die itself But were no material die in existence the image itself would be material for however evanescent it would occupy space have geometrical shape colour and magic dynamic destinies Its transformations as it rolled on the idea of a table would be transformations in nature however unaccountable by any steady law Such material qualities a mental fact can retain only in the spiritual form of representation A representation of matter is immaterial but a material image when no object exists is a material fact If the Absolute to take an ultimate case perceived nothing but space and atoms perceiving itself if you will therein space and atoms would be its whole nature and it would constitute a perfect materialism The fact that materialism was true would not of itself constitute an idealism worth distinguishing from its opposite For a vehicle or locus exists only when it makes some difference to the thing it carries presenting it in a manner not essential to its own nature Sidenote Approach to irrelevant sentience The qualification of being by the mental medium may be carried to any length As the subject matter recedes the mental datum ceases to have much similarity or inward relevance to what is its cause or its meaning The report may ultimately become like pure pain or pleasure almost wholly blind and irrelevant to any world yet such emotion is none the less immersed in matter and dependent on natural changes both for its origin and for its function since a significant pleasure or pain makes comments on the world and involves ideals about what ought to be happening there Mental facts synchronise with their basis for no thought hovers over a dead brain and there is no vision in a dark chamber but their tenure of life is independent of that of their objects since thought may be prophetic or reminiscent and is intermittent even when its object enjoys a continuous existence Mental facts are similar to their objects since things and images have intrinsically regarded the same constitution but images do not move in the same plane with things and their parts are in no proportionate dynamic relation to the parts of the latter Thought s place in nature is exiguous however broad the landscape it represents it touches the world tangentially only in some ferment of the brain It is probably no atom that supports the soul as Leibnitz imagined but rather some cloud of atoms shaping or remodelling an organism Mind in this case would be in its physical relation to matter what it feels itself to be in its moral attitude toward the same a witness to matter s interesting aspects and a realisation of its forms Sidenote Perception represents things in their practical relation to the body Mental facts moreover are highly selective especially does this appear in respect to the dialectical world which is in itself infinite while the sum of human logic and mathematics though too long for most men s patience is decidedly brief If we ask ourselves on what principle this selection and foreshortening of truth takes place in the mind we may perhaps come upon the real bond and the deepest contrast between mind and its environment The infinity of formal truth is disregarded in human thought when it is irrelevant to practice and to happiness the infinity of nature is represented there in violent perspective centring about the body and its interests The seat and starting point of every mental survey is a brief animal life A mind seems then to be a consciousness of the body s interests expressed in terms of what affects that body as if in the Babel of nature a man heard only the voices that pronounced his name A mind is a private view it is gathered together in proportion as physical sensibility extends its range and makes one stretch of being after another tributary to the animal s life and in proportion also as this sensibility is integrated so that every organ in its reaction enlists the resources of every other organ as well A personal will and intelligence thus arise and they direct action from within with a force and freedom which are exactly proportionate to the material forces within and without the body which the soul has come to represent In other words mind raises to an actual existence that form in material processes which had the processes remained wholly material would have had only ideal or imputed being as the stars would not have been divided into the signs of the Zodiac but for the fanciful eye of astrologers Automata might arise and be destroyed without any value coming or going only a form loving observer could say that anything fortunate or tragic had occurred as poets might at the budding or withering of a flower Some of nature s automata however love themselves and comment on the form they achieve or abandon these constellations of atoms are genuine beasts Their consciousness and their interest in their own individuality rescues that individuality from the realm of discourse and from having merely imputed limits Sidenote Mind the existence in which form becomes actual That the basis of mind lies in the body s interests rather than in its atoms may seem a doctrine somewhat too poetical for psychology yet may not poetry superposed on material existence and supported by it be perhaps the key to mind Such a view hangs well together with the practical and prospective character of consciousness with its total dependence on the body its cognitive relevance to the world and its formal disparity from material being Mind does not accompany body like a useless and persistent shadow it is significant and it is intermittent Much less can it be a link in physiological processes processes irrelevant to its intent and incompatible with its immaterial essence Consciousness seems to arise when the body assumes an attitude which being an attitude supervenes upon the body s elements and cannot be contained within them This attitude belongs to the whole body in its significant operation and the report of this attitude its expression requires survey synthesis appreciation things which constitute what we call mentality This remains of course the mentality of that material situation it is the voice of that particular body in that particular pass The mind therefore represents its basis but this basis being a form of material existence and not matter itself is neither vainly reduplicated by representation nor used up materially in the process Representation is far from idle since it brings to focus those mechanical unities which otherwise would have existed only potentially and at the option of a roving eye In evoking consciousness nature makes this delimination real and unambiguous there are henceforth actual centres and actual interests in the mechanical flux The flux continues to be mechanical but the representation of it supervening has created values which being due to imputation could not exist without being imputed while at the same time they could not have been imputed without being attached to one object or event rather than to another Material dramas are thus made moral and raised to an existence of their own by being expressed in what we call the souls of animals and men a mind is the entelechy of an organic body E It is a region where form breeds an existence to express it and destiny becomes important by being felt Mind adds to being a new and needful witness so soon as the constitution of being gives foothold to apperception of its movement and offers something in which it is possible to ground an interest That Aristotle has not been generally followed in views essentially so natural and pregnant as these is due no doubt to want of thoroughness in conceiving them not only on the part of his readers but even on his own part for he treated the soul which should be on his own theory only an expression and an unmoved mover as a power and an efficient cause Analysis had not gone far enough in his day to make evident that all dynamic principles are mechanical and that mechanism can obtain only among objects but by this time it should no longer seem doubtful that mental facts can have no connection except through their material basis and no mutual relevance except through their objects Sidenote Attempt at idealistic physics There is indeed a strange half assumption afloat a sort of reserved faith which every one seems to respect but nobody utters to the effect that the mental world has a mechanism of its own and that ideas intelligently produce and sustain one another Systematic idealists to be sure have generally given a dialectical or moral texture to the cosmos so that the passage from idea to idea in experience need not be due in their physics to any intrinsic or proportionate efficacy in these ideas themselves The march of experience is not explained at all by such high cosmogonies They abandon that practical calculation to some science of illusion that has to be tolerated in this provisional life Their own understanding is of things merely in the gross because they fall in with some divine plan and produce unaccountably enough some interesting harmony Empirical idealists on the contrary in making a metaphysics out of psychology hardly know what they do The laws of experience which they refer to are all laws of physics It is only the possibilities of sensation that stand and change according to law the sensations themselves if not referred to those permanent possibilities would be a chaos worse than any dream Correct and scrupulous as empiricism may be when it turns its face backward and looks for the seat the criterion and the elements of knowledge it is altogether incoherent and self inhibited when it looks forward It can believe in nothing but in what it conceives if it would rise at all above a stupid immersion in the immediate yet the relations which attach the moments of feeling together are material relations implying the whole frame of nature Psychology can accordingly conceive nothing but the natural world with its diffuse animation since this is the only background that the facts suggest or that in practice anybody can think of If empiricism trusted the intellect and consented to immerse flying experience in experience understood it would become ordinary science and ordinary common sense Deprecating this result for no very obvious reason it has to balance itself on the thin edge of an unwilling materialism with a continual protestation that it does not believe in anything that it thinks It is wholly entangled in the prevalent sophism that a man must renounce a belief when he discovers how he has formed it and that our ancestors at least the remoter ones begin to exist when we discover them When Descartes having composed a mechanical system of the world was asked by admiring ladies to say something about the passions what came into his mind was characteristically simple and dialectical Life he thought was a perpetual conflict between reason and the emotions The soul had its own natural principle to live by but was diverted from that rational path by the waves of passion that beat against it and sometimes flooded it over That was all his psychology Ideal entities in dramatic relations in a theatre which had to be borrowed of course from the other half of the world because while a material mechanism might be conceived without minds in it minds in action could not be conceived without a material mechanism at least a represented one lying beneath and between Spinoza made a great improvement in the system by attaching the mind more systematically to the body and studying the parts which organ and object played in qualifying knowledge but his conception of mental unities and mental processes remained literary or at best as we have seen dialectical No shadow of a principle at once psychic and genetic appeared in his philosophy All mind was still a transcript of material facts or a deepening of moral relations Sidenote Association not efficient The idea of explaining the flow of ideas without reference to bodies appeared however in the principle of association This is the nearest approach that has yet been made to a physics of disembodied mind something which idealism sadly needs to develop A terrible incapacity however appears at once in the principle of association for even if we suppose that it could account for the flow of ideas it does not pretend to supply any basis for sensations And as the more efficient part of association association by contiguity is only a repetition in ideas of the order once present in impressions the whole question about the march of mental experience goes back to what association does not touch namely the origin of sensations What everybody assumed of course was that the order and quality of sensations were due to the body but their derivation was not studied Hume ignored it as much as possible and Berkeley did not sacrifice a great deal when he frankly suggested that the production of sensation must be the direct work of God This tendency not to recognise the material conditions of mind showed itself more boldly in the treatment of ideation We are not plainly aware in spite of headaches fatigue sleep love intoxication and madness that the course of our thoughts is as directly dependent on the body as is their inception It was therefore possible without glaring paradox to speak as if ideas caused one another They followed in recurring the order they had first had in experience as when we learn something by heart Why a previous verse being given we should sometimes be unable to repeat the one that had often followed it before there was no attempt to explain it sufficed that reverie often seemed to retrace events in their temporal order Even less dependent on material causes seemed to be the other sort of association association by similarity This was a feat for the wit and the poet to jump from China to Peru by virtue of some spark of likeness that might flash out between them Sidenote It describes coincidences Much natural history has been written and studied with the idea of finding curious facts The demand has not been for constant laws or intelligibility but for any circumstance that could arrest attention or divert the fancy In this spirit doubtless instances of association were gathered and classified It was the young ladies botany of mind Under association could be gathered a thousand interesting anecdotes a thousand choice patterns of thought Talk of the wars says Hobbes once led a man to ask what was the value of a Roman penny But why only once The wars must have been often mentioned when the delivering up of King Charles did not enter any mind and when it did this would not have led any one to think of Judas and the thirty pence unless he had been a good royalist and a good Christian and then only by a curious accident It was not these ideas then in their natural capacity that suggested one another but some medium in which they worked once in the world opened those particular avenues between them Nevertheless no one cared to observe that each fact had had many others never recalled associated with it as closely as those which were remembered Nor was the matter taken so seriously that one needed to ask how among all similar things similarity could decide which should be chosen nor how among a thousand contiguous facts one rather than another should be recalled for contiguity s sake Sidenote Understanding is based on instinct and expressed in dialectic The best instance perhaps of regular association might be found in language and its meaning for understanding implies that each word habitually calls up its former associates Yet in what psychologically considered does understanding a word consist What concomitants does the word horse involve in actual sentience Hardly a clear image such as a man might paint for the name is not confined to recalling one view of one animal obtained at one moment Perhaps all that recurs is a vague sense of the environment in nature and in discourse in which that object lies The word kite would immediately make a different region warm in the world through which the mind was groping One would turn in idea to the sky rather than to the ground and feel suggestions of a more buoyant sort of locomotion Understanding has to be described in terms of its potential outcome since the incandescent process itself as it exists in transit will not suffer stable terms to define it Potentiality is something which each half of reality reproaches the other with things are potential to feeling because they are not life and feelings are potential to science because they elude definition To understand therefore is to know what to do and what to say in the sign s presence and this practical knowledge is far deeper than any echo casually awakened in fancy at the same time Instinctive recognition has those echoes for the most superficial part of its effect Because I understand what horse means the word can make me recall some episode in which a horse once figured This understanding is instinctive and practical and if the phrase may be pardoned it is the body that understands It is the body namely that contains the habit and readiness on which understanding hangs and the sense of understanding the instant rejection of whatever clashes and makes nonsense in that context is but a transcript of the body s education Actual mind is all above board it is all speculative vibrant the fruit and gift of those menial subterranean processes Some generative processes may be called psychic in that they minister to mind and lend it what little continuity it can boast of but they are not processes in consciousness Processes in consciousness are aesthetic or dialectical processes focussing a form rather than ushering in an existence Mental activity has a character altogether alien to association it is spiritual not mechanical an entelechy not a genesis Sidenote Suggestion a fancy name for automatism For these and other reasons association has fallen into some disrepute but it is not easy to say what in absolute psychology has come to take its place If we speak of suggestion a certain dynamic turn seems to be given to the matter yet in what sense a perception suggests its future development remains a mystery That a certain ripening and expansion of consciousness goes on in man not guided by former collocations of ideas is very true for we do not fall in love for the first time because this person loved and these ardent emotions have been habitually associated in past experience And any impassioned discourse opening at every turn into new vistas shows the same sort of vegetation Yet to observe that consciousness is automatic is not to disclose the mechanism by which it evolves The theory of spontaneous growth offers less explanation of events if that be possible than the theory of association It is perhaps a better description of the facts since at least it makes no attempt to deduce them from one another Sidenote and will another If on the contrary a relation implied in the burden or will of the moment be invoked the connection established so far as it goes is dialectical Where a dialectical correspondence is not found a material cause would have to be appealed to Such a half dialectical psychology would be like Schopenhauer s quite metaphysical It might be a great improvement on an absolute psychology because it would restore even if in mythical terms a background and meaning to life The unconscious Absolute Will the avid Genius of the Species the all attracting Platonic Ideas are fabulous but beneath them it is not hard to divine the forces of nature This volitional school supplies a good stepping stone from metaphysics back to scientific psychology It remains merely to substitute instinct for will and to explain that instinct or even will if the term be thought more consoling is merely a word covering that operative organisation in the body which controls action determines affinities dictates preferences and sustains ideation Sidenote Double attachment of mind to nature What scientific psychology has to attempt for little has been accomplished may be reduced to this To develop physiology and anthropology until the mechanism of life becomes clear at least in its general method and then to determine by experiment and by well sifted testimony what conscious sublimation each of those material situations attains if indeed it attains any There will always remain no doubt many a region where the machinery of nature is too fine for us to trace or eludes us by involving agencies that we lack senses to perceive In these regions where science is denied we shall have to be satisfied with landscape painting The more obvious results and superficial harmonies perceived in those regions will receive names and physics will be arrested at natural history Where these unexplained facts are mental it will not be hard to do more systematically what common sense has done already and to attach them as we attach love or patriotism to the natural crises that subtend them This placing of mental facts is made easy by the mental facts themselves since the connection of mind with nature is double and even when the derivation of a feeling is obscure we have but to study its meaning allowing it to tell us what it is interested in for a roundabout path to lead us safely back to its natural basis It is superfluous to ask a third person what circumstances produce hunger hunger will lead you unmistakably enough to its point of origin and its extreme interest in food will not suffer you long to believe that want of nourishment has nothing to do with its cause And it is not otherwise with higher emotions and ideas Nothing but sophistry can put us in doubt about what conscience represents for conscience does not say square the circle extinguish mankind so as to stop its sufferings or steal so as to benefit your heirs It says Thou shalt not kill and it also says Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God who brought thee out of the land of Egypt So that conscience by its import and incidence clearly enough declares what it springs from a social tradition and what it represents the interests real or imaginary of the community in which you were reared Where psychology depends on literature where both its units and its method are poetical there can be no talk of science We may as justly or as absurdly speak of the spirit of an age or of a religion as of a man s character or a river s god Particulars in illustration may have good historic warrant but the unities superimposed are ideal Such metaphors may be very useful for a man may ordinarily be trusted to continue his practices and a river its beneficent or disastrous floods and since those rhetorical forms have no existence in nature we may continue to frame them as may be most convenient for discourse Sidenote Is the subject matter of psychology absolute being When psychology is a science then it describes the flying consciousness that accompanies bodily life It is the science of feeling or absolute appearance taken exactly as it seems or feels Does such a psychology we may be tempted to ask constitute scientific knowledge of reality Is it at last the true metaphysics This question would have to be answered in the negative yet not without some previous discriminations There is honesty in the conviction that sentience is a sort of absolute it is something which certainly exists The first Cartesian axiom applies to it and to feel even doubtfully that feeling existed would be to posit its existence The science that describes sentience describes at least a part of existence Yet this self grounding of consciousness is a suspicious circumstance it renders it in one sense the typical reality and in another sense perhaps the sorriest illusion Sidenote Sentience is representable only in fancy Reality is an ambiguous term If we mean by it the immediate then sentience would be a part if not the whole of reality for what we mean by sentience or consciousness is the immediate in so far as we contain it and whatever self grounded existence there may be elsewhere can be conceived by us only mythically and on that analogy as if it were an extension or variation of sentience Psychology would then be knowledge of reality for even when consciousness contains elaborate thoughts that might be full of illusions psychology takes them only as so much feeling and in that capacity they are real enough At the same time while our science terminates upon mere feeling it can neither discover nor describe that feeling except in terms of something quite different and the only part of psychology that perhaps penetrates to brute sentience is the part that is not scientific The knowledge that science reaches about absolute states of mind is relative knowledge these states of mind are approached from without and are defined by their surrounding conditions and by their ideal objects They are known by being enveloped in processes of which they themselves are not aware Apart from this setting the only feeling known is that which is endured After the fact or before or from any other point of vantage it cannot be directly revealed at best it may be divined and re enacted Even this possible repetition would not constitute knowledge unless the imaginative reproduction were identified with or attributed to some natural fact so that an adventitious element would always attach to any recognised feeling to any feeling reported to another mind It could not be known at all unless something were known about it so that it might not pass as otherwise it would for a mere ingredient of present sentience It is precisely by virtue of this adventitious element that the re enacted feeling takes its place in nature and becomes an object of knowledge Science furnishes this setting the jewel precious or false must be supplied by imagination Romance dramatic myth is the only instrument for knowing this sort of reality A flying moment if at all understood or underpinned or if seen in its context would be not known absolutely as it had been felt but would be known scientifically and as it lay in nature But dramatic insight striving to pierce through the machinery of the world and to attain and repeat what dreams may be going on at its core is no science and the very notion that the dreams are internal that they make the interior or substance of bodies is a crude materialistic fancy Body on the contrary is the substance or instrument of mind and has to be looked for beneath it The mind is itself ethereal and plays about the body as music about a violin or rather as the sense of a page about the print and paper To look for it within is not to understand what we are looking for Knowledge of the immediate elsewhere is accordingly visionary in its method and furthermore if by a fortunate chance it be true in fact it is true only of what in itself is but appearance for the immediate while absolutely real in its stress or presence is indefinitely ignorant and false in its deliverance It knows itself but in the worst sense of the word knowledge for it knows nothing of what is true about it nothing of its relations and conditions To pierce to this blind reality or psychic flux which is nothing but flying appearance we must rely on fortune or an accidental harmony between imitative fancy in us now and original sentience elsewhere It is accordingly at least misleading to give the name of reality to this appearance which is entirely lost and inconsequential in its being without trace of its own status and consequently approachable or knowable only by divination as a dream might call to another dream Sidenote The conditions and objects of sentinence which are not sentinence are also real It is preferable to give a more Platonic meaning to the word and to let reality designate not what is merely felt diffusely but what is true about those feelings Then dramatic fancy psychology of the sympathetic sort would not be able to reach reality at all On the other hand scientific psychology together with all other sciences would have reality for its object for it would disclose what really was true about sentient moments without stopping particularly to sink abstractedly into their inner quality or private semblance It would approach and describe the immediate as a sentient factor in a natural situation and show us to what extent that situation was represented in that feeling This representation by which the dignity and interest of pure sentience would be measured might be either pictorial or virtual that is a conscious moment might represent the environing world either scientifically by understanding its structure or practically by instinctive readiness to meet it Sidenote Mind knowable and important in so far as it represents other things What for instance is the reality of Napoleon Is it what a telepathic poet a complete Browning might reconstruct Is it Napoleon s life long soliloquy Or to get at the reality should we have to add as scientific psychology would the conditions under which he lived and their relation to his casual feelings Obviously if Napoleon s thoughts had had no reference to the world we should not be able to recover them or if by chance such thoughts fell some day to our share we should attribute them to our own mental luxuriance without suspecting that they had ever visited another genius Our knowledge of his life even where it is imaginative depends upon scientific knowledge for its projection and his fame and immortality depend on the degree to which his thoughts being rooted in the structure of the world and pertinent to it can be rationally reproduced in others and attributed to him Napoleon s consciousness might perhaps be more justly identified with the truth or reality of him than could that of most people because he seems to have been unusually cognisant of his environment and master of the forces at work in it and in himself He understood his causes and function and knew that he had arisen like all the rest of history and that he stood for the transmissible force and authority of greater things Such a consciousness can be known in proportion as we too possess knowledge and is worth the pains something which could not be said of the absolute sentience of Dick or Harry which has only material being brute existence without relevance to anything nor understanding of itself The circumstances open to science which surround consciousness are thus real attributes of a man by which he is truly known and distinguished Appearances are the qualities of reality else realities would be without place time character or interrelation In knowing that Napoleon was a Corsican a short man with a fine countenance we know appearances only but these appearances are true of the reality And if the presumable inner appearances Napoleon s long soliloquy were separated from the others those inner appearances would not belong to Napoleon nor have any home in the knowable world That which physics with its concomitant psychology might discover in a man is the sum of what is true about him seeing that a man is a concretion in existence the fragment of a world and not a definition Appearances define the constituent elements of his reality which could not be better known than through their means FOOTNOTES Footnote E Aristotle called the soul the first entelechy of such a body This first entelechy is what we should call life since it is possessed by a man asleep The French I know but do not use is in its first entelechy the French I am actually speaking is in its second Consciousness is therefore the second or actualised entelechy of its body CHAPTER VI THE NATURE OF INTENT Sidenote Dialectic better than physics Common knowledge passes from memory to history and from history to mechanism and having reached that point it may stop to look back not without misgivings over the course it has traversed and thus become psychology These investigations taken together constitute physics or the science of existence But this is only half of science and on the whole the less interesting and less fundamental half No existence is of moment to a man not even his own unless it touches his will and fulfils or thwarts his intent Unless he is concerned that existences should be of specific kinds unless he is interested in form he can hardly be interested in being At the very least in terms of pleasure versus pain light versus darkness comfort versus terror the flying moment must be loaded with obloquy or excellence if its passage is not to remain a dead fact and to sink from the sphere of actuality altogether into that droning limbo of potentialities which we call matter Being which is indifferent to form is only the material of being To exist is nothing if you have nothing to do if there is nothing to choose or to distinguish or if those things which belong to a chosen form are not gathered into it before your eyes to express what we call a truth or an excellence Existence naturally precedes any idealisation of it which men can contrive since they at least must exist first yet in the order of values knowledge of existence is subsidiary to knowledge of ideals If it be true that a good physics is as yet the predominant need in science and that man is still most troubled by his ignorance of matters of fact this circumstance marks his illiberal condition Without knowledge of existence nothing can be done but nothing is really done until something else is known also the use or excellence that existence may have It is a great pity that those finer temperaments that are naturally addressed to the ideal should have turned their energies to producing bad physics or to preventing others from establishing natural truths for if physics were established on a firm basis the idealists would for the first time have a free field They might then recover their proper function of expressing the mind honestly and disdain the sorry attempt to prolong confusion and to fish in troubled waters Sidenote Maladjustments to nature render physics conspicuous and unpleasant Perhaps if physical truth had not been so hugely misrepresented in men s faith and conduct it would not need to be minutely revealed or particularly emphasised When the conditions surrounding life are not rightly faced by instinct they are inevitably forced upon reflection through painful shocks and for a long time the new habit thus forced upon men brings to consciousness not so much the movement of consciousness itself as the points at which its movement impinges on the external world and feels checks and frictions Physics thus becomes inordinately conspicuous as when philology submerges the love of letters for lack of a good disposition that should allow us to take physics for granted Much in nature is delightful to know and to keep in mind but much also the whole infinite remainder is obscure and uninteresting and were we practically well adjusted to its issue we might gladly absolve ourselves from studying its processes In a world that in extent and complexity so far outruns human energies physical knowledge ought to be largely virtual that is nature ought to be represented by a suitable attitude toward it by the attitude which reason would dictate were knowledge complete and not by explicit ideas Sidenote Physics should be largely virtual The ancients were happily inspired when they imagined that beyond the gods and the fixed stars the cosmos came to an end for the empyrean beyond was nothing in particular nothing to trouble one s self about Many existences are either out of relation to man altogether or have so infinitesimal an influence on his experience that they may be sufficiently represented there by an atom of star dust and it is probable that if out of pure curiosity we wished to consider very remote beings and had the means of doing so we should find the detail of existence in them wholly incommensurable with anything we can conceive Such beings could be known virtually only in that we might speak of them in the right key representing them in appropriate symbols and might move in their company with the right degree of respectful indifference Sidenote and dialectic explicit The present situation of science however reverses the ideal one Physics in so far as it exists is explicit and at variance with our acquired attitude toward things so that we may justly infer by the shock our little knowledge gives us that our presumptions and assumptions have been so egregious that more knowledge would give us still greater shocks Meantime dialectic or knowledge of ideal things remains merely virtual The ideal usually comes before us only in revulsions which we cannot help feeling against some scandalous situation or some intolerable muddle We have no time or genius left after our agitated soundings and balings to think of navigation as a fine art or to consider freely the sea and sky or the land we are seeking The proper occupation of the mind is gone or rather not initiated A further bad consequence of this illiberal state is that among many who have in spite of the times adoration in their souls to adore physics to worship Being seems a philosophical religion whereas of course it is the essence of idolatry The true God is an object of intent an ideal of excellence and knowledge not a term belonging to sense or to probable hypothesis or to the prudent management of affairs After we have squared our accounts with nature and taken sufficient thought for our bodily necessities the eyes can be lifted for the first time to the eternal The rest was superstition and the quaking use of a false physics That appeal to the supernatural which while the danger threatens is but forlorn medicine after the blow has fallen may turn to sublime wisdom This wisdom has cast out the fear of material evils and dreads only that the divine should not come down and be worthily entertained among us In art in politics in that form of religion which is superior and not inferior to politics and art we define and embody intent and the intent embodied dignifies the work and lends interest to its conditions So in science it is dialectic that makes physics speculative and worthy of a free mind The baser utilities of material knowledge would leave life itself perfectly vain if they did not help it to take on an ideal shape Ideal life in so far as it constitutes science is dialectical It consists in seeing how things hang together perspicuously and how the later phases of any process fill out as in good music the tendency and promise of what went before This derivation may be mathematical or it may be moral but in either case the data and problem define the result dialectic being insight into their inherent correspondence Sidenote Intent is vital and indescribable Intent is one of many evidences that the intellect s essence is practical Intent is action in the sphere of thought it corresponds to transition and derivation in the natural world Analytic psychology is obliged to ignore intent for it is obliged to regard it merely as a feeling but while the feeling of intent is a fact like any other intent itself is an aspiration a passage the recognition of an object which not only is not a part of the feeling given but is often incapable of being a feeling or a fact at all What happened to motion under the Eleatic analysis happens to intent under an anatomising reflection The parts do not contain the movement of transition which makes them a whole Moral experience is not expressible in physical categories because while you may give place and date for every feeling that something is important or is absurd you cannot so express what these feelings have discovered and have wished to confide to you The importance and the absurdity have disappeared Yet it is this pronouncement concerning what things are absurd or important that makes the intent of those judgments To touch it you have to enter the moral world that is you have to bring some sympathetic or hostile judgment to bear on those you are considering and to meet intent not by noting its existence but by estimating its value by collating it with your own intent If some one says two and two are five you are no counter mathematician when you conscientiously put it down that he said so Your science is not relevant to his intent until you run some risk yourself in that arena and say No two and two are four Sidenote It is analogous to flux in existence Feelings and ideas when plucked and separately considered do not retain the intent that made them cognitive or living yet in their native medium they certainly lived and knew If this ideality or transcendence seems a mystery it is such only in the sense in which every initial or typical fact is mysterious Every category would be unthinkable if it were not actually used The mystery in this instance has however all that can best serve to make a mystery homely and amiable It is supported by a strong analogy to other familiar mysteries The fact that intellect has intent and does not constitute or contain what it envisages is like the fact that time flows that bodies gravitate that experience is gathered or that existence is suspended between being and not being Propagation in animals is mysterious and familiar in the same fashion Cognition too is an expedient for vanquishing instability As reproduction circumvents mortality and preserves a semblance of permanence in the midst of change so intent regards what is not yet or not here or what exists no longer Thus the pulverisation proper to existence is vanquished by thought which in a moment announces or commemorates other moments together with the manner of their approach or recession The mere image of what is absent constitutes no knowledge of it a dream is not knowledge of a world like it existing elsewhere it is simply another more fragile world What renders the image cognitive is the intent that projects it and deputes it to be representative It is cognitive only in use when it is the vehicle of an assurance which may be right or wrong because it takes something ulterior for its standard Sidenote It expresses natural life We may give intent a somewhat more congenial aspect if we remember that thought comes to animals in proportion to their docility in the world and to their practical competence The more plastic a being is to experience so long as he retains vital continuity and a cumulative structure the more intelligent he becomes Intelligence is an expression of adaptation of impressionable and prophetic structure What wonder then that intelligence should speak of the things that inspire it and that lend it its oracular and practical character namely of things at that moment absent and merely potential in other words of the surrounding world Mere feeling might suffice to translate into consciousness each particle of protoplasm in its isolation but to translate the relations of that particle to what is not itself and to express its response to those environing presences intent and conscious signification are required Intellect transcends the given and means the absent because life of which intellect is the fulfilment or entelechy is itself absorbed from without and radiated outward As life depends on an equilibrium of material processes which reach far beyond the individual they sustain in being so intent is a recognition of outlying existences which sustain in being that very sympathy by which they are recognised Intent and life are more than analogous If we use the word life in an ideal sense the two are coincident for as Aristotle says the act proper to intellect is life F The flux is so pervasive so subtle in its persistency that even those miracles which suspend it must somehow share its destiny Intent bridges many a chasm but only by leaping across The life that is sustained for years the political or moral purpose that may bind whole races together is condemned to be partly a memory and partly a plan and wholly an ideal Its scope is nothing but the range to which it can continually extend its sympathies and its power of representation Its moments have nothing in common except their loyalties and a conspiring interest in what is not themselves Sidenote It has a material basis This moral energy so closely analogous to physical interplay is of course not without a material basis Spiritual sublimation does not consist in not using matter but in using it up in making it all useful When life becomes rational it continues to be mechanical and to take up room and energy in the natural world That new direction of attention upon form which finds in facts instances of ideas does not occur without a certain heat and labour in the brain In its most intimate and supernatural functions intellect has natural conditions In dreams and madness intent is confused and wayward in idiocy it is suspended altogether nor has discourse any other pledge that it is addressing kindred interlocutors except that which it receives from the disposition and habit of bodies People who have not yet been born into the world have not yet begun to think about it There is of course an inner dialectical relevance among all propositions that have the same ideal theme no matter how remote or unknown to one another those who utter the propositions may be but the medium in which this infinite dialectical network is woven is motionless and indifferent to the direction in which thought might traverse it in other words it is not discourse or intelligence but eternal truth From the point of view of experience this prior dialectical relation of form to form is merely potential for the thoughts between which it would obtain need never exist or be enacted There is society only among incarnate ideas and it is only by expressing some material situation that an idea is selected out of the infinity of not impossible ideas and promoted to the temporal dignity of actual thought Sidenote It is necessarily relevant to earth Moreover even if the faculty of intelligence were disembodied and could exist in a vacuum it would still be a vain possession if no data were given for it to operate upon and if no particular natural structure animal social or artistic were at hand for intelligence to ally itself to and defend Reason would in that case die of inanition it would have no subject matter and no sanction as well as no seat Intelligence is not a substance it is a principle of order and of art it requires a given situation and some particular natural interest to bring it into play In fact it is nothing but a name for the empire which conscious but at bottom irrational interests attain over the field in which they operate it is the fruition of life the token of successful operation Every theme or motive in the Life of Reason expresses some instinct rooted in the body and incidental to natural organisation The intent by which memory refers to past or absent experience or the intent by which perception becomes recognition is a transcript of relations in which events actually stand to one another Such intent represents modifications of structure and action important to life modifications that have responded to forces on which life is dependent Both desire and meaning translate into cognitive or ideal energy into intent mechanical relations subsisting in nature These mechanical relations give practical force to the thought that expresses them and the thought in turn gives significance and value to the forces that subserve it Fulfilment is mutual in one direction bringing material potentialities to the light and making them actual and conscious and in the other direction embodying intent in the actual forms of things and manifesting reason Nothing could be more ill considered than the desire to disembody reason Reason cries aloud for reunion with the material world which she needs not only for a basis but what concerns her even more for a theme In private and silent discourse when words and grammar are swathed in reverie the material basis and reference of thought may be forgotten Desire and intent may then seem to disport themselves in a purely ideal realm moral or logical tensions alone may seem to determine the whole process Meditative persons are even inclined to regard the disembodied life which they think they enjoy at such times as the true and native form of experience all organs applications and expressions of thought they deprecate and call accidental As some pious souls reject dogma to reach pure faith and suspend prayer to enjoy union so some mystical logicians drop the world in order to grasp reality It is an exquisite suicide but the energy and ideal that sustain such a flight are annihilated by its issue and the soul drops like a paper balloon consumed by the very flame that wafted it No thought is found without an organ none is conceivable without an expression which is that organ s visible emanation and none would be significant without a subject matter lying in the world of which that organ is a part Sidenote The basis of intent becomes appreciable in language The natural structure underlying intent is latent in silent thought and its existence might be denied by a sceptical thinker over whose mind the analogies and spirit of physics exercised little influence This hypothetical structure is not however without obvious extensions which imply its existence even where we do not perceive it directly A smile or a blush makes visible to the observer movements which must have been at work in the body while thought occupied the mind even if as more often happens the blush or smile did not precede and introduce the feeling they suggest the feeling which in our verbal mythology is said to cause them No one would be so simple as to suppose that such involuntary signs of feeling spring directly and by miracle out of feeling They surely continue some previous bodily commotion which determines their material character so that laughter for instance becomes a sign of amusement rather than of rage which it might just as well have represented so far as the abstract feeling itself is concerned In the same way a sigh a breath a word are but the last stage and superficial explosion of nervous tensions tensions which from the point of view of their other eventual expressions we might call interplaying impulses or potential memories As these material seethings underlay the budding thought so the uttered word when it comes underlies the perfect conception The word in so far as it is material undeniably continues an internal material process for aphasia and garrulity have known physical causes In the vibrations which we call words the hidden complexities of cerebral action fly out so to speak into the air they become recognisable sounds emitted by lips and tongue and received by the ear The uttered word produces an obvious commotion in nature through it thought being expressed in that its material basis is extended outward becomes at the same moment rational and practical for its expression enters into the chain of its future conditions and becomes an omen of that thought s continuance repetition and improvement Thought s rational function consists as we then perceive in expressing a natural situation and improving that situation by expressing it until such expression becomes a perfect and adequate state of knowledge which justifies both itself and its conditions Expression makes thought a power in the very world from which thought drew its being and renders it in some measure self sustaining and self assured A thirsty man let us say begs for drink Had his petition been a wordless desire it might have been supposed though falsely to be a disembodied and quite immaterial event a transcendental attitude of will without conditions or consequences but somehow with an absolute moral dignity But when the petition became articulate and audible to a fellow mortal who thereupon proceeded to fetch a cup of water the desire through the cry that expressed it obviously asserted itself in the mechanical world to which it already secretly belonged by virtue of its cause a parched body This material background for moral energy which even an inarticulate yearning would not have lacked becomes in language an overt phenomenon linked observably with all other objects and processes Language is accordingly an overflow of the physical basis of thought It is an audible gesture more refined than the visible but in the same sense an automatic extension of nervous and muscular processes Words underlie the thought they are said to express in truth it is the thought that is the flower and expression of the language much as the body underlies the mind Sidenote Intent starts from a datum Language contains side by side two distinct elements One is the meaning or sense of the words a logical projection given to sensuous terms The other is the sensuous vehicle of that meaning the sound sign or gesture This sensuous term is a fulcrum for the lever of signification a point d appui which may be indefinitely attenuated in rapid discourse but not altogether discarded Intent though it vaults high must have something to spring from or it would lend meaning to nothing The minimal sensuous term that subsists serves as a clue to a whole system of possible assertions radiating from it It becomes the sign for an essence or idea a logical hypostasis corresponding in discourse to that material hypostasis of perceptions which is called an external thing The hypostasised total of rational and just discourse is the truth Like the physical world the truth is external and in the main potential Its ideal consistency and permanence serve to make it a standard and background for fleeting assertions just as the material hypostasis called nature is the standard and background for all momentary perceptions What exists of truth in direct experience is at any moment infinitesimal as what exists of nature is but all that either contains might be represented in experience at one time or another G Sidenote and is carried by a feeling The tensions and relations of words which make grammar or make poetry are immediate in essence the force of language being just as empirical as the reality of things To ask a thinker what he means by meaning is as futile as to ask a carpenter what he means by wood to discover it you must emulate them and repeat their experience which indeed you will hardly be able to do if some sophist has so entangled your reason that you can neither understand what you see nor assert what you mean But as the carpenter s acquaintance with wood might be considerably refined if he became a naturalist or liberalised if he became a carver so a casual speaker s sense of what he means might be better focussed by dialectic and more delicately shaded by literary training Meantime the vital act called intent by which consciousness becomes cognitive and practical would remain at heart an indescribable experience a sense of spiritual life as radical and specific as the sense of heat Sidenote It demands conventional expression Significant language forms a great system of ideal tensions contained in the mutual relations of parts of speech and of clauses in propositions Of these tensions the intent in a man s mind at any moment is a living specimen Experience at that moment may have a significance a transitive force that asks to be enshrined in some permanent expression the more acute and irrevocable the crisis is the more urgent the need of transmitting to other moments some cognisance of what was once so great But were this experience to exhale its spirit in a vacuum using no conventional and transmissible medium of expression it would be foiled in its intent It would leave no monument and achieve no immortality in the world of representation for the experience and its expression would remain identical and perish together just as a perception and its object would remain identical and perish together if there were no intelligence to discover the material world to which the perplexing shifts of sensation may be habitually referred Spontaneous expression if it is to be recognisable and therefore in effect expressive labours under the necessity of subordinating itself to an ideal system of expressions a permanent language in which its spontaneous utterances may be embedded By virtue of such adoption into a common medium expression becomes interpretable a later moment may then reconstruct the past out of its surviving memorial Intent beside the form it has in language where it makes the soul of grammar has many other modes of expression in mathematical and logical reasoning in action and in those contemplated and suspended acts which we call estimation policy or morals Moral philosophy the wisdom of Socrates is merely a consideration of intent In intent we pass over from existence to ideality the nexus lying in the propulsive nature of life which could not have been capped by any form of knowledge which was not itself in some way transitive and ambitious Intent though it looks away from existence and the actual is the most natural and pervasive of things Physics and dialectic meet in this that the second brings to fruition what the first describes namely existence and that both have their transcendental root in the flux of being Matter cannot exist without some form much as by shedding every form in succession it may proclaim its aversion to fixity and its radical formlessness or infinitude Nor can form without the treacherous aid of matter pass from its ideal potentiality into selected and instant being Sidenote A fable about matter and form In order to live if such a myth may be allowed the Titan Matter was eager to disguise his incorrigible vagueness and pretend to be something He accordingly addressed himself to the beautiful company of Forms sisters whom he thought all equally beautiful though their number was endless and equally fit to satisfy his heart He wooed them hypocritically with no intention of wedding them yet he uttered their names in such seductive accents called by mortals intelligence and toil that the virgin goddesses offered no resistance at least such of them as happened to be near or of a facile disposition They were presently deserted by their unworthy lover yet they too in that moment s union had tasted the sweetness of life The heaven to which they returned was no longer an infinite mathematical paradise It was crossed by memories of earth and a warmer breath lingered in some of its lanes and grottoes Henceforth its nymphs could not forget that they had awakened a passion and that unmoved themselves they had moved a strange indomitable giant to art and love FOOTNOTES Footnote F Cf the motto on the title page Footnote G Not of course in human experience which is incapable of containing the heart of a flea much less what may be endured in remoter spheres But if an intelligence were constructed ad hoc there is nothing real that might not fall within the scope of experience The difference between existence and truth on the one side and knowledge or representation on the other may be reduced to this that knowledge brings what exists or what is true under apperception while being diffuses what is understood into an impartial subsistence As truth is indistinguishable from an absolute motionless intellect which should no longer be a function of life but merely a static order so existence is indistinguishable from an absolute motionless experience which should no longer be a foreshortening or representation of anything This existence would be motionless in the sense that it would mark time for of course every fact in it might be a fact of transition The whole system however would have a static ideal constitution since the fact that things change in a certain way or stand in a certain order is as much a fact as any other and it is not a logical necessity either but a brute matter of fact that might well have been otherwise CHAPTER VII DIALECTIC Sidenote Dialectic elaborates given forms The advantage which the mechanical sciences have over history is drawn from their mathematical form Mathematics has somewhat the same place in physics that conscience has in action it seems to be a directive principle in natural operations where it is only a formal harmony The formalistic school which treats grammar in all departments as if it were the ground of import rather than a means of expressing it takes mathematics also for an oracular deliverance springing full armed out of the brain and setting up a canon which all concrete things must conform to Thus mathematical science has become a mystery which a myth must be constructed to solve For how can it happen people ask that pure intuition retreating into its cell can evolve there a prodigious system of relations which it carries like a measuring rod into the world and lo everything in experience submits to be measured by it What pre established harmony is this between the spinning cerebral silkworm and nature s satins and brocades If we but knew so the myth runs that experience can show no patterns but those which the prolific Mind has woven we should not wonder at this necessary correspondence The Mind having decreed of its own motion while it sat alone before the creation of the world that it would take to dreaming mathematically it evoked out of nothing all formal necessities and later when it felt some solicitation to play with things it imposed those forms upon all its toys admitting none of any other sort into the nursery In other words perception perfected its grammar before perceiving any of its objects and having imputed that grammar to the materials of sense it was able to perceive objects for the first time and to legislate further about their relations The most obvious artifices of language are often the most deceptive and bring on epidemic prejudices What is this Mind this machine existing prior to existence The mind that exists is only a particular department or focus of existence its principles cannot be its own source much less the source of anything in other beings Mathematical principles in particular are not imposed on existence or on nature ab extra but are found in and abstracted from the subject matter and march of experience To exist things have to wear some form and the form they happen to wear is largely mathematical This being the case the mind in shaping its barbarous prosody somewhat more closely to the nature of things learns to note and to abstract the form that so strikingly defines them Once abstracted and focussed in the mind these forms like all forms reveal their dialectic but that things conform to that dialectic when they do is not wonderful seeing that it is the obvious form of things that the mind has singled out not without practical shrewdness for more intensive study Sidenote Forms are abstracted from existence by intent The difference between ideal and material knowledge does not lie in the ungenerated oracular character of one of them in opposition to the other in both the data are inexplicable and irrational and in both investigation is tentative observant and subject to control by the subject matter The difference lies rather in the direction of speculation In physics which is at bottom historical we study what happens we make inventories and records of events of phenomena of juxtapositions In dialectic which is wholly intensive we study what is we strive to clarify and develop the essence of what we find bringing into focus the inner harmonies and implications of forms forms which our attention or purpose has defined initially The intuitions from which mathematical deduction starts are highly generic notions drawn from observation The lines and angles of geometers are ideals and their ideal context is entirely independent of what may be their context in the world but they are found in the world and their ideals are suggested by very common sensations Had they been invented by some inexplicable parthenogenesis in thought it would indeed have been a marvel had they found application Philosophy has enough notions of this inapplicable sort usually however not very recondite in their origin to show that dialectic when it seems to control existence must have taken more than one hint from the subject world and that in the realm of logic too nothing submits to be governed without representation Sidenote Confusion comes of imperfect abstraction or ambiguous intent When dialectic is employed as in ethics and metaphysics upon highly complex ideas concretions in discourse which cover large blocks of existence the dialectician in defining and in deducing often reaches notions which cease to apply in some important respect to the object originally intended Thus Socrates taking courage for his theme treats it dialectically and expresses the intent of the word by saying that courage must be good and then develops the meaning of good showing that it means the choice one the greater benefit and finally turns about and ends by saying that courage is consequently the choice of the greater benefit and identical with wisdom Here we have a process of thought ending in a paradox which frankly misrepresents the original meaning For courage meant not merely something desirable but something having a certain animal and psychological aspect The emotion and gesture of it had not been excluded from the idea So that while the argument proves to perfection that unwise courage is a bad thing it does not end with an affirmation really true of the original concept The instinct which we call courage with an eye to its psychic and bodily quality is not always virtuous or wise Dialectic when it starts with confused and deep dyed feelings like those which ethical and metaphysical terms generally stand for is thus in great danger of proving unsatisfactory and being or seeming sophistical The mathematical dialectician has no such serious dangers to face When having observed the sun and sundry other objects he frames the idea of a circle and tracing out its intent shows that the circle meant cannot be squared there is no difficulty in reverting to nature and saying that the sun s circle cannot be squared For there is no difference in intent between the circularity noted in the sun and that which is the subject of the demonstration The geometer has made in his first reflection so clear and violent an abstraction from the sun s actual bulk and qualities that he will never imagine himself to be speaking of anything but a concretion in discourse The concretion in nature is never legislated about nor so much as thought of except possibly when under warrant of sense it is chosen to illustrate the concept investigated dialectically It does not even occur to a man to ask if the sun s circle can be squared for every one understands that the sun is circular only in so far as it conforms to the circle s ideal nature which is as if Socrates and his interlocutors had clearly understood that the virtue of courage in an intemperate villain meant only whatever in his mood or action was rational and truly desirable and had then said that courage so understood was identical with wisdom or with the truly rational and desirable rule of life Sidenote The fact that mathematics applies to existence is empirical The applicability of mathematics is not vouched for by mathematics but by sense and its application in some distant part of nature is not vouched for by mathematics but by inductive arguments about nature s uniformity or by the character which the notion a distant part of nature already possesses Inapplicable mathematics we are told is perfectly thinkable and systematic deductions in themselves valid may be made from concepts which contravene the facts of perception We may suspect perhaps that even these concepts are framed by analogy out of suggestions found in sense so that some symbolic relevance or proportion is kept even in these dislocated speculations to the matter of experience It is like a new mythology the purely fictitious idea has a certain parallelism and affinity to nature and moves in a human and familiar way Both data and method are drawn from applicable science elements of which even myth whether poetic or mathematical may illustrate by a sort of variant or fantastic reduplication The great glory of mathematics like that of virtue is to be useful while remaining free Number and measure furnish an inexhaustible subject matter which the mind can dominate and develop dialectically as it is the mind s inherent office to develop ideas At the same time number and measure are the grammar of sense and the more this inner logic is cultivated and refined the greater subtlety and sweep can be given to human perception Astronomy on the one hand and mechanical arts on the other are fruits of mathematics by which its worth is made known even to the layman although the born mathematician would not need the sanction of such an extraneous utility to attach him to a subject that has an inherent cogency and charm Ideas like other things have pleasure in propagation and even when allowance is made for birth pangs and an occasional miscarriage their native fertility will always continue to assert itself The more ideal and frictionless the movement of thought is the more perfect must be the physiological engine that sustains it The momentum of that silent and secluded growth carries the mind with a sense of pure disembodied vision through the logical labyrinth but the momentum is vital for the truth itself does not move Sidenote Its moral value is therefore contingent Whether the airy phantoms thus brought into being are valued and preserved by the world is an ulterior point of policy which the pregnant mathematician does not need to consider in bringing to light the legitimate burden of his thoughts But were mathematics incapable of application did nature and experience for instance illustrate nothing but Parmenides Being or Hegel s Logic the dialectical cogency which mathematics would of course retain would not give this science a very high place in the Life of Reason Mathematics would be an amusement and though apparently innocent like a game of patience it might even turn out to be a wasteful and foolish exercise for the mind because to deepen habits and cultivate pleasures irrelevant to other interests is a way of alienating ourselves from our general happiness Distinction and a curious charm there may well be in such a pursuit but this quality is perhaps traceable to affinities and associations with other more substantial interests or is due to the ingenious temper it denotes which touches that of the wit or magician Mathematics if it were nothing more than a pleasure might conceivably become a vice Those addicted to it might be indulging an atavistic taste at the expense of their humanity It would then be in the position now occupied by mythology and mysticism Even as it is mathematicians share with musicians a certain partiality in their characters and mental development Masters in one abstract subject they may remain children in the world exquisite manipulators of the ideal they may be erratic and clumsy in their earthly ways Immense as are the uses and wide the applications of mathematics its texture is too thin and inhuman to employ the whole mind or render it harmonious It is a science which Socrates rejected for its supposed want of utility but perhaps he had another ground in reserve to justify his humorous prejudice He may have felt that such a science if admitted would endanger his thesis about the identity of virtue and knowledge Sidenote Quantity submits easily to dialectical treatment Mathematical method has been the envy of philosophers perplexed and encumbered as they are with the whole mystery of existence and they have attempted at times to emulate mathematical cogency Now the lucidity and certainty found in mathematics are not inherent in its specific character as the science of number or dimension they belong to dialectic as a whole which is essentially elucidation The effort to explain meanings is in most cases abortive because these meanings melt in our hands a defeat which Hegel would fain have consecrated together with all other evils into necessity and law But the merit of mathematics is that it is so much less Hegelian than life that it holds its own while it advances and never allows itself to misrepresent its original intent In all it finds to say about the triangle it never comes to maintain that the triangle is really a square The privilege of mathematics is simply to have offered the mind for dialectical treatment a material to which dialectical treatment could be honestly applied This material consists in certain general aspects of sensation its extensity its pulsation its distribution into related parts The wakefulness that originally makes these abstractions is able to keep them clear and to elaborate them infinitely without contradicting their essence For this reason it is always a false step in mathematical science a step over its brink into the abyss beyond when we try to reduce its elements to anything not essentially sensible Intuition must continue to furnish the subject of discourse the axioms and the ultimate criteria and sanctions Calculation and transmutation can never make their own counters or the medium in which they move So that space number continuity and every other elementary intuition remains at bottom opaque opaque that is to mathematical science for it is no paradox but an obvious necessity that the data of a logical operation should not be producible by its workings Reason would have nothing to do if it had no irrational materials Saint Augustine s rhetoric accordingly covered as so often with him a profound truth when he said of time that he knew what it was when no one asked him but if any one asked him he did not know which may be restated by saying that time is an intuition an aspect of crude experience which science may work with but which it can never arrive at Sidenote Constancy and progress in intent When a concretion is formed in discourse and an intent is attained in consciousness predicates accrue to the subject in a way which is perfectly empirical Dialectic is not retrospective it does not consist in recovering ground previously surveyed The accretion of new predicates comes in answer to chance questions questions raised to be sure about a given theme The subject is fixed by the mind s intent and it suffices to compare any tentative assertion made about it with that intent itself to see whether the expression suggested for it is truly dialectical and thoroughly honest Dialectic verifies by reconsideration by equation of tentative results with fixed intentions It does not verify like the sciences of existence by comparing a hypothesis with a new perception In dialectic no new perception is wanted the goal is to understand the old fact to give it an aureole and not a progeny It is a transubstantiation of matter a passage from existence to eternity In this sense dialectic is synthetic a priori it analyses an intent which demanded further elucidation and had fixed the direction and principle of its expansion If this intent is abandoned and a new subject is introduced surreptitiously a fallacy is committed yet the correct elucidation of ideas is a true progress nor could there be any progress unless the original idea were better expressed and elicited as we proceeded so that constancy in intent and advance in explication are the two requisites of a cogent deduction The question in dialectic is always what is true what can be said about this and the demonstrative pronoun indicating an act of selective attention raises the object it selects to a concretion in discourse the relations of which in the universe of discourse it then proceeds to formulate At the same time this dialectical investigation may be full of surprises Knowledge may be so truly enriched by it that knowledge in an ideal sense only begins when dialectic has given some articulation to being Without dialectic an animal might follow instinct he might have vivid emotions expectations and dreams but he could hardly be said to know anything or to guide his life with conscious intent The accretions that might come empirically into any field of vision would not be new predicates to be added to a known thing unless the logical and functional mantle of that thing fell upon them and covered them While the right of particulars to existence is their own granted them by the free grace of heaven their ability to enlarge our knowledge on any particular subject their relevance or incidence in discourse hangs on their fulfilling the requirements which that subject s dialectical nature imposes on all its expressions Sidenote Intent determines the functional essence of objects It is on this ground for instance that the image of a loaf of bread is so far from being the loaf of bread itself External resemblance is nothing even psychological derivation or superposition is nothing the intent rather which picks out what that object s function and meaning shall be alone defines its idea and this function involves a locus and a status which the image does not possess Such admirable iridescence as the image might occasionally put on in the fine arts for instance would not constitute any iridescence or transformation in the thing nor would identity of aspect preserve the thing if its soul if its utility had disappeared Herein lies the ground for the essential or functional distinction between primary and secondary qualities in things a distinction which a psychological scepticism has so hastily declared to be untenable If it was discovered said these logicians that space was perceived through reading muscular sensations space and the muscles too were thereby proved to be unreal This remarkable sophism passed muster in the philosophical world for want of attention to dialectic which might so easily have shown that what a thing means is spatial distinction and mechanical efficacy and that the origin of our perceptions which are all equally bodily and dependent on material stimulation has nothing to do with their respective claims to hypostasis It is intent that makes objects objects and the same intent defining the function of things defines the scope of those qualities which are essential to them In the flux substances and shadows drift down together it is reason that discerns the difference Sidenote Also the scope of ideals Purposes need dialectical articulation as much as essences do and without an articulate and fixed purpose without an ideal action would collapse into mere motion or conscious change It is notably in this region that elucidation constitutes progress for to understand the properties of number may be less important than empirically to count but to see and feel the values of things in all their distinction and fulness is the ultimate fruit of efficiency it is mastery in that art of life for which all the rest is apprenticeship Dialectic of this sort is practised intuitively by spiritual minds and even when it has to be carried on argumentatively it may prove very enlightening That the excellence of courage is identical with that of wisdom still needs to be driven home and that the excellence of poetry is identical with that of all other things probably sounds like a blind paradox Yet did not all excellences conspire to one end and meet in one Life of Reason how could their relative value be estimated or any reflective sanction be found for them at all The miscellaneous captious fancies of the will the menagerie of moral prejudices still call for many a Socrates to tame them So long as courage means a grimace of mind or body the love of it is another grimace But if it meant the value recognisable by reason and diffused through all life which that casual attitude or feeling might have then we should be launched upon the quest for wisdom The want of integration in moral views is like what want of integration would be in arithmetic if we declared that it was the part of a man and a Christian to maintain that my two equals four or that a green fifteen is a hundred These propositions might have incidental lights and shades in people s lives to make them plausible and precious but they could not be maintained by one who had clarified his intent in naming and adding For then the arithmetical relations would be abstracted and their incidental associates would drop out of the account So a man who is in pursuit of things for the good that is in them must recognise and if reason avails must pursue what is good in them all Strange customs and unheard of thoughts may then find their appropriate warrant just as in higher mathematical calculations very wonderful and unforeseen results may be arrived at which a man will not accept without careful reconsideration of the terms and problem before him but if he finds the unexpected conclusion flowing from those premises he will have enlarged his knowledge of his art and discovered a congenial good He will have made progress in the Socratic science of knowing his own intent Sidenote Double status of mathematics Mathematics for all its applications in nature is a part of ideal philosophy It is logic applied to certain simple intuitions These intuitions and many of their developments happen to appear in that efficacious and self sustaining moiety of being which we call material so that mathematics is per accidens the dialectical study of nature s efficacious form Its use and application in the world rather hide its dialectical principle Mathematics owes its public success to the happy choice of a simple and widely diffused subject matter it owes its inner cogency however to its ideality and the merely adventitious application it has to existence Mathematics has come to seem the type of good logic because it is an illustration of logic in a sphere so highly abstract in idea and so pervasive in sense as to be at once manageable and useful The delights and triumphs of mathematics ought therefore to be a great encouragement to ideal philosophy If in a comparatively uninteresting field attention can find so many treasures of harmony and order what beauties might it not discover in interpreting faithfully ideas nobler than extension and number concretions closer to man s spiritual life But unfortunately the logic of values is subject to voluntary and involuntary confusions of so discouraging a nature that the flight of dialectic in that direction has never been long and even when short often disastrous What is needed as the example of mathematics shows is a steadfast intent and an adventurous inquiry It would not occur to a geometer to ask with trepidation what difference it would make to the Pythagorean proposition if the hypothenuse were said to be wise and good Yet metaphysicians confounding dialectic with physics and thereby corrupting both will discuss for ever the difference it makes to substance whether you call it matter or God Nevertheless no decorative epithets can give substance any other attributes than those which it has that is other than the actual appearances that substance is needed to support Similarly neither mathematicians nor astronomers are exercised by the question whether Greek pi created the ring of Saturn yet naturalists and logicians have not rejected the analogous problem whether the good did or did not create the animals Sidenote Practical role of dialectic So long as in using terms there is no fixed intent no concretion in discourse with discernible predicates controversy will rage as conceptions waver and will reach no valid result But when the force of intellect once having arrested an idea amid the flux of perceptions avails to hold and examine that idea with perseverance not only does a flash of light immediately cross the mind but deeper and deeper vistas are opened there into ideal truth The principle of dialectic is intelligence itself and as no part of man s economy is more vital than intelligence since intelligence is what makes life aware of its destiny so no part has a more delightful or exhilarating movement To understand is pre eminently to live moving not by stimulation and external compulsion but by inner direction and control Dialectic is related to observation as art is to industry it uses what the other furnishes it is the fruition of experience It is not an alternative to empirical pursuits but their perfection for dialectic like art has no special or private subject matter nor any obligation to be useless Its subject matter is all things and its function is to compare them in form and worth giving the mind speculative dominion over them It profits by the flux to fix its signification This is precisely what mathematics does for the abstract form and multitude of sensible things it is what dialectic might do everywhere with the same incidental utility if it could settle its own attitude and learn to make the passions steadfast and calm in the consciousness of their ultimate objects Sidenote Hegel s satire on dialectic The nature of dialectic might be curiously illustrated by reference to Hegel s Logic and though to approach the subject from Hegel s satirical angle is not perhaps quite honest or fair the method has a certain spice Hegel who despised mathematics saw that in other departments the instability of men s meanings defeated their desire to understand themselves This insecurity in intent he found to be closely connected with change of situation with the natural mutability of events and opinions in the world Instead of showing however what inroads passion oblivion sophistry and frivolity may make into dialectic he bethought himself to represent all these incoherences which are indeed significant of natural changes as the march of dialectic itself thus identified with the process of evolution and with natural law The romance of an unstable and groping theology full of warm intentions and impossible ideas he took to be typical of all experience and of all science In that impressionable age any effect of chiaro oscuro caught in the moonlight of history could find a philosopher to exalt it into the darkly luminous secret of the world Hegel accordingly decreed that men s habit of self contradiction constituted their providential function both in thought and in morals and he devoted his Logic to showing how every idea they embraced for he never treated an idea otherwise than as a creed when pressed a little turned into its opposite This opposite after a while would fall back into something like the original illusion whereupon a new change of insight would occur and a new thought would be accepted until the landscape changing attention would be attracted to a fresh aspect of the matter and conviction would wander into a new labyrinth of false steps and half meanings The sum total of these wanderings when viewed from above formed an interesting picture A half mystical half cynical reflection might take a certain pleasure in contemplating it especially if in memory of Calvin and the Stoics this situation were called the expression of Absolute Reason and Divine Will We may think for a moment that we have grasped the elusive secret of this philosophy and that it is simply a Calvinism without Christianity in which God s glory consists in the damnation of quite all his creatures Presently however the scene changes again and we recognise that Creator and creation ideal and process are identical so that the glory belongs to the very multitude that suffers But finally as we rub our eyes the whole revelation collapses into a platitude and we discover that this glory and this damnation were nothing but unctuous phrases for the vulgar flux of existence That nothing is what we mean by it is perfectly true when we in no case know what we mean Thus a man who is a mystic by nature may very well become one by reflection also Not knowing what he wants nor what he is he may believe that every shift carries him nearer to perfection A temperamental and quasi religious thirst for inconclusiveness and room to move on lent a certain triumphant note to Hegel s satire he was sure it all culminated in something and was not sure it did not culminate in himself The system however as it might strike a less egotistical reader is a long demonstration of man s ineptitude and of nature s contemptuous march over a path paved with good intentions It is an idealism without respect for ideals a system of dialectic in which a psychological flux not of course psychological science which would involve terms dialectically fixed and determinate is made systematically to obliterate intended meanings Sidenote Dialectic expresses a given intent This spirited travesty of logic has enough historical truth in it to show that dialectic must always stand so to speak on its apex for life is changeful and the vision and interest of one moment are not understood in the next Theological dialectic rings hollow when once faith is dead grammar looks artificial when a language is foreign mathematics itself seems shallow when like Hegel we have no love for nature s intelligible mechanism nor for the clear structure and constancy of eternal things Ideal philosophy is a flower of the spirit and varies with the soil If mathematics suffers so little contradiction it is only because the primary aspects of sensation which it elaborates could not lapse from the world without an utter break in its continuity Otherwise though mathematics might not be refuted it might well be despised like an obsolete ontology Its boasted necessity and universality would not help it at all if experience should change so much as to present no further mathematical aspect Those who expect to pass at death into a non spatial and super temporal world where there will be no detestable extended and unthinking substances and nothing that need be counted will find their hard learned mathematics sadly superfluous there The memory of earthly geometry and arithmetic will grow pale amid that floating incense and music where dialectic if it survives at all will have to busy itself on new intuitions So too when the landscape changes in the moral world when new passions or arts make their appearance moral philosophy must start afresh on a new foundation and try to express the ideals involved in the new pursuits To this extent experience lends colour to Hegel s dialectical physics but he betrayed like the sincere pantheist he was the finite interests that give actual values to the world and he wished to bestow instead a groundless adoration on the law that connected and defeated every ideal Such a genius in spite of incisive wit and a certain histrionic sympathy with all experience could not be truly free it could not throw off its professional priestcraft its habit of ceremonious fraud on the surface nor at heart its inhuman religion Sidenote Its empire is ideal and autonomous The sincere dialectician the genuine moralist must stand upon human Socratic ground Though art be long it must take a short life for its basis and an actual interest for its guide The liberal dialectician has the gift of conversation he does not pretend to legislate from the throne of Jehovah about the course of affairs but asks the ingenuous heart to speak for itself guiding and checking it only in its own interest The result is to express a given nature and to cultivate it so that whenever any one possessing such a nature is born into the world he may use this calculation and more easily understand and justify his mind Of course if experience were no longer the same and faculties had entirely varied the former interpretation could no longer serve Where nature shows a new principle of growth the mind must find a new method of expression and move toward other goals Ideals are not forces stealthily undermining the will they are possible forms of being that would frankly express it These forms are invulnerable eternal and free and he who finds them divine and congenial and is able to embody them at least in part and for a season has to that extent transfigured life turning it from a fatal process into a liberal art CHAPTER VIII PRERATIONAL MORALITY Sidenote Empirical alloy in dialectic When a polyglot person is speaking foreign words sometimes occur to him which he at once translates into the language he happens to be using Somewhat in the same way when dialectic develops an idea suggestions for this development may come from the empirical field yet these suggestions soon shed their externality and their place is taken by some genuine development of the original notion In constructing for instance the essence of a circle I may have started from a hoop I may have observed that as the hoop meanders down the path the roundness of it disappears to the eye being gradually flattened into a straight line such as the hoop presents when it is rolling directly away from me I may now frame the idea of a mathematical circle in which all diameters are precisely equal in express contrast to the series of ellipses with very unequal diameters which the floundering hoop has illustrated in its career When once however the definition of the circle is attained no watching of hoops is any longer requisite The ellipse can be generated ideally out of the definition and would have been generated like asymptotes and hyperbolas even if never illustrated in nature at all Lemmas from a foreign tongue have only served to disclose a great fecundity in the native one and the legitimate word that the context required has supplanted the casual stranger that may first have ushered it into the mind When the idea which dialectic is to elaborate is a moral idea a purpose touching something in the concrete world lemmas from experience often play a very large part in the process Their multitude with the small shifts in aspiration and esteem which they may suggest to the mind often obscures the dialectical process altogether In this case the foreign term is never translated into the native medium we never make out what ideal connection our conclusion has with our premises nor in what way the conduct we finally decide upon is to fulfil the purpose with which we began Reflection merely beats about the bush and when a sufficient number of prejudices and impulses have been driven from cover we go home satisfied with our day s ranging and feeling that we have left no duty unconsidered and our last bird is our final resolution Sidenote Arrested rationality in morals When morality is in this way non dialectical casual impulsive polyglot it is what we may call prerational morality There is indeed reason in it since every deliberate precept expresses some reflection by which impulses have been compared and modified But such chance reflection amounts to moral perception not to moral science Reason has not begun to educate her children This morality is like knowing chairs from tables and things near from distant things which is hardly what we mean by natural science On this stage in the moral world are the judgments of missus Grundy the aims of political parties and their maxims the principles of war the appreciation of art the commandments of religious authorities special revelations of duty to individuals and all systems of intuitive ethics Sidenote Its emotional and practical power Prerational morality is vigorous because it is sincere Actual interests rooted habits appreciations the opposite of which is inconceivable and contrary to the current use of language are embodied in special precepts or they flare up of themselves in impassioned judgments It is hardly too much to say indeed that prerational morality is morality proper Rational ethics in comparison seems a kind of politics or wisdom while post rational systems are essentially religions If we thus identify morality with prerational standards we may agree also that morality is no science in itself though it may become with other matters a subject for the science of anthropology and Hume who had never come to close quarters with any rational or post rational ideal could say with perfect truth that morality was not founded on reason Instinct is of course not founded on reason but vice versa and the maxims enforced by tradition or conscience are unmistakably founded on instinct They might it is true become materials for reason if they were intelligently accepted compared and controlled but such a possibility reverses the partisan and spasmodic methods which Hume and most other professed moralists associate with ethics Hume s own treatises on morals it need hardly be said are pure psychology It would have seemed to him conceited perhaps to inquire what ought really to be done He limited himself to asking what men tended to think about their doings The chief expression of rational ethics which a man in Hume s world would have come upon lay in the Platonic and Aristotelian writings but these were not then particularly studied nor vitally understood The chief illustration of post rational morality that could have fallen under his eyes the Catholic religion he would never have thought of as a philosophy of life but merely as a combination of superstition and policy well adapted to the lying and lascivious habits of Mediterranean peoples Under such circumstances ethics could not be thought of as a science and whatever gradual definition of the ideal whatever prescription of what ought to be and to be done found a place in the thoughts of such philosophers formed a part of their politics or religion and not of their reasoned knowledge Sidenote Moral science is an application of dialectic not a part of anthropology There is however a dialectic of the will and that is the science which for want of a better name we must call ethics or moral philosophy The interweaving of this logic of practice with various natural sciences that have man or society for their theme leads to much confusion in terminology and in point of view Is the good we may ask what anybody calls good at any moment or what anybody calls good on reflection or what all men agree to call good or what God calls good no matter what all mankind may think about it Or is true good something that perhaps nobody calls good nor knows of something with no other characteristic or relation except that it is simply good Various questions are involved in such perplexing alternatives some are physical questions and others dialectical Why any one values anything at all or anything in particular is a question of physics it asks for the causes of interest judgment and desire To esteem a thing good is to express certain affinities between that thing and the speaker and if this is done with self knowledge and with knowledge of the thing so that the felt affinity is a real one the judgment is invulnerable and cannot be asked to rescind itself Thus if a man said hemlock was good to drink we might say he was mistaken but if he explained that he meant good to drink in committing suicide there would be nothing pertinent left to say for to adduce that to commit suicide is not good would be impertinent To establish that we should have to go back and ask him if he valued anything life parents country knowledge reputation and if he said no and was sincere our mouths would be effectually stopped that is unless we took to declamation But we might very well turn to the bystanders and explain what sort of blood and training this man possessed and what had happened among the cells and fibres of his brain to make him reason after that fashion The causes of morality good or bad are physical seeing that they are causes The science of ethics however has nothing to do with causes not in that it need deny or ignore them but in that it is their fruit and begins where they end Incense rises from burning coals but it is itself no conflagration and will produce none What ethics asks is not why a thing is called good but whether it is good or not whether it is right or not so to esteem it Goodness in this ideal sense is not a matter of opinion but of nature For intent is at work life is in active operation and the question is whether the thing or the situation responds to that intent So if I ask Is four really twice two the answer is not that most people say so but that in saying so I am not misunderstanding myself To judge whether things are really good intent must be made to speak and if this intent may itself be judged later that happens by virtue of other intents comparing the first with their own direction Hence good when once the moral or dialectical attitude has been assumed means not what is called good but what is so that is what ought to be called good For intent beneath which there is no moral judgment sets up its own standard and ideal science begins on that basis and cannot go back of it to ask why the obvious good is good at all Naturally there is a reason but not a moral one for it lies in the physical habit and necessity of things The reason is simply the propulsive essence of animals and of the universal flux which renders forms possible but unstable and either helpful or hurtful to one another That nature should have this constitution or intent this direction is not a good in itself It is esteemed good or bad as the intent that speaks finds in that situation a support or an obstacle to its ideal As a matter of fact nature and the very existence of life cannot be thought wholly evil since no intent is wholly at war with these its conditions nor can nature and life be sincerely regarded as wholly good since no moral intent stops at the facts nor does the universal flux which infinitely overflows any actual synthesis altogether support any intent it may generate Sidenote Estimation the soul of philosophy Philosophers would do a great discourtesy to estimation if they sought to justify it It is all other acts that need justification by this one The good greets us initially in every experience and in every object Remove from anything its share of excellence and you have made it utterly insignificant irrelevant to human discourse and unworthy of even theoretic consideration Value is the principle of perspective in science no less than of rightness in life The hierarchy of goods the architecture of values is the subject that concerns man most Wisdom is the first philosophy both in time and in authority and to collect facts or to chop logic would be idle and would add no dignity to the mind unless that mind possessed a clear humanity and could discern what facts and logic are good for and what not The facts would remain facts and the truths truths for of course values accruing on account of animal souls and their affections cannot possibly create the universe those animals inhabit But both facts and truths would remain trivial fit to awaken no pang no interest and no rapture The first philosophers were accordingly sages They were statesmen and poets who knew the world and cast a speculative glance at the heavens the better to understand the conditions and limits of human happiness Before their day too wisdom had spoken in proverbs It is better every adage began Better this than that Images or symbols mythical or homely events of course furnished subjects and provocations for these judgments but the residuum of all observation was a settled estimation of things a direction chosen in thought and life because it was better Such was philosophy in the beginning and such is philosophy still Sidenote Moral discriminations are natural and inevitable To one brought up in a sophisticated society or in particular under an ethical religion morality seems at first an external command a chilling and arbitrary set of requirements and prohibitions which the young heart if it trusted itself would not reckon at a penny s worth Yet while this rebellion is brewing in the secret conclave of the passions the passions themselves are prescribing a code They are inventing gallantry and kindness and honour they are discovering friendship and paternity With maturity comes the recognition that the authorised precepts of morality were essentially not arbitrary that they expressed the genuine aims and interests of a practised will that their alleged alien and supernatural basis which if real would have deprived them of all moral authority was but a mythical cover for their forgotten natural springs Virtue is then seen to be admirable essentially and not merely by conventional imputation If traditional morality has much in it that is out of proportion much that is unintelligent and inert nevertheless it represents on the whole the verdict of reason It speaks for a typical human will chastened by a typical human experience Sidenote A choice of proverbs Gnomic wisdom however is notoriously polychrome and proverbs depend for their truth entirely on the occasion they are applied to Almost every wise saying has an opposite one no less wise to balance it so that a man rich in such lore like Sancho Panza can always find a venerable maxim to fortify the view he happens to be taking In respect to foresight for instance we are told Make hay while the sun shines A stitch in time saves nine Honesty is the best policy Murder will out Woe unto you ye hypocrites Watch and pray Seek salvation with fear and trembling and Respice finem But on the same authorities exactly we have opposite maxims inspired by a feeling that mortal prudence is fallible that life is shorter than policy and that only the present is real for we hear A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush Carpe diem Ars longa vita brevis Be not righteous overmuch Enough for the day is the evil thereof Behold the lilies of the field Judge not that ye be not judged Mind your own business and It takes all sorts of men to make a world So when some particularly shocking thing happens one man says Cherchez la femme and another says Great is Allah That these maxims should be so various and partial is quite intelligible when we consider how they spring up Every man in moral reflection is animated by his own intent he has something in view which he prizes he knows not why and which wears to him the essential and unquestionable character of a good With this standard before his eyes he observes easily for love and hope are extraordinarily keen sighted what in action or in circumstances forwards his purpose and what thwarts it and at once the maxim comes very likely in the language of the particular instance before him Now the interests that speak in a man are different at different times and the outer facts or measures which in one case promote that interest may where other less obvious conditions have changed altogether defeat it Hence all sorts of precepts looking to all sorts of results Sidenote Their various representative value Prescriptions of this nature differ enormously in value for they differ enormously in scope By chance or through the insensible operation of experience leading up to some outburst of genius intuitive maxims may be so central so expressive of ultimate aims so representative I mean of all aims in fusion that they merely anticipate what moral science would have come to if it had existed This happens much as in physics ultimate truths may be divined by poets long before they are discovered by investigators the vivida vis animi taking the place of much recorded experience because much unrecorded experience has secretly fed it Such for instance is the central maxim of Christianity Love thy neighbour as thyself On the other hand what is usual in intuitive codes is a mixture of some elementary precepts necessary to any society with others representing local traditions or ancient rites so Thou shalt not kill and Thou shalt keep holy the Sabbath day figure side by side in the Decalogue When Antigone in her sublimest exaltation defies human enactments and appeals to laws which are not of to day nor yesterday no man knowing whence they have arisen she mixes various types of obligation in a most instructive fashion for a superstitious horror at leaving a body unburied something decidedly of yesterday gives poignancy in her mind to natural affection for a brother something indeed universal yet having a well known origin The passionate assertion of right is here in consequence more dramatic than spiritual and even its dramatic force has suffered somewhat by the change in ruling ideals Sidenote Conflict of partial moralities The disarray of intuitive ethics is made painfully clear in the conflicts which it involves when it has fostered two incompatible growths in two centres which lie near enough to each other to come into physical collision Such ethics has nothing to offer in the presence of discord except an appeal to force and to ultimate physical sanctions It can instigate but cannot resolve the battle of nations and the battle of religions Precisely the same zeal the same patriotism the same readiness for martyrdom fires adherents to rival societies and fires them especially in view of the fact that the adversary is no less uncompromising and fierce It might seem idle if not cruel and malicious to wish to substitute one historical allegiance for another when both are equally arbitrary and the existing one is the more congenial to those born under it but to feel this aggression to be criminal demands some degree of imagination and justice and sectaries would not be sectaries if they possessed it Truly religious minds while eager perhaps to extirpate every religion but their own often rise above national jealousies for spirituality is universal whatever churches may be Similarly politicians often understand very well the religious situation and of late it has become again the general practice among prudent governments to do as the Romans did in their conquests and to leave people free to exercise what religion they have without pestering them with a foreign one On the other hand the same politicians are the avowed agents of a quite patent iniquity for what is their ideal To substitute their own language commerce soldiers and tax gatherers for the tax gatherers soldiers commerce and language of their neighbours and no means is thought illegitimate be it fraud in policy or bloodshed in war to secure this absolutely nugatory end Is not one country as much a country as another Is it not as dear to its inhabitants What then is gained by oppressing its genius or by seeking to destroy it altogether Here are two flagrant instances where prerational morality defeats the ends of morality Viewed from within each religious or national fanaticism stands for a good but in its outward operation it produces and becomes an evil It is possible no doubt that its agents are really so far apart in nature and ideals that like men and mosquitoes they can stand in physical relations only and if they meet can meet only to poison or to crush one another More probably however humanity in them is no merely nominal essence it is definable ideally as essences are defined by a partially identical function and intent In that case by studying their own nature they could rise above their mutual opposition and feel that in their fanaticism they were taking too contracted a view of their own souls and were hardly doing justice to themselves when they did such great injustice to others Sidenote The Greek ideal How prerational morality may approach the goal and miss it is well illustrated in the history of Hellenism Greek morals may be said to have been inspired by two prerational sentiments a naturalistic religion and a local patriotism Could Plato have succeeded in making that religion moral or Alexander in universalising that patriotism perhaps Greece might have been saved and we might all be now at a very different level of civilisation Both Plato and Alexander failed in spite of the immense and lasting influence of their work for in both cases the after effects were spurious and the new spirit was smothered in the dull substances it strove to vivify Greek myth was an exuberant assertion of the rights of life in the universe Existence could not but be joyful and immortal if it had once found in land sea or air a form congruous with that element Such congruity would render a being stable efficient beautiful He would achieve a perfection grounded in skilful practice and in a thorough rejection of whatever was irrelevant These things the Greeks called virtue The gods were perfect models of this kind of excellence for of course the amours of Zeus and Hermes trickery were in their hearty fashion splendid manifestations of energy This natural divine virtue carried no sense of responsibility with it but it could not fail to diffuse benefit because it radiated happiness and beauty The worshipper by invoking those braver inhabitants of the cosmos felt he might more easily attain a corresponding beauty and happiness in his paternal city Sidenote Imaginative exuberance and political discipline The source of myth had been a genial sympathy with nature The observer at ease himself multiplied ideally the potentialities of his being but he went farther in imagining what life might yield abroad freed from every trammel and necessity than in deepening his sense of what life was in himself and of what it ought to be This moral reflection absent from mythology was supplied by politics The family and the state had a soberer antique religion of their own this hereditary piety together with the laws prescribed education customs and duties The city drew its walls close about the heart and while it fostered friendship and reason within without it looked to little but war A splendid physical and moral discipline was established to serve a suicidal egoism The city committed its crimes and the individual indulged his vices of conduct and estimation hardly rebuked by philosophy and quite unrebuked by religion Nevertheless religion and philosophy existed together with an incomparable literature and art and an unrivalled measure and simplicity in living A liberal fancy and a strict civic regimen starting with different partial motives and blind purposes combined by good fortune into an almost rational life It was inevitable however when only an irrational tradition supported the state and kept it so weak amid a world of enemies that this state should succumb not to speak of the mean animosities the license in life and the spirit of mockery that inwardly infested it The myths too faded they had expressed a fleeting moment of poetic insight as patriotism had expressed a fleeting moment of unanimous effort but what force could sustain such accidental harmonies The patriotism soon lost its power to inspire sacrifice and the myth its power to inspire wonder so that the relics of that singular civilisation were scattered almost at once in the general flood of the world Sidenote Sterility of Greek example The Greek ideal has fascinated many men in all ages who have sometimes been in a position to set a fashion so that the world in general has pretended also to admire But the truth is Hellas in leaving so many heirlooms to mankind has left no constitutional benefit it has taught the conscience no lesson We possess a great heritage from Greece but it is no natural endowment An artistic renaissance in the fifteenth century and a historical one in the nineteenth have only affected the trappings of society The movement has come from above It has not found any response in the people While Greek morality in its contents or in the type of life it prescribes comes nearer than any other prerational experiment to what reason might propose yet it has been less useful than many other influences in bringing the Life of Reason about The Christian and the Moslem in refining their more violent inspiration have brought us nearer to genuine goodness than the Greek could by his idle example Classic perfection is a seedless flower imitable only by artifice not reproducible by generation It is capable of influencing character only through the intellect the means by which character can be influenced least It is a detached ideal responding to no crying and actual demand in the world at large It never passed to win the right of addressing mankind through a sufficient novitiate of sorrow Sidenote Prerational morality among the Jews The Hebrews on the contrary who in comparison with the Greeks had a barbarous idea of happiness showed far greater moral cohesion under the pressure of adversity They integrated their purposes into a fanaticism but they integrated them and the integrity that resulted became a mighty example It constituted an ideal of character not the less awe inspiring for being merely formal We need not marvel that abstract commandments should have impressed the world more than concrete ideals To appreciate an ideal to love and serve it in the full light of science and reason would require a high intelligence and what is rarer still noble affinities and renunciations which are not to be looked for in an undisciplined people But to feel the truth and authority of an abstract maxim as for instance Do right and shame the devil a maxim applicable to experience on any plane nothing is needed but a sound wit and common honesty Men know better what is right and wrong than what is ultimately good or evil their conscience is more vividly present to them than the fruits which obedience to conscience might bear so that the logical relation of means to ends of methods to activities eludes them altogether What is a necessary connection between the given end happiness and the normal life naturally possessing it appears to them as a miraculous connection between obedience to God s commands and enjoyment of his favour The evidence of this miracle astonishes them and fills them with zeal They are strengthened to persevere in righteousness under any stress of misfortune in the assurance that they are being put to a temporary test and that the reward promised to virtue will eventually be theirs Sidenote The development of conscience Thus a habit of faithfulness a trust in general principles is fostered and ingrained in generation after generation a rare and precious heritage for a race so imperfectly rational as the human Reason would of course justify the same constancy in well doing since a course of conduct would not be right but wrong if its ultimate issue were human misery But as the happiness secured by virtue may be remote and may demand more virtue to make it appreciable the mere rationality of a habit gives it no currency in the world and but little moral glow in the conscience We should not therefore be too much offended at the illusions which play a part in moral integration Imagination is often more efficacious in reaching the gist and meaning of experience than intelligence can be just because imagination is less scrupulous and more instinctive Even physical discoveries when they come are the fruit of divination and Columbus had to believe he might sail westward to India before he could actually hit upon America Reason cannot create itself and nature in producing reason has to feel her way experimentally Habits and chance systems of education have to arise first and exercise upon individuals an irrational suasion favourable to rational ends Men long live in substantial harmony with reality before they recognise its nature Organs long exist before they reach their perfect function The fortunate instincts of a race destined to long life and rationality express themselves in significant poetry before they express themselves in science The service which Hebraism has rendered to mankind has been instrumental as that rendered by Hellenism has been imaginative Hebraism has put earnestness and urgency into morality making it a matter of duty at once private and universal rather than what paganism had left it a mass of local allegiances and legal practices The Jewish system has in consequence a tendency to propaganda and intolerance a tendency which would not have proved nefarious had this religion always remained true to its moral principle for morality is coercive and no man being autonomous has a right to do wrong Conscience thus reinforced by religious passion has been able to focus a general abhorrence on certain great scandals slavery and sodomy could be practically suppressed among Christians and drunkenness among Moslems The Christian principle of charity also owed a part of its force to Hebraic tradition For the law and the prophets were full of mercy and loving kindness toward the faithful What Moses had taught his people Christ and his Hellenising disciples had the beautiful courage to preach to all mankind Yet this virtue of charity on its subtler and more metaphysical side belongs to the spirit of redemption to that ascetic and quasi Buddhistic element in Christianity to which we shall presently revert The pure Jews can have no part in such insight because it contradicts the positivism of their religion and character and their ideal of worldly happiness Sidenote Need of Hebraic devotion to Greek aims As the human body is said to change all its substance every seven years and yet is the same body so the Hebraic conscience might change all its tenets in seven generations and be the same conscience still Could this abstract moral habit this transferable earnestness be enlisted in rational causes the Life of Reason would have gained a valuable instrument Men would possess the single eye and the art so difficult to an ape like creature with loose moral feelings of acting on principle Could the vision of an adequate natural ideal fall into the Hebraising mind already aching for action and nerved to practical enthusiasm that ideal vision might become efficacious and be largely realised in practice The abstract power of self direction if enlightened by a larger experience and a more fertile genius might give the Life of Reason a public embodiment such as it has not had since the best days of classic antiquity Thus the two prerational moralities out of which European civilisation has grown could they be happily superposed would make a rational polity Sidenote Prerational morality marks an acquisition but offers no programme The objects of human desire then until reason has compared and experience has tested them are a miscellaneous assortment of goods unstable in themselves and incompatible with one another It is a happy chance if a tolerable mixture of them recommends itself to a prophet or finds an adventitous acceptance among a group of men Intuitive morality is adequate while it simply enforces those obvious and universal laws which are indispensable to any society and which impose themselves everywhere on men under pain of quick extinction a penalty which many an individual and many a nation continually prefers to pay But when intuitive morality ventures upon speculative ground and tries to guide progress its magic fails Ideals are tentative and have to be critically viewed A moralist who rests in his intuitions may be a good preacher but hardly deserves the name of philosopher He cannot find any authority for his maxims which opposite maxims may not equally invoke To settle the relative merits of rival authorities and of hostile consciences it is necessary to appeal to the only real authority to experience reason and human nature in the living man No other test is conceivable and no other would be valid for no good man would ever consent to regard an authority as divine or binding which essentially contradicted his own conscience Yet a conscience which is irreflective and incorrigible is too hastily satisfied with itself and not conscientious enough it needs cultivation by dialectic It neglects to extend to all human interests that principle of synthesis and justice by which conscience itself has arisen And so soon as the conscience summons its own dicta for revision in the light of experience and of universal sympathy it is no longer called conscience but reason So too when the spirit summons its traditional faiths to subject them to a similar examination that exercise is not called religion but philosophy It is true in a sense that philosophy is the purest religion and reason the ultimate conscience but so to name them would be misleading The things commonly called by those names have seldom consented to live at peace with sincere reflection It has been felt vaguely that reason could not have produced them and that they might suffer sad changes by submitting to it as if reason could be the ground of anything or as if everything might not find its consummation in becoming rational CHAPTER IX RATIONAL ETHICS Sidenote Moral passions represent private interests In moral reprobation there is often a fanatical element I mean that hatred which an animal may sometimes feel for other animals on account of their strange aspect or because their habits put him to serious inconvenience or because these habits if he himself adopted them might be vicious in him Such aversion however is not a rational sentiment No fault can be justly found with a creature merely for not resembling another or for nourishing in a different physical or moral environment It has been an unfortunate consequence of mythical philosophies that moral emotions have been stretched to objects with which a man has only physical relations so that the universe has been filled with monsters more or less horrible according as the forces they represented were more or less formidable to human life In the same spirit every experiment in civilisation has passed for a crime among those engaged in some other experiment The foreigner has seemed an insidious rascal the heretic a pestilent sinner and any material obstacle a literal devil while to possess some unusual passion however innocent has brought obloquy on every one unfortunate enough not to be constituted like the average of his neighbours Ethics if it is to be a science and not a piece of arbitrary legislation cannot pronounce it sinful in a serpent to be a serpent it cannot even accuse a barbarian of loving a wrong life except in so far as the barbarian is supposed capable of accusing himself of barbarism If he is a perfect barbarian he will be inwardly and therefore morally justified The notion of a barbarian will then be accepted by him as that of a true man and will form the basis of whatever rational judgments or policy he attains It may still seem dreadful to him to be a serpent as to be a barbarian might seem dreadful to a man imbued with liberal interests But the degree to which moral science or the dialectic of will can condemn any type of life depends on the amount of disruptive contradiction which at any reflective moment that life brings under the unity of apperception The discordant impulses therein confronted will challenge and condemn one another and the court of reason in which their quarrel is ventilated will have authority to pronounce between them The physical repulsion however which everybody feels to habits and interests which he is incapable of sharing is no part of rational estimation large as its share may be in the fierce prejudices and superstitions which prerational morality abounds in The strongest feelings assigned to the conscience are not moral feelings at all they express merely physical antipathies Toward alien powers a man s true weapon is not invective but skill and strength An obstacle is an obstacle not a devil and even a moral life when it actually exists in a being with hostile activities is merely a hostile power It is not hostile however in so far as it is moral but only in so far as its morality represents a material organism physically incompatible with what the thinker has at heart Sidenote Common ideal interests may supervene Material conflicts cannot be abolished by reason because reason is powerful only where they have been removed Yet where opposing forces are able mutually to comprehend and respect one another common ideal interests at once supervene and though the material conflict may remain irrepressible it will be overlaid by an intellectual life partly common and unanimous In this lies the chivalry of war that we acknowledge the right of others to pursue ends contrary to our own Competitors who are able to feel this ideal comity and who leading different lives in the flesh lead the same life in imagination are incited by their mutual understanding to rise above that material ambition perhaps gratuitous that has made them enemies They may ultimately wish to renounce that temporal good which deprives them of spiritual goods in truth infinitely greater and more appealing to the soul innocence justice and intelligence They may prefer an enlarged mind to enlarged frontiers and the comprehension of things foreign to the destruction of them They may even aspire to detachment from those private interests which as Plato said H do not deserve to be taken too seriously the fact that we must take them seriously being the ignoble part of our condition Of course such renunciations to be rational must not extend to the whole material basis of life since some physical particularity and efficiency are requisite for bringing into being that very rationality which is to turn enemies into friends The need of a material basis for spirit is what renders partial war with parts of the world the inevitable background of charity and justice The frontiers at which this warfare is waged may however be pushed back indefinitely Within the sphere organised about a firm and generous life a Roman peace can be established It is not what is assimilated that saps a creative will but what remains outside that ultimately invades and disrupts it In exact proportion to its vigour it wins over former enemies civilises the barbarian and even tames the viper when the eye is masterful and sympathetic enough to dispel hatred and fear The more rational an institution is the less it suffers by making concessions to others for these concessions being just propagate its essence The ideal commonwealth can extend to the limit at which such concessions cease to be just and are thereby detrimental Beyond or below that limit strife must continue for physical ascendancy so that the power and the will to be reasonable may not be undermined Reason is an operation in nature and has its root there Saints cannot arise where there have been no warriors nor philosophers where a prying beast does not remain hidden in the depths Sidenote To this extent there is rational society Perhaps the art of politics if it were practised scientifically might obviate open war religious enmities industrial competition and human slavery but it would certainly not leave a free field for all animals nor for all monstrosities in men Even while admitting the claims of monsters to be treated humanely reason could not suffer them to absorb those material resources which might be needed to maintain rational society at its highest efficiency We cannot at this immense distance from a rational social order judge what concessions individual genius would be called upon to make in a system of education and government in which all attainable goods should be pursued scientifically Concessions would certainly be demanded if not from well trained wills still from inevitable instincts reacting on inevitable accidents There is tragedy in perfection because the universe in which perfection arises is itself imperfect Accidents will always continue to harass the most consummate organism they will flow in both from the outer world and from the interstices so to speak of its own machinery for a rational life touches the irrational at its core as well as at its periphery In both directions it meets physical force and can subsist only by exercising physical force in return The range of rational ethics is limited to the intermediate political zone in which existences have attained some degree of natural unanimity It should be added perhaps that the frontiers between moral and physical action are purely notional Real existences do not lie wholly on one or the other side of them Every man every material object has moral affinities enveloping an indomitable vital nucleus or brute personal kernel this moral essence is enveloped in turn by untraceable relations radiating to infinity over the natural world The stars enter society by the light and knowledge they afford the time they keep and the ornament they lavish but they are mere dead weights in their substance and cosmological puzzles in their destiny You and I possess manifold ideal bonds in the interests we share but each of us has his poor body and his irremediable incommunicable dreams Beyond the little span of his foresight and love each is merely a physical agency preparing the way quite irresponsibly for undreamt of revolutions and alien lives Sidenote A rational morality not attainable A truly rational morality or social regimen has never existed in the world and is hardly to be looked for What guides men and nations in their practice is always some partial interest or some partial disillusion A rational morality would imply perfect self knowledge so that no congenial good should be needlessly missed least of all practical reason or justice itself so that no good congenial to other creatures would be needlessly taken from them The total value which everything had from the agent s point of view would need to be determined and felt efficaciously and among other things the total value which this point of view with the conduct it justified would have for every foreign interest which it affected Such knowledge such definition of purpose and such perfection of sympathy are clearly beyond man s reach All that can be hoped for is that the advance of science and commerce by fostering peace and a rational development of character may bring some part of mankind nearer to that goal but the goal lies as every ultimate ideal should at the limit of what is possible and must serve rather to measure achievements than to prophesy them Sidenote but its principle clear In lieu of a rational morality however we have rational ethics and this mere idea of a rational morality is something valuable While we wait for the sentiments customs and laws which should embody perfect humanity and perfect justice we may observe the germinal principle of these ideal things we may sketch the ground plan of a true commonwealth This sketch constitutes rational ethics as founded by Socrates glorified by Plato and sobered and solidified by Aristotle It sets forth the method of judgment and estimation which a rational morality would apply universally and express in practice The method being very simple can be discovered and largely illustrated in advance while the complete self knowledge and sympathy are still wanting which might avail to embody that method in the concrete and to discover unequivocally where absolute duty and ultimate happiness may lie Sidenote It is the logic of an autonomous will This method the Socratic method consists in accepting any estimation which any man may sincerely make and in applying dialectic to it so as to let the man see what he really esteems What he really esteems is what ought to guide his conduct for to suggest that a rational being ought to do what he feels to be wrong or ought to pursue what he genuinely thinks is worthless would be to impugn that man s rationality and to discredit one s own With what face could any man or god say to another Your duty is to do what you cannot know you ought to do your function is to suffer what you cannot recognise to be worth suffering Such an attitude amounts to imposture and excludes society it is the attitude of a detestable tyrant and any one who mistakes it for moral authority has not yet felt the first heart throb of philosophy Sidenote Socrates science More even than natural philosophy moral philosophy is something Greek it is the appanage of freemen The Socratic method is the soul of liberal conversation it is compacted in equal measure of sincerity and courtesy Each man is autonomous and all are respected and nothing is brought forward except to be submitted to reason and accepted or rejected by the self questioning heart Indeed when Socrates appeared in Athens mutual respect had passed into democracy and liberty into license but the stalwart virtue of Socrates saved him from being a sophist much as his method when not honestly and sincerely used might seem to countenance that moral anarchy which the sophists had expressed in their irresponsible doctrines Their sophistry did not consist in the private seat which they assigned to judgment for what judgment is there that is not somebody s judgment at some moment The sophism consisted in ignoring the living moment s intent and in suggesting that no judgment could refer to anything ulterior and therefore that no judgment could be wrong in other words that each man at each moment was the theme and standard as well as the seat of his judgment Socrates escaped this folly by force of honesty which is what saves from folly in dialectic He built his whole science precisely on that intent which the sophists ignored he insisted that people should declare sincerely what they meant and what they wanted and on that living rock he founded the persuasive and ideal sciences of logic and ethics the necessity of which lies all in free insight and in actual will This will and insight they render deliberate profound unshakable and consistent Socrates by his genial midwifery helped men to discover the truth and excellence to which they were naturally addressed This circumstance rendered his doctrine at once moral and scientific scientific because dialectical moral because expressive of personal and living aspirations His ethics was not like what has since passed under that name a spurious physics accompanied by commandments and threats It was a pliant and liberal expression of ideals inwardly grounded and spontaneously pursued It was an exercise in self knowledge Sidenote Its opposition to sophistry and moral anarchy Socrates liberality was that of a free man ready to maintain his will and conscience if need be against the whole world The sophists on the contrary were sycophants in their scepticism and having inwardly abandoned the ideals of their race and nation which Socrates defended with his homely irony they dealt out their miscellaneous knowledge or their talent in exposition at the beck and for the convenience of others Their theory was that each man having a right to pursue his own aims skilful thinkers might for money furnish any fellow mortal with instruments fitted to his purpose Socrates on the contrary conceived that each man to achieve his aims must first learn to distinguish them clearly he demanded that rationality in the form of an examination and clarification of purposes should precede any selection of external instruments For how should a man recognise anything useful unless he first had established the end to be subserved and thereby recognised the good True science then was that which enabled a man to disentangle and attain his natural good and such a science is also the art of life and the whole of virtue The autonomous moralist differs from the sophist or ethical sceptic in this that he retains his integrity In vindicating his ideal he does not recant his human nature In asserting the initial right of every impulse in others he remains the spokesman of his own Knowledge of the world courtesy and fairness do not neutralise his positive life He is thoroughly sincere as the sophist is not for every man while he lives embodies and enacts some special interest and this truth which those who confound psychology with ethics may think destructive of all authority in morals is in fact what alone renders moral judgment possible and respectable If the sophist declares that what his nature attaches him to is not really a good because it would not be a good perhaps for a different creature he is a false interpreter of his own heart and rather discreditably stultifies his honest feelings and actions by those theoretical valuations which in guise of a mystical ethics he gives out to the world Socratic liberality on the contrary is consistent with itself as Spinozistic naturalism is also for it exercises that right of private judgment which it concedes to others and avowedly builds up the idea of the good on that natural inner foundation on which everybody who has it at all must inevitably build it This functional good is accordingly always relative and good for something it is the ideal which a vital and energising soul carries with it as it moves It is identical as Socrates constantly taught with the useful the helpful the beneficent It is the complement needed to perfect every art and every activity after its own kind Sidenote Its vitality Rational ethics is an embodiment of volition not a description of it It is the expression of living interest preference and categorical choice It leaves to psychology and history a free field for the description of moral phenomena It has no interest in slipping far fetched and incredible myths beneath the facts of nature so as to lend a non natural origin to human aspirations It even recognises as an emanation of its own force that uncompromising truthfulness with which science assigns all forms of moral life to their place in the mechanical system of nature But the rational moralist is not on that account reduced to a mere spectator a physicist acknowledging no interest except the interest in facts and in the laws of change His own spirit small by the material forces which it may stand for and express is great by its prerogative of surveying and judging the universe surveying it of course from a mortal point of view and judging it only by its kindliness or cruelty to some actual interest yet even so determining unequivocally a part of its constitution and excellence The rational moralist represents a force energising in the world discovering its affinities there and clinging to them to the exclusion of their hateful opposites He represents over against the chance facts an ideal embodying the particular demands possibilities and satisfactions of a specific being This dogmatic position of reason is not uncritically dogmatic on the contrary it is the sophistical position that is uncritically neutral All criticism needs a dogmatic background else it would lack objects and criteria for criticism The sophist himself without confessing it enacts a special interest He bubbles over with convictions about the pathological and fatal origin of human beliefs as if that could prevent some of them from being more trustworthy and truer than others He is doubtless right in his psychology his own ideas have their natural causes and their chance of signifying something real His scepticism may represent a wider experience than do the fanaticisms it opposes But this sceptic also lives Nature has sent her saps abundantly into him and he cannot but nod dogmatically on that philosophical tree on which he is so pungent a berry His imagination is unmistakably fascinated by the pictures it happens to put together His judgment falls unabashed and his discourse splashes on in its dialectical march every stepping stone an unquestioned idea every stride a categorical assertion Does he deny this Then his very denial in its promptness and heat audibly contradicts him and makes him ridiculous Honest criticism consists in being consciously dogmatic and conscientiously so like Descartes when he said I am It is to sift and harmonise all assertions so as to make them a faithful expression of actual experience and inevitable thought Sidenote Genuine altruism is natural self expression Now will no less than that reason which avails to render will consistent and far reaching animates natural bodies and expresses their functions It has a radical bias a foregone determinate direction else it could not be a will nor a principle of preference The knowledge of what other people desire does not abolish a man s own aims Sympathy and justice are simply an expansion of the soul s interests arising when we consider other men s lives so intently that something in us imitates and re enacts their experience so that we move partly in unison with their movement recognise the reality and initial legitimacy of their interests and consequently regard their aims in our action in so far as our own status and purposes have become identical with theirs We are not less ourselves nor less autonomous for this assimilation since we assimilate only what is in itself intelligible and congruous with our mind and obey only that authority which can impose itself on our reason The case is parallel to that of knowledge To know all men s experience and to comprehend their beliefs would constitute the most cogent and settled of philosophies Thought would then be reasonably adjusted to all the facts of history and judgment would grow more authoritative and precise by virtue of that enlightenment So too to understand all the goods that any man nay that any beast or angel may ever have pursued would leave man still necessitous of food drink sleep and shelter he would still love the comic the loathsome the beautiful would still affect him with unmistakable direct emotions His taste might no doubt gain in elasticity by those sympathetic excursions into the polyglot world the plastic or dramatic quality which had enabled him to feel other creatures joys would grow by exercise and new overtones would be added to his gamut But the foundations of his nature would stand and his possible happiness though some new and precious threads might be woven into it would not have a texture fundamentally different The radical impulses at work in any animal must continue to speak while he lives for they are his essence A true morality does not have to be adopted the parts of it best practised are those which are never preached To be converted would be to pass from one self betrayal to another It would be to found a new morality on a new artifice The morality which has genuine authority exists inevitably and speaks autonomously in every common judgment self congratulation ambition or passion that fills the vulgar day The pursuit of those goods which are the only possible or fitting crown of a man s life is predetermined by his nature he cannot choose a law giver nor accept one for none who spoke to the purpose could teach him anything but to know himself Rational life is an art not a slavery and terrible as may be the errors and the apathy that impede its successful exercise the standard and goal of it are given intrinsically Any task imposed externally on a man is imposed by force only a force he has the right to defy so soon as he can do so without creating some greater impediment to his natural vocation Sidenote Reason expresses impulses Rational ethics then resembles prerational precepts and half systems in being founded on impulse It formulates a natural morality It is a settled method of achieving ends to which man is drawn by virtue of his physical and rational constitution By this circumstance rational ethics is removed from the bad company of all artificial verbal and unjust systems of morality which in absolving themselves from relevance to man s endowment and experience merely show how completely irrelevant they are to life Once no doubt each of these arbitrary systems expressed like the observance of the Sabbath some practical interest or some not unnatural rite but so narrow a basis of course has to be disowned when the precepts so originating have been swollen into universal tyrannical laws A rational ethics reduces them at once to their slender representative role and it surrounds and buttresses them on every side with all other natural ideals Sidenote but impulses reduced to harmony Rational ethics thus differs from the prerational in being complete There is one impulse which intuitive moralists ignore the impulse to reflect Human instincts are ignorant multitudinous and contradictory To satisfy them as they come is often impossible and often disastrous in that such satisfaction prevents the satisfaction of other instincts inherently no less fecund and legitimate When we apply reason to life we immediately demand that life be consistent complete and satisfactory when reflected upon and viewed as a whole This view as it presents each moment in its relations extends to all moments affected by the action or maxim under discussion it has no more ground for stopping at the limits of what is called a single life than at the limits of a single adventure To stop at selfishness is not particularly rational The same principle that creates the ideal of a self creates the ideal of a family or an institution Sidenote Self love artificial The conflict between selfishness and altruism is like that between any two ideal passions that in some particular may chance to be opposed but such a conflict has no obstinate existence for reason For reason the person itself has no obstinate existence The character which a man achieves at the best moment of his life is indeed something ideal and significant it justifies and consecrates all his coherent actions and preferences But the man s life the circle drawn by biographers around the career of a particular body from the womb to the charnel house and around the mental flux that accompanies that career is no significant unity All the substances and efficient processes that figure within it come from elsewhere and continue beyond while all the rational objects and interests to which it refers have a trans personal status Self love itself is concerned with public opinion and if a man concentrates his view on private pleasures these may qualify the fleeting moments of his life with an intrinsic value but they leave the life itself shapeless and infinite as if sparks should play over a piece of burnt paper The limits assigned to the mass of sentience attributed to each man are assigned conventionally his prenatal feelings his forgotten dreams and his unappropriated sensations belong to his body and for that reason only are said to belong to him Each impulse included within these limits may be as directly compared with the represented impulses of other people as with the represented impulses expected to arise later in the same body Reason lives among these represented values all of which have their cerebral seat and present efficacy over the passing thought and reason teaches this passing thought to believe in and to respect them equally Their right is not less clear nor their influence less natural because they may range over the whole universe and may await their realisation at the farthest boundaries of time All that is physically requisite to their operation is that they should be vividly represented while all that is requisite rationally to justify them in qualifying actual life by their influence is that the present act should have some tendency to bring the represented values about In other words a rational mind would consider in its judgment and action every interest which that judgment or action at all affected and it would conspire with each represented good in proportion not to that good s intrinsic importance but to the power which the present act might have of helping to realise that good Sidenote The sanction of reason is happiness If pleasure because it is commonly a result of satisfied instinct may by a figure of speech be called the aim of impulse happiness by a like figure may be called the aim of reason The direct aim of reason is harmony yet harmony when made to rule in life gives reason a noble satisfaction which we call happiness Happiness is impossible and even inconceivable to a mind without scope and without pause a mind driven by craving pleasure and fear The moralists who speak disparagingly of happiness are less sublime than they think In truth their philosophy is too lightly ballasted too much fed on prejudice and quibbles for happiness to fall within its range Happiness implies resource and security it can be achieved only by discipline Your intuitive moralist rejects discipline at least discipline of the conscience and he is punished by having no lien on wisdom He trusts to the clash of blind forces in collision being one of them himself He demands that virtue should be partisan and unjust and he dreams of crushing the adversary in some physical cataclysm Such groping enthusiasm is often innocent and romantic it captivates us with its youthful spell But it has no structure with which to resist the shocks of fortune which it goes out so jauntily to meet It turns only too often into vulgarity and worldliness A snow flake is soon a smudge and there is a deeper purity in the diamond Happiness is hidden from a free and casual will it belongs rather to one chastened by a long education and unfolded in an atmosphere of sacred and perfected institutions It is discipline that renders men rational and capable of happiness by suppressing without hatred what needs to be suppressed to attain a beautiful naturalness Discipline discredits the random pleasures of illusion hope and triumph and substitutes those which are self reproductive perennial and serene because they express an equilibrium maintained with reality So long as the result of endeavour is partly unforeseen and unintentional so long as the will is partly blind the Life of Reason is still swaddled in ignominy and the animal barks in the midst of human discourse Wisdom and happiness consist in having recast natural energies in the furnace of experience Nor is this experience merely a repressive force It enshrines the successful expressions of spirit as well as the shocks and vetoes of circumstance it enables a man to know himself in knowing the world and to discover his ideal by the very ring true or false of fortune s coin Sidenote Moral science impeded by its chaotic data With this brief account we may leave the subject of rational ethics Its development is impossible save in the concrete when a legislator starting from extant interests considers what practices serve to render those interests vital and genuine and what external alliances might lend them support and a more glorious expression The difficulty in carrying rational policy very far comes partly from the refractory materials at hand and partly from the narrow range within which moral science is usually confined The materials are individual wills naturally far from unanimous lost for the most part in frivolous pleasures rivalries and superstitions and little inclined to listen to a law giver that like a new Lycurgus should speak to them of unanimity simplicity discipline and perfection Devotion and singlemindedness perhaps possible in the cloister are hard to establish in the world yet a rational morality requires that all lay activities all sweet temptations should have their voice in the conclave Morality becomes rational precisely by refusing either to accept human nature as it sprouts altogether without harmony or to mutilate it in the haste to make it harmonious The condition therefore of making a beginning in good politics is to find a set of men with well knit character and cogent traditions so that there may be a firm soil to cultivate and that labour may not be wasted in ploughing the quicksands Sidenote and its unrecognised scope When such a starting point is given moral values radiate from it to the very ends of the universe and a failure to appreciate the range over which rational estimation spreads is a second obstacle to sound ethics Because of this failure the earnest soul is too often intent on escaping to heaven while the gross politician is suffered to declaim about the national honour and to promise this client an office this district a favour and this class an iniquitous advantage Politics is expected to be sophistical and in the soberest parliaments hardly an argument is used or an ideal invoked which is not an insult to reason Majorities work by a system of bribes offered to the more barren interests of men and to their more blatant prejudices The higher direction of their lives is relegated to religion which unhappily is apt to suffer from hereditary blindness to natural needs and to possible progress The idea that religion as well as art industry nationality and science should exist only for human life s sake and in order that men may live better in this world is an idea not even mooted in politics and perhaps opposed by an official philosophy The enterprise of individuals or of small aristocratic bodies has meantime sown the world which we call civilised with some seeds and nuclei of order There are scattered about a variety of churches industries academies and governments But the universal order once dreamt of and nominally almost established the empire of universal peace all permeating rational art and philosophical worship is mentioned no more An unformulated conception the prerational ethics of private privilege and national unity fills the background of men s minds It represents feudal traditions rather than the tendency really involved in contemporary industry science or philanthropy Those dark ages from which our political practice is derived had a political theory which we should do well to study for their theory about a universal empire and a catholic church was in turn the echo of a former age of reason when a few men conscious of ruling the world had for a moment sought to survey it as a whole and to rule it justly Modern rational ethics however or what approaches most nearly to such a thing has one advantage over the ancient and mediaeval it has profited by Christian discipline and by the greater gentleness of modern manners It has recognised the rights of the dumb majority it has revolted against cruelty and preventable suffering and has bent itself on diffusing well being the well being that people want and not the so called virtues which a supercilious aristocracy may find it convenient to prescribe for them It has based ethics on the foundation on which actual morality rests on nature on the necessities of social life on the human instincts of sympathy and justice Sidenote Fallacy in democratic hedonism It is all the more to be regretted that the only modern school of ethics which is humane and honestly interested in progress should have given a bad technical expression to its generous principles and should have substituted a dubious psychology for Socratic dialectic The mere fact that somebody somewhere enjoys or dislikes a thing cannot give direction to a rational will That fact indicates a moral situation but does not prescribe a definite action A partial harmony or maladjustment is thereby proved to exist but the method is not revealed by which the harmony should be sustained or the maladjustment removed A given harmony can be sustained by leaving things as they are or by changing them together A maladjustment can be removed by altering the environment or by altering the man Pleasures may be attached to anything and to pursue them in the abstract does not help to define any particular line of conduct The particular ideal pre exists in the observer the mathematics of pleasure and pain cannot oblige him for instance to prefer a hundred units of mindless pleasure enjoyed in dreams to fifty units diffused over labour and discourse He need not limit his efforts to spreading needless comforts and silly pleasures among the million he need not accept for a goal a child s caprices multiplied by infinity Even these caprices pleasures and comforts doubtless have their claims but these claims have to be adjudicated by the agent s autonomous conscience and he will give them the place they fill in his honest ideal of what it would be best to have in the world not the place which they might pretend to usurp there by a sort of physical pressure A conscience is a living function expressing a particular nature it is not a passive medium where heterogeneous values can find their balance by virtue of their dead weight and number A moralist is called upon first of all to decide in what things pleasure ought to be found Of course his decision if he is rational will not be arbitrary it will conscientiously express his own nature on which alone honest ideals can rest without attempting to speak for the deafening and inconstant convocation of the whole sentient universe Duty is a matter of self knowledge not of statistics A living and particular will therein discovers its affinities broadens its basis acknowledges its obligations and company operates with everything that will company operate with it but it continues throughout to unfold a particular life finding its supports and extensions in the state the arts and the universe It cannot for a moment renounce its autonomy without renouncing reason and perhaps decreeing the extinction both of its own bodily basis and of its ideal method and policy Sidenote Sympathy a conditional duty Utilitarianism needs to be transferred to Socratic and dialectical ground so that interest in absent interests may take its place in a concrete ideal It is a noble thing to be sensitive to others hardships and happy in their happiness but it is noble because it refines the natural will without enfeebling it offering it rather a new and congenial development one entirely predetermined by the fundamental structure of human nature Were man not gregarious were he not made to be child friend husband and father by turns his morality would not be social but like that of some silk worm or some seraph wholly industrious or wholly contemplative Parental and sexual instincts social life and the gift of company operation carry sympathy implicitly with them as they carry the very faculty to recognise a fellow being To make this sympathy explicit and to find one s happiness in exercising it is to lay one s foundations deeper in nature and to expand the range of one s being Its limits however would be broken down and moral dissolution would set in if forgetting his humanity a man should bid all living creatures lapse with him into a delicious torpor or run into a cycle of pleasant dreams so intense that death would be sure to precede any awakening out of them Great as may be the advance in charity since the days of Socrates therefore the advance is within the lines of his method to trespass beyond them would be to recede This situation is repeated on a broader stage A statesman entrusted with power should regard nothing but his country s interests to regard anything else would be treason He cannot allow foreign sentiment or private hobbies to make him misapply the resources of his fellow countrymen to their own injury But he may well have an enlightened view of the interests which he serves he might indeed be expected to take a more profound and enlightened view of them than his countrymen were commonly capable of else he would have no right to his eminent station He should be the first to feel that to inflict injury or foster hatred among other populations should not be a portion of a people s happiness A nation like a man is something ideal Indestructible mountains and valleys crawled over by any sort of race do not constitute its identity Its essence is a certain spirit and only what enters into this spirit can bind it morally or preserve it Sidenote All life and hence right life finite and particular If a drop of water contains a million worlds which I in swallowing may ruin or transform that is Allah s business mine is to clarify my own intent to cling to what ideals may lie within the circle of my experience and practical imagination so that I may have a natural ground for my loyalties and may be constant in them It would not be a rational ambition to wish to multiply the population of China by two or that of America by twenty after ascertaining that life there contained an overplus of pleasure To weed a garden however would be rational though the weeds and their interests would have to be sacrificed in the process Utilitarianism took up false ground when it made right conduct terminate in miscellaneous pleasures and pains as if in their isolation they constituted all that morality had to consider and as if respect offered to them somehow in proportion to their quantity were the true conscience The true conscience is rather an integrated natural will chastened by clear knowledge of what it pursues and may attain What morality has to consider is the form of life not its quantity In a world that is perhaps infinite moral life can spring only from definite centres and is neither called upon nor able to estimate the whole nor to redress its balance It is the free spirit of a part finding its affinities and equilibrium in the material whole which it reacts on and which it is in that measure enabled to understand FOOTNOTES Footnote H Laws VII eight hundred three B CHAPTER X POST RATIONAL MORALITY Sidenote Socratic ethics retrospective When Socrates and his two great disciples composed a system of rational ethics they were hardly proposing practical legislation for mankind One by his irony another by his frank idealism and the third by his preponderating interest in history and analysis showed clearly enough how little they dared to hope They were merely writing an eloquent epitaph on their country They were publishing the principles of what had been its life gathering piously its broken ideals and interpreting its momentary achievement The spirit of liberty and company operation was already dead The private citizen debauched by the largesses and petty quarrels of his city had become indolent and mean spirited He had begun to question the utility of religion of patriotism and of justice Having allowed the organ for the ideal to atrophy in his soul he could dream of finding some sullen sort of happiness in unreason He felt that the austere glories of his country as a Spartan regimen might have preserved them would not benefit that baser part of him which alone remained Political virtue seemed a useless tax on his material profit and freedom The tedium and distrust proper to a disintegrated society began to drive him to artificial excitements and superstitions Democracy had learned to regard as enemies the few in whom public interest was still represented the few whose nobler temper and traditions still coincided with the general good These last patriots were gradually banished or exterminated and with them died the spirit that rational ethics had expressed Philosophers were no longer suffered to have illusions about the state Human activity on the public stage had shaken off all allegiance to art or reason Sidenote Rise of disillusioned moralities The biographer of reason might well be tempted to ignore the subsequent attitudes into which moral life fell in the West since they all embodied a more or less complete despair and having abandoned the effort to express the will honestly and dialectically they could support no moral science The point was merely to console or deceive the soul with some substitute for happiness Life is older and more persistent than reason and the failure of a first experiment in rationality does not deprive mankind of that mental and moral vegetation which they possessed for ages in a wild state before the advent of civilisation They merely revert to their uncivil condition and espouse whatever imaginative ideal comes to hand by which some semblance of meaning and beauty may be given to existence without the labour of building this meaning and beauty systematically out of its positive elements Not to study these imaginative ideals partial and arbitrary as they are would be to miss one of the most instructive points of view from which the Life of Reason may be surveyed the point of view of its satirists For moral ideals may follow upon philosophy just as they may precede it When they follow at least so long as they are consciously embraced in view of reason s failure they have a quite particular value Aversion to rational ideals does not then come as the intuitionist s aversion does from moral incoherence or religious prejudice It does not come from lack of speculative power On the contrary it may come from undue haste in speculation from a too ready apprehension of the visible march of things The obvious irrationality of nature as a whole too painfully brought home to a musing mind may make it forget or abdicate its own rationality In a decadent age the philosopher who surveys the world and sees that the end of it is even as the beginning may not feel that the intervening episode in which he and all he values after all figure is worth consideration and he may cry in his contemplative spleen that all is vanity If you should still confront him with a theory of the ideal he would not be reduced like the pre rational moralists in a similar case to mere inattention and bluster If you told him that every art and every activity involves a congruous good and that the endeavour to realise the ideal in every direction is an effort of which reason necessarily approves since reason is nothing but the method of that endeavour he would not need to deny your statements in order to justify himself He might admit the naturalness the spontaneity the ideal sufficiency of your conceptions but he might add with the smile of the elder and the sadder man that he had experience of their futility You Hellenisers he might say are but children you have not pondered the little history you know If thought were conversant with reality if virtue were stable and fruitful if pains and policy were ultimately justified by a greater good arising out of them then indeed a life according to reason might tempt a philosopher But unfortunately not one of those fond assumptions is true Human thought is a meaningless phantasmagoria Virtue is a splendid and laborious folly when it is not a pompous garment that only looks respectable in the dark being in truth full of spots and ridiculous patches Men s best laid plans become in the casual cross currents of being the occasion of their bitterest calamities How then live How justify in our eyes let us not say the ways of God but our own ways Sidenote The illusion subsisting in them Such a position may be turned dialectically by invoking whatever positive hopes or convictions the critic may retain who while he lives cannot be wholly without them But the position is specious and does not collapse like that of the intuitionist at the first breath of criticism Pessimism and all the moralities founded on despair are not pre rational but post rational They are the work of men who more or less explicitly have conceived the Life of Reason tried it at least imaginatively and found it wanting These systems are a refuge from an intolerable situation they are experiments in redemption As a matter of fact animal instincts and natural standards of excellence are never eluded in them for no moral experience has other terms but the part of the natural ideal which remains active appears in opposition to all the rest and by an intelligible illusion seems to be no part of that natural ideal because compared with the commoner passions on which it reacts it represents some simpler or more attenuated hope the appeal to some very humble or very much chastened satisfaction or to an utter change in the conditions of life Post rational morality thus constitutes in intention if not in fact a criticism of all experience It thinks it is not like pre rational morality an arbitrary selection from among company ordinate precepts It is an effort to subordinate all precepts to one that points to some single eventual good For it occurs to the founders of these systems that by estranging oneself from the world or resting in the moment s pleasure or mortifying the passions or enduring all sufferings in patience or studying a perfect conformity with the course of affairs one may gain admission to some sort of residual mystical paradise and this thought once conceived is published as a revelation and accepted as a panacea It becomes in consequence for such is the force of nature the foundation of elaborate institutions and elaborate philosophies into which the contents of the worldly life are gradually reintroduced When human life is in an acute crisis the sick dreams that visit the soul are the only evidence of her continued existence Through them she still envisages a good and when the delirium passes and the normal world gradually re establishes itself in her regard she attributes her regeneration to the ministry of those phantoms a regeneration due in truth to the restored nutrition and circulation within her In this way post rational systems though founded originally on despair in a later age that has forgotten its disillusions may come to pose as the only possible basis of morality The philosophers addicted to each sect and brought up under its influence may exhaust criticism and sophistry to show that all faith and effort would be vain unless their particular nostrum was accepted and so a curious party philosophy arises in which after discrediting nature and reason in general the sectary puts forward some mythical echo of reason and nature as the one saving and necessary truth The positive substance of such a doctrine is accordingly pre rational and perhaps crudely superstitious but it is introduced and nominally supported by a formidable indictment of physical and moral science so that the wretched idol ultimately offered to our worship acquires a spurious halo and an imputed majesty by being raised on a pedestal of infinite despair Sidenote Epicurean refuge in pleasure Socrates was still living when a school of post rational morality arose among the Sophists which after passing quickly through various phases settled down into Epicureanism and has remained the source of a certain consolation to mankind which if somewhat cheap is none the less genuine The pursuit of pleasure may seem simple selfishness with a tendency to debauchery and in this case the pre rational and instinctive character of the maxim retained would be very obvious Pleasure to be sure is not the direct object of an unspoiled will but after some experience and discrimination a man may actually guide himself by a foretaste of the pleasures he has found in certain objects and situations The criticism required to distinguish what pays from what does not pay may not often be carried very far but it may sometimes be carried to the length of suppressing every natural instinct and natural hope and of turning the philosopher as it turned Hegesias the Cyrenaic into a eulogist of death The post rational principle in the system then comes to the fore and we see clearly that to sit down and reflect upon human life picking out its pleasant moments and condemning all the rest is to initiate a course of moral retrenchment It is to judge what is worth doing not by the innate ambition of the soul but by experience of incidental feelings which to a mind without creative ideas may seem the only objects worthy of pursuit That life ought to be accompanied by pleasure and exempt from pain is certain for this means that what is agreeable to the whole process of nature would have become agreeable also to the various partial impulses involved another way of describing organic harmony and physical perfection But such a desirable harmony cannot be defined or obtained by picking out and isolating from the rest those occasions and functions in which it may already have been reached These partial harmonies may be actual arrests or impediments in the whole which is to be made harmonious and even when they are innocent or helpful they cannot serve to determine the form which the general harmony might take on They merely illustrate its principle The organism in which this principle of harmony might find pervasive expression is still potential and the ideal is something of which in its concrete form no man has had experience It involves a propitious material environment perfect health perfect arts perfect government a mind enlarged to the knowledge and enjoyment of all its external conditions and internal functions Such an ideal is lost sight of when a man cultivates his garden plot of private pleasures leaving it to chance and barbarian fury to govern the state and quicken the world s passions Even Aristippus the first and most delightful of hedonists who really enjoyed the pleasures he advocated and was not afraid of the incidental pains even Aristippus betrayed the post rational character of his philosophy by abandoning politics mocking science making his peace with all abuses that fostered his comfort and venting his wit on all ambitions that exceeded his hopes A great temperament can carry off a rough philosophy Rebellion and license may distinguish honourable souls in an age of polite corruption and a grain of sincerity is better in moral philosophy than a whole harvest of conventionalities The violence and shamelessness of Aristippus were corrected by Epicurus and a balance was found between utter despair and utter irresponsibility Epicureanism retrenched much it cut off politics religion enterprise and passion These things it convicted of vanity without stopping to distinguish in them what might be inordinate from what might be rational At the same time it retained friendship freedom of soul and intellectual light It cultivated unworldliness without superstition and happiness without illusion It was tender toward simple and honest things scornful and bitter only against pretence and usurpation It thus marked a first halting place in the retreat of reason a stage where the soul had thrown off only the higher and more entangling part of her burden and was willing to live in somewhat reduced circumstances on the remainder Such a philosophy expresses well the genuine sentiment of persons at once mild and emancipated who find themselves floating on the ebb tide of some civilisation and enjoying its fruits without any longer representing the forces that brought that civilisation about Sidenote Stoic recourse to conformity The same emancipation without its mildness appeared in the Cynics whose secret it was to throw off all allegiance and all dependence on circumstance and to live entirely on inner strength of mind on pride and inflexible humour The renunciation was far more sweeping than that of Epicurus and indeed wellnigh complete yet the Stoics in underpinning the Cynical self sufficiency with a system of physics introduced into the life of the sect a contemplative element which very much enlarged and ennobled its sympathies Nature became a sacred system the laws of nature being eulogistically called rational laws and the necessity of things because it might be foretold in auguries being called providence There was some intellectual confusion in all this but contemplation even if somewhat idolatrous has a purifying effect and the sad and solemn review of the cosmos to which the Stoic daily invited his soul to make it ready to face its destiny doubtless liberated it from many an unworthy passion The impressive spectacle of things was used to remind the soul of her special and appropriate function which was to be rational This rationality consisted partly in insight to perceive the necessary order of things and partly in conformity to perceive that this order whatever it might be could serve the soul to exercise itself upon and to face with equanimity Despair in this system flooded a much larger area of human life everything in fact was surrendered except the will to endure whatever might come The concentration was much more marked since only a formal power of perception and defiance was retained and made the sphere of moral life this rational power at least in theory was the one peak that remained visible above the deluge But in practice much more was retained Some distinction was drawn however unwarrantably between external calamities and human turpitude so that absolute conformity and acceptance might not be demanded by the latter although the chief occasion which a Stoic could find to practise fortitude and recognise the omnipresence of law was in noting the universal corruption of the state and divining its ruin The obligation to conform to nature which strictly speaking could not be disregarded in any case was interpreted to signify that every one should perform the offices conventionally attached to his station In this way a perfunctory citizenship and humanity were restored to the philosopher But the restored life was merely histrionic the Stoic was a recluse parading the market place and a monk disguised in armour His interest and faith were centred altogether on his private spiritual condition He cultivated the society of those persons who he thought might teach him some virtue He attended to the affairs of state so as to exercise his patience He might even lead an army to battle if he wished to test his endurance and make sure that philosophy had rendered him indifferent to the issue Sidenote Conformity the core of Islam The strain and artifice of such a discipline with merely formal goals and no hope on earth or in heaven could not long maintain itself and doubtless it existed at a particular juncture only in a few souls Resignation to the will of God says Bishop Butler is the whole of piety yet mere resignation would make a sorry religion and the negation of all morality unless the will of God was understood to be quite different from his operation in nature To turn Stoicism into a workable religion we need to qualify it with some pre rational maxims Islam for instance which boasts that in its essence it is nothing but the primitive and natural religion of mankind consists in abandoning oneself to the will of God or in other words in accepting the inevitable This will of God is learned for the most part by observing the course of nature and history and remembering the fate meted out habitually to various sorts of men Were this all Islam would be a pure Stoicism and Hebraic religion in its ultimate phase would be simply the eloquence of physics It would not in that case be a moral inspiration at all except as contemplation and the sense of one s nothingness might occasionally silence the passions and for a moment bewilder the mind On recovering from this impression however men would find themselves enriched with no self knowledge armed with no precepts and stimulated by no ideal They would be reduced to enacting their incidental impulses as the animals are quite as if they had never perceived that in doing so they were fulfilling a divine decree Enlightened Moslems accordingly have often been more Epicurean than Stoical and if they have felt themselves not without some reason superior to Christians in delicacy in savoir vivre in kinship with all natural powers this sense of superiority has been quite rationalistic and purely human Their religion contributed to it only because it was simpler freer from superstition nearer to a clean and pleasant regimen in life Resignation to the will of God being granted expression of the will of man might more freely begin Sidenote enveloped in arbitrary doctrines What made Islam however a positive and contagious novelty was the assumption that God s will might be incidentally revealed to prophets before the event so that past experience was not the only source from which its total operation might be gathered In its opposition to grosser idolatries Islam might appeal to experience and challenge those who trusted in special deities to justify their worship in face of the facts The most decisive facts against idolaters however were not yet patent but were destined to burst upon mankind at the last day and most unpleasantly for the majority Where Mohammed speaks in the name of the universal natural power he is abundantly scornful toward that fond paganism which consists in imagining distinct patrons for various regions of nature or for sundry human activities In turning to such patrons the pagan regards something purely ideal or as the Koran shrewdly observes worships his own passions Allah on the contrary is overwhelmingly external and as far as possible from being ideal He is indeed the giver of all good things as of all evil and while his mercies are celebrated on every page of the Koran these mercies consist in the indulgence he is expected to show to his favourites and the exceeding reward reserved for them after their earthly trials Allah s mercy does not exclude all those senseless and unredeemed cruelties of which nature is daily guilty nay it shines all the more conspicuously by contrast with his essential irresponsibility and wanton wrath a part of his express purpose being to keep hell full of men and demons The tendency toward enlightenment which Islam represents and the limits of that enlightenment may be illustrated by the precept about unclean animals Allah we are told being merciful and gracious made the world for man s use with all the animals in it We may therefore justly slaughter and devour them in so far as comports with health but of course we may not eat animals that have died a natural death nor those offered in sacrifice to false gods nor swine for to do so would be an abomination Sidenote The latter alone lend it practical force Unfortunately religious reformers triumph not so much by their rational insight as by their halting traditional maxims Mohammed felt the unity of God like a philosopher but people listened to him because he preached it like a sectary God as he often reminds us did not make the world for a plaything he made it in order to establish distinctions and separate by an immense interval the fate of those who conform to the truth from the fate of those who ignore it Human life is indeed beset with enough imminent evils to justify this urgent tone in the Semitic moralist and to lend his precepts a stern practical ring absent from merely Platonic idealisms But this stringency which is called positivism when the conditions of welfare are understood becomes fanaticism when they are misrepresented Had Mohammed spoken only of the dynamic unity in things the omnipresence of destiny and the actual conditions of success and failure in the world he would not have been called a prophet or have had more than a dozen intelligent followers scattered over as many centuries but the weakness of his intellect and his ignorance of nature made the success of his mission It is easier to kindle righteous indignation against abuses when by abating them we further our personal interests and Mohammed might have been less zealous in denouncing false gods had his own God been altogether the true one But in the heat of his militancy he descends so far as to speak of God s interests which the faithful embrace and of fighting in God s cause By these notions so crudely pre rational we are allowed to interpret and discount the pantheistic sublimities with which in most places we are regaled and in order that a morality too weak to be human may not wither altogether in the fierce light of the Absolute we are led to humanise the Absolute into a finite force needing our support against independent enemies So complete is the bankruptcy of that Stoic morality which thinks to live on the worship of That which Is Sidenote Moral ambiguity in pantheism As extremes are said to meet so we may say that a radical position is often the point of departure for opposite systems Pantheism or religion and morality abdicating in favour of physics may in practice be interpreted in contrary ways To be in sympathy with the Whole may seem to require us to outgrow and discard every part yet on the other hand there is no obvious reason why Being should love its essence in a fashion that involves hating every possible form of Being The worshipper of Being accordingly assumes now one now the other of two opposite attitudes according as the society in which he lives is in a prerational or a post rational state of culture Pantheism is interpreted pre rationally as by the early Mohammedans or by the Hegelians when people are not yet acquainted or not yet disgusted with worldliness the Absolute then seems to lend a mystical sanction to whatever existences or tendencies happen to be afoot Morality is reduced to sanctioning reigning conventions or reigning passions on the authority of the universe Thus the Moslems by way of serving Allah could extend their conquests and cultivate the arts and pleasures congenial to a self sufficing soul at once indolent and fierce while the transcendentalists of our times by way of accepting their part in the divine business have merely added a certain speculative loftiness to the maxims of some sect or the chauvinism of some nation Sidenote Under stress it becomes ascetic and requires a mythology To accept everything however is not an easy nor a tolerable thing unless you are naturally well pleased with what falls to your share However the Absolute may feel a moral creature has to hate some forms of being and if the age has thrust these forms before a man s eyes and imposed them upon him not being suffered by his pantheism to blame the Absolute he will by an inconsistency take to blaming himself It will be his finitude his inordinate claims his enormous effrontery in having any will or any preference in particular that will seem to him the source of all evil and the single blot on the infinite lucidity of things Pantheism under these circumstances will issue in a post rational morality It will practise asceticism and look for a mystical deliverance from finite existence Under these circumstances myth is inevitably reintroduced Without it no consolation could be found except in the prospect of death and awaiting that in incidental natural satisfactions whereby absorption in the Absolute might come to look not only impossible but distinctly undesirable To make retreat out of human nature seem a possible vocation this nature itself must in some myth be represented as unnatural the soul that this life stifles must be said to come from elsewhere and to be fitted to breathe some element far rarer and finer than this sublunary fog Sidenote A supernatural world made by the Platonist out of dialectic A curious foothold for such a myth was furnished by the Socratic philosophy Plato wafted by his poetic vision too far perhaps from the utilitarianism of his master had eulogised concretions in discourse at the expense of existences and had even played with cosmological myths meant to express the values of things by speaking as if these values had brought things into being The dialectical terms thus contrasted with natural objects and pictured as natural powers furnished the dogmas needed at this juncture by a post rational religion The spell which dialectic can exercise over an abstracted mind is itself great and it may grow into a sacred influence and a positive revelation when it offers a sanctuary from a weary life in the world Out of the play of notions carried on in a prayerful dream wonderful mysteries can be constructed to be presently announced to the people and made the core of sacramental injunctions When the tide of vulgar superstition is at the flood and every form of quackery is welcome we need not wonder that a theosophy having so respectable a core something indeed like a true logic misunderstood should gain many adherents Out of the names of things and of virtues a mystic ladder could be constructed by which to leave the things and the virtues themselves behind but the sagacity and exigencies of the school would not fail to arrange the steps in this progress the end of which was unattainable except perhaps in a momentary ecstasy so that the obvious duties of men would continue for the nonce to be imposed upon them The chief difference made in morals would be only this that the positive occasions and sanctions of good conduct would no longer be mentioned with respect but the imagination would be invited to dwell instead on mystical issues Sidenote The Herbraic cry for redemption Neo Platonic morality through a thousand learned and vulgar channels permeated Christianity and entirely transformed it Original Christianity was though in another sense a religion of redemption The Jews without dreaming of original sin or of any inherent curse in being finite had found themselves often in the sorest material straits They hoped like all primitive peoples that relief might come by propitiating the deity They knew that the sins of the fathers were visited upon the children even to the third and fourth generation They had accepted this idea of joint responsibility and vicarious atonement turning in their unphilosophical way this law of nature into a principle of justice Meantime the failure of all their cherished ambitions had plunged them into a penitential mood Though in fact pious and virtuous to a fault they still looked for repentance their own or the world s to save them This redemption was to be accomplished in the Hebrew spirit through long suffering and devotion to the Law with the Hebrew solidarity by vicarious attribution of merits and demerits within the household of the faith Such a way of conceiving redemption was far more dramatic poignant and individual than the Neo Platonic hence it was far more popular and better fitted to be a nucleus for religious devotion However much therefore Christianity may have insisted on renouncing the world the flesh and the devil it always kept in the background this perfectly Jewish and pre rational craving for a delectable promised land The journey might be long and through a desert but milk and honey were to flow in the oasis beyond Had renunciation been fundamental or revulsion from nature complete there would have been no much trumpeted last judgment and no material kingdom of heaven The renunciation was only temporary and partial the revulsion was only against incidental evils Despair touched nothing but the present order of the world though at first it took the extreme form of calling for its immediate destruction This was the sort of despair and renunciation that lay at the bottom of Christian repentance while hope in a new order of this world or of one very like it lay at the bottom of Christian joy A temporary sacrifice it was thought and a partial mutilation would bring the spirit miraculously into a fresh paradise The pleasures nature had grudged or punished grace was to offer as a reward for faith and patience The earthly life which was vain as an experience was to be profitable as a trial Normal experience appropriate exercise for the spirit would thereafter begin Sidenote The two factors meet in Christianity Christianity is thus a system of postponed rationalism a rationalism intercepted by a supernatural version of the conditions of happiness Its moral principle is reason the only moral principle there is its motive power is the impulse and natural hope to be and to be happy Christianity merely renews and reinstates these universal principles after a first disappointment and a first assault of despair by opening up new vistas of accomplishment new qualities and measures of success The Christian field of action being a world of grace enveloping the world of nature many transitory reversals of acknowledged values may take place in its code Poverty chastity humility obedience self sacrifice ignorance sickness and dirt may all acquire a religious worth which reason in its direct application might scarcely have found in them yet these reversed appreciations are merely incidental to a secret rationality and are justified on the ground that human nature as now found is corrupt and needs to be purged and transformed before it can safely manifest its congenital instincts and become again an authoritative criterion of values In the kingdom of God men would no longer need to do penance for life there would be truly natural and there the soul would be at last in her native sphere This submerged optimism exists in Christianity being a heritage from the Jews and those Protestant communities that have rejected the pagan and Platonic elements that overlaid it have little difficulty in restoring it to prominence Not however without abandoning the soul of the gospel for the soul of the gospel though expressed in the language of Messianic hopes is really post rational It was not to marry and be given in marriage or to sit on thrones or to unravel metaphysical mysteries or to enjoy any of the natural delights renounced in this life that Christ summoned his disciples to abandon all they had and to follow him There was surely a deeper peace in his self surrender It was not a new thing even among the Jews to use the worldly promises of their exoteric religion as symbols for inner spiritual revolutions and the change of heart involved in genuine Christianity was not a fresh excitation of gaudy hopes nor a new sort of utilitarian temporary austerity It was an emptying of the will in respect to all human desires so that a perfect charity and contemplative justice falling like the Father s gifts ungrudgingly on the whole creation might take the place of ambition petty morality and earthly desires It was a renunciation which at least in Christ himself and in his more spiritual disciples did not spring from disappointed illusion or lead to other unregenerate illusions even more sure to be dispelled by events It sprang rather from a native speculative depth a natural affinity to the divine fecundity serenity and sadness of the world It was the spirit of prayer the kindliness and insight which a pure soul can fetch from contemplation Sidenote Consequent electicism This mystical detachment supervening on the dogged old Jewish optimism gave Christianity a double aspect and had some curious consequence in later times Those who were inwardly convinced as most religious minds were under the Roman Empire that all earthly things were vanity and that they plunged the soul into an abyss of nothingness if not of torment could in view of brighter possibilities in another world carry their asceticism and their cult of suffering farther than a purely negative system like the Buddhistic would have allowed For a discipline that is looked upon as merely temporary can contradict nature more boldly than one intended to take nature s place The hope of unimaginable benefits to ensue could drive religion to greater frenzies than it could have fallen into if its object had been merely to silence the will Christianity persecuted tortured and burned Like a hound it tracked the very scent of heresy It kindled wars and nursed furious hatreds and ambitions It sanctified quite like Mohammedanism extermination and tyranny All this would have been impossible if like Buddhism it had looked only to peace and the liberation of souls It looked beyond it dreamt of infinite blisses and crowns it should be crowned with before an electrified universe and an applauding God These were rival baits to those which the world fishes with and were snapped at when seen with no less avidity Man far from being freed from his natural passions was plunged into artificial ones quite as violent and much more disappointing Buddhism had tried to quiet a sick world with anaesthetics Christianity sought to purge it with fire Another consequence of combining in the Christian life post rational with pre rational motives a sense of exile and renunciation with hopes of a promised land was that esoteric piety could choose between the two factors even while it gave a verbal assent to the dogmas that included both Mystics honoured the post rational motive and despised the pre rational positivists clung to the second and hated the first To the spiritually minded whose religion was founded on actual insight and disillusion the joys of heaven could never be more than a symbol for the intrinsic worth of sanctity To the worldling those heavenly joys were nothing but a continuation of the pleasures and excitements of this life serving to choke any reflections which in spite of himself might occasionally visit him about the vanity of human wishes So that Christianity even in its orthodox forms covers various kinds of morality and its philosophical incoherence betrays itself in disruptive movements profound schisms and total alienation on the part of one Christian from the inward faith of another Trappist or Calvinist may be practising a heroic and metaphysical self surrender while the busy bodies of their respective creeds are fostering in God s name all their hot and miscellaneous passions Sidenote The negation of naturalism never complete This contradiction present in the overt morality of Christendom cannot be avoided however by taking refuge again in pure asceticism Every post rational system is necessarily self contradictory Its despair cannot be universal nor its nihilism complete so long as it remains a coherent method of action with particular goals and a steady faith that their attainment is possible The renunciation of the will must stop at the point where the will to be saved makes its appearance and as this desire may be no less troublesome and insistent than any other as it may even become a tormenting obsession the mystic is far from the end of his illusions when he sets about to dispel them There is one rational method to which in post rational systems the world is still thought to be docile one rational endeavour which nature is sure to crown with success This is the method of deliverance from existence the effort after salvation There is let us say a law of Karma by which merit and demerit accruing in one incarnation pass on to the next and enable the soul to rise continuously through a series of stages Thus the world though called illusory is not wholly intractable It provides systematically for an exit out of its illusions On this rational ordinance of phenomena which is left standing by an imperfect nihilism Buddhist morality is built Rational endeavour remains possible because experience is calculable and fruitful in this one respect that it dissolves in the presence of goodness and knowledge Similarly in Christian ethics the way of the cross has definite stations and a definite end However negative this end may be thought to be the assurance that it may be attained is a remnant of natural hope in the bosom of pessimism A complete disillusion would have involved the neglect of such an assurance the denial that it was possible or at least that it was to be realised under specific conditions That conversion and good works lead to something worth attaining is a new sort of positivistic hope A complete scepticism would involve a doubt not only concerning the existence of such a method of salvation but also what is more significant concerning the importance of applying it if it were found For to assert that salvation is not only possible but urgently necessary that every soul is now in an intolerable condition and should search for an ultimate solution to all its troubles a restoration to a normal and somehow blessed state what is this but to assert that the nature of things has a permanent constitution by conformity with which man may secure his happiness Moreover we assert in such a faith that this natural constitution of things is discoverable in a sufficient measure to guide our action to a successful issue Belief in Karma in prayer in sacraments in salvation is a remnant of a natural belief in the possibility of living successfully The remnant may be small and expressed in fancy Transmigration or an atonement may be chimerical ideas Yet the mere fact of reliance upon something the assumption that the world is steady and capable of rational exploitation even if in a supernatural interest and by semi magical means amounts to an essential loyalty to postulates of practical reason an essential adherence to natural morality The pretension to have reached a point of view from which all impulse may be criticised is accordingly an untenable pretension It is abandoned in the very systems in which it was to be most thoroughly applied The instrument of criticism must itself be one impulse surviving the wreck of all the others the vision of salvation and of the way thither must be one dream among the rest A single suggestion of experience is thus accepted while all others are denied and although a certain purification and revision of morality may hence ensue there is no real penetration to a deeper principle than spontaneous reason no revelation of a higher end than the best possible happiness One sporadic growth of human nature may be substituted for its whole luxuriant vegetation one negative or formal element of happiness may be preferred to the full entelechy of life We may see the Life of Reason reduced to straits made to express itself in a niggardly and fantastic environment but we have in principle and essence the Life of Reason still empirical in its basis and rational in its method its substance impulse and its end happiness Sidenote Spontaneous values rehabilitated So much for the umbilical cord that unites every living post rational system to the matrix of human hopes There remains a second point of contact between these systems and rational morality the reinstated natural duties which all religions and philosophies in order to subsist among civilised peoples are at once obliged to sanction and somehow to deduce from their peculiar principles The most plausible evidence which a supernatural doctrine can give of its truth is the beauty and rationality of its moral corollaries It is instructive to observe that a gospel s congruity with natural reason and common humanity is regarded as the decisive mark of its supernatural origin Indeed were inspiration not the faithful echo of plain conscience and vulgar experience there would be no means of distinguishing it from madness Whatever poetic idea a prophet starts with in whatever intuition or analogy he finds a hint of salvation it is altogether necessary that he should hasten to interpret his oracle in such a manner that it may sanction without disturbing the system of indispensable natural duties although these natural duties by being attached artificially to supernatural dogmas may take on a different tone justify themselves by a different rhetoric and possibly suffer real transformation in some minor particulars Systems of post rational morality are not original works they are versions of natural morality translated into different metaphysical languages each of which adds its peculiar flavour its own genius and poetry to the plain sense of the common original Sidenote A witness out of India In the doctrine of Karma for instance experience of retribution is ideally extended and made precise Acts daily experience teaches us form habits habits constitute character and each man s character as Heraclitus said is his guardian deity the artisan of his fate We need but raise this particular observation to a solitary eminence after the manner of post rational thinking we need but imagine it to underlie and explain all other empirical observations so that character may come to figure as an absolute cause of which experience itself is an attendant result Such arbitrary emphasis laid on some term of experience is the source of each metaphysical system in turn In this case the surviving dogma will have yielded an explanation of our environment no less than of our state of heart by instituting a deeper spiritual law a certain balance of merit and demerit in the soul accruing to it through a series of previous incarnations This fabulous starting point was gained by an imaginary extension of the law of moral continuity and natural retribution but when accepting this starting point the believer went on to inquire what he should do to be saved and to cancel the heavy debts he inherited from his mythical past he would merely enumerate the natural duties of man giving them however a new sanction and conceiving them as if they emanated from his new born metaphysical theory This theory apart from a natural conscience and traditional code would have been perfectly barren The notion that every sin must be expiated does not carry with it any information about what acts are sins This indispensable information must still be furnished by common opinion Those acts which bring suffering after them those acts which arouse the enmity of our fellows and by a premonition of that enmity arouse our own shame those are assumed and deputed to be sinful and the current code of morality being thus borrowed without begging leave the law of absolute retribution can be brought in to paint the picture of moral responsibility in more glaring colours and to extend the vista of rewards and punishments into a rhetorical infinite Buddhistic morality was natural morality intensified by this forced sense of minute and boundless responsibility It was coloured also by the negative pessimistic justification which this dogma gives to moral endeavour Every virtue was to be viewed as merely removing guilt and alleviating suffering knowledge itself being precious only as a means to that end The ultimate inspiration of right living was to be hope of perfect peace a hope generously bestowed by nature on every spirit which being linked to the flux of things is conscious of change and susceptible of weariness but a hope which the irresponsible Oriental imagination had disturbed with bad dreams A pathetic feminine quality was thereby imparted to moral feeling we were to be good for pity s sake for the sake of a great distant deliverance from profound sorrows Sidenote Dignity of post rational morality The pathetic idiosyncrasy of this religion has probably enabled it to touch many a heart and to lift into speculation many a life otherwise doomed to be quite instinctive animal It has kept morality pure free from that admixture of worldly and partisan precepts with which less pessimistic systems are encumbered Restraint can be rationally imposed on a given will only by virtue of evils which would be involved in its satisfaction by virtue in other words of some actual demand whose disappointment would ensue upon inconsiderate action To save to cure to nourish are duties far less conditional than would be a supposed duty to acquire or to create There is no harm in merely not being and privation is an evil only when after we exist it deprives us of something naturally requisite the absence of which would defeat interests already launched into the world If there is something in a purely remedial system of morality which seems one sided and extreme we must call to mind the far less excusable one sidedness of those moralities of prejudice to which we are accustomed in the Occident the ethics of irrational acquisitiveness irrational faith and irrational honour Buddhistic morality so reasonable and beautifully persuasive rising so willingly to the ideal of sanctity merits in comparison the profoundest respect It is lifted as far above the crudities of intuitionism as the whisperings of an angel are above a schoolboy s code A certain bias and deviation from strict reason seems indeed inseparable from any moral reform from any doctrine that is to be practically and immediately influential Socratic ethics was too perfect an expression to be much of a force Philosophers whose hearts are set on justice and pure truth often hear reproaches addressed to them by the fanatic who contrasts the conspicuous change in this or that direction accomplished by his preaching with the apparent impotence of reason and thought Reason s resources are in fact so limited that it is usually reduced to guerilla warfare a general plan of campaign is useless when only insignificant forces obey our commands Moral progress is for that reason often greatest when some nobler passion or more fortunate prejudice takes the lead and subdues its meaner companions without needing to rely on the consciousness of ultimate benefits hence accruing to the whole life So a pessimistic and merely remedial morality may accomplish reforms which reason with its broader and milder suasion might have failed in If certain rare and precious virtues can thus be inaugurated under the influence of a zeal exaggerating its own justification there will be time later to insist on the complementary truths and to tack in the other direction after having been carried forward a certain distance by this oblique advance Sidenote Absurdities nevertheless involved At the same time neglect of reason is never without its dangers and its waste The Buddhistic system itself suffers from a fundamental contradiction because its framers did not acknowledge the actual limits of retribution nor the empirical machinery by which benefits and injuries are really propagated It is an onerous condition which religions must fulfil if they would prevail in the world that they must have their roots in the past Buddhism had its mission of salvation but to express this mission to its proselytes it was obliged to borrow the language of the fantastic metaphysics which had preceded it in India The machinery of transmigration had to serve as a scaffolding to raise the monument of mercy purity and spirituality But this fabulous background given to life was really inconsistent with what was best in the new morality just as in Christianity the post rational evangelical ideals of redemption and regeneration of the human will mystically reversed were radically incompatible with the pre rational myths about a creation and a political providence The doctrine of Karma was a hypostasis of moral responsibility but in making responsibility dynamic and all explaining the theory discountenanced in advance the charitable efforts of Buddhism the desire to instruct and save every fellow creature For if all my fortunes depend upon my former conduct I am the sole artificer of my destiny The love the pity the science or the prayers of others can have no real influence over my salvation They cannot diminish by one tittle my necessary sufferings nor accelerate by one instant the period which my own action appoints for my deliverance Perhaps another s influence might in the false world of time and space change the order or accidental vesture of my moral experiences but their quantity and value being the exact counterpart of my free merits and demerits could not be affected at all by those extraneous doings Therefore the empirical fact that we can help one another remains in Buddhism as in any retributive scheme only by a serious inconsistency and since this fact is the sanction of whatever moral efficacy can be attributed to Buddhism in sobering teaching and saving mankind anything inconsistent with it is fundamentally repugnant to the whole system Yet on that repugnant and destructive dogma of Karma Buddhism was condemned to base its instruction This is the heavy price paid for mythical consolations that they invalidate the moral values they are intended to emphasise Nature has allowed the innocent to suffer for the guilty and the guilty perhaps to die in some measure unpunished To correct this imperfection we feign a closed circle of personal retributions exactly proportionate to personal deserts But thereby without perceiving it we have invalidated all political and social responsibility and denied that any man can be benefited or injured by any other Our moral ambition has overleaped itself and carried us into a non natural world where morality is impotent and unmeaning Sidenote The soul of positivism in all ideals Post rational systems accordingly mark no real advance and offer no genuine solution to spiritual enigmas The saving force each of them invokes is merely some remnant of that natural energy which animates the human animal Faith in the supernatural is a desperate wager made by man at the lowest ebb of his fortunes it is as far as possible from being the source of that normal vitality which subsequently if his fortunes mend he may gradually recover Under the same religion with the same posthumous alternatives and mystic harmonies hanging about them different races or the same race at different periods will manifest the most opposite moral characteristics Belief in a thousand hells and heavens will not lift the apathetic out of apathy or hold back the passionate from passion while a newly planted and ungalled community in blessed forgetfulness of rewards or punishments of cosmic needs or celestial sanctions will know how to live cheerily and virtuously for life s own sake putting to shame those thin vaticinations To hope for a second life to be had gratis merely because this life has lost its savour or to dream of a different world because nature seems too intricate and unfriendly is in the end merely to play with words since the supernatural has no permanent aspect or charm except in so far as it expresses man s natural situation and points to the satisfaction of his earthly interests What keeps supernatural morality in its better forms within the limits of sanity is the fact that it reinstates in practice under novel associations and for motives ostensibly different the very natural virtues and hopes which when seen to be merely natural it had thrown over with contempt The new dispensation itself if treated in the same spirit would be no less contemptible and what makes it genuinely esteemed is the restored authority of those human ideals which it expresses in a fable The extent of this moral restoration the measure in which nature is suffered to bloom in the sanctuary determines the value of post rational moralities They may preside over a good life personal or communal when their symbolism though cumbrous is not deceptive when the supernatural machinery brings man back to nature through mystical circumlocutions and becomes itself a poetic echo of experience and a dramatic impersonation of reason The peculiar accent and emphasis which it will not cease to impose on the obvious lessons of life need not then repel the wisest intelligence True sages and true civilisations can accordingly flourish under a dispensation nominally supernatural for that supernaturalism may have become a mere form in which imagination clothes a rational and humane wisdom Sidenote Moribund dreams and perennial realities People who speak only one language have some difficulty in conceiving that things should be expressed just as well in some other a prejudice which does not necessarily involve their mistaking words for things or being practically misled by their inflexible vocabulary So it constantly happens that supernatural systems when they have long prevailed are defended by persons who have only natural interests at heart because these persons lack that speculative freedom and dramatic imagination which would allow them to conceive other moulds for morality and happiness than those to which a respectable tradition has accustomed them Sceptical statesmen and academic scholars sometimes suffer from this kind of numbness it is intelligible that they should mistake the forms of culture for its principle especially when their genius is not original and their chosen function is to defend and propagate the local traditions in which their whole training has immersed them Indeed in the political field such concern for decaying myths may have a pathetic justification for however little the life of or dignity of man may he jeopardised by changes in language languages themselves are not indifferent things They may be closely bound up with the peculiar history and spirit of nations and their disappearance however necessary and on the whole propitious may mark the end of some stirring chapter in the world s history Those whose vocation is not philosophy and whose country is not the world may be pardoned for wishing to retard the migrations of spirit and for looking forward with apprehension to a future in which their private enthusiasms will not be understood The value of post rational morality then depends on a double conformity on its part with the Life of Reason In the first place some natural impulse must be retained some partial ideal must still be trusted and pursued by the prophet of redemption In the second place the intuition thus gained and exclusively put forward must be made the starting point for a restored natural morality Otherwise the faith appealed to would be worthless in its operation as well as fanciful in its basis and it could never become a mould for thought or action in a civilised society CHAPTER XI THE VALIDITY OF SCIENCE The same despair or confusion which when it overtakes human purposes seeks relief in arbitrary schemes of salvation when it overtakes human knowledge may breed arbitrary substitutes for science There are post rational systems of nature as well as of duty Most of these are myths hardly worth separating from the post rational moralities they adorn and have been sufficiently noticed in the last chapter but a few aspire to be critical revisions of science themselves scientific It may be well in bringing this book to a close to review these proposed revisions The validity of science is at stake and with it the validity of that whole Life of Reason which science crowns and justifies to reflection Sidenote Various modes of revising science There are many degrees and kinds of this critical retractation Science may be accepted bodily while its present results are modified by suggesting speculatively what its ultimate results might be This is natural philosophy or legitimate metaphysics Or science may be accepted in part and in part subjected to control by some other alleged vehicle of knowledge This is traditional or intuitive theology Or science may be retracted and withdrawn altogether on the ground that it is but methodological fiction its facts appearances merely and its principles tendencies to feign This is transcendentalism whereupon a dilemma presents itself We may be invited to abstain from all hypostasis or hearty belief in anything and to dwell only on the consciousness of imaginative activity in a vacuum which is radical idealism Or we may be assured that science being a dream we may awake from it into another cosmos built upon principles quite alien to those illustrated in nature or applicable in practice which is idealism of the mythical sort Finally it may occur to us that the criticism of science is an integral part of science itself and that a transcendental method of survey which marshals all things in the order of their discovery far from invalidating knowledge can only serve to separate it from incidental errors and to disclose the relative importance of truths Science would then be rehabilitated by criticism The primary movement of the intellect would not be condemned by that subsequent reflection which it makes possible and which collates its results Science purged of all needless realism and seen in its relation to human life would continue to offer the only conception of reality which is pertinent or possible to the practical mind We may now proceed to discuss these various attitudes in turn Sidenote Science its own best critic A first and quite blameless way of criticising science is to point out that science is incomplete That it grows fast is indeed its commonest boast and no man of science is so pessimistic as to suppose that its growth is over To wish to supplement science and to regard its conclusions as largely provisional is therefore more than legitimate It is actually to share the spirit of inquiry and to feel the impulse toward investigation When new truths come into view old truths are thereby reinterpreted and put in a new light so that the acquisitions of science not only admit of revision but loudly call for it not wishing for any other authority or vindication than that which they might find in the context of universal truth To revise science in this spirit would be merely to extend it No new method no transverse philosophy would be requisite or fitted for the task Knowledge would be transformed by more similar knowledge not by some verbal manipulation Yet while waiting for experience to grow and accumulate its lessons a man of genius who had drunk deep of experience himself might imagine some ultimate synthesis He might venture to carry out the suggestions of science and anticipate the conclusions it would reach when completed The game is certainly dangerous especially if the prophecy is uttered with any air of authority yet with good luck and a fine instinct such speculation may actually open the way to discovery and may diffuse in advance that virtual knowledge of physics which is enough for moral and poetic purposes Verification in detail is needed not so much for its own sake as to check speculative errors but when speculation is by chance well directed and hits upon the substantial truth it does all that a completed science would do for mankind since science if ever completed would immediately have to be summed up again and reduced to generalities Under the circumstances of human life ultimate truth must forego detailed verification and must remain speculative The curse of modern philosophy is only that it has not drawn its inspiration from science as the misfortune of science is that it has not yet saturated the mind of philosophers and recast the moral world The Greek physicists puerile as was their notion of natural mechanism had a more integral view of things They understood nature s uses and man s conditions in an honest and noble way If no single phenomenon had been explained correctly by any philosopher from Thales to Lucretius yet by their frank and studious contemplation of nature they would have liberated the human soul Sidenote Obstruction by alien traditions Unfortunately the supplements to science which most philosophers supply in our day are not conceived in a scientific spirit Instead of anticipating the physics of the future they cling to the physics of the past They do not stimulate us by a picture however fanciful of what the analogies of nature and politics actually point to they seek rather to patch and dislocate current physics with some ancient myth once the best physics obtainable from which they have not learned to extricate their affections Sometimes these survivals are intended to modify scientific conceptions but slightly and merely to soften a little the outlines of a cosmic picture to which religion and literature are not yet accustomed There is a school of political conservatives who with no specific interest in metaphysics cannot or dare not break with traditional modes of expression with the customs of their nation or with the clerical classes They accordingly append to current knowledge certain sentimental postulates alleging that what is established by tradition and what appeals to the heart must somehow correspond to something which is needful and true But their conventional attachment to a religion which in its original essence was perhaps mystical and revolutionary scarcely modifies in their eyes the sum of practical assurances or the aim of human life As language exercises some functions which science can hardly assume as for instance in poetry and communication so theology and metaphysics which to such men are nothing but languages might provide for inarticulate interests and unite us to much that lies in the dim penumbra of our workaday world Ancient revelations and mysteries however incredible if taken literally might therefore be suffered to nourish undisturbed so long as they did not clash with any clear fact or natural duty They might continue to decorate with a mystical aureole the too prosaic kernel of known truth Sidenote Needless anxiety for moral interests Mythology and ritual with the sundry divinations of poets might in fact be kept suspended with advantage over human passion and ignorance to furnish them with decent expression But once indulged divination is apt to grow arrogant and dogmatic When its oracles have become traditional they are almost inevitably mistaken for sober truths Hence the second kind of supplement offered to science so that revelations with which moral life has been intertwined may find a place beside or beyond science The effort is honest but extraordinarily short sighted Whatever value those revelations may have they draw from actual experience or inevitable ideals When the ground of that experience and those ideals is disclosed by science nothing of any value is lost it only remains to accustom ourselves to a new vocabulary and to shift somewhat the associations of those values which life contains or pursues Revelations are necessarily mythical and subrational they express natural forces and human interests in a groping way before the advent of science To stick in them when something more honest and explicit is available is inconsistent with caring for attainable welfare or understanding the situation It is to be stubborn and negligent under the cloak of religion These prejudices are a drag on progress moral no less than material and the sensitive conservatism that fears they may be indispensable is entangled in a pathetic delusion It is conservatism in a ship wreck It has not the insight to embrace the fertile principles of life which are always ready to renew life after no matter what natural catastrophe The good laggards have no courage to strip for the race Rather than live otherwise and live better they prefer to nurse the memories of youth and to die with a retrospective smile upon their countenance Sidenote Science an imaginative and practical art Far graver than the criticism which shows science to be incomplete is that which shows it to be relative The fact is undeniable though the inferences made from it are often rash and gratuitous We have seen that science is nothing but developed perception interpreted intent common sense rounded out and minutely articulated It is therefore as much an instinctive product as much a stepping forth of human courage in the dark as is any inevitable dream or impulsive action Like life itself like any form of determinate existence it is altogether autonomous and unjustifiable from the outside It must lean on its own vitality to sanction reason there is only reason and to corroborate sense there is nothing but sense Inferential thought is a venture not to be approved of save by a thought no less venturesome and inferential This is once for all the fate of a living being it is the very essence of spirit to be ever on the wing borne by inner forces toward goals of its own imagining confined to a passing apprehension of a represented world Mind which calls itself the organ of truth is a permanent possibility of error The encouragement and corroboration which science is alleged to receive from moment to moment may for aught it knows be simply a more ingenious self deception a form of that cumulative illusion by which madness can confirm itself creating a whole world with an endless series of martyrs to bear witness to its sanity To insist on this situation may seem idle since no positive doctrine can gain thereby in plausibility and no particular line of action in reasonableness Yet this transcendental exercise this reversion to the immediate may be recommended by way of a cathartic to free the mind from ancient obstructions and make it hungrier and more agile in its rational faith Scepticism is harmless when it is honest and universal it clears the air and is a means of reorganising belief on its natural foundations Belief is an inevitable accompaniment of practice and intent both of which it will cling to all the more closely after a thorough criticism When all beliefs are challenged together the just and necessary ones have a chance to step forward and to re establish themselves alone The doubt cast on science when it is an ingenuous and impartial doubt will accordingly serve to show what sort of thing science is and to establish it on a sure foundation Science will then be seen to be tentative genial practical and humane full of ideality and pathos like every great human undertaking Sidenote Arriere pensee in transcendentalism Unfortunately a searching disintegration of dogma a conscientious reversion to the immediate is seldom practised for its own sake So violent a disturbance of mental habits needs some great social upheaval or some revolutionary ambition to bring it about The transcendental philosophy might never have been put forward at all had its authors valued it for what it can really accomplish The effort would have seemed too great and the result too nugatory Their criticism of knowledge was not freely undertaken with the pure speculative motive of understanding and purifying human science They were driven on by the malicious psychology of their predecessors by the perplexities of a sophistical scepticism and by the imminent collapse of traditional metaphysics They were enticed at the same time by the hope of finding a new basis for the religious myths associated with that metaphysics In consequence their transcendentalism was not a rehearsal of the Life of Reason a retrospect criticising and justifying the phases of human progress It was rather a post rational system of theology the dangerous cure to a harmless disease inducing a panic to introduce a fable The panic came from the assumption a wholly gratuitous one that a spontaneous constructive intellect cannot be a trustworthy instrument that appearances cannot be the properties of reality and that things cannot be what science finds that they are We were forbidden to believe in anything we might discover or to trust in anything we could see The artificial vacuum thus produced in the mind ached to be filled with something and of course a flood of rhetorical commonplaces was at hand which might rush in to fill it Sidenote Its romantic sincerity The most heroic transcendentalists were but men and having imagined that logic obliged them to abstain from every sort of hypostasis they could not long remain true to their logic For a time being of a buoyant disposition they might feel that nothing could be more exhilarating than to swim in the void altogether free from settled conditions altogether the ignorant creators of each moment s vision Such a career evidently affords all sorts of possibilities except perhaps the possibility of being a career But when a man has strained every nerve to maintain an absolute fluidity and a painful fidelity to the immediate he can hardly be blamed if he lapses at last into some flattering myth and if having satisfied himself that all science is fiction he proclaims some fairy tale to be the truth The episodes of experience not being due to any conceivable machinery beneath might come of mere willing or at the waving of a dialectical wand Yet apart from this ulterior inconsistency and backsliding into credulity transcendentalism would hear nothing of causes or grounds All phenomena existed for it on one flat level We were released from all dogma and reinstated in the primordial assurance that we were all there was but without understanding what we were and without any means of controlling our destiny though cheered by the magnificent feeling that that destiny was great Sidenote Its constructive importance It is intelligible that a pure transcendentalism of this sort should not be either stable or popular It may be admired for its analytic depth and its persistency in tracing all supposed existences back to the experience that vouches for them Yet a spirit that finds its only exercise in gloating on the consciousness that it is a spirit one that has so little skill in expression that it feels all its embodiments to be betrayals and all its symbols to be misrepresentations is a spirit evidently impotent and confused It is self inhibited and cannot fulfil its essential vocation by reaching an embodiment at once definitive and ideal philosophical and true We may excuse a school that has done one original task so thoroughly as transcendentalism has thing could be said of it would be simply an integral term in the discourse that described it And this discourse this sad residuum of reality would remain an absolute datum without a ground without a subject matter without a past and without a future Sidenote Its futility It suffices therefore to take the supposed negative implication in transcendentalism a little seriously to see that it leaves nothing standing but negation and imbecility so that we may safely conclude that such a negative implication is gratuitous and also that in taking the transcendental method for an instrument of reconstruction its professors were radically false to it They took the starting point of experience on which they had fallen back for its ultimate deliverance and in reverting to protoplasm they thought they were rising to God The transcendental method is merely retrospective its use is to recover more systematically conceptions already extant and inevitable It invalidates nothing in science much less does it carry with it any rival doctrine of its own Every philosophy even materialism may find a transcendental justification if experience as it develops will yield no other terms What has reason to tremble at a demand for its credentials is surely not natural science it is rather those mystical theologies or romantic philosophies of history which aspire to take its place Such lucubrations even if reputed certain can scarcely be really credited or regarded in practice while scientific tenets are necessarily respected even when they are declared to be fictions This nemesis is inevitable for the mind must be inhabited and the ideas with which science peoples it are simply its involuntary perceptions somewhat more clearly arranged Sidenote Ideal science is self justified That the relativity of science its being an emanation of human life is nothing against its truth appears best perhaps in the case of dialectic Dialectic is valid by virtue of an intended meaning and felt congruity in its terms but these terms which intent fixes are external and independent in their ideal nature and the congruity between them is not created by being felt but whether incidentally felt or not is inherent in their essence Mathematical thinking is the closest and most intimate of mental operations nothing external being called in to aid yet mathematical truth is as remote as possible from being personal or psychic It is absolutely self justified and is necessary before it is discovered to be so Here then is a conspicuous region of truth disclosed to the human intellect by its own internal exercise which is nevertheless altogether independent being eternal and indefeasible while the thought that utters it is ephemeral Sidenote Physical science is presupposed in scepticism The validity of material science not being warranted by pure insight cannot be so quickly made out nevertheless it cannot be denied systematically and the misunderstood transcendentalism which belittles physics contradicts its own basis For how are we supposed to know that what call facts are mere appearances and what we call objects mere creations of thought We know this by physics It is physiology a part of physics that assures us that our senses and brains are conditions of our experience Were it not for what we know of the outer world and of our place in it we should be incapable of attaching any meaning to subjectivity The flux of things would then go on in their own medium not in our minds and no suspicion of illusion or of qualification by mind would attach to any event in nature So it is in a dream and it is our knowledge of physics our reliance on the world s material coherence that marks our awakening and that constitutes our discovery that we exist as minds and are subject to dreaming It is quite true that the flux as it exists in men is largely psychic but only because the events it contains are effects of material causes and the images in it are flying shadows cast by solid external things This is the meaning of psychic existence and its differentia Mind is an expression weighted with emotion of mechanical relations among bodies Suppose the bodies all removed at once the images formerly contrasted with those bodies would resume their inherent characteristics and mutual relation they would become existences in their own category large moving coloured distributed to right and left that is save for their values they would become material things Sidenote It recurs in all understanding of perception Physics is accordingly a science which though hypothetical and only verifiable by experiment is involved in history and psychology and therefore in any criticism of knowledge The contradiction would be curious if a man should declare that his ideas were worthless being due to his organs of sense and that therefore these organs since he had an idea of them did not exist Yet on this brave argument idealism chiefly rests It asserts that bodies are mere ideas because it is through our bodies that we perceive them When physics has discovered the conditions under which knowledge of physics has arisen physics is supposed to be spirited away whereas of course it has only closed its circle and justified its sovereignty Were all science retracted and reduced to symbolic calculation nothing would remain for this calculation to symbolise The whole force of calling a theory merely a vehicle or method of thought leading us to something different from itself lies in having a literal knowledge of this other thing But such literal knowledge is the first stage of science which the other stages merely extend So that when under special circumstances we really appeal to algebraic methods of expression and think in symbols we do so in the hope of transcribing our terms when the reckoning is over into the language of familiar facts Were these facts not forthcoming the symbolic machinery would itself become the genuine reality since it is really given and we should have to rest in it as in the ultimate truth This is what happens in mythology when the natural phenomena expressed by it are forgotten But natural phenomena themselves are symbols of nothing because they are primary data They are the constitutive elements of the reality they disclose Sidenote Science contains all trustworthy knowledge The validity of science in general is accordingly established merely by establishing the truth of its particular propositions in dialectic on the authority of intent and in physics on that of experiment It is impossible to base science on a deeper foundation or to override it by a higher knowledge What is called metaphysics if not an anticipation of natural science is a confusion of it with dialectic or a mixture of it with myths If we have the faculty of being utterly sincere and of disintegrating the conventions of language and religion we must confess that knowledge is only a claim we put forth a part of that unfathomable compulsion by force of which we live and hold our painted world together for a moment If we have any insight into mind or any eye for human history we must confess at the same time that the oracular substitutes for knowledge to which in our perplexities we might be tempted to fly are pathetic popular fables having no other sanctity than that which they borrow from the natural impulses they play upon To live by science requires intelligence and faith but not to live by it is folly Sidenote It suffices for the Life of Reason If science thus contains the sum total of our rational convictions and gives us the only picture of reality on which we should care to dwell we have but to consult the sciences in detail to ascertain as far as that is possible what sort of a universe we live in The result is as yet far from satisfactory The sciences have not joined hands and made their results coherent showing nature to be as it doubtless is all of one piece The moral sciences especially are a mass of confusion Negative I think must be the attitude of reason in the present state of science upon any hypothesis far outrunning the recorded history and the visible habitat of the human race Yet exactly the same habits and principles that have secured our present knowledge are still active within us and promise further discoveries It is more desirable to clarify our knowledge within these bounds than to extend it beyond them For while the reward of action is contemplation or in more modern phrase experience and consciousness there is nothing stable or interesting to contemplate except objects relevant to action the natural world and the mind s ideals Both the conditions and the standards of action lie well within the territory which science after a fashion already dominates But there remain unexplored jungles and monster breeding lairs within our nominal jurisdiction which it is the immediate task of science to clear The darkest spots are in man himself in his fitful irrational disposition Could a better system prevail in our lives a better order would establish itself in our thinking It has not been for want of keen senses or personal genius or a constant order in the outer world that mankind have fallen back repeatedly into barbarism and superstition It has been for want of good character good example and good government There is a pathetic capacity in men to live nobly if only they would give one another the chance The ideal of political perfection vague and remote as it yet seems is certainly approachable for it is as definite and constant as human nature The knowledge of all relevant truth would be involved in that ideal and no intellectual dissatisfaction would be felt with a system of ideas that should express and illumine a perfect life END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE LIFE OF REASON This file should be named
