document To the historian it bristles with errors not errors of fact but errors of interpretation Looking back across the seven centuries that have lapsed since Avis Everhard completed her manuscript events and the bearings of events that were confused and veiled to her are clear to us She lacked perspective She was too close to the events she writes about Nay she was merged in the events she has described Nevertheless as a personal document the Everhard Manuscript is of inestimable value But here again enter error of perspective and vitiation due to the bias of love Yet we smile indeed and forgive Avis Everhard for the heroic lines upon which she modelled her husband We know to day that he was not so colossal and that he loomed among the events of his times less largely than the Manuscript would lead us to believe We know that Ernest Everhard was an exceptionally strong man but not so exceptional as his wife thought him to be He was after all but one of a large number of heroes who throughout the world devoted their lives to the Revolution though it must be conceded that he did unusual work especially in his elaboration and interpretation of working class philosophy Proletarian science and proletarian philosophy were his phrases for it and therein he shows the provincialism of his mind a defect however that was due to the times and that none in that day could escape But to return to the Manuscript Especially valuable is it in communicating to us the FEEL of those terrible times Nowhere do we find more vividly portrayed the psychology of the persons that lived in that turbulent period embraced between the years nineteen twelve and nineteen thirty two their mistakes and ignorance their doubts and fears and misapprehensions their ethical delusions their violent passions their inconceivable sordidness and selfishness These are the things that are so hard for us of this enlightened age to understand History tells us that these things were and biology and psychology tell us why they were but history and biology and psychology do not make these things alive We accept them as facts but we are left without sympathetic comprehension of them This sympathy comes to us however as we peruse the Everhard Manuscript We enter into the minds of the actors in that long ago world drama and for the time being their mental processes are our mental processes Not alone do we understand Avis Everhard s love for her hero husband but we feel as he felt in those first days the vague and terrible loom of the Oligarchy The Iron Heel well named we feel descending upon and crushing mankind And in passing we note that that historic phrase the Iron Heel originated in Ernest Everhard s mind This we may say is the one moot question that this new found document clears up Previous to this the earliest known use of the phrase occurred in the pamphlet Ye Slaves written by George Milford and published in December nineteen twelve This George Milford was an obscure agitator about whom nothing is known save the one additional bit of information gained from the Manuscript which mentions that he was shot in the Chicago Commune Evidently he had heard Ernest Everhard make use of the phrase in some public speech most probably when he was running for Congress in the fall of nineteen twelve From the Manuscript we learn that Everhard used the phrase at a private dinner in the spring of nineteen twelve This is without discussion the earliest known occasion on which the Oligarchy was so designated The rise of the Oligarchy will always remain a cause of secret wonder to the historian and the philosopher Other great historical events have their place in social evolution They were inevitable Their coming could have been predicted with the same certitude that astronomers to day predict the outcome of the movements of stars Without these other great historical events social evolution could not have proceeded Primitive communism chattel slavery serf slavery and wage slavery were necessary stepping stones in the evolution of society But it were ridiculous to assert that the Iron Heel was a necessary stepping stone Rather to day is it adjudged a step aside or a step backward to the social tyrannies that made the early world a hell but that were as necessary as the Iron Heel was unnecessary Black as Feudalism was yet the coming of it was inevitable What else than Feudalism could have followed upon the breakdown of that great centralized governmental machine known as the Roman Empire Not so however with the Iron Heel In the orderly procedure of social evolution there was no place for it It was not necessary and it was not inevitable It must always remain the great curiosity of history a whim a fantasy an apparition a thing unexpected and undreamed and it should serve as a warning to those rash political theorists of to day who speak with certitude of social processes Capitalism was adjudged by the sociologists of the time to be the culmination of bourgeois rule the ripened fruit of the bourgeois revolution And we of to day can but applaud that judgment Following upon Capitalism it was held even by such intellectual and antagonistic giants as Herbert Spencer that Socialism would come Out of the decay of self seeking capitalism it was held would arise that flower of the ages the Brotherhood of Man Instead of which appalling alike to us who look back and to those that lived at the time capitalism rotten ripe sent forth that monstrous offshoot the Oligarchy Too late did the socialist movement of the early twentieth century divine the coming of the Oligarchy Even as it was divined the Oligarchy was there a fact established in blood a stupendous and awful reality Nor even then as the Everhard Manuscript well shows was any permanence attributed to the Iron Heel Its overthrow was a matter of a few short years was the judgment of the revolutionists It is true they realized that the Peasant Revolt was unplanned and that the First Revolt was premature but they little realized that the Second Revolt planned and mature was doomed to equal futility and more terrible punishment It is apparent that Avis Everhard completed the Manuscript during the last days of preparation for the Second Revolt hence the fact that there is no mention of the disastrous outcome of the Second Revolt It is quite clear that she intended the Manuscript for immediate publication as soon as the Iron Heel was overthrown so that her husband so recently dead should receive full credit for all that he had ventured and accomplished Then came the frightful crushing of the Second Revolt and it is probable that in the moment of danger ere she fled or was captured by the Mercenaries she hid the Manuscript in the hollow oak at Wake Robin Lodge Of Avis Everhard there is no further record Undoubtedly she was executed by the Mercenaries and as is well known no record of such executions was kept by the Iron Heel But little did she realize even then as she hid the Manuscript and prepared to flee how terrible had been the breakdown of the Second Revolt Little did she realize that the tortuous and distorted evolution of the next three centuries would compel a Third Revolt and a Fourth Revolt and many Revolts all drowned in seas of blood ere the world movement of labor should come into its own And little did she dream that for seven long centuries the tribute of her love to Ernest Everhard would repose undisturbed in the heart of the ancient oak of Wake Robin Lodge ANTHONY MEREDITH Ardis November twenty seven four hundred nineteen B O M THE IRON HEEL CHAPTER I MY EAGLE The soft summer wind stirs the redwoods and Wild Water ripples sweet cadences over its mossy stones There are butterflies in the sunshine and from everywhere arises the drowsy hum of bees It is so quiet and peaceful and I sit here and ponder and am restless It is the quiet that makes me restless It seems unreal All the world is quiet but it is the quiet before the storm I strain my ears and all my senses for some betrayal of that impending storm Oh that it may not be premature That it may not be premature The Second Revolt was largely the work of Ernest Everhard though he cooperated of course with the European leaders The capture and secret execution of Everhard was the great event of the spring of nineteen thirty two A D Yet so thoroughly had he prepared for the revolt that his fellow conspirators were able with little confusion or delay to carry out his plans It was after Everhard s execution that his wife went to Wake Robin Lodge a small bungalow in the Sonoma Hills of California Small wonder that I am restless I think and think and I cannot cease from thinking I have been in the thick of life so long that I am oppressed by the peace and quiet and I cannot forbear from dwelling upon that mad maelstrom of death and destruction so soon to burst forth In my ears are the cries of the stricken and I can see as I have seen in the past all the marring and mangling of the sweet beautiful flesh and the souls torn with violence from proud bodies and hurled to God Thus do we poor humans attain our ends striving through carnage and destruction to bring lasting peace and happiness upon the earth Without doubt she here refers to the Chicago Commune And then I am lonely When I do not think of what is to come I think of what has been and is no more my Eagle beating with tireless wings the void soaring toward what was ever his sun the flaming ideal of human freedom I cannot sit idly by and wait the great event that is his making though he is not here to see He devoted all the years of his manhood to it and for it he gave his life It is his handiwork He made it With all respect to Avis Everhard it must be pointed out that Everhard was but one of many able leaders who planned the Second Revolt And we to day looking back across the centuries can safely say that even had he lived the Second Revolt would not have been less calamitous in its outcome than it was And so it is in this anxious time of waiting that I shall write of my husband There is much light that I alone of all persons living can throw upon his character and so noble a character cannot be blazoned forth too brightly His was a great soul and when my love grows unselfish my chiefest regret is that he is not here to witness to morrow s dawn We cannot fail He has built too stoutly and too surely for that Woe to the Iron Heel Soon shall it be thrust back from off prostrate humanity When the word goes forth the labor hosts of all the world shall rise There has been nothing like it in the history of the world The solidarity of labor is assured and for the first time will there be an international revolution wide as the world is wide The Second Revolt was truly international It was a colossal plan too colossal to be wrought by the genius of one man alone Labor in all the oligarchies of the world was prepared to rise at the signal Germany Italy France and all Australasia were labor countries socialist states They were ready to lend aid to the revolution Gallantly they did and it was for this reason when the Second Revolt was crushed that they too were crushed by the united oligarchies of the world their socialist governments being replaced by oligarchical governments You see I am full of what is impending I have lived it day and night utterly and for so long that it is ever present in my mind For that matter I cannot think of my husband without thinking of it He was the soul of it and how can I possibly separate the two in thought As I have said there is much light that I alone can throw upon his character It is well known that he toiled hard for liberty and suffered sore How hard he toiled and how greatly he suffered I well know for I have been with him during these twenty anxious years and I know his patience his untiring effort his infinite devotion to the Cause for which only two months gone he laid down his life I shall try to write simply and to tell here how Ernest Everhard entered my life how I first met him how he grew until I became a part of him and the tremendous changes he wrought in my life In this way may you look at him through my eyes and learn him as I learned him in all save the things too secret and sweet for me to tell It was in February nineteen twelve that I first met him when as a guest of my father s at dinner he came to our house in Berkeley I cannot say that my very first impression of him was favorable He was one of many at dinner and in the drawing room where we gathered and waited for all to arrive he made a rather incongruous appearance It was preacher s night as my father privately called it and Ernest was certainly out of place in the midst of the churchmen John Cunningham Avis Everhard s father was a professor at the State University at Berkeley California His chosen field was physics and in addition he did much original research and was greatly distinguished as a scientist His chief contribution to science was his studies of the electron and his monumental work on the Identification of Matter and Energy wherein he established beyond cavil and for all time that the ultimate unit of matter and the ultimate unit of force were identical This idea had been earlier advanced but not demonstrated by Sir Oliver Lodge and other students in the new field of radio activity In the first place his clothes did not fit him He wore a ready made suit of dark cloth that was ill adjusted to his body In fact no ready made suit of clothes ever could fit his body And on this night as always the cloth bulged with his muscles while the coat between the shoulders what of the heavy shoulder development was a maze of wrinkles His neck was the neck of a prize fighter thick and strong So this was the social philosopher and ex horseshoer my father had discovered was my thought And he certainly looked it with those bulging muscles and that bull throat Immediately I classified him a sort of prodigy I thought a Blind Tom of the working class In that day it was the custom of men to compete for purses of money They fought with their hands When one was beaten into insensibility or killed the survivor took the money This obscure reference applies to a blind negro musician who took the world by storm in the latter half of the nineteenth century of the Christian Era And then when he shook hands with me His handshake was firm and strong but he looked at me boldly with his black eyes too boldly I thought You see I was a creature of environment and at that time had strong class instincts Such boldness on the part of a man of my own class would have been almost unforgivable I know that I could not avoid dropping my eyes and I was quite relieved when I passed him on and turned to greet Bishop Morehouse a favorite of mine a sweet and serious man of middle age Christ like in appearance and goodness and a scholar as well But this boldness that I took to be presumption was a vital clew to the nature of Ernest Everhard He was simple direct afraid of nothing and he refused to waste time on conventional mannerisms You pleased me he explained long afterward and why should I not fill my eyes with that which pleases me I have said that he was afraid of nothing He was a natural aristocrat and this in spite of the fact that he was in the camp of the non aristocrats He was a superman a blond beast such as Nietzsche has described and in addition he was aflame with democracy Friederich Nietzsche the mad philosopher of the nineteenth century of the Christian Era who caught wild glimpses of truth but who before he was done reasoned himself around the great circle of human thought and off into madness In the interest of meeting the other guests and what of my unfavorable impression I forgot all about the working class philosopher though once or twice at table I noticed him especially the twinkle in his eye as he listened to the talk first of one minister and then of another He has humor I thought and I almost forgave him his clothes But the time went by and the dinner went by and he never opened his mouth to speak while the ministers talked interminably about the working class and its relation to the church and what the church had done and was doing for it I noticed that my father was annoyed because Ernest did not talk Once father took advantage of a lull and asked him to say something but Ernest shrugged his shoulders and with an I have nothing to say went on eating salted almonds But father was not to be denied After a while he said We have with us a member of the working class I am sure that he can present things from a new point of view that will be interesting and refreshing I refer to mister Everhard The others betrayed a well mannered interest and urged Ernest for a statement of his views Their attitude toward him was so broadly tolerant and kindly that it was really patronizing And I saw that Ernest noted it and was amused He looked slowly about him and I saw the glint of laughter in his eyes I am not versed in the courtesies of ecclesiastical controversy he began and then hesitated with modesty and indecision Go on they urged and doctor Hammerfield said We do not mind the truth that is in any man If it is sincere he amended Then you separate sincerity from truth Ernest laughed quickly doctor Hammerfield gasped and managed to answer The best of us may be mistaken young man the best of us Ernest s manner changed on the instant He became another man All right then he answered and let me begin by saying that you are all mistaken You know nothing and worse than nothing about the working class Your sociology is as vicious and worthless as is your method of thinking It was not so much what he said as how he said it I roused at the first sound of his voice It was as bold as his eyes It was a clarion call that thrilled me And the whole table was aroused shaken alive from monotony and drowsiness What is so dreadfully vicious and worthless in our method of thinking young man doctor Hammerfield demanded and already there was something unpleasant in his voice and manner of utterance You are metaphysicians You can prove anything by metaphysics and having done so every metaphysician can prove every other metaphysician wrong to his own satisfaction You are anarchists in the realm of thought And you are mad cosmos makers Each of you dwells in a cosmos of his own making created out of his own fancies and desires You do not know the real world in which you live and your thinking has no place in the real world except in so far as it is phenomena of mental aberration Do you know what I was reminded of as I sat at table and listened to you talk and talk You reminded me for all the world of the scholastics of the Middle Ages who gravely and learnedly debated the absorbing question of how many angels could dance on the point of a needle Why my dear sirs you are as remote from the intellectual life of the twentieth century as an Indian medicine man making incantation in the primeval forest ten thousand years ago As Ernest talked he seemed in a fine passion his face glowed his eyes snapped and flashed and his chin and jaw were eloquent with aggressiveness But it was only a way he had It always aroused people His smashing sledge hammer manner of attack invariably made them forget themselves And they were forgetting themselves now Bishop Morehouse was leaning forward and listening intently Exasperation and anger were flushing the face of doctor Hammerfield And others were exasperated too and some were smiling in an amused and superior way As for myself I found it most enjoyable I glanced at father and I was afraid he was going to giggle at the effect of this human bombshell he had been guilty of launching amongst us Your terms are rather vague doctor Hammerfield interrupted Just precisely what do you mean when you call us metaphysicians I call you metaphysicians because you reason metaphysically Ernest went on Your method of reasoning is the opposite to that of science There is no validity to your conclusions You can prove everything and nothing and no two of you can agree upon anything Each of you goes into his own consciousness to explain himself and the universe As well may you lift yourselves by your own bootstraps as to explain consciousness by consciousness I do not understand Bishop Morehouse said It seems to me that all things of the mind are metaphysical That most exact and convincing of all sciences mathematics is sheerly metaphysical Each and every thought process of the scientific reasoner is metaphysical Surely you will agree with me As you say you do not understand Ernest replied The metaphysician reasons deductively out of his own subjectivity The scientist reasons inductively from the facts of experience The metaphysician reasons from theory to facts the scientist reasons from facts to theory The metaphysician explains the universe by himself the scientist explains himself by the universe Thank God we are not scientists doctor Hammerfield murmured complacently What are you then Ernest demanded Philosophers There you go Ernest laughed You have left the real and solid earth and are up in the air with a word for a flying machine Pray come down to earth and tell me precisely what you do mean by philosophy Philosophy is doctor Hammerfield paused and cleared his throat something that cannot be defined comprehensively except to such minds and temperaments as are philosophical The narrow scientist with his nose in a test tube cannot understand philosophy Ernest ignored the thrust It was always his way to turn the point back upon an opponent and he did it now with a beaming brotherliness of face and utterance Then you will undoubtedly understand the definition I shall now make of philosophy But before I make it I shall challenge you to point out error in it or to remain a silent metaphysician Philosophy is merely the widest science of all Its reasoning method is the same as that of any particular science and of all particular sciences And by that same method of reasoning the inductive method philosophy fuses all particular sciences into one great science As Spencer says the data of any particular science are partially unified knowledge Philosophy unifies the knowledge that is contributed by all the sciences Philosophy is the science of science the master science if you please How do you like my definition Very creditable very creditable doctor Hammerfield muttered lamely But Ernest was merciless Remember he warned my definition is fatal to metaphysics If you do not now point out a flaw in my definition you are disqualified later on from advancing metaphysical arguments You must go through life seeking that flaw and remaining metaphysically silent until you have found it Ernest waited The silence was painful doctor Hammerfield was pained He was also puzzled Ernest s sledge hammer attack disconcerted him He was not used to the simple and direct method of controversy He looked appealingly around the table but no one answered for him I caught father grinning into his napkin There is another way of disqualifying the metaphysicians Ernest said when he had rendered doctor Hammerfield s discomfiture complete Judge them by their works What have they done for mankind beyond the spinning of airy fancies and the mistaking of their own shadows for gods They have added to the gayety of mankind I grant but what tangible good have they wrought for mankind They philosophized if you will pardon my misuse of the word about the heart as the seat of the emotions while the scientists were formulating the circulation of the blood They declaimed about famine and pestilence as being scourges of God while the scientists were building granaries and draining cities They builded gods in their own shapes and out of their own desires while the scientists were building roads and bridges They were describing the earth as the centre of the universe while the scientists were discovering America and probing space for the stars and the laws of the stars In short the metaphysicians have done nothing absolutely nothing for mankind Step by step before the advance of science they have been driven back As fast as the ascertained facts of science have overthrown their subjective explanations of things they have made new subjective explanations of things including explanations of the latest ascertained facts And this I doubt not they will go on doing to the end of time Gentlemen a metaphysician is a medicine man The difference between you and the Eskimo who makes a fur clad blubber eating god is merely a difference of several thousand years of ascertained facts That is all Yet the thought of Aristotle ruled Europe for twelve centuries doctor Ballingford announced pompously And Aristotle was a metaphysician doctor Ballingford glanced around the table and was rewarded by nods and smiles of approval Your illustration is most unfortunate Ernest replied You refer to a very dark period in human history In fact we call that period the Dark Ages A period wherein science was raped by the metaphysicians wherein physics became a search for the Philosopher s Stone wherein chemistry became alchemy and astronomy became astrology Sorry the domination of Aristotle s thought doctor Ballingford looked pained then he brightened up and said Granted this horrible picture you have drawn yet you must confess that metaphysics was inherently potent in so far as it drew humanity out of this dark period and on into the illumination of the succeeding centuries Metaphysics had nothing to do with it Ernest retorted What doctor Hammerfield cried It was not the thinking and the speculation that led to the voyages of discovery Ah my dear sir Ernest smiled I thought you were disqualified You have not yet picked out the flaw in my definition of philosophy You are now on an unsubstantial basis But it is the way of the metaphysicians and I forgive you No I repeat metaphysics had nothing to do with it Bread and butter silks and jewels dollars and cents and incidentally the closing up of the overland trade routes to India were the things that caused the voyages of discovery With the fall of Constantinople in fourteen fifty three the Turks blocked the way of the caravans to India The traders of Europe had to find another route Here was the original cause for the voyages of discovery Columbus sailed to find a new route to the Indies It is so stated in all the history books Incidentally new facts were learned about the nature size and form of the earth and the Ptolemaic system went glimmering doctor Hammerfield snorted You do not agree with me Ernest queried Then wherein am I wrong I can only reaffirm my position doctor Hammerfield retorted tartly It is too long a story to enter into now No story is too long for the scientist Ernest said sweetly That is why the scientist gets to places That is why he got to America I shall not describe the whole evening though it is a joy to me to recall every moment every detail of those first hours of my coming to know Ernest Everhard Battle royal raged and the ministers grew red faced and excited especially at the moments when Ernest called them romantic philosophers shadow projectors and similar things And always he checked them back to facts The fact man the irrefragable fact he would proclaim triumphantly when he had brought one of them a cropper He bristled with facts He tripped them up with facts ambuscaded them with facts bombarded them with broadsides of facts You seem to worship at the shrine of fact doctor Hammerfield taunted him There is no God but Fact and mister Everhard is its prophet doctor Ballingford paraphrased Ernest smilingly acquiesced I m like the man from Texas he said And on being solicited he explained You see the man from Missouri always says You ve got to show me But the man from Texas says You ve got to put it in my hand From which it is apparent that he is no metaphysician Another time when Ernest had just said that the metaphysical philosophers could never stand the test of truth doctor Hammerfield suddenly demanded What is the test of truth young man Will you kindly explain what has so long puzzled wiser heads than yours Certainly Ernest answered His cocksureness irritated them The wise heads have puzzled so sorely over truth because they went up into the air after it Had they remained on the solid earth they would have found it easily enough ay they would have found that they themselves were precisely testing truth with every practical act and thought of their lives The test the test doctor Hammerfield repeated impatiently Never mind the preamble Give us that which we have sought so long the test of truth Give it us and we will be as gods There was an impolite and sneering scepticism in his words and manner that secretly pleased most of them at the table though it seemed to bother Bishop Morehouse doctor Jordan has stated it very clearly Ernest said His test of truth is Will it work Will you trust your life to it A noted educator of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries of the Christian Era He was president of the Stanford University a private benefaction of the times Pish doctor Hammerfield sneered You have not taken Bishop Berkeley into account He has never been answered An idealistic monist who long puzzled the philosophers of that time with his denial of the existence of matter but whose clever argument was finally demolished when the new empiric facts of science were philosophically generalized The noblest metaphysician of them all Ernest laughed But your example is unfortunate As Berkeley himself attested his metaphysics didn t work doctor Hammerfield was angry righteously angry It was as though he had caught Ernest in a theft or a lie Young man he trumpeted that statement is on a par with all you have uttered to night It is a base and unwarranted assumption I am quite crushed Ernest murmured meekly Only I don t know what hit me You ll have to put it in my hand Doctor I will I will doctor Hammerfield spluttered How do you know You do not know that Bishop Berkeley attested that his metaphysics did not work You have no proof Young man they have always worked I take it as proof that Berkeley s metaphysics did not work because Ernest paused calmly for a moment Because Berkeley made an invariable practice of going through doors instead of walls Because he trusted his life to solid bread and butter and roast beef Because he shaved himself with a razor that worked when it removed the hair from his face But those are actual things doctor Hammerfield cried Metaphysics is of the mind And they work in the mind Ernest queried softly The other nodded And even a multitude of angels can dance on the point of a needle in the mind Ernest went on reflectively And a blubber eating fur clad god can exist and work in the mind and there are no proofs to the contrary in the mind I suppose Doctor you live in the mind My mind to me a kingdom is was the answer That s another way of saying that you live up in the air But you come back to earth at meal time I am sure or when an earthquake happens along Or tell me Doctor do you have no apprehension in an earthquake that that incorporeal body of yours will be hit by an immaterial brick Instantly and quite unconsciously doctor Hammerfield s hand shot up to his head where a scar disappeared under the hair It happened that Ernest had blundered on an apposite illustration doctor Hammerfield had been nearly killed in the Great Earthquake by a falling chimney Everybody broke out into roars of laughter The Great Earthquake of nineteen oh six A D that destroyed San Francisco Well Ernest asked when the merriment had subsided Proofs to the contrary And in the silence he asked again Well Then he added Still well but not so well that argument of yours But doctor Hammerfield was temporarily crushed and the battle raged on in new directions On point after point Ernest challenged the ministers When they affirmed that they knew the working class he told them fundamental truths about the working class that they did not know and challenged them for disproofs He gave them facts always facts checked their excursions into the air and brought them back to the solid earth and its facts How the scene comes back to me I can hear him now with that war note in his voice flaying them with his facts each fact a lash that stung and stung again And he was merciless He took no quarter and gave none I can never forget the flaying he gave them at the end This figure arises from the customs of the times When among men fighting to the death in their wild animal way a beaten man threw down his weapons it was at the option of the victor to slay him or spare him You have repeatedly confessed to night by direct avowal or ignorant statement that you do not know the working class But you are not to be blamed for this How can you know anything about the working class You do not live in the same locality with the working class You herd with the capitalist class in another locality And why not It is the capitalist class that pays you that feeds you that puts the very clothes on your backs that you are wearing to night And in return you preach to your employers the brands of metaphysics that are especially acceptable to them and the especially acceptable brands are acceptable because they do not menace the established order of society Here there was a stir of dissent around the table Oh I am not challenging your sincerity Ernest continued You are sincere You preach what you believe There lies your strength and your value to the capitalist class But should you change your belief to something that menaces the established order your preaching would be unacceptable to your employers and you would be discharged Every little while some one or another of you is so discharged Am I not right During this period there were many ministers cast out of the church for preaching unacceptable doctrine Especially were they cast out when their preaching became tainted with socialism This time there was no dissent They sat dumbly acquiescent with the exception of doctor Hammerfield who said It is when their thinking is wrong that they are asked to resign Which is another way of saying when their thinking is unacceptable Ernest answered and then went on So I say to you go ahead and preach and earn your pay but for goodness sake leave the working class alone You belong in the enemy s camp You have nothing in common with the working class Your hands are soft with the work others have performed for you Your stomachs are round with the plenitude of eating Here doctor Ballingford winced and every eye glanced at his prodigious girth It was said he had not seen his own feet in years And your minds are filled with doctrines that are buttresses of the established order You are as much mercenaries sincere mercenaries I grant as were the men of the Swiss Guard Be true to your salt and your hire guard with your preaching the interests of your employers but do not come down to the working class and serve as false leaders You cannot honestly be in the two camps at once The working class has done without you Believe me the working class will continue to do without you And furthermore the working class can do better without you than with you The hired foreign palace guards of Louis XVI a king of France that was beheaded by his people CHAPTER II CHALLENGES After the guests had gone father threw himself into a chair and gave vent to roars of Gargantuan laughter Not since the death of my mother had I known him to laugh so heartily I ll wager doctor Hammerfield was never up against anything like it in his life he laughed The courtesies of ecclesiastical controversy Did you notice how he began like a lamb Everhard I mean and how quickly he became a roaring lion He has a splendidly disciplined mind He would have made a good scientist if his energies had been directed that way I need scarcely say that I was deeply interested in Ernest Everhard It was not alone what he had said and how he had said it but it was the man himself I had never met a man like him I suppose that was why in spite of my twenty four years I had not married I liked him I had to confess it to myself And my like for him was founded on things beyond intellect and argument Regardless of his bulging muscles and prize fighter s throat he impressed me as an ingenuous boy I felt that under the guise of an intellectual swashbuckler was a delicate and sensitive spirit I sensed this in ways I knew not save that they were my woman s intuitions There was something in that clarion call of his that went to my heart It still rang in my ears and I felt that I should like to hear it again and to see again that glint of laughter in his eyes that belied the impassioned seriousness of his face And there were further reaches of vague and indeterminate feelings that stirred in me I almost loved him then though I am confident had I never seen him again that the vague feelings would have passed away and that I should easily have forgotten him But I was not destined never to see him again My father s new born interest in sociology and the dinner parties he gave would not permit Father was not a sociologist His marriage with my mother had been very happy and in the researches of his own science physics he had been very happy But when mother died his own work could not fill the emptiness At first in a mild way he had dabbled in philosophy then becoming interested he had drifted on into economics and sociology He had a strong sense of justice and he soon became fired with a passion to redress wrong It was with gratitude that I hailed these signs of a new interest in life though I little dreamed what the outcome would be With the enthusiasm of a boy he plunged excitedly into these new pursuits regardless of whither they led him He had been used always to the laboratory and so it was that he turned the dining room into a sociological laboratory Here came to dinner all sorts and conditions of men scientists politicians bankers merchants professors labor leaders socialists and anarchists He stirred them to discussion and analyzed their thoughts of life and society He had met Ernest shortly prior to the preacher s night And after the guests were gone I learned how he had met him passing down a street at night and stopping to listen to a man on a soap box who was addressing a crowd of workingmen The man on the box was Ernest Not that he was a mere soap box orator He stood high in the councils of the socialist party was one of the leaders and was the acknowledged leader in the philosophy of socialism But he had a certain clear way of stating the abstruse in simple language was a born expositor and teacher and was not above the soap box as a means of interpreting economics to the workingmen My father stopped to listen became interested effected a meeting and after quite an acquaintance invited him to the ministers dinner It was after the dinner that father told me what little he knew about him He had been born in the working class though he was a descendant of the old line of Everhards that for over two hundred years had lived in America At ten years of age he had gone to work in the mills and later he served his apprenticeship and became a horseshoer He was self educated had taught himself German and French and at that time was earning a meagre living by translating scientific and philosophical works for a struggling socialist publishing house in Chicago Also his earnings were added to by the royalties from the small sales of his own economic and philosophic works The distinction between being native born and foreign born was sharp and invidious in those days This much I learned of him before I went to bed and I lay long awake listening in memory to the sound of his voice I grew frightened at my thoughts He was so unlike the men of my own class so alien and so strong His masterfulness delighted me and terrified me for my fancies wantonly roved until I found myself considering him as a lover as a husband I had always heard that the strength of men was an irresistible attraction to women but he was too strong No no I cried out It is impossible absurd And on the morrow I awoke to find in myself a longing to see him again I wanted to see him mastering men in discussion the war note in his voice to see him in all his certitude and strength shattering their complacency shaking them out of their ruts of thinking What if he did swashbuckle To use his own phrase it worked it produced effects And besides his swashbuckling was a fine thing to see It stirred one like the onset of battle Several days passed during which I read Ernest s books borrowed from my father His written word was as his spoken word clear and convincing It was its absolute simplicity that convinced even while one continued to doubt He had the gift of lucidity He was the perfect expositor Yet in spite of his style there was much that I did not like He laid too great stress on what he called the class struggle the antagonism between labor and capital the conflict of interest Father reported with glee doctor Hammerfield s judgment of Ernest which was to the effect that he was an insolent young puppy made bumptious by a little and very inadequate learning Also doctor Hammerfield declined to meet Ernest again But Bishop Morehouse turned out to have become interested in Ernest and was anxious for another meeting A strong young man he said and very much alive very much alive But he is too sure too sure Ernest came one afternoon with father The Bishop had already arrived and we were having tea on the veranda Ernest s continued presence in Berkeley by the way was accounted for by the fact that he was taking special courses in biology at the university and also that he was hard at work on a new book entitled Philosophy and Revolution This book continued to be secretly printed throughout the three centuries of the Iron Heel There are several copies of various editions in the National Library of Ardis The veranda seemed suddenly to have become small when Ernest arrived Not that he was so very large he stood only five feet nine inches but that he seemed to radiate an atmosphere of largeness As he stopped to meet me he betrayed a certain slight awkwardness that was strangely at variance with his bold looking eyes and his firm sure hand that clasped for a moment in greeting And in that moment his eyes were just as steady and sure There seemed a question in them this time and as before he looked at me over long I have been reading your Working class Philosophy I said and his eyes lighted in a pleased way Of course he answered you took into consideration the audience to which it was addressed I did and it is because I did that I have a quarrel with you I challenged I too have a quarrel with you mister Everhard Bishop Morehouse said Ernest shrugged his shoulders whimsically and accepted a cup of tea The Bishop bowed and gave me precedence You foment class hatred I said I consider it wrong and criminal to appeal to all that is narrow and brutal in the working class Class hatred is anti social and it seems to me anti socialistic Not guilty he answered Class hatred is neither in the text nor in the spirit of anything I have every written Oh I cried reproachfully and reached for his book and opened it He sipped his tea and smiled at me while I ran over the pages Page one hundred and thirty two I read aloud The class struggle therefore presents itself in the present stage of social development between the wage paying and the wage paid classes I looked at him triumphantly No mention there of class hatred he smiled back But I answered you say class struggle A different thing from class hatred he replied And believe me we foment no hatred We say that the class struggle is a law of social development We are not responsible for it We do not make the class struggle We merely explain it as Newton explained gravitation We explain the nature of the conflict of interest that produces the class struggle But there should be no conflict of interest I cried I agree with you heartily he answered That is what we socialists are trying to bring about the abolition of the conflict of interest Pardon me Let me read an extract He took his book and turned back several pages Page one hundred and twenty six The cycle of class struggles which began with the dissolution of rude tribal communism and the rise of private property will end with the passing of private property in the means of social existence But I disagree with you the Bishop interposed his pale ascetic face betraying by a faint glow the intensity of his feelings Your premise is wrong There is no such thing as a conflict of interest between labor and capital or rather there ought not to be Thank you Ernest said gravely By that last statement you have given me back my premise But why should there be a conflict the Bishop demanded warmly Ernest shrugged his shoulders Because we are so made I guess But we are not so made cried the other Are you discussing the ideal man Ernest asked unselfish and godlike and so few in numbers as to be practically non existent or are you discussing the common and ordinary average man The common and ordinary man was the answer Who is weak and fallible prone to error Bishop Morehouse nodded And petty and selfish Again he nodded Watch out Ernest warned I said selfish The average man IS selfish the Bishop affirmed valiantly Wants all he can get Wants all he can get true but deplorable Then I ve got you Ernest s jaw snapped like a trap Let me show you Here is a man who works on the street railways He couldn t work if it weren t for capital the Bishop interrupted True and you will grant that capital would perish if there were no labor to earn the dividends The Bishop was silent Won t you Ernest insisted The Bishop nodded Then our statements cancel each other Ernest said in a matter of fact tone and we are where we were Now to begin again The workingmen on the street railway furnish the labor The stockholders furnish the capital By the joint effort of the workingmen and the capital money is earned They divide between them this money that is earned Capital s share is called dividends Labor s share is called wages In those days groups of predatory individuals controlled all the means of transportation and for the use of same levied toll upon the public Very good the Bishop interposed And there is no reason that the division should not be amicable You have already forgotten what we had agreed upon Ernest replied We agreed that the average man is selfish He is the man that is You have gone up in the air and are arranging a division between the kind of men that ought to be but are not But to return to the earth the workingman being selfish wants all he can get in the division The capitalist being selfish wants all he can get in the division When there is only so much of the same thing and when two men want all they can get of the same thing there is a conflict of interest between labor and capital And it is an irreconcilable conflict As long as workingmen and capitalists exist they will continue to quarrel over the division If you were in San Francisco this afternoon you d have to walk There isn t a street car running Another strike the Bishop queried with alarm These quarrels were very common in those irrational and anarchic times Sometimes the laborers refused to work Sometimes the capitalists refused to let the laborers work In the violence and turbulence of such disagreements much property was destroyed and many lives lost All this is inconceivable to us as inconceivable as another custom of that time namely the habit the men of the lower classes had of breaking the furniture when they quarrelled with their wives Yes they re quarrelling over the division of the earnings of the street railways Bishop Morehouse became excited It is wrong he cried It is so short sighted on the part of the workingmen How can they hope to keep our sympathy When we are compelled to walk Ernest said slyly But Bishop Morehouse ignored him and went on Their outlook is too narrow Men should be men not brutes There will be violence and murder now and sorrowing widows and orphans Capital and labor should be friends They should work hand in hand and to their mutual benefit Ah now you are up in the air again Ernest remarked dryly Come back to earth Remember we agreed that the average man is selfish But he ought not to be the Bishop cried And there I agree with you was Ernest s rejoinder He ought not to be selfish but he will continue to be selfish as long as he lives in a social system that is based on pig ethics The Bishop was aghast and my father chuckled Yes pig ethics Ernest went on remorselessly That is the meaning of the capitalist system And that is what your church is standing for what you are preaching for every time you get up in the pulpit Pig ethics There is no other name for it Bishop Morehouse turned appealingly to my father but he laughed and nodded his head I m afraid mister Everhard is right he said LAISSEZ FAIRE the let alone policy of each for himself and devil take the hindmost As mister Everhard said the other night the function you churchmen perform is to maintain the established order of society and society is established on that foundation But that is not the teaching of Christ cried the Bishop The Church is not teaching Christ these days Ernest put in quickly That is why the workingmen will have nothing to do with the Church The Church condones the frightful brutality and savagery with which the capitalist class treats the working class The Church does not condone it the Bishop objected The Church does not protest against it Ernest replied And in so far as the Church does not protest it condones for remember the Church is supported by the capitalist class I had not looked at it in that light the Bishop said naively You must be wrong I know that there is much that is sad and wicked in this world I know that the Church has lost the what you call the proletariat Proletariat Derived originally from the Latin PROLETARII the name given in the census of Servius Tullius to those who were of value to the state only as the rearers of offspring PROLES in other words they were of no importance either for wealth or position or exceptional ability You never had the proletariat Ernest cried The proletariat has grown up outside the Church and without the Church I do not follow you the Bishop said faintly Then let me explain With the introduction of machinery and the factory system in the latter part of the eighteenth century the great mass of the working people was separated from the land The old system of labor was broken down The working people were driven from their villages and herded in factory towns The mothers and children were put to work at the new machines Family life ceased The conditions were frightful It is a tale of blood I know I know Bishop Morehouse interrupted with an agonized expression on his face It was terrible But it occurred a century and a half ago And there a century and a half ago originated the modern proletariat Ernest continued And the Church ignored it While a slaughter house was made of the nation by the capitalist the Church was dumb It did not protest as to day it does not protest As Austin Lewis says speaking of that time those to whom the command Feed my lambs had been given saw those lambs sold into slavery and worked to death without a protest The Church was dumb then and before I go on I want you either flatly to agree with me or flatly to disagree with me Was the Church dumb then Candidate for Governor of California on the Socialist ticket in the fall election of nineteen oh six Christian Era An Englishman by birth a writer of many books on political economy and philosophy and one of the Socialist leaders of the times There is no more horrible page in history than the treatment of the child and women slaves in the English factories in the latter half of the eighteenth century of the Christian Era In such industrial hells arose some of the proudest fortunes of that day Bishop Morehouse hesitated Like doctor Hammerfield he was unused to this fierce infighting as Ernest called it The history of the eighteenth century is written Ernest prompted If the Church was not dumb it will be found not dumb in the books I am afraid the Church was dumb the Bishop confessed And the Church is dumb to day There I disagree said the Bishop Ernest paused looked at him searchingly and accepted the challenge All right he said Let us see In Chicago there are women who toil all the week for ninety cents Has the Church protested This is news to me was the answer Ninety cents per week It is horrible Has the Church protested Ernest insisted The Church does not know The Bishop was struggling hard Yet the command to the Church was Feed my lambs Ernest sneered And then the next moment Pardon my sneer Bishop But can you wonder that we lose patience with you When have you protested to your capitalistic congregations at the working of children in the Southern cotton mills Children six and seven years of age working every night at twelve hour shifts They never see the blessed sunshine They die like flies The dividends are paid out of their blood And out of the dividends magnificent churches are builded in New England wherein your kind preaches pleasant platitudes to the sleek full bellied recipients of those dividends Everhard might have drawn a better illustration from the Southern Church s outspoken defence of chattel slavery prior to what is known as the War of the Rebellion Several such illustrations culled from the documents of the times are here appended In eighteen thirty five A D the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church resolved that slavery is recognized in both the Old and the New Testaments and is not condemned by the authority of God The Charleston Baptist Association issued the following in an address in eighteen thirty five A D The right of masters to dispose of the time of their slaves has been distinctly recognized by the Creator of all things who is surely at liberty to vest the right of property over any object whomsoever He pleases The reverend E D Simon Doctor of Divinity and professor in the Randolph Macon Methodist College of Virginia wrote Extracts from Holy Writ unequivocally assert the right of property in slaves together with the usual incidents to that right The right to buy and sell is clearly stated Upon the whole then whether we consult the Jewish policy instituted by God himself or the uniform opinion and practice of mankind in all ages or the injunctions of the New Testament and the moral law we are brought to the conclusion that slavery is not immoral Having established the point that the first African slaves were legally brought into bondage the right to detain their children in bondage follows as an indispensable consequence Thus we see that the slavery that exists in America was founded in right It is not at all remarkable that this same note should have been struck by the Church a generation or so later in relation to the defence of capitalistic property In the great museum at Asgard there is a book entitled Essays in Application written by Henry van Dyke The book was published in nineteen oh five of the Christian Era From what we can make out Van Dyke must have been a churchman The book is a good example of what Everhard would have called bourgeois thinking Note the similarity between the utterance of the Charleston Baptist Association quoted above and the following utterance of Van Dyke seventy years later The Bible teaches that God owns the world He distributes to every man according to His own good pleasure conformably to general laws I did not know the Bishop murmured faintly His face was pale and he seemed suffering from nausea Then you have not protested The Bishop shook his head Then the Church is dumb to day as it was in the eighteenth century The Bishop was silent and for once Ernest forbore to press the point And do not forget whenever a churchman does protest that he is discharged I hardly think that is fair was the objection Will you protest Ernest demanded Show me evils such as you mention in our own community and I will protest I ll show you Ernest said quietly I am at your disposal I will take you on a journey through hell And I shall protest The Bishop straightened himself in his chair and over his gentle face spread the harshness of the warrior The Church shall not be dumb You will be discharged was the warning I shall prove the contrary was the retort I shall prove if what you say is so that the Church has erred through ignorance And furthermore I hold that whatever is horrible in industrial society is due to the ignorance of the capitalist class It will mend all that is wrong as soon as it receives the message And this message it shall be the duty of the Church to deliver Ernest laughed He laughed brutally and I was driven to the Bishop s defence Remember I said you see but one side of the shield There is much good in us though you give us credit for no good at all Bishop Morehouse is right The industrial wrong terrible as you say it is is due to ignorance The divisions of society have become too widely separated The wild Indian is not so brutal and savage as the capitalist class he answered and in that moment I hated him You do not know us I answered We are not brutal and savage Prove it he challenged How can I prove it to you I was growing angry He shook his head I do not ask you to prove it to me I ask you to prove it to yourself I know I said You know nothing was his rude reply There there children father said soothingly I don t care I began indignantly but Ernest interrupted I understand you have money or your father has which is the same thing money invested in the Sierra Mills What has that to do with it I cried Nothing much he began slowly except that the gown you wear is stained with blood The food you eat is a bloody stew The blood of little children and of strong men is dripping from your very roof beams I can close my eyes now and hear it drip drop drip drop all about me And suiting the action to the words he closed his eyes and leaned back in his chair I burst into tears of mortification and hurt vanity I had never been so brutally treated in my life Both the Bishop and my father were embarrassed and perturbed They tried to lead the conversation away into easier channels but Ernest opened his eyes looked at me and waved them aside His mouth was stern and his eyes too and in the latter there was no glint of laughter What he was about to say what terrible castigation he was going to give me I never knew for at that moment a man passing along the sidewalk stopped and glanced in at us He was a large man poorly dressed and on his back was a great load of rattan and bamboo stands chairs and screens He looked at the house as if debating whether or not he should come in and try to sell some of his wares That man s name is Jackson Ernest said With that strong body of his he should be at work and not peddling I answered curtly In that day there were many thousands of these poor merchants called PEDLERS They carried their whole stock in trade from door to door It was a most wasteful expenditure of energy Distribution was as confused and irrational as the whole general system of society Notice the sleeve of his left arm Ernest said gently I looked and saw that the sleeve was empty It was some of the blood from that arm that I heard dripping from your roof beams Ernest said with continued gentleness He lost his arm in the Sierra Mills and like a broken down horse you turned him out on the highway to die When I say you I mean the superintendent and the officials that you and the other stockholders pay to manage the mills for you It was an accident It was caused by his trying to save the company a few dollars The toothed drum of the picker caught his arm He might have let the small flint that he saw in the teeth go through It would have smashed out a double row of spikes But he reached for the flint and his arm was picked and clawed to shreds from the finger tips to the shoulder It was at night The mills were working overtime They paid a fat dividend that quarter Jackson had been working many hours and his muscles had lost their resiliency and snap They made his movements a bit slow That was why the machine caught him He had a wife and three children And what did the company do for him I asked Nothing Oh yes they did do something They successfully fought the damage suit he brought when he came out of hospital The company employs very efficient lawyers you know You have not told the whole story I said with conviction Or else you do not know the whole story Maybe the man was insolent Insolent Ha ha His laughter was Mephistophelian Great God Insolent And with his arm chewed off Nevertheless he was a meek and lowly servant and there is no record of his having been insolent But the courts I urged The case would not have been decided against him had there been no more to the affair than you have mentioned Colonel Ingram is leading counsel for the company He is a shrewd lawyer Ernest looked at me intently for a moment then went on I ll tell you what you do Miss Cunningham You investigate Jackson s case I had already determined to I said coldly All right he beamed good naturedly and I ll tell you where to find him But I tremble for you when I think of all you are to prove by Jackson s arm And so it came about that both the Bishop and I accepted Ernest s challenges They went away together leaving me smarting with a sense of injustice that had been done me and my class The man was a beast I hated him then and consoled myself with the thought that his behavior was what was to be expected from a man of the working class CHAPTER III JACKSON S ARM Little did I dream the fateful part Jackson s arm was to play in my life Jackson himself did not impress me when I hunted him out I found him in a crazy ramshackle house down near the bay on the edge of the marsh Pools of stagnant water stood around the house their surfaces covered with a green and putrid looking scum while the stench that arose from them was intolerable An adjective descriptive of ruined and dilapidated houses in which great numbers of the working people found shelter in those days They invariably paid rent and considering the value of such houses enormous rent to the landlords I found Jackson the meek and lowly man he had been described He was making some sort of rattan work and he toiled on stolidly while I talked with him But in spite of his meekness and lowliness I fancied I caught the first note of a nascent bitterness in him when he said They might a given me a job as watchman anyway In those days thievery was incredibly prevalent Everybody stole property from everybody else The lords of society stole legally or else legalized their stealing while the poorer classes stole illegally Nothing was safe unless guarded Enormous numbers of men were employed as watchmen to protect property The houses of the well to do were a combination of safe deposit vault and fortress The appropriation of the personal belongings of others by our own children of to day is looked upon as a rudimentary survival of the theft characteristic that in those early times was universal I got little out of him He struck me as stupid and yet the deftness with which he worked with his one hand seemed to belie his stupidity This suggested an idea to me How did you happen to get your arm caught in the machine I asked He looked at me in a slow and pondering way and shook his head I don t know It just happened Carelessness I prompted No he answered I ain t for callin it that I was workin overtime an I guess I was tired out some I worked seventeen years in them mills an I ve took notice that most of the accidents happens just before whistle blow I m willin to bet that more accidents happens in the hour before whistle blow than in all the rest of the day A man ain t so quick after workin steady for hours I ve seen too many of em cut up an gouged an chawed not to know The laborers were called to work and dismissed by savage screaming nerve racking steam whistles Many of them I queried Hundreds an hundreds an children too With the exception of the terrible details Jackson s story of his accident was the same as that I had already heard When I asked him if he had broken some rule of working the machinery he shook his head I chucked off the belt with my right hand he said an made a reach for the flint with my left I didn t stop to see if the belt was off I thought my right hand had done it only it didn t I reached quick and the belt wasn t all the way off And then my arm was chewed off It must have been painful I said sympathetically The crunchin of the bones wasn t nice was his answer His mind was rather hazy concerning the damage suit Only one thing was clear to him and that was that he had not got any damages He had a feeling that the testimony of the foremen and the superintendent had brought about the adverse decision of the court Their testimony as he put it wasn t what it ought to have ben And to them I resolved to go One thing was plain Jackson s situation was wretched His wife was in ill health and he was unable to earn by his rattan work and peddling sufficient food for the family He was back in his rent and the oldest boy a lad of eleven had started to work in the mills They might a given me that watchman s job were his last words as I went away By the time I had seen the lawyer who had handled Jackson s case and the two foremen and the superintendent at the mills who had testified I began to feel that there was something after all in Ernest s contention He was a weak and inefficient looking man the lawyer and at sight of him I did not wonder that Jackson s case had been lost My first thought was that it had served Jackson right for getting such a lawyer But the next moment two of Ernest s statements came flashing into my consciousness The company employs very efficient lawyers and Colonel Ingram is a shrewd lawyer I did some rapid thinking It dawned upon me that of course the company could afford finer legal talent than could a workingman like Jackson But this was merely a minor detail There was some very good reason I was sure why Jackson s case had gone against him Why did you lose the case I asked The lawyer was perplexed and worried for a moment and I found it in my heart to pity the wretched little creature Then he began to whine I do believe his whine was congenital He was a man beaten at birth He whined about the testimony The witnesses had given only the evidence that helped the other side Not one word could he get out of them that would have helped Jackson They knew which side their bread was buttered on Jackson was a fool He had been brow beaten and confused by Colonel Ingram Colonel Ingram was brilliant at cross examination He had made Jackson answer damaging questions How could his answers be damaging if he had the right on his side I demanded What s right got to do with it he demanded back You see all those books He moved his hand over the array of volumes on the walls of his tiny office All my reading and studying of them has taught me that law is one thing and right is another thing Ask any lawyer You go to Sunday school to learn what is right But you go to those books to learn law Do you mean to tell me that Jackson had the right on his side and yet was beaten I queried tentatively Do you mean to tell me that there is no justice in Judge Caldwell s court The little lawyer glared at me a moment and then the belligerence faded out of his face I hadn t a fair chance he began whining again They made a fool out of Jackson and out of me too What chance had I Colonel Ingram is a great lawyer If he wasn t great would he have charge of the law business of the Sierra Mills of the Erston Land Syndicate of the Berkeley Consolidated of the Oakland San Leandro and Pleasanton Electric He s a corporation lawyer and corporation lawyers are not paid for being fools What do you think the Sierra Mills alone give him twenty thousand dollars a year for Because he s worth twenty thousand dollars a year to them that s what for I m not worth that much If I was I wouldn t be on the outside starving and taking cases like Jackson s What do you think I d have got if I d won Jackson s case The function of the corporation lawyer was to serve by corrupt methods the money grabbing propensities of the corporations It is on record that Theodore Roosevelt at that time President of the United States said in nineteen oh five A D in his address at Harvard Commencement We all know that as things actually are many of the most influential and most highly remunerated members of the Bar in every centre of wealth make it their special task to work out bold and ingenious schemes by which their wealthy clients individual or corporate can evade the laws which were made to regulate in the interests of the public the uses of great wealth You d have robbed him most probably I answered Of course I would he cried angrily I ve got to live haven t I A typical illustration of the internecine strife that permeated all society Men preyed upon one another like ravening wolves The big wolves ate the little wolves and in the social pack Jackson was one of the least of the little wolves He has a wife and children I chided So have I a wife and children he retorted And there s not a soul in this world except myself that cares whether they starve or not His face suddenly softened and he opened his watch and showed me a small photograph of a woman and two little girls pasted inside the case There they are Look at them We ve had a hard time a hard time I had hoped to send them away to the country if I d won Jackson s case They re not healthy here but I can t afford to send them away When I started to leave he dropped back into his whine I hadn t the ghost of a chance Colonel Ingram and Judge Caldwell are pretty friendly I m not saying that if I d got the right kind of testimony out of their witnesses on cross examination that friendship would have decided the case And yet I must say that Judge Caldwell did a whole lot to prevent my getting that very testimony Why Judge Caldwell and Colonel Ingram belong to the same lodge and the same club They live in the same neighborhood one I can t afford And their wives are always in and out of each other s houses They re always having whist parties and such things back and forth And yet you think Jackson had the right of it I asked pausing for the moment on the threshold I don t think I know it was his answer And at first I thought he had some show too But I didn t tell my wife I didn t want to disappoint her She had her heart set on a trip to the country hard enough as it was Why did you not call attention to the fact that Jackson was trying to save the machinery from being injured I asked Peter Donnelly one of the foremen who had testified at the trial He pondered a long time before replying Then he cast an anxious look about him and said Because I ve a good wife an three of the sweetest children ye ever laid eyes on that s why I do not understand I said In other words because it wouldn t a ben healthy he answered You mean I began But he interrupted passionately I mean what I said It s long years I ve worked in the mills I began as a little lad on the spindles I worked up ever since It s by hard work I got to my present exalted position I m a foreman if you please An I doubt me if there s a man in the mills that d put out a hand to drag me from drownin I used to belong to the union But I ve stayed by the company through two strikes They called me scab There s not a man among em to day to take a drink with me if I asked him D ye see the scars on me head where I was struck with flying bricks There ain t a child at the spindles but what would curse me name Me only friend is the company It s not me duty but me bread an butter an the life of me children to stand by the mills That s why Was Jackson to blame I asked He should a got the damages He was a good worker an never made trouble Then you were not at liberty to tell the whole truth as you had sworn to do He shook his head The truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth I said solemnly Again his face became impassioned and he lifted it not to me but to heaven I d let me soul an body burn in everlastin hell for them children of mine was his answer Henry Dallas the superintendent was a vulpine faced creature who regarded me insolently and refused to talk Not a word could I get from him concerning the trial and his testimony But with the other foreman I had better luck James Smith was a hard faced man and my heart sank as I encountered him He too gave me the impression that he was not a free agent as we talked I began to see that he was mentally superior to the average of his kind He agreed with Peter Donnelly that Jackson should have got damages and he went farther and called the action heartless and cold blooded that had turned the worker adrift after he had been made helpless by the accident Also he explained that there were many accidents in the mills and that the company s policy was to fight to the bitter end all consequent damage suits It means hundreds of thousands a year to the stockholders he said and as he spoke I remembered the last dividend that had been paid my father and the pretty gown for me and the books for him that had been bought out of that dividend I remembered Ernest s charge that my gown was stained with blood and my flesh began to crawl underneath my garments When you testified at the trial you didn t point out that Jackson received his accident through trying to save the machinery from damage I said No I did not was the answer and his mouth set bitterly I testified to the effect that Jackson injured himself by neglect and carelessness and that the company was not in any way to blame or liable Was it carelessness I asked Call it that or anything you want to call it The fact is a man gets tired after he s been working for hours I was becoming interested in the man He certainly was of a superior kind You are better educated than most workingmen I said I went through high school he replied I worked my way through doing janitor work I wanted to go through the university But my father died and I came to work in the mills I wanted to become a naturalist he explained shyly as though confessing a weakness I love animals But I came to work in the mills When I was promoted to foreman I got married then the family came and well I wasn t my own boss any more What do you mean by that I asked I was explaining why I testified at the trial the way I did why I followed instructions Whose instructions Colonel Ingram He outlined the evidence I was to give And it lost Jackson s case for him He nodded and the blood began to rise darkly in his face And Jackson had a wife and two children dependent on him I know he said quietly though his face was growing darker Tell me I went on was it easy to make yourself over from what you were say in high school to the man you must have become to do such a thing at the trial The suddenness of his outburst startled and frightened me He ripped out a savage oath and clenched his fist as though about to strike me It is interesting to note the virilities of language that were common speech in that day as indicative of the life red of claw and fang that was then lived Reference is here made of course not to the oath of Smith but to the verb ripped used by Avis Everhard I beg your pardon he said the next moment No it was not easy And now I guess you can go away You ve got all you wanted out of me But let me tell you this before you go It won t do you any good to repeat anything I ve said I ll deny it and there are no witnesses I ll deny every word of it and if I have to I ll do it under oath on the witness stand After my interview with Smith I went to my father s office in the Chemistry Building and there encountered Ernest It was quite unexpected but he met me with his bold eyes and firm hand clasp and with that curious blend of his awkwardness and ease It was as though our last stormy meeting was forgotten but I was not in the mood to have it forgotten I have been looking up Jackson s case I said abruptly He was all interested attention and waited for me to go on though I could see in his eyes the certitude that my convictions had been shaken He seems to have been badly treated I confessed I I think some of his blood is dripping from our roof beams Of course he answered If Jackson and all his fellows were treated mercifully the dividends would not be so large I shall never be able to take pleasure in pretty gowns again I added I felt humble and contrite and was aware of a sweet feeling that Ernest was a sort of father confessor Then as ever after his strength appealed to me It seemed to radiate a promise of peace and protection Nor will you be able to take pleasure in sackcloth he said gravely There are the jute mills you know and the same thing goes on there It goes on everywhere Our boasted civilization is based upon blood soaked in blood and neither you nor I nor any of us can escape the scarlet stain The men you talked with who were they I told him all that had taken place And not one of them was a free agent he said They were all tied to the merciless industrial machine And the pathos of it and the tragedy is that they are tied by their heartstrings Their children always the young life that it is their instinct to protect This instinct is stronger than any ethic they possess My father He lied he stole he did all sorts of dishonorable things to put bread into my mouth and into the mouths of my brothers and sisters He was a slave to the industrial machine and it stamped his life out worked him to death But you I interjected You are surely a free agent Not wholly he replied I am not tied by my heartstrings I am often thankful that I have no children and I dearly love children Yet if I married I should not dare to have any That surely is bad doctrine I cried I know it is he said sadly But it is expedient doctrine I am a revolutionist and it is a perilous vocation I laughed incredulously If I tried to enter your father s house at night to steal his dividends from the Sierra Mills what would he do He sleeps with a revolver on the stand by the bed I answered He would most probably shoot you And if I and a few others should lead a million and a half of men into the houses of all the well to do there would be a great deal of shooting wouldn t there This reference is to the socialist vote cast in the United States in nineteen ten The rise of this vote clearly indicates the swift growth of the party of revolution Its voting strength in the United States in eighteen eighty eight was twenty sixty eight in nineteen oh two one hundred twenty seven thousand seven hundred thirteen in nineteen oh four four hundred thirty five thousand forty in nineteen oh eight one million one hundred eight thousand four hundred twenty seven and in nineteen ten one million six hundred eighty eight thousand two hundred eleven Yes but you are not doing that I objected It is precisely what I am doing And we intend to take not the mere wealth in the houses but all the sources of that wealth all the mines and railroads and factories and banks and stores That is the revolution It is truly perilous There will be more shooting I am afraid than even I dream of But as I was saying no one to day is a free agent We are all caught up in the wheels and cogs of the industrial machine You found that you were and that the men you talked with were Talk with more of them Go and see Colonel Ingram Look up the reporters that kept Jackson s case out of the papers and the editors that run the papers You will find them all slaves of the machine A little later in our conversation I asked him a simple little question about the liability of workingmen to accidents and received a statistical lecture in return It is all in the books he said The figures have been gathered and it has been proved conclusively that accidents rarely occur in the first hours of the morning work but that they increase rapidly in the succeeding hours as the workers grow tired and slower in both their muscular and mental processes Why do you know that your father has three times as many chances for safety of life and limb than has a working man He has The insurance companies know They will charge him four dollars and twenty cents a year on a thousand dollar accident policy and for the same policy they will charge a laborer fifteen dollars In the terrible wolf struggle of those centuries no man was permanently safe no matter how much wealth he amassed Out of fear for the welfare of their families men devised the scheme of insurance To us in this intelligent age such a device is laughably absurd and primitive But in that age insurance was a very serious matter The amusing part of it is that the funds of the insurance companies were frequently plundered and wasted by the very officials who were intrusted with the management of them And you I asked and in the moment of asking I was aware of a solicitude that was something more than slight Oh as a revolutionist I have about eight chances to the workingman s one of being injured or killed he answered carelessly The insurance companies charge the highly trained chemists that handle explosives eight times what they charge the workingmen I don t think they d insure me at all Why did you ask My eyes fluttered and I could feel the blood warm in my face It was not that he had caught me in my solicitude but that I had caught myself and in his presence Just then my father came in and began making preparations to depart with me Ernest returned some books he had borrowed and went away first But just as he was going he turned and said Oh by the way while you are ruining your own peace of mind and I am ruining the Bishop s you d better look up missus Wickson and missus Pertonwaithe Their husbands you know are the two principal stockholders in the Mills Like all the rest of humanity those two women are tied to the machine but they are so tied that they sit on top of it CHAPTER IV SLAVES OF THE MACHINE The more I thought of Jackson s arm the more shaken I was I was confronted by the concrete For the first time I was seeing life My university life and study and culture had not been real I had learned nothing but theories of life and society that looked all very well on the printed page but now I had seen life itself Jackson s arm was a fact of life The fact man the irrefragable fact of Ernest s was ringing in my consciousness It seemed monstrous impossible that our whole society was based upon blood And yet there was Jackson I could not get away from him Constantly my thought swung back to him as the compass to the Pole He had been monstrously treated His blood had not been paid for in order that a larger dividend might be paid And I knew a score of happy complacent families that had received those dividends and by that much had profited by Jackson s blood If one man could be so monstrously treated and society move on its way unheeding might not many men be so monstrously treated I remembered Ernest s women of Chicago who toiled for ninety cents a week and the child slaves of the Southern cotton mills he had described And I could see their wan white hands from which the blood had been pressed at work upon the cloth out of which had been made my gown And then I thought of the Sierra Mills and the dividends that had been paid and I saw the blood of Jackson upon my gown as well Jackson I could not escape Always my meditations led me back to him Down in the depths of me I had a feeling that I stood on the edge of a precipice It was as though I were about to see a new and awful revelation of life And not I alone My whole world was turning over There was my father I could see the effect Ernest was beginning to have on him And then there was the Bishop When I had last seen him he had looked a sick man He was at high nervous tension and in his eyes there was unspeakable horror From the little I learned I knew that Ernest had been keeping his promise of taking him through hell But what scenes of hell the Bishop s eyes had seen I knew not for he seemed too stunned to speak about them Once the feeling strong upon me that my little world and all the world was turning over I thought of Ernest as the cause of it and also I thought We were so happy and peaceful before he came And the next moment I was aware that the thought was a treason against truth and Ernest rose before me transfigured the apostle of truth with shining brows and the fearlessness of one of Gods own angels battling for the truth and the right and battling for the succor of the poor and lonely and oppressed And then there arose before me another figure the Christ He too had taken the part of the lowly and oppressed and against all the established power of priest and pharisee And I remembered his end upon the cross and my heart contracted with a pang as I thought of Ernest Was he too destined for a cross he with his clarion call and war noted voice and all the fine man s vigor of him And in that moment I knew that I loved him and that I was melting with desire to comfort him I thought of his life A sordid harsh and meagre life it must have been And I thought of his father who had lied and stolen for him and been worked to death And he himself had gone into the mills when he was ten All my heart seemed bursting with desire to fold my arms around him and to rest his head on my breast his head that must be weary with so many thoughts and to give him rest just rest and easement and forgetfulness for a tender space I met Colonel Ingram at a church reception Him I knew well and had known well for many years I trapped him behind large palms and rubber plants though he did not know he was trapped He met me with the conventional gayety and gallantry He was ever a graceful man diplomatic tactful and considerate And as for appearance he was the most distinguished looking man in our society Beside him even the venerable head of the university looked tawdry and small And yet I found Colonel Ingram situated the same as the unlettered mechanics He was not a free agent He too was bound upon the wheel I shall never forget the change in him when I mentioned Jackson s case His smiling good nature vanished like a ghost A sudden frightful expression distorted his well bred face I felt the same alarm that I had felt when James Smith broke out But Colonel Ingram did not curse That was the slight difference that was left between the workingman and him He was famed as a wit but he had no wit now And unconsciously this way and that he glanced for avenues of escape But he was trapped amid the palms and rubber trees Oh he was sick of the sound of Jackson s name Why had I brought the matter up He did not relish my joke It was poor taste on my part and very inconsiderate Did I not know that in his profession personal feelings did not count He left his personal feelings at home when he went down to the office At the office he had only professional feelings Should Jackson have received damages I asked Certainly he answered That is personally I have a feeling that he should But that has nothing to do with the legal aspects of the case He was getting his scattered wits slightly in hand Tell me has right anything to do with the law I asked You have used the wrong initial consonant he smiled in answer Might I queried and he nodded his head And yet we are supposed to get justice by means of the law That is the paradox of it he countered We do get justice You are speaking professionally now are you not I asked Colonel Ingram blushed actually blushed and again he looked anxiously about him for a way of escape But I blocked his path and did not offer to move Tell me I said when one surrenders his personal feelings to his professional feelings may not the action be defined as a sort of spiritual mayhem I did not get an answer Colonel Ingram had ingloriously bolted overturning a palm in his flight Next I tried the newspapers I wrote a quiet restrained dispassionate account of Jackson s case I made no charges against the men with whom I had talked nor for that matter did I even mention them I gave the actual facts of the case the long years Jackson had worked in the mills his effort to save the machinery from damage and the consequent accident and his own present wretched and starving condition The three local newspapers rejected my communication likewise did the two weeklies I got hold of Percy Layton He was a graduate of the university had gone in for journalism and was then serving his apprenticeship as reporter on the most influential of the three newspapers He smiled when I asked him the reason the newspapers suppressed all mention of Jackson or his case Editorial policy he said We have nothing to do with that It s up to the editors But why is it policy I asked We re all solid with the corporations he answered If you paid advertising rates you couldn t get any such matter into the papers A man who tried to smuggle it in would lose his job You couldn t get it in if you paid ten times the regular advertising rates How about your own policy I questioned It would seem your function is to twist truth at the command of your employers who in turn obey the behests of the corporations I haven t anything to do with that He looked uncomfortable for the moment then brightened as he saw his way out I myself do not write untruthful things I keep square all right with my own conscience Of course there s lots that s repugnant in the course of the day s work But then you see that s all part of the day s work he wound up boyishly Yet you expect to sit at an editor s desk some day and conduct a policy I ll be case hardened by that time was his reply Since you are not yet case hardened tell me what you think right now about the general editorial policy I don t think he answered quickly One can t kick over the ropes if he s going to succeed in journalism I ve learned that much at any rate And he nodded his young head sagely But the right I persisted You don t understand the game Of course it s all right because it comes out all right don t you see Delightfully vague I murmured but my heart was aching for the youth of him and I felt that I must either scream or burst into tears I was beginning to see through the appearances of the society in which I had always lived and to find the frightful realities that were beneath There seemed a tacit conspiracy against Jackson and I was aware of a thrill of sympathy for the whining lawyer who had ingloriously fought his case But this tacit conspiracy grew large Not alone was it aimed against Jackson It was aimed against every workingman who was maimed in the mills And if against every man in the mills why not against every man in all the other mills and factories In fact was it not true of all the industries And if this was so then society was a lie I shrank back from my own conclusions It was too terrible and awful to be true But there was Jackson and Jackson s arm and the blood that stained my gown and dripped from my own roof beams And there were many Jacksons hundreds of them in the mills alone as Jackson himself had said Jackson I could not escape I saw mister Wickson and mister Pertonwaithe the two men who held most of the stock in the Sierra Mills But I could not shake them as I had shaken the mechanics in their employ I discovered that they had an ethic superior to that of the rest of society It was what I may call the aristocratic ethic or the master ethic They talked in large ways of policy and they identified policy and right And to me they talked in fatherly ways patronizing my youth and inexperience They were the most hopeless of all I had encountered in my quest They believed absolutely that their conduct was right There was no question about it no discussion They were convinced that they were the saviours of society and that it was they who made happiness for the many And they drew pathetic pictures of what would be the sufferings of the working class were it not for the employment that they and they alone by their wisdom provided for it Before Avis Everhard was born John Stuart Mill in his essay ON LIBERTY wrote Wherever there is an ascendant class a large portion of the morality emanates from its class interests and its class feelings of superiority Fresh from these two masters I met Ernest and related my experience He looked at me with a pleased expression and said Really this is fine You are beginning to dig truth for yourself It is your own empirical generalization and it is correct No man in the industrial machine is a free will agent except the large capitalist and he isn t if you ll pardon the Irishism You see the masters are quite sure that they are right in what they are doing That is the crowning absurdity of the whole situation They are so tied by their human nature that they can t do a thing unless they think it is right They must have a sanction for their acts Verbal contradictions called BULLS were long an amiable weakness of the ancient Irish When they want to do a thing in business of course they must wait till there arises in their brains somehow a religious or ethical or scientific or philosophic concept that the thing is right And then they go ahead and do it unwitting that one of the weaknesses of the human mind is that the wish is parent to the thought No matter what they want to do the sanction always comes They are superficial casuists They are Jesuitical They even see their way to doing wrong that right may come of it One of the pleasant and axiomatic fictions they have created is that they are superior to the rest of mankind in wisdom and efficiency Therefrom comes their sanction to manage the bread and butter of the rest of mankind They have even resurrected the theory of the divine right of kings commercial kings in their case The newspapers in nineteen oh two of that era credited the president of the Anthracite Coal Trust George F Baer with the enunciation of the following principle The rights and interests of the laboring man will be protected by the Christian men to whom God in His infinite wisdom has given the property interests of the country The weakness in their position lies in that they are merely business men They are not philosophers They are not biologists nor sociologists If they were of course all would be well A business man who was also a biologist and a sociologist would know approximately the right thing to do for humanity But outside the realm of business these men are stupid They know only business They do not know mankind nor society and yet they set themselves up as arbiters of the fates of the hungry millions and all the other millions thrown in History some day will have an excruciating laugh at their expense I was not surprised when I had my talk out with missus Wickson and missus Pertonwaithe They were society women Their homes were palaces They had many homes scattered over the country in the mountains on lakes and by the sea They were tended by armies of servants and their social activities were bewildering They patronized the university and the churches and the pastors especially bowed at their knees in meek subservience They were powers these two women what of the money that was theirs The power of subsidization of thought was theirs to a remarkable degree as I was soon to learn under Ernest s tuition SOCIETY is here used in a restricted sense a common usage of the times to denote the gilded drones that did no labor but only glutted themselves at the honey vats of the workers Neither the business men nor the laborers had time or opportunity for SOCIETY SOCIETY was the creation of the idle rich who toiled not and who in this way played Bring on your tainted money was the expressed sentiment of the Church during this period They aped their husbands and talked in the same large ways about policy and the duties and responsibilities of the rich They were swayed by the same ethic that dominated their husbands the ethic of their class and they uttered glib phrases that their own ears did not understand Also they grew irritated when I told them of the deplorable condition of Jackson s family and when I wondered that they had made no voluntary provision for the man I was told that they thanked no one for instructing them in their social duties When I asked them flatly to assist Jackson they as flatly refused The astounding thing about it was that they refused in almost identically the same language and this in face of the fact that I interviewed them separately and that one did not know that I had seen or was going to see the other Their common reply was that they were glad of the opportunity to make it perfectly plain that no premium would ever be put on carelessness by them nor would they by paying for accident tempt the poor to hurt themselves in the machinery In the files of the OUTLOOK a critical weekly of the period in the number dated August eighteen nineteen oh six is related the circumstance of a workingman losing his arm the details of which are quite similar to those of Jackson s case as related by Avis Everhard And they were sincere these two women They were drunk with conviction of the superiority of their class and of themselves They had a sanction in their own class ethic for every act they performed As I drove away from missus Pertonwaithe s great house I looked back at it and I remembered Ernest s expression that they were bound to the machine but that they were so bound that they sat on top of it CHAPTER V THE PHILOMATHS Ernest was often at the house Nor was it my father merely nor the controversial dinners that drew him there Even at that time I flattered myself that I played some part in causing his visits and it was not long before I learned the correctness of my surmise For never was there such a lover as Ernest Everhard His gaze and his hand clasp grew firmer and steadier if that were possible and the question that had grown from the first in his eyes grew only the more imperative My impression of him the first time I saw him had been unfavorable Then I had found myself attracted toward him Next came my repulsion when he so savagely attacked my class and me After that as I saw that he had not maligned my class and that the harsh and bitter things he said about it were justified I had drawn closer to him again He became my oracle For me he tore the sham from the face of society and gave me glimpses of reality that were as unpleasant as they were undeniably true As I have said there was never such a lover as he No girl could live in a university town till she was twenty four and not have love experiences I had been made love to by beardless sophomores and gray professors and by the athletes and the football giants But not one of them made love to me as Ernest did His arms were around me before I knew His lips were on mine before I could protest or resist Before his earnestness conventional maiden dignity was ridiculous He swept me off my feet by the splendid invincible rush of him He did not propose He put his arms around me and kissed me and took it for granted that we should be married There was no discussion about it The only discussion and that arose afterward was when we should be married It was unprecedented It was unreal Yet in accordance with Ernest s test of truth it worked I trusted my life to it And fortunate was the trust Yet during those first days of our love fear of the future came often to me when I thought of the violence and impetuosity of his love making Yet such fears were groundless No woman was ever blessed with a gentler tenderer husband This gentleness and violence on his part was a curious blend similar to the one in his carriage of awkwardness and ease That slight awkwardness He never got over it and it was delicious His behavior in our drawing room reminded me of a careful bull in a china shop In those days it was still the custom to fill the living rooms with bric a brac They had not discovered simplicity of living Such rooms were museums entailing endless labor to keep clean The dust demon was the lord of the household There were a myriad devices for catching dust and only a few devices for getting rid of it It was at this time that vanished my last doubt of the completeness of my love for him a subconscious doubt at most It was at the Philomath Club a wonderful night of battle wherein Ernest bearded the masters in their lair Now the Philomath Club was the most select on the Pacific Coast It was the creation of Miss Brentwood an enormously wealthy old maid and it was her husband and family and toy Its members were the wealthiest in the community and the strongest minded of the wealthy with of course a sprinkling of scholars to give it intellectual tone The Philomath had no club house It was not that kind of a club Once a month its members gathered at some one of their private houses to listen to a lecture The lecturers were usually though not always hired If a chemist in New York made a new discovery in say radium all his expenses across the continent were paid and as well he received a princely fee for his time The same with a returning explorer from the polar regions or the latest literary or artistic success No visitors were allowed while it was the Philomath s policy to permit none of its discussions to get into the papers Thus great statesmen and there had been such occasions were able fully to speak their minds I spread before me a wrinkled letter written to me by Ernest twenty years ago and from it I copy the following Your father is a member of the Philomath so you are able to come Therefore come next Tuesday night I promise you that you will have the time of your life In your recent encounters you failed to shake the masters If you come I ll shake them for you I ll make them snarl like wolves You merely questioned their morality When their morality is questioned they grow only the more complacent and superior But I shall menace their money bags That will shake them to the roots of their primitive natures If you can come you will see the cave man in evening dress snarling and snapping over a bone I promise you a great caterwauling and an illuminating insight into the nature of the beast They ve invited me in order to tear me to pieces This is the idea of Miss Brentwood She clumsily hinted as much when she invited me She s given them that kind of fun before They delight in getting trustful souled gentle reformers before them Miss Brentwood thinks I am as mild as a kitten and as good natured and stolid as the family cow I ll not deny that I helped to give her that impression She was very tentative at first until she divined my harmlessness I am to receive a handsome fee two hundred and fifty dollars as befits the man who though a radical once ran for governor Also I am to wear evening dress This is compulsory I never was so apparelled in my life I suppose I ll have to hire one somewhere But I d do more than that to get a chance at the Philomaths Of all places the Club gathered that night at the Pertonwaithe house Extra chairs had been brought into the great drawing room and in all there must have been two hundred Philomaths that sat down to hear Ernest They were truly lords of society I amused myself with running over in my mind the sum of the fortunes represented and it ran well into the hundreds of millions And the possessors were not of the idle rich They were men of affairs who took most active parts in industrial and political life We were all seated when Miss Brentwood brought Ernest in They moved at once to the head of the room from where he was to speak He was in evening dress and what of his broad shoulders and kingly head he looked magnificent And then there was that faint and unmistakable touch of awkwardness in his movements I almost think I could have loved him for that alone And as I looked at him I was aware of a great joy I felt again the pulse of his palm on mine the touch of his lips and such pride was mine that I felt I must rise up and cry out to the assembled company He is mine He has held me in his arms and I mere I have filled that mind of his to the exclusion of all his multitudinous and kingly thoughts At the head of the room Miss Brentwood introduced him to Colonel Van Gilbert and I knew that the latter was to preside Colonel Van Gilbert was a great corporation lawyer In addition he was immensely wealthy The smallest fee he would deign to notice was a hundred thousand dollars He was a master of law The law was a puppet with which he played He moulded it like clay twisted and distorted it like a Chinese puzzle into any design he chose In appearance and rhetoric he was old fashioned but in imagination and knowledge and resource he was as young as the latest statute His first prominence had come when he broke the Shardwell will His fee for this one act was five hundred thousand dollars From then on he had risen like a rocket He was often called the greatest lawyer in the country corporation lawyer of course and no classification of the three greatest lawyers in the United States could have excluded him This breaking of wills was a peculiar feature of the period With the accumulation of vast fortunes the problem of disposing of these fortunes after death was a vexing one to the accumulators Will making and will breaking became complementary trades like armor making and gun making The shrewdest will making lawyers were called in to make wills that could not be broken But these wills were always broken and very often by the very lawyers that had drawn them up Nevertheless the delusion persisted in the wealthy class that an absolutely unbreakable will could be cast and so through the generations clients and lawyers pursued the illusion It was a pursuit like unto that of the Universal Solvent of the mediaeval alchemists He arose and began in a few well chosen phrases that carried an undertone of faint irony to introduce Ernest Colonel Van Gilbert was subtly facetious in his introduction of the social reformer and member of the working class and the audience smiled It made me angry and I glanced at Ernest The sight of him made me doubly angry He did not seem to resent the delicate slurs Worse than that he did not seem to be aware of them There he sat gentle and stolid and somnolent He really looked stupid And for a moment the thought rose in my mind What if he were overawed by this imposing array of power and brains Then I smiled He couldn t fool me But he fooled the others just as he had fooled Miss Brentwood She occupied a chair right up to the front and several times she turned her head toward one or another of her CONFRERES and smiled her appreciation of the remarks Colonel Van Gilbert done Ernest arose and began to speak He began in a low voice haltingly and modestly and with an air of evident embarrassment He spoke of his birth in the working class and of the sordidness and wretchedness of his environment where flesh and spirit were alike starved and tormented He described his ambitions and ideals and his conception of the paradise wherein lived the people of the upper classes As he said Up above me I knew were unselfishnesses of the spirit clean and noble thinking keen intellectual living I knew all this because I read Seaside Library novels in which with the exception of the villains and adventuresses all men and women thought beautiful thoughts spoke a beautiful tongue and performed glorious deeds In short as I accepted the rising of the sun I accepted that up above me was all that was fine and noble and gracious all that gave decency and dignity to life all that made life worth living and that remunerated one for his travail and misery A curious and amazing literature that served to make the working class utterly misapprehend the nature of the leisure class He went on and traced his life in the mills the learning of the horseshoeing trade and his meeting with the socialists Among them he said he had found keen intellects and brilliant wits ministers of the Gospel who had been broken because their Christianity was too wide for any congregation of mammon worshippers and professors who had been broken on the wheel of university subservience to the ruling class The socialists were revolutionists he said struggling to overthrow the irrational society of the present and out of the material to build the rational society of the future Much more he said that would take too long to write but I shall never forget how he described the life among the revolutionists All halting utterance vanished His voice grew strong and confident and it glowed as he glowed and as the thoughts glowed that poured out from him He said Amongst the revolutionists I found also warm faith in the human ardent idealism sweetnesses of unselfishness renunciation and martyrdom all the splendid stinging things of the spirit Here life was clean noble and alive I was in touch with great souls who exalted flesh and spirit over dollars and cents and to whom the thin wail of the starved slum child meant more than all the pomp and circumstance of commercial expansion and world empire All about me were nobleness of purpose and heroism of effort and my days and nights were sunshine and starshine all fire and dew with before my eyes ever burning and blazing the Holy Grail Christ s own Grail the warm human long suffering and maltreated but to be rescued and saved at the last As before I had seen him transfigured so now he stood transfigured before me His brows were bright with the divine that was in him and brighter yet shone his eyes from the midst of the radiance that seemed to envelop him as a mantle But the others did not see this radiance and I assumed that it was due to the tears of joy and love that dimmed my vision At any rate mister Wickson who sat behind me was unaffected for I heard him sneer aloud Utopian The people of that age were phrase slaves The abjectness of their servitude is incomprehensible to us There was a magic in words greater than the conjurer s art So befuddled and chaotic were their minds that the utterance of a single word could negative the generalizations of a lifetime of serious research and thought Such a word was the adjective UTOPIAN The mere utterance of it could damn any scheme no matter how sanely conceived of economic amelioration or regeneration Vast populations grew frenzied over such phrases as an honest dollar and a full dinner pail The coinage of such phrases was considered strokes of genius Ernest went on to his rise in society till at last he came in touch with members of the upper classes and rubbed shoulders with the men who sat in the high places Then came his disillusionment and this disillusionment he described in terms that did not flatter his audience He was surprised at the commonness of the clay Life proved not to be fine and gracious He was appalled by the selfishness he encountered and what had surprised him even more than that was the absence of intellectual life Fresh from his revolutionists he was shocked by the intellectual stupidity of the master class And then in spite of their magnificent churches and well paid preachers he had found the masters men and women grossly material It was true that they prattled sweet little ideals and dear little moralities but in spite of their prattle the dominant key of the life they lived was materialistic And they were without real morality for instance that which Christ had preached but which was no longer preached I met men he said who invoked the name of the Prince of Peace in their diatribes against war and who put rifles in the hands of Pinkertons with which to shoot down strikers in their own factories I met men incoherent with indignation at the brutality of prize fighting and who at the same time were parties to the adulteration of food that killed each year more babes than even red handed Herod had killed Originally they were private detectives but they quickly became hired fighting men of the capitalists and ultimately developed into the Mercenaries of the Oligarchy This delicate aristocratic featured gentleman was a dummy director and a tool of corporations that secretly robbed widows and orphans This gentleman who collected fine editions and was a patron of literature paid blackmail to a heavy jowled black browed boss of a municipal machine This editor who published patent medicine advertisements called me a scoundrelly demagogue because I dared him to print in his paper the truth about patent medicines This man talking soberly and earnestly about the beauties of idealism and the goodness of God had just betrayed his comrades in a business deal This man a pillar of the church and heavy contributor to foreign missions worked his shop girls ten hours a day on a starvation wage and thereby directly encouraged prostitution This man who endowed chairs in universities and erected magnificent chapels perjured himself in courts of law over dollars and cents This railroad magnate broke his word as a citizen as a gentleman and as a Christian when he granted a secret rebate and he granted many secret rebates This senator was the tool and the slave the little puppet of a brutal uneducated machine boss so was this governor and this supreme court judge and all three rode on railroad passes and also this sleek capitalist owned the machine the machine boss and the railroads that issued the passes PATENT MEDICINES were patent lies but like the charms and indulgences of the Middle Ages they deceived the people The only difference lay in that the patent medicines were more harmful and more costly Even as late as nineteen twelve A D the great mass of the people still persisted in the belief that they ruled the country by virtue of their ballots In reality the country was ruled by what were called POLITICAL MACHINES At first the machine bosses charged the master capitalists extortionate tolls for legislation but in a short time the master capitalists found it cheaper to own the political machines themselves and to hire the machine bosses And so it was instead of in paradise that I found myself in the arid desert of commercialism I found nothing but stupidity except for business I found none clean noble and alive though I found many who were alive with rottenness What I did find was monstrous selfishness and heartlessness and a gross gluttonous practised and practical materialism Much more Ernest told them of themselves and of his disillusionment Intellectually they had bored him morally and spiritually they had sickened him so that he was glad to go back to his revolutionists who were clean noble and alive and all that the capitalists were not And now he said let me tell you about that revolution But first I must say that his terrible diatribe had not touched them I looked about me at their faces and saw that they remained complacently superior to what he had charged And I remembered what he had told me that no indictment of their morality could shake them However I could see that the boldness of his language had affected Miss Brentwood She was looking worried and apprehensive Ernest began by describing the army of revolution and as he gave the figures of its strength the votes cast in the various countries the assemblage began to grow restless Concern showed in their faces and I noticed a tightening of lips At last the gage of battle had been thrown down He described the international organization of the socialists that united the million and a half in the United States with the twenty three millions and a half in the rest of the world Such an army of revolution he said twenty five millions strong is a thing to make rulers and ruling classes pause and consider The cry of this army is No quarter We want all that you possess We will be content with nothing less than all that you possess We want in our hands the reins of power and the destiny of mankind Here are our hands They are strong hands We are going to take your governments your palaces and all your purpled ease away from you and in that day you shall work for your bread even as the peasant in the field or the starved and runty clerk in your metropolises Here are our hands They are strong hands And as he spoke he extended from his splendid shoulders his two great arms and the horseshoer s hands were clutching the air like eagle s talons He was the spirit of regnant labor as he stood there his hands outreaching to rend and crush his audience I was aware of a faintly perceptible shrinking on the part of the listeners before this figure of revolution concrete potential and menacing That is the women shrank and fear was in their faces Not so with the men They were of the active rich and not the idle and they were fighters A low throaty rumble arose lingered on the air a moment and ceased It was the forerunner of the snarl and I was to hear it many times that night the token of the brute in man the earnest of his primitive passions And they were unconscious that they had made this sound It was the growl of the pack mouthed by the pack and mouthed in all unconsciousness And in that moment as I saw the harshness form in their faces and saw the fight light flashing in their eyes I realized that not easily would they let their lordship of the world be wrested from them Ernest proceeded with his attack He accounted for the existence of the million and a half of revolutionists in the United States by charging the capitalist class with having mismanaged society He sketched the economic condition of the cave man and of the savage peoples of to day pointing out that they possessed neither tools nor machines and possessed only a natural efficiency of one in producing power Then he traced the development of machinery and social organization so that to day the producing power of civilized man was a thousand times greater than that of the savage Five men he said can produce bread for a thousand One man can produce cotton cloth for two hundred and fifty people woollens for three hundred and boots and shoes for a thousand One would conclude from this that under a capable management of society modern civilized man would be a great deal better off than the cave man But is he Let us see In the United States to day there are fifteen million people living in poverty and by poverty is meant that condition in life in which through lack of food and adequate shelter the mere standard of working efficiency cannot be maintained In the United States to day in spite of all your so called labor legislation there are three millions of child laborers In twelve years their numbers have been doubled And in passing I will ask you managers of society why you did not make public the census figures of nineteen ten And I will answer for you that you were afraid The figures of misery would have precipitated the revolution that even now is gathering Robert Hunter in nineteen oh six in a book entitled Poverty pointed out that at that time there were ten millions in the United States living in poverty In the United States Census of nineteen hundred the last census the figures of which were made public the number of child laborers was placed at one million seven hundred fifty two thousand one hundred eighty seven But to return to my indictment If modern man s producing power is a thousand times greater than that of the cave man why then in the United States to day are there fifteen million people who are not properly sheltered and properly fed Why then in the United States to day are there three million child laborers It is a true indictment The capitalist class has mismanaged In face of the facts that modern man lives more wretchedly than the cave man and that his producing power is a thousand times greater than that of the cave man no other conclusion is possible than that the capitalist class has mismanaged that you have mismanaged my masters that you have criminally and selfishly mismanaged And on this count you cannot answer me here to night face to face any more than can your whole class answer the million and a half of revolutionists in the United States You cannot answer I challenge you to answer And furthermore I dare to say to you now that when I have finished you will not answer On that point you will be tongue tied though you will talk wordily enough about other things You have failed in your management You have made a shambles of civilization You have been blind and greedy You have risen up as you to day rise up shamelessly in our legislative halls and declared that profits were impossible without the toil of children and babes Don t take my word for it It is all in the records against you You have lulled your conscience to sleep with prattle of sweet ideals and dear moralities You are fat with power and possession drunken with success and you have no more hope against us than have the drones clustered about the honey vats when the worker bees spring upon them to end their rotund existence You have failed in your management of society and your management is to be taken away from you A million and a half of the men of the working class say that they are going to get the rest of the working class to join with them and take the management away from you This is the revolution my masters Stop it if you can For an appreciable lapse of time Ernest s voice continued to ring through the great room Then arose the throaty rumble I had heard before and a dozen men were on their feet clamoring for recognition from Colonel Van Gilbert I noticed Miss Brentwood s shoulders moving convulsively and for the moment I was angry for I thought that she was laughing at Ernest And then I discovered that it was not laughter but hysteria She was appalled by what she had done in bringing this firebrand before her blessed Philomath Club Colonel Van Gilbert did not notice the dozen men with passion wrought faces who strove to get permission from him to speak His own face was passion wrought He sprang to his feet waving his arms and for a moment could utter only incoherent sounds Then speech poured from him But it was not the speech of a one hundred thousand dollar lawyer nor was the rhetoric old fashioned Fallacy upon fallacy he cried Never in all my life have I heard so many fallacies uttered in one short hour And besides young man I must tell you that you have said nothing new I learned all that at college before you were born Jean Jacques Rousseau enunciated your socialistic theory nearly two centuries ago A return to the soil forsooth Reversion Our biology teaches the absurdity of it It has been truly said that a little learning is a dangerous thing and you have exemplified it to night with your madcap theories Fallacy upon fallacy I was never so nauseated in my life with overplus of fallacy That for your immature generalizations and childish reasonings He snapped his fingers contemptuously and proceeded to sit down There were lip exclamations of approval on the part of the women and hoarser notes of confirmation came from the men As for the dozen men who were clamoring for the floor half of them began speaking at once The confusion and babel was indescribable Never had missus Pertonwaithe s spacious walls beheld such a spectacle These then were the cool captains of industry and lords of society these snarling growling savages in evening clothes Truly Ernest had shaken them when he stretched out his hands for their moneybags his hands that had appeared in their eyes as the hands of the fifteen hundred thousand revolutionists But Ernest never lost his head in a situation Before Colonel Van Gilbert had succeeded in sitting down Ernest was on his feet and had sprung forward One at a time he roared at them The sound arose from his great lungs and dominated the human tempest By sheer compulsion of personality he commanded silence One at a time he repeated softly Let me answer Colonel Van Gilbert After that the rest of you can come at me but one at a time remember No mass plays here This is not a football field As for you he went on turning toward Colonel Van Gilbert you have replied to nothing I have said You have merely made a few excited and dogmatic assertions about my mental caliber That may serve you in your business but you can t talk to me like that I am not a workingman cap in hand asking you to increase my wages or to protect me from the machine at which I work You cannot be dogmatic with truth when you deal with me Save that for dealing with your wage slaves They will not dare reply to you because you hold their bread and butter their lives in your hands As for this return to nature that you say you learned at college before I was born permit me to point out that on the face of it you cannot have learned anything since Socialism has no more to do with the state of nature than has differential calculus with a Bible class I have called your class stupid when outside the realm of business You sir have brilliantly exemplified my statement This terrible castigation of her hundred thousand dollar lawyer was too much for Miss Brentwood s nerves Her hysteria became violent and she was helped weeping and laughing out of the room It was just as well for there was worse to follow Don t take my word for it Ernest continued when the interruption had been led away Your own authorities with one unanimous voice will prove you stupid Your own hired purveyors of knowledge will tell you that you are wrong Go to your meekest little assistant instructor of sociology and ask him what is the difference between Rousseau s theory of the return to nature and the theory of socialism ask your greatest orthodox bourgeois political economists and sociologists question through the pages of every text book written on the subject and stored on the shelves of your subsidized libraries and from one and all the answer will be that there is nothing congruous between the return to nature and socialism On the other hand the unanimous affirmative answer will be that the return to nature and socialism are diametrically opposed to each other As I say don t take my word for it The record of your stupidity is there in the books your own books that you never read And so far as your stupidity is concerned you are but the exemplar of your class You know law and business Colonel Van Gilbert You know how to serve corporations and increase dividends by twisting the law Very good Stick to it You are quite a figure You are a very good lawyer but you are a poor historian you know nothing of sociology and your biology is contemporaneous with Pliny Here Colonel Van Gilbert writhed in his chair There was perfect quiet in the room Everybody sat fascinated paralyzed I may say Such fearful treatment of the great Colonel Van Gilbert was unheard of undreamed of impossible to believe the great Colonel Van Gilbert before whom judges trembled when he arose in court But Ernest never gave quarter to an enemy This is of course no reflection on you Ernest said Every man to his trade Only you stick to your trade and I ll stick to mine You have specialized When it comes to a knowledge of the law of how best to evade the law or make new law for the benefit of thieving corporations I am down in the dirt at your feet But when it comes to sociology my trade you are down in the dirt at my feet Remember that Remember also that your law is the stuff of a day and that you are not versatile in the stuff of more than a day Therefore your dogmatic assertions and rash generalizations on things historical and sociological are not worth the breath you waste on them Ernest paused for a moment and regarded him thoughtfully noting his face dark and twisted with anger his panting chest his writhing body and his slim white hands nervously clenching and unclenching But it seems you have breath to use and I ll give you a chance to use it I indicted your class Show me that my indictment is wrong I pointed out to you the wretchedness of modern man three million child slaves in the United States without whose labor profits would not be possible and fifteen million under fed ill clothed and worse housed people I pointed out that modern man s producing power through social organization and the use of machinery was a thousand times greater than that of the cave man And I stated that from these two facts no other conclusion was possible than that the capitalist class had mismanaged This was my indictment and I specifically and at length challenged you to answer it Nay I did more I prophesied that you would not answer It remains for your breath to smash my prophecy You called my speech fallacy Show the fallacy Colonel Van Gilbert Answer the indictment that I and my fifteen hundred thousand comrades have brought against your class and you Colonel Van Gilbert quite forgot that he was presiding and that in courtesy he should permit the other clamorers to speak He was on his feet flinging his arms his rhetoric and his control to the winds alternately abusing Ernest for his youth and demagoguery and savagely attacking the working class elaborating its inefficiency and worthlessness For a lawyer you are the hardest man to keep to a point I ever saw Ernest began his answer to the tirade My youth has nothing to do with what I have enunciated Nor has the worthlessness of the working class I charged the capitalist class with having mismanaged society You have not answered You have made no attempt to answer Why Is it because you have no answer You are the champion of this whole audience Every one here except me is hanging on your lips for that answer They are hanging on your lips for that answer because they have no answer themselves As for me as I said before I know that you not only cannot answer but that you will not attempt an answer This is intolerable Colonel Van Gilbert cried out This is insult That you should not answer is intolerable Ernest replied gravely No man can be intellectually insulted Insult in its very nature is emotional Recover yourself Give me an intellectual answer to my intellectual charge that the capitalist class has mismanaged society Colonel Van Gilbert remained silent a sullen superior expression on his face such as will appear on the face of a man who will not bandy words with a ruffian Do not be downcast Ernest said Take consolation in the fact that no member of your class has ever yet answered that charge He turned to the other men who were anxious to speak And now it s your chance Fire away and do not forget that I here challenge you to give the answer that Colonel Van Gilbert has failed to give It would be impossible for me to write all that was said in the discussion I never realized before how many words could be spoken in three short hours At any rate it was glorious The more his opponents grew excited the more Ernest deliberately excited them He had an encyclopaedic command of the field of knowledge and by a word or a phrase by delicate rapier thrusts he punctured them He named the points of their illogic This was a false syllogism that conclusion had no connection with the premise while that next premise was an impostor because it had cunningly hidden in it the conclusion that was being attempted to be proved This was an error that was an assumption and the next was an assertion contrary to ascertained truth as printed in all the text books And so it went Sometimes he exchanged the rapier for the club and went smashing amongst their thoughts right and left And always he demanded facts and refused to discuss theories And his facts made for them a Waterloo When they attacked the working class he always retorted The pot calling the kettle black that is no answer to the charge that your own face is dirty And to one and all he said Why have you not answered the charge that your class has mismanaged You have talked about other things and things concerning other things but you have not answered Is it because you have no answer It was at the end of the discussion that mister Wickson spoke He was the only one that was cool and Ernest treated him with a respect he had not accorded the others No answer is necessary mister Wickson said with slow deliberation I have followed the whole discussion with amazement and disgust I am disgusted with you gentlemen members of my class You have behaved like foolish little schoolboys what with intruding ethics and the thunder of the common politician into such a discussion You have been outgeneralled and outclassed You have been very wordy and all you have done is buzz You have buzzed like gnats about a bear Gentlemen there stands the bear he pointed at Ernest and your buzzing has only tickled his ears Believe me the situation is serious That bear reached out his paws tonight to crush us He has said there are a million and a half of revolutionists in the United States That is a fact He has said that it is their intention to take away from us our governments our palaces and all our purpled ease That also is a fact A change a great change is coming in society but haply it may not be the change the bear anticipates The bear has said that he will crush us What if we crush the bear The throat rumble arose in the great room and man nodded to man with indorsement and certitude Their faces were set hard They were fighters that was certain But not by buzzing will we crush the bear mister Wickson went on coldly and dispassionately We will hunt the bear We will not reply to the bear in words Our reply shall be couched in terms of lead We are in power Nobody will deny it By virtue of that power we shall remain in power He turned suddenly upon Ernest The moment was dramatic This then is our answer We have no words to waste on you When you reach out your vaunted strong hands for our palaces and purpled ease we will show you what strength is In roar of shell and shrapnel and in whine of machine guns will our answer be couched We will grind you revolutionists down under our heel and we shall walk upon your faces The world is ours we are its lords and ours it shall remain As for the host of labor it has been in the dirt since history began and I read history aright And in the dirt it shall remain so long as I and mine and those that come after us have the power There is the word It is the king of words Power Not God not Mammon but Power Pour it over your tongue till it tingles with it Power To show the tenor of thought the following definition is quoted from The Cynic s Word Book nineteen oh six A D written by one Ambrose Bierce an avowed and confirmed misanthrope of the period Grapeshot n An argument which the future is preparing in answer to the demands of American Socialism I am answered Ernest said quietly It is the only answer that could be given Power It is what we of the working class preach We know and well we know by bitter experience that no appeal for the right for justice for humanity can ever touch you Your hearts are hard as your heels with which you tread upon the faces of the poor So we have preached power By the power of our ballots on election day will we take your government away from you What if you do get a majority a sweeping majority on election day mister Wickson broke in to demand Suppose we refuse to turn the government over to you after you have captured it at the ballot box That also have we considered Ernest replied And we shall give you an answer in terms of lead Power you have proclaimed the king of words Very good Power it shall be And in the day that we sweep to victory at the ballot box and you refuse to turn over to us the government we have constitutionally and peacefully captured and you demand what we are going to do about it in that day I say we shall answer you and in roar of shell and shrapnel and in whine of machine guns shall our answer be couched You cannot escape us It is true that you have read history aright It is true that labor has from the beginning of history been in the dirt And it is equally true that so long as you and yours and those that come after you have power that labor shall remain in the dirt I agree with you I agree with all that you have said Power will be the arbiter as it always has been the arbiter It is a struggle of classes Just as your class dragged down the old feudal nobility so shall it be dragged down by my class the working class If you will read your biology and your sociology as clearly as you do your history you will see that this end I have described is inevitable It does not matter whether it is in one year ten or a thousand your class shall be dragged down And it shall be done by power We of the labor hosts have conned that word over till our minds are all a tingle with it Power It is a kingly word And so ended the night with the Philomaths CHAPTER VI ADUMBRATIONS It was about this time that the warnings of coming events began to fall about us thick and fast Ernest had already questioned father s policy of having socialists and labor leaders at his house and of openly attending socialist meetings and father had only laughed at him for his pains As for myself I was learning much from this contact with the working class leaders and thinkers I was seeing the other side of the shield I was delighted with the unselfishness and high idealism I encountered though I was appalled by the vast philosophic and scientific literature of socialism that was opened up to me I was learning fast but I learned not fast enough to realize then the peril of our position There were warnings but I did not heed them For instance missus Pertonwaithe and missus Wickson exercised tremendous social power in the university town and from them emanated the sentiment that I was a too forward and self assertive young woman with a mischievous penchant for officiousness and interference in other persons affairs This I thought no more than natural considering the part I had played in investigating the case of Jackson s arm But the effect of such a sentiment enunciated by two such powerful social arbiters I underestimated True I noticed a certain aloofness on the part of my general friends but this I ascribed to the disapproval that was prevalent in my circles of my intended marriage with Ernest It was not till some time afterward that Ernest pointed out to me clearly that this general attitude of my class was something more than spontaneous that behind it were the hidden springs of an organized conduct You have given shelter to an enemy of your class he said And not alone shelter for you have given your love yourself This is treason to your class Think not that you will escape being penalized But it was before this that father returned one afternoon Ernest was with me and we could see that father was angry philosophically angry He was rarely really angry but a certain measure of controlled anger he allowed himself He called it a tonic And we could see that he was tonic angry when he entered the room What do you think he demanded I had luncheon with Wilcox Wilcox was the superannuated president of the university whose withered mind was stored with generalizations that were young in eighteen seventy and which he had since failed to revise I was invited father announced I was sent for He paused and we waited Oh it was done very nicely I ll allow but I was reprimanded I And by that old fossil I ll wager I know what you were reprimanded for Ernest said Not in three guesses father laughed One guess will do Ernest retorted And it won t be a guess It will be a deduction You were reprimanded for your private life The very thing father cried How did you guess I knew it was coming I warned you before about it Yes you did father meditated But I couldn t believe it At any rate it is only so much more clinching evidence for my book It is nothing to what will come Ernest went on if you persist in your policy of having these socialists and radicals of all sorts at your house myself included Just what old Wilcox said And of all unwarranted things He said it was in poor taste utterly profitless anyway and not in harmony with university traditions and policy He said much more of the same vague sort and I couldn t pin him down to anything specific I made it pretty awkward for him and he could only go on repeating himself and telling me how much he honored me and all the world honored me as a scientist It wasn t an agreeable task for him I could see he didn t like it He was not a free agent Ernest said The leg bar is not always worn graciously LEG BAR the African slaves were so manacled also criminals It was not until the coming of the Brotherhood of Man that the leg bar passed out of use Yes I got that much out of him He said the university needed ever so much more money this year than the state was willing to furnish and that it must come from wealthy personages who could not but be offended by the swerving of the university from its high ideal of the passionless pursuit of passionless intelligence When I tried to pin him down to what my home life had to do with swerving the university from its high ideal he offered me a two years vacation on full pay in Europe for recreation and research Of course I couldn t accept it under the circumstances It would have been far better if you had Ernest said gravely It was a bribe father protested and Ernest nodded Also the beggar said that there was talk tea table gossip and so forth about my daughter being seen in public with so notorious a character as you and that it was not in keeping with university tone and dignity Not that he personally objected oh no but that there was talk and that I would understand Ernest considered this announcement for a moment and then said and his face was very grave withal there was a sombre wrath in it There is more behind this than a mere university ideal Somebody has put pressure on President Wilcox Do you think so father asked and his face showed that he was interested rather than frightened I wish I could convey to you the conception that is dimly forming in my own mind Ernest said Never in the history of the world was society in so terrific flux as it is right now The swift changes in our industrial system are causing equally swift changes in our religious political and social structures An unseen and fearful revolution is taking place in the fibre and structure of society One can only dimly feel these things But they are in the air now to day One can feel the loom of them things vast vague and terrible My mind recoils from contemplation of what they may crystallize into You heard Wickson talk the other night Behind what he said were the same nameless formless things that I feel He spoke out of a superconscious apprehension of them You mean father began then paused I mean that there is a shadow of something colossal and menacing that even now is beginning to fall across the land Call it the shadow of an oligarchy if you will it is the nearest I dare approximate it What its nature may be I refuse to imagine But what I wanted to say was this You are in a perilous position a peril that my own fear enhances because I am not able even to measure it Take my advice and accept the vacation Though like Everhard they did not dream of the nature of it there were men even before his time who caught glimpses of the shadow John C Calhoun said A power has risen up in the government greater than the people themselves consisting of many and various and powerful interests combined into one mass and held together by the cohesive power of the vast surplus in the banks And that great humanist Abraham Lincoln said just before his assassination I see in the near future a crisis approaching that unnerves me and causes me to tremble for the safety of my country Corporations have been enthroned an era of corruption in high places will follow and the money power of the country will endeavor to prolong its reign by working upon the prejudices of the people until the wealth is aggregated in a few hands and the Republic is destroyed But it would be cowardly was the protest Not at all You are an old man You have done your work in the world and a great work Leave the present battle to youth and strength We young fellows have our work yet to do Avis will stand by my side in what is to come She will be your representative in the battle front But they can t hurt me father objected Thank God I am independent Oh I assure you I know the frightful persecution they can wage on a professor who is economically dependent on his university But I am independent I have not been a professor for the sake of my salary I can get along very comfortably on my own income and the salary is all they can take away from me But you do not realize Ernest answered If all that I fear be so your private income your principal itself can be taken from you just as easily as your salary Father was silent for a few minutes He was thinking deeply and I could see the lines of decision forming in his face At last he spoke I shall not take the vacation He paused again I shall go on with my book You may be wrong but whether you are wrong or right I shall stand by my guns This book Economics and Education was published in that year Three copies of it are extant two at Ardis and one at Asgard It dealt in elaborate detail with one factor in the persistence of the established namely the capitalistic bias of the universities and common schools It was a logical and crushing indictment of the whole system of education that developed in the minds of the students only such ideas as were favorable to the capitalistic regime to the exclusion of all ideas that were inimical and subversive The book created a furor and was promptly suppressed by the Oligarchy All right Ernest said You are travelling the same path that Bishop Morehouse is and toward a similar smash up You ll both be proletarians before you re done with it The conversation turned upon the Bishop and we got Ernest to explain what he had been doing with him He is soul sick from the journey through hell I have given him I took him through the homes of a few of our factory workers I showed him the human wrecks cast aside by the industrial machine and he listened to their life stories I took him through the slums of San Francisco and in drunkenness prostitution and criminality he learned a deeper cause than innate depravity He is very sick and worse than that he has got out of hand He is too ethical He has been too severely touched And as usual he is unpractical He is up in the air with all kinds of ethical delusions and plans for mission work among the cultured He feels it is his bounden duty to resurrect the ancient spirit of the Church and to deliver its message to the masters He is overwrought Sooner or later he is going to break out and then there s going to be a smash up What form it will take I can t even guess He is a pure exalted soul but he is so unpractical He s beyond me I can t keep his feet on the earth And through the air he is rushing on to his Gethsemane And after this his crucifixion Such high souls are made for crucifixion And you I asked and beneath my smile was the seriousness of the anxiety of love Not I he laughed back I may be executed or assassinated but I shall never be crucified I am planted too solidly and stolidly upon the earth But why should you bring about the crucifixion of the Bishop I asked You will not deny that you are the cause of it Why should I leave one comfortable soul in comfort when there are millions in travail and misery he demanded back Then why did you advise father to accept the vacation Because I am not a pure exalted soul was the answer Because I am solid and stolid and selfish Because I love you and like Ruth of old thy people are my people As for the Bishop he has no daughter Besides no matter how small the good nevertheless his little inadequate wail will be productive of some good in the revolution and every little bit counts I could not agree with Ernest I knew well the noble nature of Bishop Morehouse and I could not conceive that his voice raised for righteousness would be no more than a little inadequate wail But I did not yet have the harsh facts of life at my fingers ends as Ernest had He saw clearly the futility of the Bishop s great soul as coming events were soon to show as clearly to me It was shortly after this day that Ernest told me as a good story the offer he had received from the government namely an appointment as United States Commissioner of Labor I was overjoyed The salary was comparatively large and would make safe our marriage And then it surely was congenial work for Ernest and furthermore my jealous pride in him made me hail the proffered appointment as a recognition of his abilities Then I noticed the twinkle in his eyes He was laughing at me You are not going to to decline I quavered It is a bribe he said Behind it is the fine hand of Wickson and behind him the hands of greater men than he It is an old trick old as the class struggle is old stealing the captains from the army of labor Poor betrayed labor If you but knew how many of its leaders have been bought out in similar ways in the past It is cheaper so much cheaper to buy a general than to fight him and his whole army There was but I ll not call any names I m bitter enough over it as it is Dear heart I am a captain of labor I could not sell out If for no other reason the memory of my poor old father and the way he was worked to death would prevent The tears were in his eyes this great strong hero of mine He never could forgive the way his father had been malformed the sordid lies and the petty thefts he had been compelled to in order to put food in his children s mouths My father was a good man Ernest once said to me The soul of him was good and yet it was twisted and maimed and blunted by the savagery of his life He was made into a broken down beast by his masters the arch beasts He should be alive to day like your father He had a strong constitution But he was caught in the machine and worked to death for profit Think of it For profit his life blood transmuted into a wine supper or a jewelled gewgaw or some similar sense orgy of the parasitic and idle rich his masters the arch beasts CHAPTER VII 
5224-35439-0000	train-other-500	THE BISHOP S VISION The Bishop is out of hand Ernest wrote me He is clear up in the air Tonight he is going to begin putting to rights this very miserable world of ours
5224-35439-0001	train-other-500	He is going to deliver his message He has told me so and I cannot dissuade him
5224-35439-0002	train-other-500	To night he is chairman of the I P H and he will embody his message in his introductory remarks There is no clew to the name of the organization for which these initials stand
5224-35439-0003	train-other-500	May I bring you to hear him Of course he is foredoomed to futility It will break your heart it will break his but for you it will be an excellent object lesson
none	none	 You know dear heart how proud I am because you love me And because of that I want you to know my fullest value 
5224-35439-0004	train-other-500	I want to redeem in your eyes some small measure of my unworthiness And so it is that my pride desires that you shall know my thinking is correct and right My views are harsh
5224-35439-0005	train-other-500	the futility of so noble a soul as the Bishop will show you the compulsion for such harshness So come to night Sad though this night s happening will be I feel that it will but draw you more closely to me
5224-35439-0006	train-other-500	The I P H held its convention that night in San Francisco
5224-35439-0007	train-other-500	This convention had been called to consider public immorality and the remedy for it Bishop Morehouse presided He was very nervous as he sat on the platform and I could see the high tension he was under By his side were Bishop Dickinson
none	none	 H H Jones the head of the ethical department in the University of California missus W W Hurd the great charity organizer Philip Ward the equally great philanthropist and several lesser luminaries in the field of morality and charity Bishop Morehouse arose and abruptly began It took but a few minutes to cross by ferry from Berkeley to San Francisco These and the other bay cities practically composed one community I was in my brougham driving through the streets It was night time Now and then I looked through the carriage windows and suddenly my eyes seemed to be opened and I saw things as they really are At first I covered my eyes with my hands to shut out the awful sight 
5224-35439-0008	train-other-500	and then in the darkness the question came to me What is to be done What is to be done A little later the question came to me in another way What would the Master do And with the question a great light seemed to fill the place
none	none	 and I saw my duty sun clear 
5224-35439-0009	train-other-500	as Saul saw his on the way to Damascus I stopped the carriage got out and after a few minutes conversation persuaded two of the public women to get into the brougham with me If Jesus was right then these two unfortunates were my sisters
5224-35439-0010	train-other-500	and the only hope of their purification was in my affection and tenderness I live in one of the loveliest localities of San Francisco The house in which I live cost a hundred thousand dollars and its furnishings books and works of art cost as much more
5224-35439-0011	train-other-500	The house is a mansion No it is a palace wherein there are many servants I never knew what palaces were good for I had thought they were to live in But now I know I took the two women of the street to my palace
5224-35439-0012	train-other-500	and they are going to stay with me I hope to fill every room in my palace with such sisters as they The audience had been growing more and more restless and unsettled and the faces of those that sat on the platform had been betraying greater and greater dismay and consternation
none	none	 And at this point Bishop Dickinson arose and with an expression of disgust on his face 
5224-35439-0013	train-other-500	fled from the platform and the hall But Bishop Morehouse oblivious to all his eyes filled with his vision continued
none	none	 Oh sisters and brothers in this act of mine I find the solution of all my difficulties I didn t know what broughams were made for but now I know 
5224-35439-0014	train-other-500	They are made to carry the weak the sick and the aged they are made to show honor to those who have lost the sense even of shame I did not know what palaces were made for but now I have found a use for them The palaces of the Church should be hospitals
5224-35439-0015	train-other-500	and nurseries for those who have fallen by the wayside and are perishing He made a long pause plainly overcome by the thought that was in him and nervous how best to express it I am not fit dear brethren
5224-35439-0016	train-other-500	to tell you anything about morality I have lived in shame and hypocrisies too long to be able to help others but my action with those women sisters of mine shows me that the better way is easy to find To those who believe in Jesus and his gospel
5224-35439-0017	train-other-500	there can be no other relation between man and man than the relation of affection Love alone is stronger than sin stronger than death I therefore say to the rich among you that it is their duty to do what I have done and am doing
5224-35439-0018	train-other-500	Let each one of you who is prosperous take into his house some thief and treat him as his brother some unfortunate and treat her as his sister and San Francisco will need no police force and no magistrates the prisons will be turned into hospitals
5224-35439-0019	train-other-500	and the criminal will disappear with his crime We must give ourselves and not our money alone We must do as Christ did that is the message of the Church today
none	none	 We have wandered far from the Master s teaching We are consumed in our own flesh pots 
5224-35439-0020	train-other-500	We have put mammon in the place of Christ I have here a poem that tells the whole story I should like to read it to you
none	none	 It was written by an erring soul who yet saw clearly It must not be mistaken for an attack upon the Catholic Church 
5224-35439-0021	train-other-500	It is an attack upon all churches upon the pomp and splendor of all churches that have wandered from the Master s path and hedged themselves in from his lambs Here it is The silver trumpets rang across the Dome
5224-35439-0022	train-other-500	The people knelt upon the ground with awe And borne upon the necks of men I saw Like some great God the Holy Lord of Rome Priest like he wore a robe more white than foam
5224-35439-0023	train-other-500	And king like swathed himself in royal red Three crowns of gold rose high upon his head In splendor and in light the Pope passed home My heart stole back across wide wastes of years To One who wandered by a lonely sea
none	none	 And sought in vain for any place of rest Foxes have holes and every bird its nest I only I must wander wearily And bruise my feet and drink wine salt with tears Oscar Wilde one of the lords of language of the nineteenth century of the Christian Era The audience was agitated but unresponsive Yet Bishop Morehouse was not aware of it He held steadily on his way And so I say to the rich among you and to all the rich 
5224-35439-0024	train-other-500	that bitterly you oppress the Master s lambs
none	none	 You have hardened your hearts You have closed your ears to the voices that are crying in the land 
5224-35439-0025	train-other-500	the voices of pain and sorrow that you will not hear but that some day will be heard And so I say But at this point H H Jones and Philip Ward who had already risen from their chairs led the Bishop off the platform while the audience sat breathless and shocked
5224-35439-0026	train-other-500	Ernest laughed harshly and savagely when he had gained the street His laughter jarred upon me My heart seemed ready to burst with suppressed tears He has delivered his message Ernest cried The manhood and the deep hidden tender nature of their Bishop burst out
5224-35439-0027	train-other-500	and his Christian audience that loved him concluded that he was crazy Did you see them leading him so solicitously from the platform There must have been laughter in hell at the spectacle Nevertheless it will make a great impression what the Bishop did and said to night I said
5224-35439-0028	train-other-500	Think so Ernest queried mockingly It will make a sensation I asserted Didn t you see the reporters scribbling like mad while he was speaking Not a line of which will appear in to morrow s papers I can t believe it I cried
5224-35439-0029	train-other-500	Just wait and see was the answer Not a line not a thought that he uttered The daily press The daily suppressage
none	none	 But the reporters I objected 
5224-35439-0030	train-other-500	I saw them Not a word that he uttered will see print You have forgotten the editors They draw their salaries for the policy they maintain Their policy is to print nothing that is a vital menace to the established
5224-35439-0031	train-other-500	The Bishop s utterance was a violent assault upon the established morality It was heresy They led him from the platform to prevent him from uttering more heresy The newspapers will purge his heresy in the oblivion of silence The press of the United States
5224-35439-0032	train-other-500	It is a parasitic growth that battens on the capitalist class Its function is to serve the established by moulding public opinion and right well it serves it Let me prophesy
5224-35439-0033	train-other-500	To morrow s papers will merely mention that the Bishop is in poor health that he has been working too hard and that he broke down last night The next mention some days hence will be to the effect that he is suffering from nervous prostration
none	none	 and has been given a vacation by his grateful flock 
5224-35439-0034	train-other-500	After that one of two things will happen either the Bishop will see the error of his way and return from his vacation a well man in whose eyes there are no more visions or else he will persist in his madness and then you may expect to see in the papers
5224-35439-0035	train-other-500	couched pathetically and tenderly the announcement of his insanity After that
none	none	 he will be left to gibber his visions to padded walls 
5224-35439-0036	train-other-500	Now there you go too far I cried out In the eyes of society it will truly be insanity he replied What honest man who is not insane would take lost women and thieves into his house to dwell with him sisterly and brotherly
5224-35439-0037	train-other-500	True Christ died between two thieves but that is another story Insanity The mental processes of the man with whom one disagrees are always wrong Therefore the mind of the man is wrong Where is the line between wrong mind and insane mind
none	none	 It is inconceivable that any sane man can radically disagree with one s most sane conclusions There is a good example of it in this evening s paper Mary McKenna lives south of Market Street She is a poor but honest woman She is also patriotic 
5224-35439-0039	train-other-500	But she has erroneous ideas concerning the American flag and the protection it is supposed to symbolize And here s what happened to her
none	none	 Her husband had an accident and was laid up in hospital three months 
5224-35439-0040	train-other-500	In spite of taking in washing she got behind in her rent Yesterday they evicted her But first she hoisted an American flag and from under its folds she announced that by virtue of its protection they could not turn her out on to the cold street What was done
5224-35439-0041	train-other-500	She was arrested and arraigned for insanity To day she was examined by the regular insanity experts She was found insane She was consigned to the Napa Asylum
none	none	 But that is far fetched I objected 
5224-35439-0042	train-other-500	Suppose I should disagree with everybody about the literary style of a book They wouldn t send me to an asylum for that Very true he replied But such divergence of opinion would constitute no menace to society Therein lies the difference
none	none	 The divergence of opinion on the parts of Mary McKenna and the Bishop do menace society What if all the poor people should refuse to pay rent and shelter themselves under the American flag Landlordism would go crumbling 
5224-35439-0044	train-other-500	The Bishop s views are just as perilous to society Ergo to the asylum with him
none	none	 But still I refused to believe 
5224-35439-0045	train-other-500	Wait and see Ernest said and I waited Next morning I sent out for all the papers So far Ernest was right Not a word that Bishop Morehouse had uttered was in print Mention was made in one or two of the papers that he had been overcome by his feelings
5224-35439-0046	train-other-500	Yet the platitudes of the speakers that followed him were reported at length Several days later the brief announcement was made that he had gone away on a vacation to recover from the effects of overwork
none	none	 So far so good but there had been no hint of insanity nor even of nervous collapse Little did I dream the terrible road the Bishop was destined to travel the Gethsemane and crucifixion that Ernest had pondered about CHAPTER VIII THE MACHINE BREAKERS It was just before Ernest ran for Congress on the socialist ticket that father gave what he privately called his Profit and Loss dinner Ernest called it the dinner of the Machine Breakers In point of fact it was merely a dinner for business men small business men of course I doubt if one of them was interested in any business the total capitalization of which exceeded a couple of hundred thousand dollars They were truly representative middle class business men There was Owen of Silverberg Owen Company a large grocery firm with several branch stores We bought our groceries from them There were both partners of the big drug firm of Kowalt Washburn and mister Asmunsen the owner of a large granite quarry in Contra Costa County And there were many similar men owners or part owners in small factories small businesses and small industries small capitalists in short They were shrewd faced interesting men and they talked with simplicity and clearness Their unanimous complaint was against the corporations and trusts Their creed was Bust the Trusts All oppression originated in the trusts and one and all told the same tale of woe They advocated government ownership of such trusts as the railroads and telegraphs and excessive income taxes graduated with ferocity to destroy large accumulations Likewise they advocated as a cure for local ills municipal ownership of such public utilities as water gas telephones and street railways Especially interesting was mister Asmunsen s narrative of his tribulations as a quarry owner He confessed that he never made any profits out of his quarry and this in spite of the enormous volume of business that had been caused by the destruction of San Francisco by the big earthquake For six years the rebuilding of San Francisco had been going on and his business had quadrupled and octupled and yet he was no better off The railroad knows my business just a little bit better than I do he said It knows my operating expenses to a cent and it knows the terms of my contracts How it knows these things I can only guess It must have spies in my employ and it must have access to the parties to all my contracts For look you when I place a big contract the terms of which favor me a goodly profit the freight rate from my quarry to market is promptly raised No explanation is made The railroad gets my profit Under such circumstances I have never succeeded in getting the railroad to reconsider its raise On the other hand when there have been accidents increased expenses of operating or contracts with less profitable terms I have always succeeded in getting the railroad to lower its rate What is the result Large or small the railroad always gets my profits What remains to you over and above Ernest interrupted to ask would roughly be the equivalent of your salary as a manager did the railroad own the quarry The very thing mister Asmunsen replied Only a short time ago I had my books gone through for the past ten years I discovered that for those ten years my gain was just equivalent to a manager s salary The railroad might just as well have owned my quarry and hired me to run it But with this difference Ernest laughed the railroad would have had to assume all the risk which you so obligingly assumed for it Very true mister Asmunsen answered sadly Having let them have they say Ernest began asking questions right and left He began with mister Owen You started a branch store here in Berkeley about six months ago Yes mister Owen answered And since then I ve noticed that three little corner groceries have gone out of business Was your branch store the cause of it mister Owen affirmed with a complacent smile They had no chance against us Why not We had greater capital With a large business there is always less waste and greater efficiency And your branch store absorbed the profits of the three small ones I see But tell me what became of the owners of the three stores One is driving a delivery wagon for us I don t know what happened to the other two Ernest turned abruptly on mister Kowalt You sell a great deal at cut rates What have become of the owners of the small drug stores that you forced to the wall A lowering of selling price to cost and even to less than cost Thus a large company could sell at a loss for a longer period than a small company and so drive the small company out of business A common device of competition One of them mister Haasfurther has charge now of our prescription department was the answer And you absorbed the profits they had been making Surely That is what we are in business for And you Ernest said suddenly to mister Asmunsen You are disgusted because the railroad has absorbed your profits mister Asmunsen nodded What you want is to make profits yourself Again mister Asmunsen nodded Out of others There was no answer Out of others Ernest insisted That is the way profits are made mister Asmunsen replied curtly Then the business game is to make profits out of others and to prevent others from making profits out of you That s it isn t it Ernest had to repeat his question before mister Asmunsen gave an answer and then he said Yes that s it except that we do not object to the others making profits so long as they are not extortionate By extortionate you mean large yet you do not object to making large profits yourself Surely not And mister Asmunsen amiably confessed to the weakness There was one other man who was quizzed by Ernest at this juncture a mister Calvin who had once been a great dairy owner Some time ago you were fighting the Milk Trust Ernest said to him and now you are in Grange politics How did it happen Many efforts were made during this period to organize the perishing farmer class into a political party the aim of which was destroy the trusts and corporations by drastic legislation All such attempts ended in failure Oh I haven t quit the fight mister Calvin answered and he looked belligerent enough I m fighting the Trust on the only field where it is possible to fight the political field Let me show you A few years ago we dairymen had everything our own way But you competed among yourselves Ernest interrupted Yes that was what kept the profits down We did try to organize but independent dairymen always broke through us Then came the Milk Trust Financed by surplus capital from Standard Oil Ernest said The first successful great trust almost a generation in advance of the rest Yes mister Calvin acknowledged But we did not know it at the time Its agents approached us with a club Come in and be fat was their proposition or stay out and starve Most of us came in Those that didn t starved Oh it paid us at first Milk was raised a cent a quart One quarter of this cent came to us Three quarters of it went to the Trust Then milk was raised another cent only we didn t get any of that cent Our complaints were useless The Trust was in control We discovered that we were pawns Finally the additional quarter of a cent was denied us Then the Trust began to squeeze us out What could we do We were squeezed out There were no dairymen only a Milk Trust But with milk two cents higher I should think you could have competed Ernest suggested slyly So we thought We tried it mister Calvin paused a moment It broke us The Trust could put milk upon the market more cheaply than we It could sell still at a slight profit when we were selling at actual loss I dropped fifty thousand dollars in that venture Most of us went bankrupt The dairymen were wiped out of existence Bankruptcy a peculiar institution that enabled an individual who had failed in competitive industry to forego paying his debts The effect was to ameliorate the too savage conditions of the fang and claw social struggle So the Trust took your profits away from you Ernest said and you ve gone into politics in order to legislate the Trust out of existence and get the profits back mister Calvin s face lighted up That is precisely what I say in my speeches to the farmers That s our whole idea in a nutshell And yet the Trust produces milk more cheaply than could the independent dairymen Ernest queried Why shouldn t it with the splendid organization and new machinery its large capital makes possible There is no discussion Ernest answered It certainly should and furthermore it does mister Calvin here launched out into a political speech in exposition of his views He was warmly followed by a number of the others and the cry of all was to destroy the trusts Poor simple folk Ernest said to me in an undertone They see clearly as far as they see but they see only to the ends of their noses A little later he got the floor again and in his characteristic way controlled it for the rest of the evening I have listened carefully to all of you he began and I see plainly that you play the business game in the orthodox fashion Life sums itself up to you in profits You have a firm and abiding belief that you were created for the sole purpose of making profits Only there is a hitch In the midst of your own profit making along comes the trust and takes your profits away from you This is a dilemma that interferes somehow with the aim of creation and the only way out as it seems to you is to destroy that which takes from you your profits I have listened carefully and there is only one name that will epitomize you I shall call you that name You are machine breakers Do you know what a machine breaker is Let me tell you In the eighteenth century in England men and women wove cloth on hand looms in their own cottages It was a slow clumsy and costly way of weaving cloth this cottage system of manufacture Along came the steam engine and labor saving machinery A thousand looms assembled in a large factory and driven by a central engine wove cloth vastly more cheaply than could the cottage weavers on their hand looms Here in the factory was combination and before it competition faded away The men and women who had worked the hand looms for themselves now went into the factories and worked the machine looms not for themselves but for the capitalist owners Furthermore little children went to work on the machine looms at lower wages and displaced the men This made hard times for the men Their standard of living fell They starved And they said it was all the fault of the machines Therefore they proceeded to break the machines They did not succeed and they were very stupid Yet you have not learned their lesson Here are you a century and a half later trying to break machines By your own confession the trust machines do the work more efficiently and more cheaply than you can That is why you cannot compete with them And yet you would break those machines You are even more stupid than the stupid workmen of England And while you maunder about restoring competition the trusts go on destroying you One and all you tell the same story the passing away of competition and the coming on of combination You mister Owen destroyed competition here in Berkeley when your branch store drove the three small groceries out of business Your combination was more effective Yet you feel the pressure of other combinations on you the trust combinations and you cry out It is because you are not a trust If you were a grocery trust for the whole United States you would be singing another song And the song would be Blessed are the trusts And yet again not only is your small combination not a trust but you are aware yourself of its lack of strength You are beginning to divine your own end You feel yourself and your branch stores a pawn in the game You see the powerful interests rising and growing more powerful day by day you feel their mailed hands descending upon your profits and taking a pinch here and a pinch there the railroad trust the oil trust the steel trust the coal trust and you know that in the end they will destroy you take away from you the last per cent of your little profits You sir are a poor gamester When you squeezed out the three small groceries here in Berkeley by virtue of your superior combination you swelled out your chest talked about efficiency and enterprise and sent your wife to Europe on the profits you had gained by eating up the three small groceries It is dog eat dog and you ate them up But on the other hand you are being eaten up in turn by the bigger dogs wherefore you squeal And what I say to you is true of all of you at this table You are all squealing You are all playing the losing game and you are all squealing about it But when you squeal you don t state the situation flatly as I have stated it You don t say that you like to squeeze profits out of others and that you are making all the row because others are squeezing your profits out of you No you are too cunning for that You say something else You make small capitalist political speeches such as mister Calvin made What did he say Here are a few of his phrases I caught Our original principles are all right What this country requires is a return to fundamental American methods free opportunity for all The spirit of liberty in which this nation was born Let us return to the principles of our forefathers When he says free opportunity for all he means free opportunity to squeeze profits which freedom of opportunity is now denied him by the great trusts And the absurd thing about it is that you have repeated these phrases so often that you believe them You want opportunity to plunder your fellow men in your own small way but you hypnotize yourselves into thinking you want freedom You are piggish and acquisitive but the magic of your phrases leads you to believe that you are patriotic Your desire for profits which is sheer selfishness you metamorphose into altruistic solicitude for suffering humanity Come on now right here amongst ourselves and be honest for once Look the matter in the face and state it in direct terms There were flushed and angry faces at the table and withal a measure of awe They were a little frightened at this smooth faced young fellow and the swing and smash of his words and his dreadful trait of calling a spade a spade mister Calvin promptly replied And why not he demanded Why can we not return to ways of our fathers when this republic was founded You have spoken much truth mister Everhard unpalatable though it has been But here amongst ourselves let us speak out Let us throw off all disguise and accept the truth as mister Everhard has flatly stated it It is true that we smaller capitalists are after profits and that the trusts are taking our profits away from us It is true that we want to destroy the trusts in order that our profits may remain to us And why can we not do it Why not I say why not Ah now we come to the gist of the matter Ernest said with a pleased expression I ll try to tell you why not though the telling will be rather hard You see you fellows have studied business in a small way but you have not studied social evolution at all You are in the midst of a transition stage now in economic evolution but you do not understand it and that s what causes all the confusion Why cannot you return Because you can t You can no more make water run up hill than can you cause the tide of economic evolution to flow back in its channel along the way it came Joshua made the sun stand still upon Gibeon but you would outdo Joshua You would make the sun go backward in the sky You would have time retrace its steps from noon to morning In the face of labor saving machinery of organized production of the increased efficiency of combination you would set the economic sun back a whole generation or so to the time when there were no great capitalists no great machinery no railroads a time when a host of little capitalists warred with each other in economic anarchy and when production was primitive wasteful unorganized and costly Believe me Joshua s task was easier and he had Jehovah to help him But God has forsaken you small capitalists The sun of the small capitalists is setting It will never rise again Nor is it in your power even to make it stand still You are perishing and you are doomed to perish utterly from the face of society This is the fiat of evolution It is the word of God Combination is stronger than competition Primitive man was a puny creature hiding in the crevices of the rocks He combined and made war upon his carnivorous enemies They were competitive beasts Primitive man was a combinative beast and because of it he rose to primacy over all the animals And man has been achieving greater and greater combinations ever since It is combination versus competition a thousand centuries long struggle in which competition has always been worsted Whoso enlists on the side of competition perishes But the trusts themselves arose out of competition mister Calvin interrupted Very true Ernest answered And the trusts themselves destroyed competition That by your own word is why you are no longer in the dairy business The first laughter of the evening went around the table and even mister Calvin joined in the laugh against himself And now while we are on the trusts Ernest went on let us settle a few things I shall make certain statements and if you disagree with them speak up Silence will mean agreement Is it not true that a machine loom will weave more cloth and weave more cheaply than a hand loom He paused but nobody spoke up Is it not then highly irrational to break the machine loom and go back to the clumsy and more costly hand loom method of weaving Heads nodded in acquiescence Is it not true that that known as a trust produces more efficiently and cheaply than can a thousand competing small concerns Still no one objected Then is it not irrational to destroy that cheap and efficient combination No one answered for a long time Then mister Kowalt spoke What are we to do then he demanded To destroy the trusts is the only way we can see to escape their domination Ernest was all fire and aliveness on the instant I ll show you another way he cried Let us not destroy those wonderful machines that produce efficiently and cheaply Let us control them Let us profit by their efficiency and cheapness Let us run them for ourselves Let us oust the present owners of the wonderful machines and let us own the wonderful machines ourselves That gentlemen is socialism a greater combination than the trusts a greater economic and social combination than any that has as yet appeared on the planet It is in line with evolution We meet combination with greater combination It is the winning side Come on over with us socialists and play on the winning side Here arose dissent There was a shaking of heads and mutterings arose All right then you prefer to be anachronisms Ernest laughed You prefer to play atavistic roles You are doomed to perish as all atavisms perish Have you ever asked what will happen to you when greater combinations than even the present trusts arise Have you ever considered where you will stand when the great trusts themselves combine into the combination of combinations into the social economic and political trust He turned abruptly and irrelevantly upon mister Calvin Tell me Ernest said if this is not true You are compelled to form a new political party because the old parties are in the hands of the trusts The chief obstacle to your Grange propaganda is the trusts Behind every obstacle you encounter every blow that smites you every defeat that you receive is the hand of the trusts Is this not so Tell me mister Calvin sat in uncomfortable silence Go ahead Ernest encouraged It is true mister Calvin confessed We captured the state legislature of Oregon and put through splendid protective legislation and it was vetoed by the governor who was a creature of the trusts We elected a governor of Colorado and the legislature refused to permit him to take office Twice we have passed a national income tax and each time the supreme court smashed it as unconstitutional The courts are in the hands of the trusts We the people do not pay our judges sufficiently But there will come a time When the combination of the trusts will control all legislation when the combination of the trusts will itself be the government Ernest interrupted Never never were the cries that arose Everybody was excited and belligerent Tell me Ernest demanded what will you do when such a time comes We will rise in our strength mister Asmunsen cried and many voices backed his decision That will be civil war Ernest warned them So be it civil war was mister Asmunsen s answer with the cries of all the men at the table behind him We have not forgotten the deeds of our forefathers For our liberties we are ready to fight and die Ernest smiled Do not forget he said that we had tacitly agreed that liberty in your case gentlemen means liberty to squeeze profits out of others The table was angry now fighting angry but Ernest controlled the tumult and made himself heard One more question When you rise in your strength remember the reason for your rising will be that the government is in the hands of the trusts Therefore against your strength the government will turn the regular army the navy the militia the police in short the whole organized war machinery of the United States Where will your strength be then Dismay sat on their faces and before they could recover Ernest struck again Do you remember not so long ago when our regular army was only fifty thousand Year by year it has been increased until to day it is three hundred thousand Again he struck Nor is that all While you diligently pursued that favorite phantom of yours called profits and moralized about that favorite fetich of yours called competition even greater and more direful things have been accomplished by combination There is the militia It is our strength cried mister Kowalt With it we would repel the invasion of the regular army You would go into the militia yourself was Ernest s retort and be sent to Maine or Florida or the Philippines or anywhere else to drown in blood your own comrades civil warring for their liberties While from Kansas or Wisconsin or any other state your own comrades would go into the militia and come here to California to drown in blood your own civil warring Now they were really shocked and they sat wordless until mister Owen murmured We would not go into the militia That would settle it We would not be so foolish Ernest laughed outright You do not understand the combination that has been effected You could not help yourself You would be drafted into the militia There is such a thing as civil law mister Owen insisted Not when the government suspends civil law In that day when you speak of rising in your strength your strength would be turned against yourself Into the militia you would go willy nilly Habeas corpus I heard some one mutter just now Instead of habeas corpus you would get post mortems If you refused to go into the militia or to obey after you were in you would be tried by drumhead court martial and shot down like dogs It is the law It is not the law mister Calvin asserted positively There is no such law Young man you have dreamed all this Why you spoke of sending the militia to the Philippines That is unconstitutional The Constitution especially states that the militia cannot be sent out of the country What s the Constitution got to do with it Ernest demanded The courts interpret the Constitution and the courts as mister Asmunsen agreed are the creatures of the trusts Besides it is as I have said the law It has been the law for years for nine years gentlemen That we can be drafted into the militia mister Calvin asked incredulously That they can shoot us by drumhead court martial if we refuse Yes Ernest answered precisely that How is it that we have never heard of this law my father asked and I could see that it was likewise new to him For two reasons Ernest said First there has been no need to enforce it If there had you d have heard of it soon enough And secondly the law was rushed through Congress and the Senate secretly with practically no discussion Of course the newspapers made no mention of it But we socialists knew about it We published it in our papers But you never read our papers I still insist you are dreaming mister Calvin said stubbornly The country would never have permitted it But the country did permit it Ernest replied And as for my dreaming he put his hand in his pocket and drew out a small pamphlet tell me if this looks like dream stuff He opened it and began to read Section One be it enacted and so forth and so forth that the militia shall consist of every able bodied male citizen of the respective states territories and District of Columbia who is more than eighteen and less than forty five years of age Section Seven that any officer or enlisted man remember Section One gentlemen you are all enlisted men that any enlisted man of the militia who shall refuse or neglect to present himself to such mustering officer upon being called forth as herein prescribed shall be subject to trial by court martial and shall be punished as such court martial shall direct Section Eight that courts martial for the trial of officers or men of the militia shall be composed of militia officers only Section Nine that the militia when called into the actual service of the United States shall be subject to the same rules and articles of war as the regular troops of the United States There you are gentlemen American citizens and fellow militiamen Nine years ago we socialists thought that law was aimed against labor But it would seem that it was aimed against you too Congressman Wiley in the brief discussion that was permitted said that the bill provided for a reserve force to take the mob by the throat you re the mob gentlemen and protect at all hazards life liberty and property And in the time to come when you rise in your strength remember that you will be rising against the property of the trusts and the liberty of the trusts according to the law to squeeze you Your teeth are pulled gentlemen Your claws are trimmed In the day you rise in your strength toothless and clawless you will be as harmless as any army of clams I don t believe it Kowalt cried There is no such law It is a canard got up by you socialists This bill was introduced in the House of Representatives on July thirty nineteen oh two was the reply It was introduced by Representative Dick of Ohio It was rushed through It was passed unanimously by the Senate on January fourteen nineteen oh three And just seven days afterward was approved by the President of the United States Everhard was right in the essential particulars though his date of the introduction of the bill is in error The bill was introduced on June thirty and not on July thirty The Congressional Record is here in Ardis and a reference to it shows mention of the bill on the following dates June thirty December nine fifteen sixteen and seventeen nineteen oh two and January seven and fourteen nineteen oh three The ignorance evidenced by the business men at the dinner was nothing unusual Very few people knew of the existence of this law E Untermann a revolutionist in July nineteen oh three published a pamphlet at Girard Kansas on the Militia Bill This pamphlet had a small circulation among workingmen but already had the segregation of classes proceeded so far that the members of the middle class never heard of the pamphlet at all and so remained in ignorance of the law CHAPTER IX THE MATHEMATICS OF A DREAM In the midst of the consternation his revelation had produced Ernest began again to speak You have said a dozen of you to night that socialism is impossible You have asserted the impossible now let me demonstrate the inevitable Not only is it inevitable that you small capitalists shall pass away but it is inevitable that the large capitalists and the trusts also shall pass away Remember the tide of evolution never flows backward It flows on and on and it flows from competition to combination and from little combination to large combination and from large combination to colossal combination and it flows on to socialism which is the most colossal combination of all You tell me that I dream Very good I ll give you the mathematics of my dream and here in advance I challenge you to show that my mathematics are wrong I shall develop the inevitability of the breakdown of the capitalist system and I shall demonstrate mathematically why it must break down Here goes and bear with me if at first I seem irrelevant Let us first of all investigate a particular industrial process and whenever I state something with which you disagree please interrupt me Here is a shoe factory This factory takes leather and makes it into shoes Here is one hundred dollars worth of leather It goes through the factory and comes out in the form of shoes worth let us say two hundred dollars What has happened One hundred dollars has been added to the value of the leather How was it added Let us see Capital and labor added this value of one hundred dollars Capital furnished the factory the machines and paid all the expenses Labor furnished labor By the joint effort of capital and labor one hundred dollars of value was added Are you all agreed so far Heads nodded around the table in affirmation Labor and capital having produced this one hundred dollars now proceed to divide it The statistics of this division are fractional so let us for the sake of convenience make them roughly approximate Capital takes fifty dollars as its share and labor gets in wages fifty dollars as its share We will not enter into the squabbling over the division No matter how much squabbling takes place in one percentage or another the division is arranged And take notice here that what is true of this particular industrial process is true of all industrial processes Am I right Everhard here clearly develops the cause of all the labor troubles of that time In the division of the joint product capital wanted all it could get and labor wanted all it could get This quarrel over the division was irreconcilable So long as the system of capitalistic production existed labor and capital continued to quarrel over the division of the joint product It is a ludicrous spectacle to us but we must not forget that we have seven centuries advantage over those that lived in that time Again the whole table agreed with Ernest Now suppose labor having received its fifty dollars wanted to buy back shoes It could only buy back fifty dollars worth That s clear isn t it And now we shift from this particular process to the sum total of all industrial processes in the United States which includes the leather itself raw material transportation selling everything We will say for the sake of round figures that the total production of wealth in the United States is one year is four billion dollars Then labor has received in wages during the same period two billion dollars Four billion dollars has been produced How much of this can labor buy back Two billions There is no discussion of this I am sure For that matter my percentages are mild Because of a thousand capitalistic devices labor cannot buy back even half of the total product But to return We will say labor buys back two billions Then it stands to reason that labor can consume only two billions There are still two billions to be accounted for which labor cannot buy back and consume Labor does not consume its two billions even mister Kowalt spoke up If it did it would not have any deposits in the savings banks Labor s deposits in the savings banks are only a sort of reserve fund that is consumed as fast as it accumulates These deposits are saved for old age for sickness and accident and for funeral expenses The savings bank deposit is simply a piece of the loaf put back on the shelf to be eaten next day No labor consumes all of the total product that its wages will buy back Two billions are left to capital After it has paid its expenses does it consume the remainder Does capital consume all of its two billions Ernest stopped and put the question point blank to a number of the men They shook their heads I don t know one of them frankly said Of course you do Ernest went on Stop and think a moment If capital consumed its share the sum total of capital could not increase It would remain constant If you will look at the economic history of the United States you will see that the sum total of capital has continually increased Therefore capital does not consume its share Do you remember when England owned so much of our railroad bonds As the years went by we bought back those bonds What does that mean That part of capital s unconsumed share bought back the bonds What is the meaning of the fact that to day the capitalists of the United States own hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars of Mexican bonds Russian bonds Italian bonds Grecian bonds The meaning is that those hundreds and hundreds of millions were part of capital s share which capital did not consume Furthermore from the very beginning of the capitalist system capital has never consumed all of its share And now we come to the point Four billion dollars of wealth is produced in one year in the United States Labor buys back and consumes two billions Capital does not consume the remaining two billions There is a large balance left over unconsumed What is done with this balance What can be done with it Labor cannot consume any of it for labor has already spent all its wages Capital will not consume this balance because already according to its nature it has consumed all it can And still remains the balance What can be done with it What is done with it It is sold abroad mister Kowalt volunteered The very thing Ernest agreed Because of this balance arises our need for a foreign market This is sold abroad It has to be sold abroad There is no other way of getting rid of it And that unconsumed surplus sold abroad becomes what we call our favorable balance of trade Are we all agreed so far Surely it is a waste of time to elaborate these A B C s of commerce mister Calvin said tartly We all understand them And it is by these A B C s I have so carefully elaborated that I shall confound you Ernest retorted There s the beauty of it And I m going to confound you with them right now Here goes The United States is a capitalist country that has developed its resources According to its capitalist system of industry it has an unconsumed surplus that must be got rid of and that must be got rid of abroad What is true of the United States is true of every other capitalist country with developed resources Every one of such countries has an unconsumed surplus Don t forget that they have already traded with one another and that these surpluses yet remain Labor in all these countries has spent it wages and cannot buy any of the surpluses Capital in all these countries has already consumed all it is able according to its nature And still remain the surpluses They cannot dispose of these surpluses to one another How are they going to get rid of them Theodore Roosevelt President of the United States a few years prior to this time made the following public declaration A more liberal and extensive reciprocity in the purchase and sale of commodities is necessary so that the overproduction of the United States can be satisfactorily disposed of to foreign countries Of course this overproduction he mentions was the profits of the capitalist system over and beyond the consuming power of the capitalists It was at this time that Senator Mark Hanna said The production of wealth in the United States is one third larger annually than its consumption Also a fellow Senator Chauncey Depew said The American people produce annually two billions more wealth than they consume Sell them to countries with undeveloped resources mister Kowalt suggested The very thing You see my argument is so clear and simple that in your own minds you carry it on for me And now for the next step Suppose the United States disposes of its surplus to a country with undeveloped resources like say Brazil Remember this surplus is over and above trade which articles of trade have been consumed What then does the United States get in return from Brazil Gold said mister Kowalt But there is only so much gold and not much of it in the world Ernest objected Gold in the form of securities and bonds and so forth mister Kowalt amended Now you ve struck it Ernest said From Brazil the United States in return for her surplus gets bonds and securities And what does that mean It means that the United States is coming to own railroads in Brazil factories mines and lands in Brazil And what is the meaning of that in turn mister Kowalt pondered and shook his head I ll tell you Ernest continued It means that the resources of Brazil are being developed And now the next point When Brazil under the capitalist system has developed her resources she will herself have an unconsumed surplus Can she get rid of this surplus to the United States No because the United States has herself a surplus Can the United States do what she previously did get rid of her surplus to Brazil No for Brazil now has a surplus too What happens The United States and Brazil must both seek out other countries with undeveloped resources in order to unload the surpluses on them But by the very process of unloading the surpluses the resources of those countries are in turn developed Soon they have surpluses and are seeking other countries on which to unload Now gentlemen follow me The planet is only so large There are only so many countries in the world What will happen when every country in the world down to the smallest and last with a surplus in its hands stands confronting every other country with surpluses in their hands He paused and regarded his listeners The bepuzzlement in their faces was delicious Also there was awe in their faces Out of abstractions Ernest had conjured a vision and made them see it They were seeing it then as they sat there and they were frightened by it We started with A B C mister Calvin Ernest said slyly I have now given you the rest of the alphabet It is very simple That is the beauty of it You surely have the answer forthcoming What then when every country in the world has an unconsumed surplus Where will your capitalist system be then But mister Calvin shook a troubled head He was obviously questing back through Ernest s reasoning in search of an error Let me briefly go over the ground with you again Ernest said We began with a particular industrial process the shoe factory We found that the division of the joint product that took place there was similar to the division that took place in the sum total of all industrial processes We found that labor could buy back with its wages only so much of the product and that capital did not consume all of the remainder of the product We found that when labor had consumed to the full extent of its wages and when capital had consumed all it wanted there was still left an unconsumed surplus We agreed that this surplus could only be disposed of abroad We agreed also that the effect of unloading this surplus on another country would be to develop the resources of that country and that in a short time that country would have an unconsumed surplus We extended this process to all the countries on the planet till every country was producing every year and every day an unconsumed surplus which it could dispose of to no other country And now I ask you again what are we going to do with those surpluses Still no one answered mister Calvin Ernest queried It beats me mister Calvin confessed I never dreamed of such a thing mister Asmunsen said And yet it does seem clear as print It was the first time I had ever heard Karl Marx s doctrine of surplus value elaborated and Ernest had done it so simply that I too sat puzzled and dumbfounded Karl Marx the great intellectual hero of Socialism A German Jew of the nineteenth century A contemporary of John Stuart Mill It seems incredible to us that whole generations should have elapsed after the enunciation of Marx s economic discoveries in which time he was sneered at by the world s accepted thinkers and scholars Because of his discoveries he was banished from his native country and he died an exile in England I ll tell you a way to get rid of the surplus Ernest said Throw it into the sea Throw every year hundreds of millions of dollars worth of shoes and wheat and clothing and all the commodities of commerce into the sea Won t that fix it It will certainly fix it mister Calvin answered But it is absurd for you to talk that way Ernest was upon him like a flash Is it a bit more absurd than what you advocate you machine breaker returning to the antediluvian ways of your forefathers What do you propose in order to get rid of the surplus You would escape the problem of the surplus by not producing any surplus And how do you propose to avoid producing a surplus By returning to a primitive method of production so confused and disorderly and irrational so wasteful and costly that it will be impossible to produce a surplus mister Calvin swallowed The point had been driven home He swallowed again and cleared his throat You are right he said I stand convicted It is absurd But we ve got to do something It is a case of life and death for us of the middle class We refuse to perish We elect to be absurd and to return to the truly crude and wasteful methods of our forefathers We will put back industry to its pre trust stage We will break the machines And what are you going to do about it But you can t break the machines Ernest replied You cannot make the tide of evolution flow backward Opposed to you are two great forces each of which is more powerful than you of the middle class The large capitalists the trusts in short will not let you turn back They don t want the machines destroyed And greater than the trusts and more powerful is labor It will not let you destroy the machines The ownership of the world along with the machines lies between the trusts and labor That is the battle alignment Neither side wants the destruction of the machines But each side wants to possess the machines In this battle the middle class has no place The middle class is a pygmy between two giants Don t you see you poor perishing middle class you are caught between the upper and nether millstones and even now has the grinding begun I have demonstrated to you mathematically the inevitable breakdown of the capitalist system When every country stands with an unconsumed and unsalable surplus on its hands the capitalist system will break down under the terrific structure of profits that it itself has reared And in that day there won t be any destruction of the machines The struggle then will be for the ownership of the machines If labor wins your way will be easy The United States and the whole world for that matter will enter upon a new and tremendous era Instead of being crushed by the machines life will be made fairer and happier and nobler by them You of the destroyed middle class along with labor there will be nothing but labor then so you and all the rest of labor will participate in the equitable distribution of the products of the wonderful machines And we all of us will make new and more wonderful machines And there won t be any unconsumed surplus because there won t be any profits But suppose the trusts win in this battle over the ownership of the machines and the world mister Kowalt asked Then Ernest answered you and labor and all of us will be crushed under the iron heel of a despotism as relentless and terrible as any despotism that has blackened the pages of the history of man That will be a good name for that despotism the Iron Heel The earliest known use of that name to designate the Oligarchy There was a long pause and every man at the table meditated in ways unwonted and profound But this socialism of yours is a dream mister Calvin said and repeated a dream I ll show you something that isn t a dream then Ernest answered And that something I shall call the Oligarchy You call it the Plutocracy We both mean the same thing the large capitalists or the trusts Let us see where the power lies today And in order to do so let us apportion society into its class divisions There are three big classes in society First comes the Plutocracy which is composed of wealthy bankers railway magnates corporation directors and trust magnates Second is the middle class your class gentlemen which is composed of farmers merchants small manufacturers and professional men And third and last comes my class the proletariat which is composed of the wage workers This division of society made by Everhard is in accordance with that made by Lucien Sanial one of the statistical authorities of that time His calculation of the membership of these divisions by occupation from the United States Census of nineteen hundred is as follows Plutocratic class two hundred fifty thousand two hundred fifty one Middle class eight million four hundred twenty nine thousand eight hundred forty five and Proletariat class twenty million three hundred ninety three thousand one hundred thirty seven You cannot but grant that the ownership of wealth constitutes essential power in the United States to day How is this wealth owned by these three classes Here are the figures The Plutocracy owns sixty seven billions of wealth Of the total number of persons engaged in occupations in the United States only nine tenths of one per cent are from the Plutocracy yet the Plutocracy owns seventy per cent of the total wealth The middle class owns twenty four billions Twenty nine per cent of those in occupations are from the middle class and they own twenty five per cent of the total wealth Remains the proletariat It owns four billions Of all persons in occupations seventy per cent come from the proletariat and the proletariat owns four per cent of the total wealth Where does the power lie gentlemen From your own figures we of the middle class are more powerful than labor mister Asmunsen remarked Calling us weak does not make you stronger in the face of the strength of the Plutocracy Ernest retorted And furthermore I m not done with you There is a greater strength than wealth and it is greater because it cannot be taken away Our strength the strength of the proletariat is in our muscles in our hands to cast ballots in our fingers to pull triggers This strength we cannot be stripped of It is the primitive strength it is the strength that is to life germane it is the strength that is stronger than wealth and that wealth cannot take away But your strength is detachable It can be taken away from you Even now the Plutocracy is taking it away from you In the end it will take it all away from you And then you will cease to be the middle class You will descend to us You will become proletarians And the beauty of it is that you will then add to our strength We will hail you brothers and we will fight shoulder to shoulder in the cause of humanity You see labor has nothing concrete of which to be despoiled Its share of the wealth of the country consists of clothes and household furniture with here and there in very rare cases an unencumbered home But you have the concrete wealth twenty four billions of it and the Plutocracy will take it away from you Of course there is the large likelihood that the proletariat will take it away first Don t you see your position gentlemen The middle class is a wobbly little lamb between a lion and a tiger If one doesn t get you the other will And if the Plutocracy gets you first why it s only a matter of time when the Proletariat gets the Plutocracy Even your present wealth is not a true measure of your power The strength of your wealth at this moment is only an empty shell That is why you are crying out your feeble little battle cry Return to the ways of our fathers You are aware of your impotency You know that your strength is an empty shell And I ll show you the emptiness of it What power have the farmers Over fifty per cent are thralls by virtue of the fact that they are merely tenants or are mortgaged And all of them are thralls by virtue of the fact that the trusts already own or control which is the same thing only better own and control all the means of marketing the crops such as cold storage railroads elevators and steamship lines And furthermore the trusts control the markets In all this the farmers are without power As regards their political and governmental power I ll take that up later along with the political and governmental power of the whole middle class Day by day the trusts squeeze out the farmers as they squeezed out mister Calvin and the rest of the dairymen And day by day are the merchants squeezed out in the same way Do you remember how in six months the Tobacco Trust squeezed out over four hundred cigar stores in New York City alone Where are the old time owners of the coal fields You know today without my telling you that the Railroad Trust owns or controls the entire anthracite and bituminous coal fields Doesn t the Standard Oil Trust own a score of the ocean lines And does it not also control copper to say nothing of running a smelter trust as a little side enterprise There are ten thousand cities in the United States to night lighted by the companies owned or controlled by Standard Oil and in as many cities all the electric transportation urban suburban and interurban is in the hands of Standard Oil The small capitalists who were in these thousands of enterprises are gone You know that It s the same way that you are going Standard Oil and Rockefeller see upcoming footnote Rockefeller began as a member The small manufacturer is like the farmer and small manufacturers and farmers to day are reduced to all intents and purposes to feudal tenure For that matter the professional men and the artists are at this present moment villeins in everything but name while the politicians are henchmen Why do you mister Calvin work all your nights and days to organize the farmers along with the rest of the middle class into a new political party Because the politicians of the old parties will have nothing to do with your atavistic ideas and with your atavistic ideas they will have nothing to do because they are what I said they are henchmen retainers of the Plutocracy I spoke of the professional men and the artists as villeins What else are they One and all the professors the preachers and the editors hold their jobs by serving the Plutocracy and their service consists of propagating only such ideas as are either harmless to or commendatory of the Plutocracy Whenever they propagate ideas that menace the Plutocracy they lose their jobs in which case if they have not provided for the rainy day they descend into the proletariat and either perish or become working class agitators And don t forget that it is the press the pulpit and the university that mould public opinion set the thought pace of the nation As for the artists they merely pander to the little less than ignoble tastes of the Plutocracy But after all wealth in itself is not the real power it is the means to power and power is governmental Who controls the government to day The proletariat with its twenty millions engaged in occupations Even you laugh at the idea Does the middle class with its eight million occupied members No more than the proletariat Who then controls the government The Plutocracy with its paltry quarter of a million of occupied members But this quarter of a million does not control the government though it renders yeoman service It is the brain of the Plutocracy that controls the government and this brain consists of seven small and powerful groups of men And do not forget that these groups are working to day practically in unison Even as late as nineteen oh seven it was considered that eleven groups dominated the country but this number was reduced by the amalgamation of the five railroad groups into a supreme combination of all the railroads These five groups so amalgamated along with their financial and political allies were one James J Hill with his control of the Northwest two the Pennsylvania railway group Schiff financial manager with big banking firms of Philadelphia and New York three Harriman with Frick for counsel and Odell as political lieutenant controlling the central continental Southwestern and Southern Pacific Coast lines of transportation four the Gould family railway interests and five Moore Reid and Leeds known as the Rock Island crowd These strong oligarchs arose out of the conflict of competition and travelled the inevitable road toward combination Let me point out the power of but one of them the railroad group It employs forty thousand lawyers to defeat the people in the courts It issues countless thousands of free passes to judges bankers editors ministers university men members of state legislatures and of Congress It maintains luxurious lobbies at every state capital and at the national capital and in all the cities and towns of the land it employs an immense army of pettifoggers and small politicians whose business is to attend primaries pack conventions get on juries bribe judges and in every way to work for its interests Lobby a peculiar institution for bribing bulldozing and corrupting the legislators who were supposed to represent the people s interests A decade before this speech of Everhard s the New York Board of Trade issued a report from which the following is quoted The railroads control absolutely the legislatures of a majority of the states of the Union they make and unmake United States Senators congressmen and governors and are practically dictators of the governmental policy of the United States Gentlemen I have merely sketched the power of one of the seven groups that constitute the brain of the Plutocracy Your twenty four billions of wealth does not give you twenty five cents worth of governmental power It is an empty shell and soon even the empty shell will be taken away from you The Plutocracy has all power in its hands to day It to day makes the laws for it owns the Senate Congress the courts and the state legislatures And not only that Behind law must be force to execute the law To day the Plutocracy makes the law and to enforce the law it has at its beck and call the police the army the navy and lastly the militia which is you and me and all of us Rockefeller began as a member of the proletariat and through thrift and cunning succeeded in developing the first perfect trust namely that known as Standard Oil We cannot forbear giving the following remarkable page from the history of the times to show how the need for reinvestment of the Standard Oil surplus crushed out small capitalists and hastened the breakdown of the capitalist system David Graham Phillips was a radical writer of the period and the quotation by him is taken from a copy of the Saturday Evening Post dated October four nineteen oh two A D This is the only copy of this publication that has come down to us and yet from its appearance and content we cannot but conclude that it was one of the popular periodicals with a large circulation The quotation here follows About ten years ago Rockefeller s income was given as thirty millions by an excellent authority He had reached the limit of profitable investment of profits in the oil industry Here then were these enormous sums in cash pouring in more than two million dollars a month for John Davison Rockefeller alone The problem of reinvestment became more serious It became a nightmare The oil income was swelling swelling and the number of sound investments limited even more limited than it is now It was through no special eagerness for more gains that the Rockefellers began to branch out from oil into other things They were forced swept on by this inrolling tide of wealth which their monopoly magnet irresistibly attracted They developed a staff of investment seekers and investigators It is said that the chief of this staff has a salary of one hundred twenty five thousand dollars a year The first conspicuous excursion and incursion of the Rockefellers was into the railway field By eighteen ninety five they controlled one fifth of the railway mileage of the country What do they own or through dominant ownership control to day They are powerful in all the great railways of New York north east and west except one where their share is only a few millions They are in most of the great railways radiating from Chicago They dominate in several of the systems that extend to the Pacific It is their votes that make mister Morgan so potent though it may be added they need his brains more than he needs their votes at present and the combination of the two constitutes in large measure the community of interest But railways could not alone absorb rapidly enough those mighty floods of gold Presently John D Rockefeller s two million five hundred thousand dollars a month had increased to four to five to six millions a month to seventy five million dollars a year Illuminating oil was becoming all profit The reinvestments of income were adding their mite of many annual millions The Rockefellers went into gas and electricity when those industries had developed to the safe investment stage And now a large part of the American people must begin to enrich the Rockefellers as soon as the sun goes down no matter what form of illuminant they use They went into farm mortgages It is said that when prosperity a few years ago enabled the farmers to rid themselves of their mortgages John D Rockefeller was moved almost to tears eight millions which he had thought taken care of for years to come at a good interest were suddenly dumped upon his doorstep and there set up a squawking for a new home This unexpected addition to his worriments in finding places for the progeny of his petroleum and their progeny and their progeny s progeny was too much for the equanimity of a man without a digestion The Rockefellers went into mines iron and coal and copper and lead into other industrial companies into street railways into national state and municipal bonds into steamships and steamboats and telegraphy into real estate into skyscrapers and residences and hotels and business blocks into life insurance into banking There was soon literally no field of industry where their millions were not at work The Rockefeller bank the National City Bank is by itself far and away the biggest bank in the United States It is exceeded in the world only by the Bank of England and the Bank of France The deposits average more than one hundred millions a day and it dominates the call loan market on Wall Street and the stock market But it is not alone it is the head of the Rockefeller chain of banks which includes fourteen banks and trust companies in New York City and banks of great strength and influence in every large money center in the country John D Rockefeller owns Standard Oil stock worth between four and five hundred millions at the market quotations He has a hundred millions in the steel trust almost as much in a single western railway system half as much in a second and so on and on and on until the mind wearies of the cataloguing His income last year was about one hundred million dollars it is doubtful if the incomes of all the Rothschilds together make a greater sum And it is going up by leaps and bounds Little discussion took place after this and the dinner soon broke up All were quiet and subdued and leave taking was done with low voices It seemed almost that they were scared by the vision of the times they had seen The situation is indeed serious mister Calvin said to Ernest I have little quarrel with the way you have depicted it Only I disagree with you about the doom of the middle class We shall survive and we shall overthrow the trusts And return to the ways of your fathers Ernest finished for him Even so mister Calvin answered gravely I know it s a sort of machine breaking and that it is absurd But then life seems absurd to day what of the machinations of the Plutocracy And at any rate our sort of machine breaking is at least practical and possible which your dream is not Your socialistic dream is well a dream We cannot follow you I only wish you fellows knew a little something about evolution and sociology Ernest said wistfully as they shook hands We would be saved so much trouble if you did CHAPTER X THE VORTEX Following like thunder claps upon the Business Men s dinner occurred event after event of terrifying moment and I little I who had lived so placidly all my days in the quiet university town found myself and my personal affairs drawn into the vortex of the great world affairs Whether it was my love for Ernest or the clear sight he had given me of the society in which I lived that made me a revolutionist I know not but a revolutionist I became and I was plunged into a whirl of happenings that would have been inconceivable three short months before The crisis in my own fortunes came simultaneously with great crises in society First of all father was discharged from the university Oh he was not technically discharged His resignation was demanded that was all This in itself did not amount to much Father in fact was delighted He was especially delighted because his discharge had been precipitated by the publication of his book Economics and Education It clinched his argument he contended What better evidence could be advanced to prove that education was dominated by the capitalist class But this proof never got anywhere Nobody knew he had been forced to resign from the university He was so eminent a scientist that such an announcement coupled with the reason for his enforced resignation would have created somewhat of a furor all over the world The newspapers showered him with praise and honor and commended him for having given up the drudgery of the lecture room in order to devote his whole time to scientific research At first father laughed Then he became angry tonic angry Then came the suppression of his book This suppression was performed secretly so secretly that at first we could not comprehend The publication of the book had immediately caused a bit of excitement in the country Father had been politely abused in the capitalist press the tone of the abuse being to the effect that it was a pity so great a scientist should leave his field and invade the realm of sociology about which he knew nothing and wherein he had promptly become lost This lasted for a week while father chuckled and said the book had touched a sore spot on capitalism And then abruptly the newspapers and the critical magazines ceased saying anything about the book at all Also and with equal suddenness the book disappeared from the market Not a copy was obtainable from any bookseller Father wrote to the publishers and was informed that the plates had been accidentally injured An unsatisfactory correspondence followed Driven finally to an unequivocal stand the publishers stated that they could not see their way to putting the book into type again but that they were willing to relinquish their rights in it And you won t find another publishing house in the country to touch it Ernest said And if I were you I d hunt cover right now You ve merely got a foretaste of the Iron Heel But father was nothing if not a scientist He never believed in jumping to conclusions A laboratory experiment was no experiment if it were not carried through in all its details So he patiently went the round of the publishing houses They gave a multitude of excuses but not one house would consider the book When father became convinced that the book had actually been suppressed he tried to get the fact into the newspapers but his communications were ignored At a political meeting of the socialists where many reporters were present father saw his chance He arose and related the history of the suppression of the book He laughed next day when he read the newspapers and then he grew angry to a degree that eliminated all tonic qualities The papers made no mention of the book but they misreported him beautifully They twisted his words and phrases away from the context and turned his subdued and controlled remarks into a howling anarchistic speech It was done artfully One instance in particular I remember He had used the phrase social revolution The reporter merely dropped out social This was sent out all over the country in an Associated Press despatch and from all over the country arose a cry of alarm Father was branded as a nihilist and an anarchist and in one cartoon that was copied widely he was portrayed waving a red flag at the head of a mob of long haired wild eyed men who bore in their hands torches knives and dynamite bombs He was assailed terribly in the press in long and abusive editorials for his anarchy and hints were made of mental breakdown on his part This behavior on the part of the capitalist press was nothing new Ernest told us It was the custom he said to send reporters to all the socialist meetings for the express purpose of misreporting and distorting what was said in order to frighten the middle class away from any possible affiliation with the proletariat And repeatedly Ernest warned father to cease fighting and to take to cover The socialist press of the country took up the fight however and throughout the reading portion of the working class it was known that the book had been suppressed But this knowledge stopped with the working class Next the Appeal to Reason a big socialist publishing house arranged with father to bring out the book Father was jubilant but Ernest was alarmed I tell you we are on the verge of the unknown he insisted Big things are happening secretly all around us We can feel them We do not know what they are but they are there The whole fabric of society is a tremble with them Don t ask me I don t know myself But out of this flux of society something is about to crystallize It is crystallizing now The suppression of the book is a precipitation How many books have been suppressed We haven t the least idea We are in the dark We have no way of learning Watch out next for the suppression of the socialist press and socialist publishing houses I m afraid it s coming We are going to be throttled Ernest had his hand on the pulse of events even more closely than the rest of the socialists and within two days the first blow was struck The Appeal to Reason was a weekly and its regular circulation amongst the proletariat was seven hundred and fifty thousand Also it very frequently got out special editions of from two to five millions These great editions were paid for and distributed by the small army of voluntary workers who had marshalled around the Appeal The first blow was aimed at these special editions and it was a crushing one By an arbitrary ruling of the Post Office these editions were decided to be not the regular circulation of the paper and for that reason were denied admission to the mails A week later the Post Office Department ruled that the paper was seditious and barred it entirely from the mails This was a fearful blow to the socialist propaganda The Appeal was desperate It devised a plan of reaching its subscribers through the express companies but they declined to handle it This was the end of the Appeal But not quite It prepared to go on with its book publishing Twenty thousand copies of father s book were in the bindery and the presses were turning off more And then without warning a mob arose one night and under a waving American flag singing patriotic songs set fire to the great plant of the Appeal and totally destroyed it Now Girard Kansas was a quiet peaceable town There had never been any labor troubles there The Appeal paid union wages and in fact was the backbone of the town giving employment to hundreds of men and women It was not the citizens of Girard that composed the mob This mob had risen up out of the earth apparently and to all intents and purposes its work done it had gone back into the earth Ernest saw in the affair the most sinister import The Black Hundreds are being organized in the United States he said This is the beginning There will be more of it The Iron Heel is getting bold The Black Hundreds were reactionary mobs organized by the perishing Autocracy in the Russian Revolution These reactionary groups attacked the revolutionary groups and also at needed moments rioted and destroyed property so as to afford the Autocracy the pretext of calling out the Cossacks And so perished father s book We were to see much of the Black Hundreds as the days went by Week by week more of the socialist papers were barred from the mails and in a number of instances the Black Hundreds destroyed the socialist presses Of course the newspapers of the land lived up to the reactionary policy of the ruling class and the destroyed socialist press was misrepresented and vilified while the Black Hundreds were represented as true patriots and saviours of society So convincing was all this misrepresentation that even sincere ministers in the pulpit praised the Black Hundreds while regretting the necessity of violence History was making fast The fall elections were soon to occur and Ernest was nominated by the socialist party to run for Congress His chance for election was most favorable The street car strike in San Francisco had been broken And following upon it the teamsters strike had been broken These two defeats had been very disastrous to organized labor The whole Water Front Federation along with its allies in the structural trades had backed up the teamsters and all had smashed down ingloriously It had been a bloody strike The police had broken countless heads with their riot clubs and the death list had been augmented by the turning loose of a machine gun on the strikers from the barns of the Marsden Special Delivery Company In consequence the men were sullen and vindictive They wanted blood and revenge Beaten on their chosen field they were ripe to seek revenge by means of political action They still maintained their labor organization and this gave them strength in the political struggle that was on Ernest s chance for election grew stronger and stronger Day by day unions and more unions voted their support to the socialists until even Ernest laughed when the Undertakers Assistants and the Chicken Pickers fell into line Labor became mulish While it packed the socialist meetings with mad enthusiasm it was impervious to the wiles of the old party politicians The old party orators were usually greeted with empty halls though occasionally they encountered full halls where they were so roughly handled that more than once it was necessary to call out the police reserves History was making fast The air was vibrant with things happening and impending The country was on the verge of hard times caused by a series of prosperous years wherein the difficulty of disposing abroad of the unconsumed surplus had become increasingly difficult Industries were working short time many great factories were standing idle against the time when the surplus should be gone and wages were being cut right and left Under the capitalist regime these periods of hard times were as inevitable as they were absurd Prosperity always brought calamity This of course was due to the excess of unconsumed profits that was piled up Also the great machinist strike had been broken Two hundred thousand machinists along with their five hundred thousand allies in the metalworking trades had been defeated in as bloody a strike as had ever marred the United States Pitched battles had been fought with the small armies of armed strike breakers put in the field by the employers associations the Black Hundreds appearing in scores of wide scattered places had destroyed property and in consequence a hundred thousand regular soldiers of the United States has been called out to put a frightful end to the whole affair A number of the labor leaders had been executed many others had been sentenced to prison while thousands of the rank and file of the strikers had been herded into bull pens and abominably treated by the soldiers Strike breakers these were in purpose and practice and everything except name the private soldiers of the capitalists They were thoroughly organized and well armed and they were held in readiness to be hurled in special trains to any part of the country where labor went on strike or was locked out by the employers Only those curious times could have given rise to the amazing spectacle of one Farley a notorious commander of strike breakers who in nineteen oh six swept across the United States in special trains from New York to San Francisco with an army of twenty five hundred men fully armed and equipped to break a strike of the San Francisco street car men Such an act was in direct violation of the laws of the land The fact that this act and thousands of similar acts went unpunished goes to show how completely the judiciary was the creature of the Plutocracy Bull pen in a miners strike in Idaho in the latter part of the nineteenth century it happened that many of the strikers were confined in a bull pen by the troops The practice and the name continued in the twentieth century The years of prosperity were now to be paid for All markets were glutted all markets were falling and amidst the general crumble of prices the price of labor crumbled fastest of all The land was convulsed with industrial dissensions Labor was striking here there and everywhere and where it was not striking it was being turned out by the capitalists The papers were filled with tales of violence and blood And through it all the Black Hundreds played their part Riot arson and wanton destruction of property was their function and well they performed it The whole regular army was in the field called there by the actions of the Black Hundreds All cities and towns were like armed camps and laborers were shot down like dogs Out of the vast army of the unemployed the strike breakers were recruited and when the strike breakers were worsted by the labor unions the troops always appeared and crushed the unions Then there was the militia As yet it was not necessary to have recourse to the secret militia law Only the regularly organized militia was out and it was out everywhere And in this time of terror the regular army was increased an additional hundred thousand by the government The name only and not the idea was imported from Russia The Black Hundreds were a development out of the secret agents of the capitalists and their use arose in the labor struggles of the nineteenth century There is no discussion of this No less an authority of the times than Carroll D Wright United States Commissioner of Labor is responsible for the statement From his book entitled The Battles of Labor is quoted the declaration that in some of the great historic strikes the employers themselves have instigated acts of violence that manufacturers have deliberately provoked strikes in order to get rid of surplus stock and that freight cars have been burned by employers agents during railroad strikes in order to increase disorder It was out of these secret agents of the employers that the Black Hundreds arose and it was they in turn that later became that terrible weapon of the Oligarchy the agents provocateurs Never had labor received such an all around beating The great captains of industry the oligarchs had for the first time thrown their full weight into the breach the struggling employers associations had made These associations were practically middle class affairs and now compelled by hard times and crashing markets and aided by the great captains of industry they gave organized labor an awful and decisive defeat It was an all powerful alliance but it was an alliance of the lion and the lamb as the middle class was soon to learn Labor was bloody and sullen but crushed Yet its defeat did not put an end to the hard times The banks themselves constituting one of the most important forces of the Oligarchy continued to call in credits The Wall Street group turned the stock market into a maelstrom where the values of all the land crumbled away almost to nothingness And out of all the rack and ruin rose the form of the nascent Oligarchy imperturbable indifferent and sure Its serenity and certitude was terrifying Not only did it use its own vast power but it used all the power of the United States Treasury to carry out its plans Wall Street so named from a street in ancient New York where was situated the stock exchange and where the irrational organization of society permitted underhanded manipulation of all the industries of the country The captains of industry had turned upon the middle class The employers associations that had helped the captains of industry to tear and rend labor were now torn and rent by their quondam allies Amidst the crashing of the middle men the small business men and manufacturers the trusts stood firm Nay the trusts did more than stand firm They were active They sowed wind and wind and ever more wind for they alone knew how to reap the whirlwind and make a profit out of it And such profits Colossal profits Strong enough themselves to weather the storm that was largely their own brewing they turned loose and plundered the wrecks that floated about them Values were pitifully and inconceivably shrunken and the trusts added hugely to their holdings even extending their enterprises into many new fields and always at the expense of the middle class Thus the summer of nineteen twelve witnessed the virtual death thrust to the middle class Even Ernest was astounded at the quickness with which it had been done He shook his head ominously and looked forward without hope to the fall elections It s no use he said We are beaten The Iron Heel is here I had hoped for a peaceable victory at the ballot box I was wrong Wickson was right We shall be robbed of our few remaining liberties the Iron Heel will walk upon our faces nothing remains but a bloody revolution of the working class Of course we will win but I shudder to think of it And from then on Ernest pinned his faith in revolution In this he was in advance of his party His fellow socialists could not agree with him They still insisted that victory could be gained through the elections It was not that they were stunned They were too cool headed and courageous for that They were merely incredulous that was all Ernest could not get them seriously to fear the coming of the Oligarchy They were stirred by him but they were too sure of their own strength There was no room in their theoretical social evolution for an oligarchy therefore the Oligarchy could not be We ll send you to Congress and it will be all right they told him at one of our secret meetings And when they take me out of Congress Ernest replied coldly and put me against a wall and blow my brains out what then Then we ll rise in our might a dozen voices answered at once Then you ll welter in your gore was his retort I ve heard that song sung by the middle class and where is it now in its might CHAPTER XI THE GREAT ADVENTURE mister Wickson did not send for father They met by chance on the ferry boat to San Francisco so that the warning he gave father was not premeditated Had they not met accidentally there would not have been any warning Not that the outcome would have been different however Father came of stout old Mayflower stock and the blood was imperative in him One of the first ships that carried colonies to America after the discovery of the New World Descendants of these original colonists were for a while inordinately proud of their genealogy but in time the blood became so widely diffused that it ran in the veins practically of all Americans Ernest was right he told me as soon as he had returned home Ernest is a very remarkable young man and I d rather see you his wife than the wife of Rockefeller himself or the King of England What s the matter I asked in alarm The Oligarchy is about to tread upon our faces yours and mine Wickson as much as told me so He was very kind for an oligarch He offered to reinstate me in the university What do you think of that He Wickson a sordid money grabber has the power to determine whether I shall or shall not teach in the university of the state But he offered me even better than that offered to make me president of some great college of physical sciences that is being planned the Oligarchy must get rid of its surplus somehow you see Do you remember what I told that socialist lover of your daughter s he said I told him that we would walk upon the faces of the working class And so we shall As for you I have for you a deep respect as a scientist but if you throw your fortunes in with the working class well watch out for your face that is all And then he turned and left me It means we ll have to marry earlier than you planned was Ernest s comment when we told him I could not follow his reasoning but I was soon to learn it It was at this time that the quarterly dividend of the Sierra Mills was paid or rather should have been paid for father did not receive his After waiting several days father wrote to the secretary Promptly came the reply that there was no record on the books of father s owning any stock and a polite request for more explicit information I ll make it explicit enough confound him father declared and departed for the bank to get the stock in question from his safe deposit box Ernest is a very remarkable man he said when he got back and while I was helping him off with his overcoat I repeat my daughter that young man of yours is a very remarkable young man I had learned whenever he praised Ernest in such fashion to expect disaster They have already walked upon my face father explained There was no stock The box was empty You and Ernest will have to get married pretty quickly Father insisted on laboratory methods He brought the Sierra Mills into court but he could not bring the books of the Sierra Mills into court He did not control the courts and the Sierra Mills did That explained it all He was thoroughly beaten by the law and the bare faced robbery held good It is almost laughable now when I look back on it the way father was beaten He met Wickson accidentally on the street in San Francisco and he told Wickson that he was a damned scoundrel And then father was arrested for attempted assault fined in the police court and bound over to keep the peace It was all so ridiculous that when he got home he had to laugh himself But what a furor was raised in the local papers There was grave talk about the bacillus of violence that infected all men who embraced socialism and father with his long and peaceful life was instanced as a shining example of how the bacillus of violence worked Also it was asserted by more than one paper that father s mind had weakened under the strain of scientific study and confinement in a state asylum for the insane was suggested Nor was this merely talk It was an imminent peril But father was wise enough to see it He had the Bishop s experience to lesson from and he lessoned well He kept quiet no matter what injustice was perpetrated on him and really I think surprised his enemies There was the matter of the house our home A mortgage was foreclosed on it and we had to give up possession Of course there wasn t any mortgage and never had been any mortgage The ground had been bought outright and the house had been paid for when it was built And house and lot had always been free and unencumbered Nevertheless there was the mortgage properly and legally drawn up and signed with a record of the payments of interest through a number of years Father made no outcry As he had been robbed of his money so was he now robbed of his home And he had no recourse The machinery of society was in the hands of those who were bent on breaking him He was a philosopher at heart and he was no longer even angry I am doomed to be broken he said to me but that is no reason that I should not try to be shattered as little as possible These old bones of mine are fragile and I ve learned my lesson God knows I don t want to spend my last days in an insane asylum Which reminds me of Bishop Morehouse whom I have neglected for many pages But first let me tell of my marriage In the play of events my marriage sinks into insignificance I know so I shall barely mention it Now we shall become real proletarians father said when we were driven from our home I have often envied that young man of yours for his actual knowledge of the proletariat Now I shall see and learn for myself Father must have had strong in him the blood of adventure He looked upon our catastrophe in the light of an adventure No anger nor bitterness possessed him He was too philosophic and simple to be vindictive and he lived too much in the world of mind to miss the creature comforts we were giving up So it was when we moved to San Francisco into four wretched rooms in the slum south of Market Street that he embarked upon the adventure with the joy and enthusiasm of a child combined with the clear sight and mental grasp of an extraordinary intellect He really never crystallized mentally He had no false sense of values Conventional or habitual values meant nothing to him The only values he recognized were mathematical and scientific facts My father was a great man He had the mind and the soul that only great men have In ways he was even greater than Ernest than whom I have known none greater Even I found some relief in our change of living If nothing else I was escaping from the organized ostracism that had been our increasing portion in the university town ever since the enmity of the nascent Oligarchy had been incurred And the change was to me likewise adventure and the greatest of all for it was love adventure The change in our fortunes had hastened my marriage and it was as a wife that I came to live in the four rooms on Pell Street in the San Francisco slum And this out of all remains I made Ernest happy I came into his stormy life not as a new perturbing force but as one that made toward peace and repose I gave him rest It was the guerdon of my love for him It was the one infallible token that I had not failed To bring forgetfulness or the light of gladness into those poor tired eyes of his what greater joy could have blessed me than that Those dear tired eyes He toiled as few men ever toiled and all his lifetime he toiled for others That was the measure of his manhood He was a humanist and a lover And he with his incarnate spirit of battle his gladiator body and his eagle spirit he was as gentle and tender to me as a poet He was a poet A singer in deeds And all his life he sang the song of man And he did it out of sheer love of man and for man he gave his life and was crucified And all this he did with no hope of future reward In his conception of things there was no future life He who fairly burnt with immortality denied himself immortality such was the paradox of him He so warm in spirit was dominated by that cold and forbidding philosophy materialistic monism I used to refute him by telling him that I measured his immortality by the wings of his soul and that I should have to live endless aeons in order to achieve the full measurement Whereat he would laugh and his arms would leap out to me and he would call me his sweet metaphysician and the tiredness would pass out of his eyes and into them would flood the happy love light that was in itself a new and sufficient advertisement of his immortality Also he used to call me his dualist and he would explain how Kant by means of pure reason had abolished reason in order to worship God And he drew the parallel and included me guilty of a similar act And when I pleaded guilty but defended the act as highly rational he but pressed me closer and laughed as only one of God s own lovers could laugh I was wont to deny that heredity and environment could explain his own originality and genius any more than could the cold groping finger of science catch and analyze and classify that elusive essence that lurked in the constitution of life itself I held that space was an apparition of God and that soul was a projection of the character of God and when he called me his sweet metaphysician I called him my immortal materialist And so we loved and were happy and I forgave him his materialism because of his tremendous work in the world performed without thought of soul gain thereby and because of his so exceeding modesty of spirit that prevented him from having pride and regal consciousness of himself and his soul But he had pride How could he have been an eagle and not have pride His contention was that it was finer for a finite mortal speck of life to feel Godlike than for a god to feel godlike and so it was that he exalted what he deemed his mortality He was fond of quoting a fragment from a certain poem He had never seen the whole poem and he had tried vainly to learn its authorship I here give the fragment not alone because he loved it but because it epitomized the paradox that he was in the spirit of him and his conception of his spirit For how can a man with thrilling and burning and exaltation recite the following and still be mere mortal earth a bit of fugitive force an evanescent form Here it is Joy upon joy and gain upon gain Are the destined rights of my birth And I shout the praise of my endless days To the echoing edge of the earth Though I suffer all deaths that a man can die To the uttermost end of time I have deep drained this my cup of bliss In every age and clime The froth of Pride the tang of Power The sweet of Womanhood I drain the lees upon my knees For oh the draught is good I drink to Life I drink to Death And smack my lips with song For when I die another I shall pass the cup along The man you drove from Eden s grove Was I my Lord was I And I shall be there when the earth and the air Are rent from sea to sky For it is my world my gorgeous world The world of my dearest woes From the first faint cry of the newborn To the rack of the woman s throes Packed with the pulse of an unborn race Torn with a world s desire The surging flood of my wild young blood Would quench the judgment fire I am Man Man Man from the tingling flesh To the dust of my earthly goal From the nestling gloom of the pregnant womb To the sheen of my naked soul Bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh The whole world leaps to my will And the unslaked thirst of an Eden cursed Shall harrow the earth for its fill Almighty God when I drain life s glass Of all its rainbow gleams The hapless plight of eternal night Shall be none too long for my dreams The man you drove from Eden s grove Was I my Lord was I And I shall be there when the earth and the air Are rent from sea to sky For it is my world my gorgeous world The world of my dear delight From the brightest gleam of the Arctic stream To the dusk of my own love night Ernest always overworked His wonderful constitution kept him up but even that constitution could not keep the tired look out of his eyes His dear tired eyes He never slept more than four and one half hours a night yet he never found time to do all the work he wanted to do He never ceased from his activities as a propagandist and was always scheduled long in advance for lectures to workingmen s organizations Then there was the campaign He did a man s full work in that alone With the suppression of the socialist publishing houses his meagre royalties ceased and he was hard put to make a living for he had to make a living in addition to all his other labor He did a great deal of translating for the magazines on scientific and philosophic subjects and coming home late at night worn out from the strain of the campaign he would plunge into his translating and toil on well into the morning hours And in addition to everything there was his studying To the day of his death he kept up his studies and he studied prodigiously And yet he found time in which to love me and make me happy But this was accomplished only through my merging my life completely into his I learned shorthand and typewriting and became his secretary He insisted that I succeeded in cutting his work in half and so it was that I schooled myself to understand his work Our interests became mutual and we worked together and played together And then there were our sweet stolen moments in the midst of our work just a word or caress or flash of love light and our moments were sweeter for being stolen For we lived on the heights where the air was keen and sparkling where the toil was for humanity and where sordidness and selfishness never entered We loved love and our love was never smirched by anything less than the best And this out of all remains I did not fail I gave him rest he who worked so hard for others my dear tired eyed mortalist CHAPTER XII THE BISHOP It was after my marriage that I chanced upon Bishop Morehouse But I must give the events in their proper sequence After his outbreak at the I P H Convention the Bishop being a gentle soul had yielded to the friendly pressure brought to bear upon him and had gone away on a vacation But he returned more fixed than ever in his determination to preach the message of the Church To the consternation of his congregation his first sermon was quite similar to the address he had given before the Convention Again he said and at length and with distressing detail that the Church had wandered away from the Master s teaching and that Mammon had been instated in the place of Christ And the result was willy nilly that he was led away to a private sanitarium for mental disease while in the newspapers appeared pathetic accounts of his mental breakdown and of the saintliness of his character He was held a prisoner in the sanitarium I called repeatedly but was denied access to him and I was terribly impressed by the tragedy of a sane normal saintly man being crushed by the brutal will of society For the Bishop was sane and pure and noble As Ernest said all that was the matter with him was that he had incorrect notions of biology and sociology and because of his incorrect notions he had not gone about it in the right way to rectify matters What terrified me was the Bishop s helplessness If he persisted in the truth as he saw it he was doomed to an insane ward And he could do nothing His money his position his culture could not save him His views were perilous to society and society could not conceive that such perilous views could be the product of a sane mind Or at least it seems to me that such was society s attitude But the Bishop in spite of the gentleness and purity of his spirit was possessed of guile He apprehended clearly his danger He saw himself caught in the web and he tried to escape from it Denied help from his friends such as father and Ernest and I could have given he was left to battle for himself alone And in the enforced solitude of the sanitarium he recovered He became again sane His eyes ceased to see visions his brain was purged of the fancy that it was the duty of society to feed the Master s lambs As I say he became well quite well and the newspapers and the church people hailed his return with joy I went once to his church The sermon was of the same order as the ones he had preached long before his eyes had seen visions I was disappointed shocked Had society then beaten him into submission Was he a coward Had he been bulldozed into recanting Or had the strain been too great for him and had he meekly surrendered to the juggernaut of the established I called upon him in his beautiful home He was woefully changed He was thinner and there were lines on his face which I had never seen before He was manifestly distressed by my coming He plucked nervously at his sleeve as we talked and his eyes were restless fluttering here there and everywhere and refusing to meet mine His mind seemed preoccupied and there were strange pauses in his conversation abrupt changes of topic and an inconsecutiveness that was bewildering Could this then be the firm poised Christ like man I had known with pure limpid eyes and a gaze steady and unfaltering as his soul He had been man handled he had been cowed into subjection His spirit was too gentle It had not been mighty enough to face the organized wolf pack of society I felt sad unutterably sad He talked ambiguously and was so apprehensive of what I might say that I had not the heart to catechise him He spoke in a far away manner of his illness and we talked disjointedly about the church the alterations in the organ and about petty charities and he saw me depart with such evident relief that I should have laughed had not my heart been so full of tears The poor little hero If I had only known He was battling like a giant and I did not guess it Alone all alone in the midst of millions of his fellow men he was fighting his fight Torn by his horror of the asylum and his fidelity to truth and the right he clung steadfastly to truth and the right but so alone was he that he did not dare to trust even me He had learned his lesson well too well But I was soon to know One day the Bishop disappeared He had told nobody that he was going away and as the days went by and he did not reappear there was much gossip to the effect that he had committed suicide while temporarily deranged But this idea was dispelled when it was learned that he had sold all his possessions his city mansion his country house at Menlo Park his paintings and collections and even his cherished library It was patent that he had made a clean and secret sweep of everything before he disappeared This happened during the time when calamity had overtaken us in our own affairs and it was not till we were well settled in our new home that we had opportunity really to wonder and speculate about the Bishop s doings And then everything was suddenly made clear Early one evening while it was yet twilight I had run across the street and into the butcher shop to get some chops for Ernest s supper We called the last meal of the day supper in our new environment Just at the moment I came out of the butcher shop a man emerged from the corner grocery that stood alongside A queer sense familiarity made me look again But the man had turned and was walking rapidly away There was something about the slope of the shoulders and the fringe of silver hair between coat collar and slouch hat that aroused vague memories Instead of crossing the street I hurried after the man I quickened my pace trying not to think the thoughts that formed unbidden in my brain No it was impossible It could not be not in those faded overalls too long in the legs and frayed at the bottoms I paused laughed at myself and almost abandoned the chase But the haunting familiarity of those shoulders and that silver hair Again I hurried on As I passed him I shot a keen look at his face then I whirled around abruptly and confronted the Bishop He halted with equal abruptness and gasped A large paper bag in his right hand fell to the sidewalk It burst and about his feet and mine bounced and rolled a flood of potatoes He looked at me with surprise and alarm then he seemed to wilt away the shoulders drooped with dejection and he uttered a deep sigh I held out my hand He shook it but his hand felt clammy He cleared his throat in embarrassment and I could see the sweat starting out on his forehead It was evident that he was badly frightened The potatoes he murmured faintly They are precious Between us we picked them up and replaced them in the broken bag which he now held carefully in the hollow of his arm I tried to tell him my gladness at meeting him and that he must come right home with me Father will be rejoiced to see you I said We live only a stone s throw away I can t he said I must be going Good by He looked apprehensively about him as though dreading discovery and made an attempt to walk on Tell me where you live and I shall call later he said when he saw that I walked beside him and that it was my intention to stick to him now that he was found No I answered firmly You must come now He looked at the potatoes spilling on his arm and at the small parcels on his other arm Really it is impossible he said Forgive me for my rudeness If you only knew He looked as if he were going to break down but the next moment he had himself in control Besides this food he went on It is a sad case It is terrible She is an old woman I must take it to her at once She is suffering from want of it I must go at once You understand Then I will return I promise you Let me go with you I volunteered Is it far He sighed again and surrendered Only two blocks he said Let us hasten Under the Bishop s guidance I learned something of my own neighborhood I had not dreamed such wretchedness and misery existed in it Of course this was because I did not concern myself with charity I had become convinced that Ernest was right when he sneered at charity as a poulticing of an ulcer Remove the ulcer was his remedy give to the worker his product pension as soldiers those who grow honorably old in their toil and there will be no need for charity Convinced of this I toiled with him at the revolution and did not exhaust my energy in alleviating the social ills that continuously arose from the injustice of the system I followed the Bishop into a small room ten by twelve in a rear tenement And there we found a little old German woman sixty four years old the Bishop said She was surprised at seeing me but she nodded a pleasant greeting and went on sewing on the pair of men s trousers in her lap Beside her on the floor was a pile of trousers The Bishop discovered there was neither coal nor kindling and went out to buy some I took up a pair of trousers and examined her work Six cents lady she said nodding her head gently while she went on stitching She stitched slowly but never did she cease from stitching She seemed mastered by the verb to stitch For all that work I asked Is that what they pay How long does it take you Yes she answered that is what they pay Six cents for finishing Two hours sewing on each pair But the boss doesn t know that she added quickly betraying a fear of getting him into trouble I m slow I ve got the rheumatism in my hands Girls work much faster They finish in half that time The boss is kind He lets me take the work home now that I am old and the noise of the machine bothers my head If it wasn t for his kindness I d starve Yes those who work in the shop get eight cents But what can you do There is not enough work for the young The old have no chance Often one pair is all I can get Sometimes like to day I am given eight pair to finish before night I asked her the hours she worked and she said it depended on the season In the summer when there is a rush order I work from five in the morning to nine at night But in the winter it is too cold The hands do not early get over the stiffness Then you must work later till after midnight sometimes Yes it has been a bad summer The hard times God must be angry This is the first work the boss has given me in a week It is true one cannot eat much when there is no work I am used to it I have sewed all my life in the old country and here in San Francisco thirty three years If you are sure of the rent it is all right The houseman is very kind but he must have his rent It is fair He only charges three dollars for this room That is cheap But it is not easy for you to find all of three dollars every month She ceased talking and nodding her head went on stitching You have to be very careful as to how you spend your earnings I suggested She nodded emphatically After the rent it s not so bad Of course you can t buy meat And there is no milk for the coffee But always there is one meal a day and often two She said this last proudly There was a smack of success in her words But as she stitched on in silence I noticed the sadness in her pleasant eyes and the droop of her mouth The look in her eyes became far away She rubbed the dimness hastily out of them it interfered with her stitching No it is not the hunger that makes the heart ache she explained You get used to being hungry It is for my child that I cry It was the machine that killed her It is true she worked hard but I cannot understand She was strong And she was young only forty and she worked only thirty years She began young it is true but my man died The boiler exploded down at the works And what were we to do She was ten but she was very strong But the machine killed her Yes it did It killed her and she was the fastest worker in the shop I have thought about it often and I know That is why I cannot work in the shop The machine bothers my head Always I hear it saying I did it I did it And it says that all day long And then I think of my daughter and I cannot work The moistness was in her old eyes again and she had to wipe it away before she could go on stitching I heard the Bishop stumbling up the stairs and I opened the door What a spectacle he was On his back he carried half a sack of coal with kindling on top Some of the coal dust had coated his face and the sweat from his exertions was running in streaks He dropped his burden in the corner by the stove and wiped his face on a coarse bandana handkerchief I could scarcely accept the verdict of my senses The Bishop black as a coal heaver in a workingman s cheap cotton shirt one button was missing from the throat and in overalls That was the most incongruous of all the overalls frayed at the bottoms dragged down at the heels and held up by a narrow leather belt around the hips such as laborers wear Though the Bishop was warm the poor swollen hands of the old woman were already cramping with the cold and before we left her the Bishop had built the fire while I had peeled the potatoes and put them on to boil I was to learn as time went by that there were many cases similar to hers and many worse hidden away in the monstrous depths of the tenements in my neighborhood We got back to find Ernest alarmed by my absence After the first surprise of greeting was over the Bishop leaned back in his chair stretched out his overall covered legs and actually sighed a comfortable sigh We were the first of his old friends he had met since his disappearance he told us and during the intervening weeks he must have suffered greatly from loneliness He told us much though he told us more of the joy he had experienced in doing the Master s bidding For truly now he said I am feeding his lambs And I have learned a great lesson The soul cannot be ministered to till the stomach is appeased His lambs must be fed bread and butter and potatoes and meat after that and only after that are their spirits ready for more refined nourishment He ate heartily of the supper I cooked Never had he had such an appetite at our table in the old days We spoke of it and he said that he had never been so healthy in his life I walk always now he said and a blush was on his cheek at the thought of the time when he rode in his carriage as though it were a sin not lightly to be laid My health is better for it he added hastily And I am very happy indeed most happy At last I am a consecrated spirit And yet there was in his face a permanent pain the pain of the world that he was now taking to himself He was seeing life in the raw and it was a different life from what he had known within the printed books of his library And you are responsible for all this young man he said directly to Ernest Ernest was embarrassed and awkward I I warned you he faltered No you misunderstand the Bishop answered I speak not in reproach but in gratitude I have you to thank for showing me my path You led me from theories about life to life itself You pulled aside the veils from the social shams You were light in my darkness but now I too see the light And I am very happy only he hesitated painfully and in his eyes fear leaped large Only the persecution I harm no one Why will they not let me alone But it is not that It is the nature of the persecution I shouldn t mind if they cut my flesh with stripes or burned me at the stake or crucified me head downward But it is the asylum that frightens me Think of it Of me in an asylum for the insane It is revolting I saw some of the cases at the sanitarium They were violent My blood chills when I think of it And to be imprisoned for the rest of my life amid scenes of screaming madness No no Not that Not that It was pitiful His hands shook his whole body quivered and shrank away from the picture he had conjured But the next moment he was calm Forgive me he said simply It is my wretched nerves And if the Master s work leads there so be it Who am I to complain I felt like crying aloud as I looked at him Great Bishop O hero God s hero As the evening wore on we learned more of his doings I sold my house my houses rather he said all my other possessions I knew I must do it secretly else they would have taken everything away from me That would have been terrible I often marvel these days at the immense quantity of potatoes two or three hundred thousand dollars will buy or bread or meat or coal and kindling He turned to Ernest You are right young man Labor is dreadfully underpaid I never did a bit of work in my life except to appeal aesthetically to Pharisees I thought I was preaching the message and yet I was worth half a million dollars I never knew what half a million dollars meant until I realized how much potatoes and bread and butter and meat it could buy And then I realized something more I realized that all those potatoes and that bread and butter and meat were mine and that I had not worked to make them Then it was clear to me some one else had worked and made them and been robbed of them And when I came down amongst the poor I found those who had been robbed and who were hungry and wretched because they had been robbed We drew him back to his narrative The money I have it deposited in many different banks under different names It can never be taken away from me because it can never be found And it is so good that money It buys so much food I never knew before what money was good for I wish we could get some of it for the propaganda Ernest said wistfully It would do immense good Do you think so the Bishop said I do not have much faith in politics In fact I am afraid I do not understand politics Ernest was delicate in such matters He did not repeat his suggestion though he knew only too well the sore straits the Socialist Party was in through lack of money I sleep in cheap lodging houses the Bishop went on But I am afraid and never stay long in one place Also I rent two rooms in workingmen s houses in different quarters of the city It is a great extravagance I know but it is necessary I make up for it in part by doing my own cooking though sometimes I get something to eat in cheap coffee houses And I have made a discovery Tamales are very good when the air grows chilly late at night Only they are so expensive But I have discovered a place where I can get three for ten cents They are not so good as the others but they are very warming A Mexican dish referred to occasionally in the literature of the times It is supposed that it was warmly seasoned No recipe of it has come down to us And so I have at last found my work in the world thanks to you young man It is the Master s work He looked at me and his eyes twinkled You caught me feeding his lambs you know And of course you will all keep my secret He spoke carelessly enough but there was real fear behind the speech He promised to call upon us again But a week later we read in the newspaper of the sad case of Bishop Morehouse who had been committed to the Napa Asylum and for whom there were still hopes held out In vain we tried to see him to have his case reconsidered or investigated Nor could we learn anything about him except the reiterated statements that slight hopes were still held for his recovery Christ told the rich young man to sell all he had Ernest said bitterly The Bishop obeyed Christ s injunction and got locked up in a madhouse Times have changed since Christ s day A rich man to day who gives all he has to the poor is crazy There is no discussion Society has spoken CHAPTER XIII THE GENERAL STRIKE Of course Ernest was elected to Congress in the great socialist landslide that took place in the fall of nineteen twelve One great factor that helped to swell the socialist vote was the destruction of Hearst This the Plutocracy found an easy task It cost Hearst eighteen million dollars a year to run his various papers and this sum and more he got back from the middle class in payment for advertising The source of his financial strength lay wholly in the middle class The trusts did not advertise To destroy Hearst all that was necessary was to take away from him his advertising William Randolph Hearst a young California millionaire who became the most powerful newspaper owner in the country His newspapers were published in all the large cities and they appealed to the perishing middle class and to the proletariat So large was his following that he managed to take possession of the empty shell of the old Democratic Party He occupied an anomalous position preaching an emasculated socialism combined with a nondescript sort of petty bourgeois capitalism It was oil and water and there was no hope for him though for a short period he was a source of serious apprehension to the Plutocrats The cost of advertising was amazing in those helter skelter times Only the small capitalists competed and therefore they did the advertising There being no competition where there was a trust there was no need for the trusts to advertise The whole middle class had not yet been exterminated The sturdy skeleton of it remained but it was without power The small manufacturers and small business men who still survived were at the complete mercy of the Plutocracy They had no economic nor political souls of their own When the fiat of the Plutocracy went forth they withdrew their advertisements from the Hearst papers Hearst made a gallant fight He brought his papers out at a loss of a million and a half each month He continued to publish the advertisements for which he no longer received pay Again the fiat of the Plutocracy went forth and the small business men and manufacturers swamped him with a flood of notices that he must discontinue running their old advertisements Hearst persisted Injunctions were served on him Still he persisted He received six months imprisonment for contempt of court in disobeying the injunctions while he was bankrupted by countless damage suits He had no chance The Plutocracy had passed sentence on him The courts were in the hands of the Plutocracy to carry the sentence out And with Hearst crashed also to destruction the Democratic Party that he had so recently captured With the destruction of Hearst and the Democratic Party there were only two paths for his following to take One was into the Socialist Party the other was into the Republican Party Then it was that we socialists reaped the fruit of Hearst s pseudo socialistic preaching for the great Majority of his followers came over to us The expropriation of the farmers that took place at this time would also have swelled our vote had it not been for the brief and futile rise of the Grange Party Ernest and the socialist leaders fought fiercely to capture the farmers but the destruction of the socialist press and publishing houses constituted too great a handicap while the mouth to mouth propaganda had not yet been perfected So it was that politicians like mister Calvin who were themselves farmers long since expropriated captured the farmers and threw their political strength away in a vain campaign The poor farmers Ernest once laughed savagely the trusts have them both coming and going And that was really the situation The seven great trusts working together had pooled their enormous surpluses and made a farm trust The railroads controlling rates and the bankers and stock exchange gamesters controlling prices had long since bled the farmers into indebtedness The bankers and all the trusts for that matter had likewise long since loaned colossal amounts of money to the farmers The farmers were in the net All that remained to be done was the drawing in of the net This the farm trust proceeded to do The hard times of nineteen twelve had already caused a frightful slump in the farm markets Prices were now deliberately pressed down to bankruptcy while the railroads with extortionate rates broke the back of the farmer camel Thus the farmers were compelled to borrow more and more while they were prevented from paying back old loans Then ensued the great foreclosing of mortgages and enforced collection of notes The farmers simply surrendered the land to the farm trust There was nothing else for them to do And having surrendered the land the farmers next went to work for the farm trust becoming managers superintendents foremen and common laborers They worked for wages They became villeins in short serfs bound to the soil by a living wage They could not leave their masters for their masters composed the Plutocracy They could not go to the cities for there also the Plutocracy was in control They had but one alternative to leave the soil and become vagrants in brief to starve And even there they were frustrated for stringent vagrancy laws were passed and rigidly enforced Of course here and there farmers and even whole communities of farmers escaped expropriation by virtue of exceptional conditions But they were merely strays and did not count and they were gathered in anyway during the following year The destruction of the Roman yeomanry proceeded far less rapidly than the destruction of the American farmers and small capitalists There was momentum in the twentieth century while there was practically none in ancient Rome Numbers of the farmers impelled by an insane lust for the soil and willing to show what beasts they could become tried to escape expropriation by withdrawing from any and all market dealing They sold nothing They bought nothing Among themselves a primitive barter began to spring up Their privation and hardships were terrible but they persisted It became quite a movement in fact The manner in which they were beaten was unique and logical and simple The Plutocracy by virtue of its possession of the government raised their taxes It was the weak joint in their armor Neither buying nor selling they had no money and in the end their land was sold to pay the taxes Thus it was that in the fall of nineteen twelve the socialist leaders with the exception of Ernest decided that the end of capitalism had come What of the hard times and the consequent vast army of the unemployed what of the destruction of the farmers and the middle class and what of the decisive defeat administered all along the line to the labor unions the socialists were really justified in believing that the end of capitalism had come and in themselves throwing down the gauntlet to the Plutocracy Alas how we underestimated the strength of the enemy Everywhere the socialists proclaimed their coming victory at the ballot box while in unmistakable terms they stated the situation The Plutocracy accepted the challenge It was the Plutocracy weighing and balancing that defeated us by dividing our strength It was the Plutocracy through its secret agents that raised the cry that socialism was sacrilegious and atheistic it was the Plutocracy that whipped the churches and especially the Catholic Church into line and robbed us of a portion of the labor vote And it was the Plutocracy through its secret agents of course that encouraged the Grange Party and even spread it to the cities into the ranks of the dying middle class Nevertheless the socialist landslide occurred But instead of a sweeping victory with chief executive officers and majorities in all legislative bodies we found ourselves in the minority It is true we elected fifty Congressmen but when they took their seats in the spring of nineteen thirteen they found themselves without power of any sort Yet they were more fortunate than the Grangers who captured a dozen state governments and who in the spring were not permitted to take possession of the captured offices The incumbents refused to retire and the courts were in the hands of the Oligarchy But this is too far in advance of events I have yet to tell of the stirring times of the winter of nineteen twelve The hard times at home had caused an immense decrease in consumption Labor out of work had no wages with which to buy The result was that the Plutocracy found a greater surplus than ever on its hands This surplus it was compelled to dispose of abroad and what of its colossal plans it needed money Because of its strenuous efforts to dispose of the surplus in the world market the Plutocracy clashed with Germany Economic clashes were usually succeeded by wars and this particular clash was no exception The great German war lord prepared and so did the United States prepare The war cloud hovered dark and ominous The stage was set for a world catastrophe for in all the world were hard times labor troubles perishing middle classes armies of unemployed clashes of economic interests in the world market and mutterings and rumblings of the socialist revolution For a long time these mutterings and rumblings had been heard As far back as nineteen oh six A D Lord Avebury an Englishman uttered the following in the House of Lords The unrest in Europe the spread of socialism and the ominous rise of Anarchism are warnings to the governments and the ruling classes that the condition of the working classes in Europe is becoming intolerable and that if a revolution is to be avoided some steps must be taken to increase wages reduce the hours of labor and lower the prices of the necessaries of life The Wall Street Journal a stock gamesters publication in commenting upon Lord Avebury s speech said These words were spoken by an aristocrat and a member of the most conservative body in all Europe That gives them all the more significance They contain more valuable political economy than is to be found in most of the books They sound a note of warning Take heed gentlemen of the war and navy departments At the same time Sydney Brooks writing in America in Harper s Weekly said You will not hear the socialists mentioned in Washington Why should you The politicians are always the last people in this country to see what is going on under their noses They will jeer at me when I prophesy and prophesy with the utmost confidence that at the next presidential election the socialists will poll over a million votes The Oligarchy wanted the war with Germany And it wanted the war for a dozen reasons In the juggling of events such a war would cause in the reshuffling of the international cards and the making of new treaties and alliances the Oligarchy had much to gain And furthermore the war would consume many national surpluses reduce the armies of unemployed that menaced all countries and give the Oligarchy a breathing space in which to perfect its plans and carry them out Such a war would virtually put the Oligarchy in possession of the world market Also such a war would create a large standing army that need never be disbanded while in the minds of the people would be substituted the issue America versus Germany in place of Socialism versus Oligarchy And truly the war would have done all these things had it not been for the socialists A secret meeting of the Western leaders was held in our four tiny rooms in Pell Street Here was first considered the stand the socialists were to take It was not the first time we had put our foot down upon war but it was the first time we had done so in the United States After our secret meeting we got in touch with the national organization and soon our code cables were passing back and forth across the Atlantic between us and the International Bureau It was at the very beginning of the twentieth century A D that the international organization of the socialists finally formulated their long maturing policy on war Epitomized their doctrine was Why should the workingmen of one country fight with the workingmen of another country for the benefit of their capitalist masters On May twenty one nineteen oh five A D when war threatened between Austria and Italy the socialists of Italy Austria and Hungary held a conference at Trieste and threatened a general strike of the workingmen of both countries in case war was declared This was repeated the following year when the Morocco Affair threatened to involve France Germany and England The German socialists were ready to act with us There were over five million of them many of them in the standing army and in addition they were on friendly terms with the labor unions In both countries the socialists came out in bold declaration against the war and threatened the general strike And in the meantime they made preparation for the general strike Furthermore the revolutionary parties in all countries gave public utterance to the socialist principle of international peace that must be preserved at all hazards even to the extent of revolt and revolution at home The general strike was the one great victory we American socialists won On the fourth of December the American minister was withdrawn from the German capital That night a German fleet made a dash on Honolulu sinking three American cruisers and a revenue cutter and bombarding the city Next day both Germany and the United States declared war and within an hour the socialists called the general strike in both countries For the first time the German war lord faced the men of his empire who made his empire go Without them he could not run his empire The novelty of the situation lay in that their revolt was passive They did not fight They did nothing And by doing nothing they tied their war lord s hands He would have asked for nothing better than an opportunity to loose his war dogs on his rebellious proletariat But this was denied him He could not loose his war dogs Neither could he mobilize his army to go forth to war nor could he punish his recalcitrant subjects Not a wheel moved in his empire Not a train ran not a telegraphic message went over the wires for the telegraphers and railroad men had ceased work along with the rest of the population And as it was in Germany so it was in the United States At last organized labor had learned its lesson Beaten decisively on its own chosen field it had abandoned that field and come over to the political field of the socialists for the general strike was a political strike Besides organized labor had been so badly beaten that it did not care It joined in the general strike out of sheer desperation The workers threw down their tools and left their tasks by the millions Especially notable were the machinists Their heads were bloody their organization had apparently been destroyed yet out they came along with their allies in the metal working trades Even the common laborers and all unorganized labor ceased work The strike had tied everything up so that nobody could work Besides the women proved to be the strongest promoters of the strike They set their faces against the war They did not want their men to go forth to die Then also the idea of the general strike caught the mood of the people It struck their sense of humor The idea was infectious The children struck in all the schools and such teachers as came went home again from deserted class rooms The general strike took the form of a great national picnic And the idea of the solidarity of labor so evidenced appealed to the imagination of all And finally there was no danger to be incurred by the colossal frolic When everybody was guilty how was anybody to be punished The United States was paralyzed No one knew what was happening There were no newspapers no letters no despatches Every community was as completely isolated as though ten thousand miles of primeval wilderness stretched between it and the rest of the world For that matter the world had ceased to exist And for a week this state of affairs was maintained In San Francisco we did not know what was happening even across the bay in Oakland or Berkeley The effect on one s sensibilities was weird depressing It seemed as though some great cosmic thing lay dead The pulse of the land had ceased to beat Of a truth the nation had died There were no wagons rumbling on the streets no factory whistles no hum of electricity in the air no passing of street cars no cries of news boys nothing but persons who at rare intervals went by like furtive ghosts themselves oppressed and made unreal by the silence And during that week of silence the Oligarchy was taught its lesson And well it learned the lesson The general strike was a warning It should never occur again The Oligarchy would see to that At the end of the week as had been prearranged the telegraphers of Germany and the United States returned to their posts Through them the socialist leaders of both countries presented their ultimatum to the rulers The war should be called off or the general strike would continue It did not take long to come to an understanding The war was declared off and the populations of both countries returned to their tasks It was this renewal of peace that brought about the alliance between Germany and the United States In reality this was an alliance between the Emperor and the Oligarchy for the purpose of meeting their common foe the revolutionary proletariat of both countries And it was this alliance that the Oligarchy afterward so treacherously broke when the German socialists rose and drove the war lord from his throne It was the very thing the Oligarchy had played for the destruction of its great rival in the world market With the German Emperor out of the way Germany would have no surplus to sell abroad By the very nature of the socialist state the German population would consume all that it produced Of course it would trade abroad certain things it produced for things it did not produce but this would be quite different from an unconsumable surplus I ll wager the Oligarchy finds justification Ernest said when its treachery to the German Emperor became known As usual the Oligarchy will believe it has done right And sure enough The Oligarchy s public defence for the act was that it had done it for the sake of the American people whose interests it was looking out for It had flung its hated rival out of the world market and enabled us to dispose of our surplus in that market And the howling folly of it is that we are so helpless that such idiots really are managing our interests was Ernest s comment They have enabled us to sell more abroad which means that we ll be compelled to consume less at home CHAPTER XIV THE BEGINNING OF THE END As early as January nineteen thirteen Ernest saw the true trend of affairs but he could not get his brother leaders to see the vision of the Iron Heel that had arisen in his brain They were too confident Events were rushing too rapidly to culmination A crisis had come in world affairs The American Oligarchy was practically in possession of the world market and scores of countries were flung out of that market with unconsumable and unsalable surpluses on their hands For such countries nothing remained but reorganization They could not continue their method of producing surpluses The capitalistic system so far as they were concerned had hopelessly broken down The reorganization of these countries took the form of revolution It was a time of confusion and violence Everywhere institutions and governments were crashing Everywhere with the exception of two or three countries the erstwhile capitalist masters fought bitterly for their possessions But the governments were taken away from them by the militant proletariat At last was being realized Karl Marx s classic The knell of private capitalist property sounds The expropriators are expropriated And as fast as capitalistic governments crashed cooperative commonwealths arose in their place Why does the United States lag behind Get busy you American revolutionists What s the matter with America were the messages sent to us by our successful comrades in other lands But we could not keep up The Oligarchy stood in the way Its bulk like that of some huge monster blocked our path Wait till we take office in the spring we answered Then you ll see Behind this lay our secret We had won over the Grangers and in the spring a dozen states would pass into their hands by virtue of the elections of the preceding fall At once would be instituted a dozen cooperative commonwealth states After that the rest would be easy But what if the Grangers fail to get possession Ernest demanded And his comrades called him a calamity howler But this failure to get possession was not the chief danger that Ernest had in mind What he foresaw was the defection of the great labor unions and the rise of the castes Ghent has taught the oligarchs how to do it Ernest said I ll wager they ve made a text book out of his Benevolent Feudalism Our Benevolent Feudalism a book published in nineteen oh two A D by W J Ghent It has always been insisted that Ghent put the idea of the Oligarchy into the minds of the great capitalists This belief persists throughout the literature of the three centuries of the Iron Heel and even in the literature of the first century of the Brotherhood of Man To day we know better but our knowledge does not overcome the fact that Ghent remains the most abused innocent man in all history Never shall I forget the night when after a hot discussion with half a dozen labor leaders Ernest turned to me and said quietly That settles it The Iron Heel has won The end is in sight This little conference in our home was unofficial but Ernest like the rest of his comrades was working for assurances from the labor leaders that they would call out their men in the next general strike O Connor the president of the Association of Machinists had been foremost of the six leaders present in refusing to give such assurance You have seen that you were beaten soundly at your old tactics of strike and boycott Ernest urged O Connor and the others nodded their heads And you saw what a general strike would do Ernest went on We stopped the war with Germany Never was there so fine a display of the solidarity and the power of labor Labor can and will rule the world If you continue to stand with us we ll put an end to the reign of capitalism It is your only hope And what is more you know it There is no other way out No matter what you do under your old tactics you are doomed to defeat if for no other reason because the masters control the courts As a sample of the decisions of the courts adverse to labor the following instances are given In the coal mining regions the employment of children was notorious In nineteen oh five A D labor succeeded in getting a law passed in Pennsylvania providing that proof of the age of the child and of certain educational qualifications must accompany the oath of the parent This was promptly declared unconstitutional by the Luzerne County Court on the ground that it violated the Fourteenth Amendment in that it discriminated between individuals of the same class namely children above fourteen years of age and children below The state court sustained the decision The New York Court of Special Sessions in nineteen oh five A D declared unconstitutional the law prohibiting minors and women from working in factories after nine o clock at night the ground taken being that such a law was class legislation Again the bakers of that time were terribly overworked The New York Legislature passed a law restricting work in bakeries to ten hours a day In nineteen oh six A D the Supreme Court of the United States declared this law to be unconstitutional In part the decision read There is no reasonable ground for interfering with the liberty of persons or the right of free contract by determining the hours of labor in the occupation of a baker You run ahead too fast O Connor answered You don t know all the ways out There is another way out We know what we re about We re sick of strikes They ve got us beaten that way to a frazzle But I don t think we ll ever need to call our men out again What is your way out Ernest demanded bluntly O Connor laughed and shook his head I can tell you this much We ve not been asleep And we re not dreaming now There s nothing to be afraid of or ashamed of I hope Ernest challenged I guess we know our business best was the retort It s a dark business from the way you hide it Ernest said with growing anger We ve paid for our experience in sweat and blood and we ve earned all that s coming to us was the reply Charity begins at home If you re afraid to tell me your way out I ll tell it to you Ernest s blood was up You re going in for grab sharing You ve made terms with the enemy that s what you ve done You ve sold out the cause of labor of all labor You are leaving the battle field like cowards I m not saying anything O Connor answered sullenly Only I guess we know what s best for us a little bit better than you do And you don t care a cent for what is best for the rest of labor You kick it into the ditch I m not saying anything O Connor replied except that I m president of the Machinists Association and it s my business to consider the interests of the men I represent that s all And then when the labor leaders had left Ernest with the calmness of defeat outlined to me the course of events to come The socialists used to foretell with joy he said the coming of the day when organized labor defeated on the industrial field would come over on to the political field Well the Iron Heel has defeated the labor unions on the industrial field and driven them over to the political field and instead of this being joyful for us it will be a source of grief The Iron Heel learned its lesson We showed it our power in the general strike It has taken steps to prevent another general strike But how I asked Simply by subsidizing the great unions They won t join in the next general strike Therefore it won t be a general strike But the Iron Heel can t maintain so costly a programme forever I objected Oh it hasn t subsidized all of the unions That s not necessary Here is what is going to happen Wages are going to be advanced and hours shortened in the railroad unions the iron and steel workers unions and the engineer and machinist unions In these unions more favorable conditions will continue to prevail Membership in these unions will become like seats in Paradise Still I don t see I objected What is to become of the other unions There are far more unions outside of this combination than in it The other unions will be ground out of existence all of them For don t you see the railway men machinists and engineers iron and steel workers do all of the vitally essential work in our machine civilization Assured of their faithfulness the Iron Heel can snap its fingers at all the rest of labor Iron steel coal machinery and transportation constitute the backbone of the whole industrial fabric But coal I queried There are nearly a million coal miners They are practically unskilled labor They will not count Their wages will go down and their hours will increase They will be slaves like all the rest of us and they will become about the most bestial of all of us They will be compelled to work just as the farmers are compelled to work now for the masters who robbed them of their land And the same with all the other unions outside the combination Watch them wobble and go to pieces and their members become slaves driven to toil by empty stomachs and the law of the land Do you know what will happen to Farley and his strike breakers I ll tell you Strike breaking as an occupation will cease There won t be any more strikes In place of strikes will be slave revolts Farley and his gang will be promoted to slave driving Oh it won t be called that it will be called enforcing the law of the land that compels the laborers to work It simply prolongs the fight this treachery of the big unions Heaven only knows now where and when the Revolution will triumph James Farley a notorious strike breaker of the period A man more courageous than ethical and of undeniable ability He rose high under the rule of the Iron Heel and finally was translated into the oligarch class He was assassinated in nineteen thirty two by Sarah Jenkins whose husband thirty years before had been killed by Farley s strike breakers But with such a powerful combination as the Oligarchy and the big unions is there any reason to believe that the Revolution will ever triumph I queried May not the combination endure forever He shook his head One of our generalizations is that every system founded upon class and caste contains within itself the germs of its own decay When a system is founded upon class how can caste be prevented The Iron Heel will not be able to prevent it and in the end caste will destroy the Iron Heel The oligarchs have already developed caste among themselves but wait until the favored unions develop caste The Iron Heel will use all its power to prevent it but it will fail In the favored unions are the flower of the American workingmen They are strong efficient men They have become members of those unions through competition for place Every fit workman in the United States will be possessed by the ambition to become a member of the favored unions The Oligarchy will encourage such ambition and the consequent competition Thus will the strong men who might else be revolutionists be won away and their strength used to bolster the Oligarchy On the other hand the labor castes the members of the favored unions will strive to make their organizations into close corporations And they will succeed Membership in the labor castes will become hereditary Sons will succeed fathers and there will be no inflow of new strength from that eternal reservoir of strength the common people This will mean deterioration of the labor castes and in the end they will become weaker and weaker At the same time as an institution they will become temporarily all powerful They will be like the guards of the palace in old Rome and there will be palace revolutions whereby the labor castes will seize the reins of power And there will be counter palace revolutions of the oligarchs and sometimes the one and sometimes the other will be in power And through it all the inevitable caste weakening will go on so that in the end the common people will come into their own This foreshadowing of a slow social evolution was made when Ernest was first depressed by the defection of the great unions I never agreed with him in it and I disagree now as I write these lines more heartily than ever for even now though Ernest is gone we are on the verge of the revolt that will sweep all oligarchies away Yet I have here given Ernest s prophecy because it was his prophecy In spite of his belief in it he worked like a giant against it and he more than any man has made possible the revolt that even now waits the signal to burst forth Everhard s social foresight was remarkable As clearly as in the light of past events he saw the defection of the favored unions the rise and the slow decay of the labor castes and the struggle between the decaying oligarchs and labor castes for control of the great governmental machine But if the Oligarchy persists I asked him that evening what will become of the great surpluses that will fall to its share every year The surpluses will have to be expended somehow he answered and trust the oligarchs to find a way Magnificent roads will be built There will be great achievements in science and especially in art When the oligarchs have completely mastered the people they will have time to spare for other things They will become worshippers of beauty They will become art lovers And under their direction and generously rewarded will toil the artists The result will be great art for no longer as up to yesterday will the artists pander to the bourgeois taste of the middle class It will be great art I tell you and wonder cities will arise that will make tawdry and cheap the cities of old time And in these cities will the oligarchs dwell and worship beauty We cannot but marvel at Everhard s foresight Before ever the thought of wonder cities like Ardis and Asgard entered the minds of the oligarchs Everhard saw those cities and the inevitable necessity for their creation Thus will the surplus be constantly expended while labor does the work The building of these great works and cities will give a starvation ration to millions of common laborers for the enormous bulk of the surplus will compel an equally enormous expenditure and the oligarchs will build for a thousand years ay for ten thousand years They will build as the Egyptians and the Babylonians never dreamed of building and when the oligarchs have passed away their great roads and their wonder cities will remain for the brotherhood of labor to tread upon and dwell within And since that day of prophecy have passed away the three centuries of the Iron Heel and the four centuries of the Brotherhood of Man and to day we tread the roads and dwell in the cities that the oligarchs built It is true we are even now building still more wonderful wonder cities but the wonder cities of the oligarchs endure and I write these lines in Ardis one of the most wonderful of them all These things the oligarchs will do because they cannot help doing them These great works will be the form their expenditure of the surplus will take and in the same way that the ruling classes of Egypt of long ago expended the surplus they robbed from the people by the building of temples and pyramids Under the oligarchs will flourish not a priest class but an artist class And in place of the merchant class of bourgeoisie will be the labor castes And beneath will be the abyss wherein will fester and starve and rot and ever renew itself the common people the great bulk of the population And in the end who knows in what day the common people will rise up out of the abyss the labor castes and the Oligarchy will crumble away and then at last after the travail of the centuries will it be the day of the common man I had thought to see that day but now I know that I shall never see it He paused and looked at me and added Social evolution is exasperatingly slow isn t it sweetheart My arms were about him and his head was on my breast Sing me to sleep he murmured whimsically I have had a visioning and I wish to forget CHAPTER XV LAST DAYS It was near the end of January nineteen thirteen that the changed attitude of the Oligarchy toward the favored unions was made public The newspapers published information of an unprecedented rise in wages and shortening of hours for the railroad employees the iron and steel workers and the engineers and machinists But the whole truth was not told The oligarchs did not dare permit the telling of the whole truth In reality the wages had been raised much higher and the privileges were correspondingly greater All this was secret but secrets will out Members of the favored unions told their wives and the wives gossiped and soon all the labor world knew what had happened It was merely the logical development of what in the nineteenth century had been known as grab sharing In the industrial warfare of that time profit sharing had been tried That is the capitalists had striven to placate the workers by interesting them financially in their work But profit sharing as a system was ridiculous and impossible Profit sharing could be successful only in isolated cases in the midst of a system of industrial strife for if all labor and all capital shared profits the same conditions would obtain as did obtain when there was no profit sharing So out of the unpractical idea of profit sharing arose the practical idea of grab sharing Give us more pay and charge it to the public was the slogan of the strong unions And here and there this selfish policy worked successfully In charging it to the public it was charged to the great mass of unorganized labor and of weakly organized labor These workers actually paid the increased wages of their stronger brothers who were members of unions that were labor monopolies This idea as I say was merely carried to its logical conclusion on a large scale by the combination of the oligarchs and the favored unions All the railroad unions entered into this combination with the oligarchs and it is of interest to note that the first definite application of the policy of profit grabbing was made by a railroad union in the nineteenth century A D namely the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers P M Arthur was for twenty years Grand Chief of the Brotherhood After the strike on the Pennsylvania Railroad in eighteen seventy seven he broached a scheme to have the Locomotive Engineers make terms with the railroads and to go it alone so far as the rest of the labor unions were concerned This scheme was eminently successful It was as successful as it was selfish and out of it was coined the word arthurization to denote grab sharing on the part of labor unions This word arthurization has long puzzled the etymologists but its derivation I hope is now made clear As soon as the secret of the defection of the favored unions leaked out there were rumblings and mutterings in the labor world Next the favored unions withdrew from the international organizations and broke off all affiliations Then came trouble and violence The members of the favored unions were branded as traitors and in saloons and brothels on the streets and at work and in fact everywhere they were assaulted by the comrades they had so treacherously deserted Countless heads were broken and there were many killed No member of the favored unions was safe They gathered together in bands in order to go to work or to return from work They walked always in the middle of the street On the sidewalk they were liable to have their skulls crushed by bricks and cobblestones thrown from windows and house tops They were permitted to carry weapons and the authorities aided them in every way Their persecutors were sentenced to long terms in prison where they were harshly treated while no man not a member of the favored unions was permitted to carry weapons Violation of this law was made a high misdemeanor and punished accordingly Outraged labor continued to wreak vengeance on the traitors Caste lines formed automatically The children of the traitors were persecuted by the children of the workers who had been betrayed until it was impossible for the former to play on the streets or to attend the public schools Also the wives and families of the traitors were ostracized while the corner groceryman who sold provisions to them was boycotted As a result driven back upon themselves from every side the traitors and their families became clannish Finding it impossible to dwell in safety in the midst of the betrayed proletariat they moved into new localities inhabited by themselves alone In this they were favored by the oligarchs Good dwellings modern and sanitary were built for them surrounded by spacious yards and separated here and there by parks and playgrounds Their children attended schools especially built for them and in these schools manual training and applied science were specialized upon Thus and unavoidably at the very beginning out of this segregation arose caste The members of the favored unions became the aristocracy of labor They were set apart from the rest of labor They were better housed better clothed better fed better treated They were grab sharing with a vengeance In the meantime the rest of the working class was more harshly treated Many little privileges were taken away from it while its wages and its standard of living steadily sank down Incidentally its public schools deteriorated and education slowly ceased to be compulsory The increase in the younger generation of children who could not read nor write was perilous The capture of the world market by the United States had disrupted the rest of the world Institutions and governments were everywhere crashing or transforming Germany Italy France Australia and New Zealand were busy forming cooperative commonwealths The British Empire was falling apart England s hands were full In India revolt was in full swing The cry in all Asia was Asia for the Asiatics And behind this cry was Japan ever urging and aiding the yellow and brown races against the white And while Japan dreamed of continental empire and strove to realize the dream she suppressed her own proletarian revolution It was a simple war of the castes Coolie versus Samurai and the coolie socialists were executed by tens of thousands Forty thousand were killed in the street fighting of Tokio and in the futile assault on the Mikado s palace Kobe was a shambles the slaughter of the cotton operatives by machine guns became classic as the most terrific execution ever achieved by modern war machines Most savage of all was the Japanese Oligarchy that arose Japan dominated the East and took to herself the whole Asiatic portion of the world market with the exception of India England managed to crush her own proletarian revolution and to hold on to India though she was brought to the verge of exhaustion Also she was compelled to let her great colonies slip away from her So it was that the socialists succeeded in making Australia and New Zealand into cooperative commonwealths And it was for the same reason that Canada was lost to the mother country But Canada crushed her own socialist revolution being aided in this by the Iron Heel At the same time the Iron Heel helped Mexico and Cuba to put down revolt The result was that the Iron Heel was firmly established in the New World It had welded into one compact political mass the whole of North America from the Panama Canal to the Arctic Ocean And England at the sacrifice of her great colonies had succeeded only in retaining India But this was no more than temporary The struggle with Japan and the rest of Asia for India was merely delayed England was destined shortly to lose India while behind that event loomed the struggle between a united Asia and the world And while all the world was torn with conflict we of the United States were not placid and peaceful The defection of the great unions had prevented our proletarian revolt but violence was everywhere In addition to the labor troubles and the discontent of the farmers and of the remnant of the middle class a religious revival had blazed up An offshoot of the Seventh Day Adventists sprang into sudden prominence proclaiming the end of the world Confusion thrice confounded Ernest cried How can we hope for solidarity with all these cross purposes and conflicts And truly the religious revival assumed formidable proportions The people what of their wretchedness and of their disappointment in all things earthly were ripe and eager for a heaven where industrial tyrants entered no more than camels passed through needle eyes Wild eyed itinerant preachers swarmed over the land and despite the prohibition of the civil authorities and the persecution for disobedience the flames of religious frenzy were fanned by countless camp meetings It was the last days they claimed the beginning of the end of the world The four winds had been loosed God had stirred the nations to strife It was a time of visions and miracles while seers and prophetesses were legion The people ceased work by hundreds of thousands and fled to the mountains there to await the imminent coming of God and the rising of the hundred and forty and four thousand to heaven But in the meantime God did not come and they starved to death in great numbers In their desperation they ravaged the farms for food and the consequent tumult and anarchy in the country districts but increased the woes of the poor expropriated farmers Also the farms and warehouses were the property of the Iron Heel Armies of troops were put into the field and the fanatics were herded back at the bayonet point to their tasks in the cities There they broke out in ever recurring mobs and riots Their leaders were executed for sedition or confined in madhouses Those who were executed went to their deaths with all the gladness of martyrs It was a time of madness The unrest spread In the swamps and deserts and waste places from Florida to Alaska the small groups of Indians that survived were dancing ghost dances and waiting the coming of a Messiah of their own And through it all with a serenity and certitude that was terrifying continued to rise the form of that monster of the ages the Oligarchy With iron hand and iron heel it mastered the surging millions out of confusion brought order out of the very chaos wrought its own foundation and structure Just wait till we get in the Grangers said Calvin said it to us in our Pell Street quarters Look at the states we ve captured With you socialists to back us we ll make them sing another song when we take office The millions of the discontented and the impoverished are ours the socialists said The Grangers have come over to us the farmers the middle class and the laborers The capitalist system will fall to pieces In another month we send fifty men to Congress Two years hence every office will be ours from the President down to the local dog catcher To all of which Ernest would shake his head and say How many rifles have you got Do you know where you can get plenty of lead When it comes to powder chemical mixtures are better than mechanical mixtures you take my word CHAPTER XVI THE END When it came time for Ernest and me to go to Washington father did not accompany us He had become enamoured of proletarian life He looked upon our slum neighborhood as a great sociological laboratory and he had embarked upon an apparently endless orgy of investigation He chummed with the laborers and was an intimate in scores of homes Also he worked at odd jobs and the work was play as well as learned investigation for he delighted in it and was always returning home with copious notes and bubbling over with new adventures He was the perfect scientist There was no need for his working at all because Ernest managed to earn enough from his translating to take care of the three of us But father insisted on pursuing his favorite phantom and a protean phantom it was judging from the jobs he worked at I shall never forget the evening he brought home his street pedler s outfit of shoe laces and suspenders nor the time I went into the little corner grocery to make some purchase and had him wait on me After that I was not surprised when he tended bar for a week in the saloon across the street He worked as a night watchman hawked potatoes on the street pasted labels in a cannery warehouse was utility man in a paper box factory and water carrier for a street railway construction gang and even joined the Dishwashers Union just before it fell to pieces I think the Bishop s example so far as wearing apparel was concerned must have fascinated father for he wore the cheap cotton shirt of the laborer and the overalls with the narrow strap about the hips Yet one habit remained to him from the old life he always dressed for dinner or supper rather I could be happy anywhere with Ernest and father s happiness in our changed circumstances rounded out my own happiness When I was a boy father said I was very curious I wanted to know why things were and how they came to pass That was why I became a physicist The life in me to day is just as curious as it was in my boyhood and it s the being curious that makes life worth living Sometimes he ventured north of Market Street into the shopping and theatre district where he sold papers ran errands and opened cabs There one day closing a cab he encountered mister Wickson In high glee father described the incident to us that evening Wickson looked at me sharply when I closed the door on him and muttered Well I ll be damned Just like that he said it Well I ll be damned His face turned red and he was so confused that he forgot to tip me But he must have recovered himself quickly for the cab hadn t gone fifty feet before it turned around and came back He leaned out of the door Look here Professor he said this is too much What can I do for you I closed the cab door for you I answered According to common custom you might give me a dime Bother that he snorted I mean something substantial He was certainly serious a twinge of ossified conscience or something and so I considered with grave deliberation for a moment His face was quite expectant when I began my answer but you should have seen it when I finished You might give me back my home I said and my stock in the Sierra Mills Father paused What did he say I questioned eagerly What could he say He said nothing But I said I hope you are happy He looked at me curiously Tell me are you happy I asked He ordered the cabman to drive on and went away swearing horribly And he didn t give me the dime much less the home and stock so you see my dear your father s street arab career is beset with disappointments And so it was that father kept on at our Pell Street quarters while Ernest and I went to Washington Except for the final consummation the old order had passed away and the final consummation was nearer than I dreamed Contrary to our expectation no obstacles were raised to prevent the socialist Congressmen from taking their seats Everything went smoothly and I laughed at Ernest when he looked upon the very smoothness as something ominous We found our socialist comrades confident optimistic of their strength and of the things they would accomplish A few Grangers who had been elected to Congress increased our strength and an elaborate programme of what was to be done was prepared by the united forces In all of which Ernest joined loyally and energetically though he could not forbear now and again from saying apropos of nothing in particular When it comes to powder chemical mixtures are better than mechanical mixtures you take my word The trouble arose first with the Grangers in the various states they had captured at the last election There were a dozen of these states but the Grangers who had been elected were not permitted to take office The incumbents refused to get out It was very simple They merely charged illegality in the elections and wrapped up the whole situation in the interminable red tape of the law The Grangers were powerless The courts were in the hands of their enemies This was the moment of danger If the cheated Grangers became violent all was lost How we socialists worked to hold them back There were days and nights when Ernest never closed his eyes in sleep The big leaders of the Grangers saw the peril and were with us to a man But it was all of no avail The Oligarchy wanted violence and it set its agents provocateurs to work Without discussion it was the agents provocateurs who caused the Peasant Revolt In a dozen states the revolt flared up The expropriated farmers took forcible possession of the state governments Of course this was unconstitutional and of course the United States put its soldiers into the field Everywhere the agents provocateurs urged the people on These emissaries of the Iron Heel disguised themselves as artisans farmers and farm laborers In Sacramento the capital of California the Grangers had succeeded in maintaining order Thousands of secret agents were rushed to the devoted city In mobs composed wholly of themselves they fired and looted buildings and factories They worked the people up until they joined them in the pillage Liquor in large quantities was distributed among the slum classes further to inflame their minds And then when all was ready appeared upon the scene the soldiers of the United States who were in reality the soldiers of the Iron Heel Eleven thousand men women and children were shot down on the streets of Sacramento or murdered in their houses The national government took possession of the state government and all was over for California And as with California so elsewhere Every Granger state was ravaged with violence and washed in blood First disorder was precipitated by the secret agents and the Black Hundreds then the troops were called out Rioting and mob rule reigned throughout the rural districts Day and night the smoke of burning farms warehouses villages and cities filled the sky Dynamite appeared Railroad bridges and tunnels were blown up and trains were wrecked The poor farmers were shot and hanged in great numbers Reprisals were bitter and many plutocrats and army officers were murdered Blood and vengeance were in men s hearts The regular troops fought the farmers as savagely as had they been Indians And the regular troops had cause Twenty eight hundred of them had been annihilated in a tremendous series of dynamite explosions in Oregon and in a similar manner a number of train loads at different times and places had been destroyed So it was that the regular troops fought for their lives as well as did the farmers As for the militia the militia law of nineteen oh three was put into effect and the workers of one state were compelled under pain of death to shoot down their comrade workers in other states Of course the militia law did not work smoothly at first Many militia officers were murdered and many militiamen were executed by drumhead court martial Ernest s prophecy was strikingly fulfilled in the cases of mister Kowalt and mister Asmunsen Both were eligible for the militia and both were drafted to serve in the punitive expedition that was despatched from California against the farmers of Missouri mister Kowalt and mister Asmunsen refused to serve They were given short shrift Drumhead court martial was their portion and military execution their end They were shot with their backs to the firing squad Many young men fled into the mountains to escape serving in the militia There they became outlaws and it was not until more peaceful times that they received their punishment It was drastic The government issued a proclamation for all law abiding citizens to come in from the mountains for a period of three months When the proclaimed date arrived half a million soldiers were sent into the mountainous districts everywhere There was no investigation no trial Wherever a man was encountered he was shot down on the spot The troops operated on the basis that no man not an outlaw remained in the mountains Some bands in strong positions fought gallantly but in the end every deserter from the militia met death A more immediate lesson however was impressed on the minds of the people by the punishment meted out to the Kansas militia The great Kansas Mutiny occurred at the very beginning of military operations against the Grangers Six thousand of the militia mutinied They had been for several weeks very turbulent and sullen and for that reason had been kept in camp Their open mutiny however was without doubt precipitated by the agents provocateurs On the night of the twenty twod of April they arose and murdered their officers only a small remnant of the latter escaping This was beyond the scheme of the Iron Heel for the agents provocateurs had done their work too well But everything was grist to the Iron Heel It had prepared for the outbreak and the killing of so many officers gave it justification for what followed As by magic forty thousand soldiers of the regular army surrounded the malcontents It was a trap The wretched militiamen found that their machine guns had been tampered with and that the cartridges from the captured magazines did not fit their rifles They hoisted the white flag of surrender but it was ignored There were no survivors The entire six thousand were annihilated Common shell and shrapnel were thrown in upon them from a distance and when in their desperation they charged the encircling lines they were mowed down by the machine guns I talked with an eye witness and he said that the nearest any militiaman approached the machine guns was a hundred and fifty yards The earth was carpeted with the slain and a final charge of cavalry with trampling of horses hoofs revolvers and sabres crushed the wounded into the ground Simultaneously with the destruction of the Grangers came the revolt of the coal miners It was the expiring effort of organized labor Three quarters of a million of miners went out on strike But they were too widely scattered over the country to advantage from their own strength They were segregated in their own districts and beaten into submission This was the first great slave drive Pocock won his spurs as a slave driver and earned the undying hatred of the proletariat Countless attempts were made upon his life but he seemed to bear a charmed existence It was he who was responsible for the introduction of the Russian passport system among the miners and the denial of their right of removal from one part of the country to another Albert Pocock another of the notorious strike breakers of earlier years who to the day of his death successfully held all the coal miners of the country to their task He was succeeded by his son Lewis Pocock and for five generations this remarkable line of slave drivers handled the coal mines The elder Pocock known as Pocock I has been described as follows A long lean head semicircled by a fringe of brown and gray hair with big cheek bones and a heavy chin a pale face lustreless gray eyes a metallic voice and a languid manner He was born of humble parents and began his career as a bartender He next became a private detective for a street railway corporation and by successive steps developed into a professional strikebreaker Pocock V the last of the line was blown up in a pump house by a bomb during a petty revolt of the miners in the Indian Territory This occurred in twenty seventy three A D In the meantime the socialists held firm While the Grangers expired in flame and blood and organized labor was disrupted the socialists held their peace and perfected their secret organization In vain the Grangers pleaded with us We rightly contended that any revolt on our part was virtually suicide for the whole Revolution The Iron Heel at first dubious about dealing with the entire proletariat at one time had found the work easier than it had expected and would have asked nothing better than an uprising on our part But we avoided the issue in spite of the fact that agents provocateurs swarmed in our midst In those early days the agents of the Iron Heel were clumsy in their methods They had much to learn and in the meantime our Fighting Groups weeded them out It was bitter bloody work but we were fighting for life and for the Revolution and we had to fight the enemy with its own weapons Yet we were fair No agent of the Iron Heel was executed without a trial We may have made mistakes but if so very rarely The bravest and the most combative and self sacrificing of our comrades went into the Fighting Groups Once after ten years had passed Ernest made a calculation from figures furnished by the chiefs of the Fighting Groups and his conclusion was that the average life of a man or woman after becoming a member was five years The comrades of the Fighting Groups were heroes all and the peculiar thing about it was that they were opposed to the taking of life They violated their own natures yet they loved liberty and knew of no sacrifice too great to make for the Cause These Fighting groups were modelled somewhat after the Fighting Organization of the Russian Revolution and despite the unceasing efforts of the Iron Heel these groups persisted throughout the three centuries of its existence Composed of men and women actuated by lofty purpose and unafraid to die the Fighting Groups exercised tremendous influence and tempered the savage brutality of the rulers Not alone was their work confined to unseen warfare with the secret agents of the Oligarchy The oligarchs themselves were compelled to listen to the decrees of the Groups and often when they disobeyed were punished by death and likewise with the subordinates of the oligarchs with the officers of the army and the leaders of the labor castes Stern justice was meted out by these organized avengers but most remarkable was their passionless and judicial procedure There were no snap judgments When a man was captured he was given fair trial and opportunity for defence Of necessity many men were tried and condemned by proxy as in the case of General Lampton This occurred in twenty one thirty eight A D Possibly the most bloodthirsty and malignant of all the mercenaries that ever served the Iron Heel he was informed by the Fighting Groups that they had tried him found him guilty and condemned him to death and this after three warnings for him to cease from his ferocious treatment of the proletariat After his condemnation he surrounded himself with a myriad protective devices Years passed and in vain the Fighting Groups strove to execute their decree Comrade after comrade men and women failed in their attempts and were cruelly executed by the Oligarchy It was the case of General Lampton that revived crucifixion as a legal method of execution But in the end the condemned man found his executioner in the form of a slender girl of seventeen Madeline Provence who to accomplish her purpose served two years in his palace as a seamstress to the household She died in solitary confinement after horrible and prolonged torture but to day she stands in imperishable bronze in the Pantheon of Brotherhood in the wonder city of Serles We who by personal experience know nothing of bloodshed must not judge harshly the heroes of the Fighting Groups They gave up their lives for humanity no sacrifice was too great for them to accomplish while inexorable necessity compelled them to bloody expression in an age of blood The Fighting Groups constituted the one thorn in the side of the Iron Heel that the Iron Heel could never remove Everhard was the father of this curious army and its accomplishments and successful persistence for three hundred years bear witness to the wisdom with which he organized and the solid foundation he laid for the succeeding generations to build upon In some respects despite his great economic and sociological contributions and his work as a general leader in the Revolution his organization of the Fighting Groups must be regarded as his greatest achievement The task we set ourselves was threefold First the weeding out from our circles of the secret agents of the Oligarchy Second the organizing of the Fighting Groups and outside of them of the general secret organization of the Revolution And third the introduction of our own secret agents into every branch of the Oligarchy into the labor castes and especially among the telegraphers and secretaries and clerks into the army the agents provocateurs and the slave drivers It was slow work and perilous and often were our efforts rewarded with costly failures The Iron Heel had triumphed in open warfare but we held our own in the new warfare strange and awful and subterranean that we instituted All was unseen much was unguessed the blind fought the blind and yet through it all was order purpose control We permeated the entire organization of the Iron Heel with our agents while our own organization was permeated with the agents of the Iron Heel It was warfare dark and devious replete with intrigue and conspiracy plot and counterplot And behind all ever menacing was death violent and terrible Men and women disappeared our nearest and dearest comrades We saw them to day To morrow they were gone we never saw them again and we knew that they had died There was no trust no confidence anywhere The man who plotted beside us for all we knew might be an agent of the Iron Heel We mined the organization of the Iron Heel with our secret agents and the Iron Heel countermined with its secret agents inside its own organization And it was the same with our organization And despite the absence of confidence and trust we were compelled to base our every effort on confidence and trust Often were we betrayed Men were weak The Iron Heel could offer money leisure the joys and pleasures that waited in the repose of the wonder cities We could offer nothing but the satisfaction of being faithful to a noble ideal As for the rest the wages of those who were loyal were unceasing peril torture and death Men were weak I say and because of their weakness we were compelled to make the only other reward that was within our power It was the reward of death Out of necessity we had to punish our traitors For every man who betrayed us from one to a dozen faithful avengers were loosed upon his heels We might fail to carry out our decrees against our enemies such as the Pococks for instance but the one thing we could not afford to fail in was the punishment of our own traitors Comrades turned traitor by permission in order to win to the wonder cities and there execute our sentences on the real traitors In fact so terrible did we make ourselves that it became a greater peril to betray us than to remain loyal to us The Revolution took on largely the character of religion We worshipped at the shrine of the Revolution which was the shrine of liberty It was the divine flashing through us Men and women devoted their lives to the Cause and new born babes were sealed to it as of old they had been sealed to the service of God We were lovers of Humanity CHAPTER XVII THE SCARLET LIVERY With the destruction of the Granger states the Grangers in Congress disappeared They were being tried for high treason and their places were taken by the creatures of the Iron Heel The socialists were in a pitiful minority and they knew that their end was near Congress and the Senate were empty pretences farces Public questions were gravely debated and passed upon according to the old forms while in reality all that was done was to give the stamp of constitutional procedure to the mandates of the Oligarchy Ernest was in the thick of the fight when the end came It was in the debate on the bill to assist the unemployed The hard times of the preceding year had thrust great masses of the proletariat beneath the starvation line and the continued and wide reaching disorder had but sunk them deeper Millions of people were starving while the oligarchs and their supporters were surfeiting on the surplus We called these wretched people the people of the abyss and it was to alleviate their awful suffering that the socialists had introduced the unemployed bill But this was not to the fancy of the Iron Heel In its own way it was preparing to set these millions to work but the way was not our way wherefore it had issued its orders that our bill should be voted down Ernest and his fellows knew that their effort was futile but they were tired of the suspense They wanted something to happen They were accomplishing nothing and the best they hoped for was the putting of an end to the legislative farce in which they were unwilling players They knew not what end would come but they never anticipated a more disastrous end than the one that did come The same conditions obtained in the nineteenth century A D under British rule in India The natives died of starvation by the million while their rulers robbed them of the fruits of their toil and expended it on magnificent pageants and mumbo jumbo fooleries Perforce in this enlightened age we have much to blush for in the acts of our ancestors Our only consolation is philosophic We must accept the capitalistic stage in social evolution as about on a par with the earlier monkey stage The human had to pass through those stages in its rise from the mire and slime of low organic life It was inevitable that much of the mire and slime should cling and be not easily shaken off The people of the abyss this phrase was struck out by the genius of H G Wells in the late nineteenth century A D Wells was a sociological seer sane and normal as well as warm human Many fragments of his work have come down to us while two of his greatest achievements Anticipations and Mankind in the Making have come down intact Before the oligarchs and before Everhard Wells speculated upon the building of the wonder cities though in his writings they are referred to as pleasure cities I sat in the gallery that day We all knew that something terrible was imminent It was in the air and its presence was made visible by the armed soldiers drawn up in lines in the corridors and by the officers grouped in the entrances to the House itself The Oligarchy was about to strike Ernest was speaking He was describing the sufferings of the unemployed as if with the wild idea of in some way touching their hearts and consciences but the Republican and Democratic members sneered and jeered at him and there was uproar and confusion Ernest abruptly changed front I know nothing that I may say can influence you he said You have no souls to be influenced You are spineless flaccid things You pompously call yourselves Republicans and Democrats There is no Republican Party There is no Democratic Party There are no Republicans nor Democrats in this House You are lick spittlers and panderers the creatures of the Plutocracy You talk verbosely in antiquated terminology of your love of liberty and all the while you wear the scarlet livery of the Iron Heel Here the shouting and the cries of Order order drowned his voice and he stood disdainfully till the din had somewhat subsided He waved his hand to include all of them turned to his own comrades and said Listen to the bellowing of the well fed beasts Pandemonium broke out again The Speaker rapped for order and glanced expectantly at the officers in the doorways There were cries of Sedition and a great rotund New York member began shouting Anarchist at Ernest And Ernest was not pleasant to look at Every fighting fibre of him was quivering and his face was the face of a fighting animal withal he was cool and collected Remember he said in a voice that made itself heard above the din that as you show mercy now to the proletariat some day will that same proletariat show mercy to you The cries of Sedition and Anarchist redoubled I know that you will not vote for this bill Ernest went on You have received the command from your masters to vote against it And yet you call me anarchist You who have destroyed the government of the people and who shamelessly flaunt your scarlet shame in public places call me anarchist I do not believe in hell fire and brimstone but in moments like this I regret my unbelief Nay in moments like this I almost do believe Surely there must be a hell for in no less place could it be possible for you to receive punishment adequate to your crimes So long as you exist there is a vital need for hell fire in the Cosmos There was movement in the doorways Ernest the Speaker all the members turned to see Why do you not call your soldiers in mister Speaker and bid them do their work Ernest demanded They should carry out your plan with expedition There are other plans afoot was the retort That is why the soldiers are present Our plans I suppose Ernest sneered Assassination or something kindred But at the word assassination the uproar broke out again Ernest could not make himself heard but he remained on his feet waiting for a lull And then it happened From my place in the gallery I saw nothing except the flash of the explosion The roar of it filled my ears and I saw Ernest reeling and falling in a swirl of smoke and the soldiers rushing up all the aisles His comrades were on their feet wild with anger capable of any violence But Ernest steadied himself for a moment and waved his arms for silence It is a plot his voice rang out in warning to his comrades Do nothing or you will be destroyed Then he slowly sank down and the soldiers reached him The next moment soldiers were clearing the galleries and I saw no more Though he was my husband I was not permitted to get to him When I announced who I was I was promptly placed under arrest And at the same time were arrested all socialist Congressmen in Washington including the unfortunate Simpson who lay ill with typhoid fever in his hotel The trial was prompt and brief The men were foredoomed The wonder was that Ernest was not executed This was a blunder on the part of the Oligarchy and a costly one But the Oligarchy was too confident in those days It was drunk with success and little did it dream that that small handful of heroes had within them the power to rock it to its foundations To morrow when the Great Revolt breaks out and all the world resounds with the tramp tramp of the millions the Oligarchy will realize and too late how mightily that band of heroes has grown Avis Everhard took for granted that her narrative would be read in her own day and so omits to mention the outcome of the trial for high treason Many other similar disconcerting omissions will be noticed in the Manuscript Fifty two socialist Congressmen were tried and all were found guilty Strange to relate not one received the death sentence Everhard and eleven others among whom were Theodore Donnelson and Matthew Kent received life imprisonment The remaining forty received sentences varying from thirty to forty five years while Arthur Simpson referred to in the Manuscript as being ill of typhoid fever at the time of the explosion received only fifteen years It is the tradition that he died of starvation in solitary confinement and this harsh treatment is explained as having been caused by his uncompromising stubbornness and his fiery and tactless hatred for all men that served the despotism He died in Cabanas in Cuba where three of his comrades were also confined The fifty two socialist Congressmen were confined in military fortresses scattered all over the United States Thus Du Bois and Woods were held in Porto Rico while Everhard and Merryweather were placed in Alcatraz an island in San Francisco Bay that had already seen long service as a military prison As a revolutionist myself as one on the inside who knew the hopes and fears and secret plans of the revolutionists I am fitted to answer as very few are the charge that they were guilty of exploding the bomb in Congress And I can say flatly without qualification or doubt of any sort that the socialists in Congress and out had no hand in the affair Who threw the bomb we do not know but the one thing we are absolutely sure of is that we did not throw it On the other hand there is evidence to show that the Iron Heel was responsible for the act Of course we cannot prove this Our conclusion is merely presumptive But here are such facts as we do know It had been reported to the Speaker of the House by secret service agents of the government that the Socialist Congressmen were about to resort to terroristic tactics and that they had decided upon the day when their tactics would go into effect This day was the very day of the explosion Wherefore the Capitol had been packed with troops in anticipation Since we knew nothing about the bomb and since a bomb actually was exploded and since the authorities had prepared in advance for the explosion it is only fair to conclude that the Iron Heel did know Furthermore we charge that the Iron Heel was guilty of the outrage and that the Iron Heel planned and perpetrated the outrage for the purpose of foisting the guilt on our shoulders and so bringing about our destruction From the Speaker the warning leaked out to all the creatures in the House that wore the scarlet livery They knew while Ernest was speaking that some violent act was to be committed And to do them justice they honestly believed that the act was to be committed by the socialists At the trial and still with honest belief several testified to having seen Ernest prepare to throw the bomb and that it exploded prematurely Of course they saw nothing of the sort In the fevered imagination of fear they thought they saw that was all As Ernest said at the trial Does it stand to reason if I were going to throw a bomb that I should elect to throw a feeble little squib like the one that was thrown There wasn t enough powder in it It made a lot of smoke but hurt no one except me It exploded right at my feet and yet it did not kill me Believe me when I get to throwing bombs I ll do damage There ll be more than smoke in my petards In return it was argued by the prosecution that the weakness of the bomb was a blunder on the part of the socialists just as its premature explosion caused by Ernest s losing his nerve and dropping it was a blunder And to clinch the argument there were the several Congressmen who testified to having seen Ernest fumble and drop the bomb As for ourselves not one of us knew how the bomb was thrown Ernest told me that the fraction of an instant before it exploded he both heard and saw it strike at his feet He testified to this at the trial but no one believed him Besides the whole thing in popular slang was cooked up The Iron Heel had made up its mind to destroy us and there was no withstanding it There is a saying that truth will out I have come to doubt that saying Nineteen years have elapsed and despite our untiring efforts we have failed to find the man who really did throw the bomb Undoubtedly he was some emissary of the Iron Heel but he has escaped detection We have never got the slightest clew to his identity And now at this late date nothing remains but for the affair to take its place among the mysteries of history Avis Everhard would have had to live for many generations ere she could have seen the clearing up of this particular mystery A little less than a hundred years ago and a little more than six hundred years after the death the confession of Pervaise was discovered in the secret archives of the Vatican It is perhaps well to tell a little something about this obscure document which in the main is of interest to the historian only Pervaise was an American of French descent who in nineteen thirteen A D was lying in the Tombs Prison New York City awaiting trial for murder From his confession we learn that he was not a criminal He was warm blooded passionate emotional In an insane fit of jealousy he killed his wife a very common act in those times Pervaise was mastered by the fear of death all of which is recounted at length in his confession To escape death he would have done anything and the police agents prepared him by assuring him that he could not possibly escape conviction of murder in the first degree when his trial came off In those days murder in the first degree was a capital offense The guilty man or woman was placed in a specially constructed death chair and under the supervision of competent physicians was destroyed by a current of electricity This was called electrocution and it was very popular during that period Anaesthesia as a mode of compulsory death was not introduced until later This man good at heart but with a ferocious animalism close at the surface of his being lying in jail and expectant of nothing less than death was prevailed upon by the agents of the Iron Heel to throw the bomb in the House of Representatives In his confession he states explicitly that he was informed that the bomb was to be a feeble thing and that no lives would be lost This is directly in line with the fact that the bomb was lightly charged and that its explosion at Everhard s feet was not deadly Pervaise was smuggled into one of the galleries ostensibly closed for repairs He was to select the moment for the throwing of the bomb and he naively confesses that in his interest in Everhard s tirade and the general commotion raised thereby he nearly forgot his mission Not only was he released from prison in reward for his deed but he was granted an income for life This he did not long enjoy In nineteen fourteen A D in September he was stricken with rheumatism of the heart and lived for three days It was then that he sent for the Catholic priest Father Peter Durban and to him made confession So important did it seem to the priest that he had the confession taken down in writing and sworn to What happened after this we can only surmise The document was certainly important enough to find its way to Rome Powerful influences must have been brought to bear hence its suppression For centuries no hint of its existence reached the world It was not until in the last century that Lorbia the brilliant Italian scholar stumbled upon it quite by chance during his researches in the Vatican There is to day no doubt whatever that the Iron Heel was responsible for the bomb that exploded in the House of Representatives in nineteen thirteen A D Even though the Pervaise confession had never come to light no reasonable doubt could obtain for the act in question that sent fifty two Congressmen to prison was on a par with countless other acts committed by the oligarchs and before them by the capitalists There is the classic instance of the ferocious and wanton judicial murder of the innocent and so called Haymarket Anarchists in Chicago in the penultimate decade of the nineteenth century A D In a category by itself is the deliberate burning and destruction of capitalist property by the capitalists themselves For such destruction of property innocent men were frequently punished railroaded in the parlance of the times In the labor troubles of the first decade of the twentieth century A D between the capitalists and the Western Federation of Miners similar but more bloody tactics were employed The railroad station at Independence was blown up by the agents of the capitalists Thirteen men were killed and many more were wounded And then the capitalists controlling the legislative and judicial machinery of the state of Colorado charged the miners with the crime and came very near to convicting them Romaines one of the tools in this affair like Pervaise was lying in jail in another state Kansas awaiting trial when he was approached by the agents of the capitalists But unlike Pervaise the confession of Romaines was made public in his own time Then during this same period there was the case of Moyer and Haywood two strong fearless leaders of labor One was president and the other was secretary of the Western Federation of Miners The ex governor of Idaho had been mysteriously murdered The crime at the time was openly charged to the mine owners by the socialists and miners Nevertheless in violation of the national and state constitutions and by means of conspiracy on the parts of the governors of Idaho and Colorado Moyer and Haywood were kidnapped thrown into jail and charged with the murder It was this instance that provoked from Eugene V Debs national leader of the American socialists at the time the following words The labor leaders that cannot be bribed nor bullied must be ambushed and murdered The only crime of Moyer and Haywood is that they have been unswervingly true to the working class The capitalists have stolen our country debauched our politics defiled our judiciary and ridden over us rough shod and now they propose to murder those who will not abjectly surrender to their brutal dominion The governors of Colorado and Idaho are but executing the mandates of their masters the Plutocracy The issue is the Workers versus the Plutocracy If they strike the first violent blow we will strike the last CHAPTER XVIII IN THE SHADOW OF SONOMA Of myself during this period there is not much to say For six months I was kept in prison though charged with no crime I was a suspect a word of fear that all revolutionists were soon to come to know But our own nascent secret service was beginning to work By the end of my second month in prison one of the jailers made himself known as a revolutionist in touch with the organization Several weeks later Joseph Parkhurst the prison doctor who had just been appointed proved himself to be a member of one of the Fighting Groups Thus throughout the organization of the Oligarchy our own organization weblike and spidery was insinuating itself And so I was kept in touch with all that was happening in the world without And furthermore every one of our imprisoned leaders was in contact with brave comrades who masqueraded in the livery of the Iron Heel Though Ernest lay in prison three thousand miles away on the Pacific Coast I was in unbroken communication with him and our letters passed regularly back and forth The leaders in prison and out were able to discuss and direct the campaign It would have been possible within a few months to have effected the escape of some of them but since imprisonment proved no bar to our activities it was decided to avoid anything premature Fifty two Congressmen were in prison and fully three hundred more of our leaders It was planned that they should be delivered simultaneously If part of them escaped the vigilance of the oligarchs might be aroused so as to prevent the escape of the remainder On the other hand it was held that a simultaneous jail delivery all over the land would have immense psychological influence on the proletariat It would show our strength and give confidence So it was arranged when I was released at the end of six months that I was to disappear and prepare a secure hiding place for Ernest To disappear was in itself no easy thing No sooner did I get my freedom than my footsteps began to be dogged by the spies of the Iron Heel It was necessary that they should be thrown off the track and that I should win to California It is laughable the way this was accomplished Already the passport system modelled on the Russian was developing I dared not cross the continent in my own character It was necessary that I should be completely lost if ever I was to see Ernest again for by trailing me after he escaped he would be caught once more Again I could not disguise myself as a proletarian and travel There remained the disguise of a member of the Oligarchy While the arch oligarchs were no more than a handful there were myriads of lesser ones of the type say of mister Wickson men worth a few millions who were adherents of the arch oligarchs The wives and daughters of these lesser oligarchs were legion and it was decided that I should assume the disguise of such a one A few years later this would have been impossible because the passport system was to become so perfect that no man woman nor child in all the land was unregistered and unaccounted for in his or her movements When the time was ripe the spies were thrown off my track An hour later Avis Everhard was no more At that time one Felice Van Verdighan accompanied by two maids and a lap dog with another maid for the lap dog entered a drawing room on a Pullman and a few minutes later was speeding west This ridiculous picture well illustrates the heartless conduct of the masters While people starved lap dogs were waited upon by maids This was a serious masquerade on the part of Avis Everhard Life and death and the Cause were in the issue therefore the picture must be accepted as a true picture It affords a striking commentary of the times Pullman the designation of the more luxurious railway cars of the period and so named from the inventor The three maids who accompanied me were revolutionists Two were members of the Fighting Groups and the third Grace Holbrook entered a group the following year and six months later was executed by the Iron Heel She it was who waited upon the dog Of the other two Bertha Stole disappeared twelve years later while Anna Roylston still lives and plays an increasingly important part in the Revolution Despite continual and almost inconceivable hazards Anna Roylston lived to the royal age of ninety one As the Pococks defied the executioners of the Fighting Groups so she defied the executioners of the Iron Heel She bore a charmed life and prospered amid dangers and alarms She herself was an executioner for the Fighting Groups and known as the Red Virgin she became one of the inspired figures of the Revolution When she was an old woman of sixty nine she shot Bloody Halcliffe down in the midst of his armed escort and got away unscathed In the end she died peaceably of old age in a secret refuge of the revolutionists in the Ozark mountains Without adventure we crossed the United States to California When the train stopped at Sixteenth Street Station in Oakland we alighted and there Felice Van Verdighan with her two maids her lap dog and her lap dog s maid disappeared forever The maids guided by trusty comrades were led away Other comrades took charge of me Within half an hour after leaving the train I was on board a small fishing boat and out on the waters of San Francisco Bay The winds baffled and we drifted aimlessly the greater part of the night But I saw the lights of Alcatraz where Ernest lay and found comfort in the thought of nearness to him By dawn what with the rowing of the fishermen we made the Marin Islands Here we lay in hiding all day and on the following night swept on by a flood tide and a fresh wind we crossed San Pablo Bay in two hours and ran up Petaluma Creek Here horses were ready and another comrade and without delay we were away through the starlight To the north I could see the loom of Sonoma Mountain toward which we rode We left the old town of Sonoma to the right and rode up a canyon that lay between outlying buttresses of the mountain The wagon road became a wood road the wood road became a cow path and the cow path dwindled away and ceased among the upland pastures Straight over Sonoma Mountain we rode It was the safest route There was no one to mark our passing Dawn caught us on the northern brow and in the gray light we dropped down through chaparral into redwood canyons deep and warm with the breath of passing summer It was old country to me that I knew and loved and soon I became the guide The hiding place was mine I had selected it We let down the bars and crossed an upland meadow Next we went over a low oak covered ridge and descended into a smaller meadow Again we climbed a ridge this time riding under red limbed madronos and manzanitas of deeper red The first rays of the sun streamed upon our backs as we climbed A flight of quail thrummed off through the thickets A big jackrabbit crossed our path leaping swiftly and silently like a deer And then a deer a many pronged buck the sun flashing red gold from neck and shoulders cleared the crest of the ridge before us and was gone We followed in his wake a space then dropped down a zigzag trail that he disdained into a group of noble redwoods that stood about a pool of water murky with minerals from the mountain side I knew every inch of the way Once a writer friend of mine had owned the ranch but he too had become a revolutionist though more disastrously than I for he was already dead and gone and none knew where nor how He alone in the days he had lived knew the secret of the hiding place for which I was bound He had bought the ranch for beauty and paid a round price for it much to the disgust of the local farmers He used to tell with great glee how they were wont to shake their heads mournfully at the price to accomplish ponderously a bit of mental arithmetic and then to say But you can t make six per cent on it But he was dead now nor did the ranch descend to his children Of all men it was now the property of mister Wickson who owned the whole eastern and northern slopes of Sonoma Mountain running from the Spreckels estate to the divide of Bennett Valley Out of it he had made a magnificent deer park where over thousands of acres of sweet slopes and glades and canyons the deer ran almost in primitive wildness The people who had owned the soil had been driven away A state home for the feeble minded had also been demolished to make room for the deer To cap it all Wickson s hunting lodge was a quarter of a mile from my hiding place This instead of being a danger was an added security We were sheltered under the very aegis of one of the minor oligarchs Suspicion by the nature of the situation was turned aside The last place in the world the spies of the Iron Heel would dream of looking for me and for Ernest when he joined me was Wickson s deer park We tied our horses among the redwoods at the pool From a cache behind a hollow rotting log my companion brought out a variety of things a fifty pound sack of flour tinned foods of all sorts cooking utensils blankets a canvas tarpaulin books and writing material a great bundle of letters a five gallon can of kerosene an oil stove and last and most important a large coil of stout rope So large was the supply of things that a number of trips would be necessary to carry them to the refuge But the refuge was very near Taking the rope and leading the way I passed through a glade of tangled vines and bushes that ran between two wooded knolls The glade ended abruptly at the steep bank of a stream It was a little stream rising from springs and the hottest summer never dried it up On every hand were tall wooded knolls a group of them with all the seeming of having been flung there from some careless Titan s hand There was no bed rock in them They rose from their bases hundreds of feet and they were composed of red volcanic earth the famous wine soil of Sonoma Through these the tiny stream had cut its deep and precipitous channel It was quite a scramble down to the stream bed and once on the bed we went down stream perhaps for a hundred feet And then we came to the great hole There was no warning of the existence of the hole nor was it a hole in the common sense of the word One crawled through tight locked briers and branches and found oneself on the very edge peering out and down through a green screen A couple of hundred feet in length and width it was half of that in depth Possibly because of some fault that had occurred when the knolls were flung together and certainly helped by freakish erosion the hole had been scooped out in the course of centuries by the wash of water Nowhere did the raw earth appear All was garmented by vegetation from tiny maiden hair and gold back ferns to mighty redwood and Douglas spruces These great trees even sprang out from the walls of the hole Some leaned over at angles as great as forty five degrees though the majority towered straight up from the soft and almost perpendicular earth walls It was a perfect hiding place No one ever came there not even the village boys of Glen Ellen Had this hole existed in the bed of a canyon a mile long or several miles long it would have been well known But this was no canyon From beginning to end the length of the stream was no more than five hundred yards Three hundred yards above the hole the stream took its rise in a spring at the foot of a flat meadow A hundred yards below the hole the stream ran out into open country joining the main stream and flowing across rolling and grass covered land My companion took a turn of the rope around a tree and with me fast on the other end lowered away In no time I was on the bottom And in but a short while he had carried all the articles from the cache and lowered them down to me He hauled the rope up and hid it and before he went away called down to me a cheerful parting Before I go on I want to say a word for this comrade John Carlson a humble figure of the Revolution one of the countless faithful ones in the ranks He worked for Wickson in the stables near the hunting lodge In fact it was on Wickson s horses that we had ridden over Sonoma Mountain For nearly twenty years now John Carlson has been custodian of the refuge No thought of disloyalty I am sure has ever entered his mind during all that time To betray his trust would have been in his mind a thing undreamed He was phlegmatic stolid to such a degree that one could not but wonder how the Revolution had any meaning to him at all And yet love of freedom glowed sombrely and steadily in his dim soul In ways it was indeed good that he was not flighty and imaginative He never lost his head He could obey orders and he was neither curious nor garrulous Once I asked how it was that he was a revolutionist When I was a young man I was a soldier was his answer It was in Germany There all young men must be in the army So I was in the army There was another soldier there a young man too His father was what you call an agitator and his father was in jail for lese majesty what you call speaking the truth about the Emperor And the young man the son talked with me much about people and work and the robbery of the people by the capitalists He made me see things in new ways and I became a socialist His talk was very true and good and I have never forgotten When I came to the United States I hunted up the socialists I became a member of a section that was in the day of the S L P Then later when the split came I joined the local of the S P I was working in a livery stable in San Francisco then That was before the Earthquake I have paid my dues for twenty two years I am yet a member and I yet pay my dues though it is very secret now I will always pay my dues and when the cooperative commonwealth comes I will be glad Left to myself I proceeded to cook breakfast on the oil stove and to prepare my home Often in the early morning or in the evening after dark Carlson would steal down to the refuge and work for a couple of hours At first my home was the tarpaulin Later a small tent was put up And still later when we became assured of the perfect security of the place a small house was erected This house was completely hidden from any chance eye that might peer down from the edge of the hole The lush vegetation of that sheltered spot make a natural shield Also the house was built against the perpendicular wall and in the wall itself shored by strong timbers well drained and ventilated we excavated two small rooms Oh believe me we had many comforts When Biedenbach the German terrorist hid with us some time later he installed a smoke consuming device that enabled us to sit by crackling wood fires on winter nights And here I must say a word for that gentle souled terrorist than whom there is no comrade in the Revolution more fearfully misunderstood Comrade Biedenbach did not betray the Cause Nor was he executed by the comrades as is commonly supposed This canard was circulated by the creatures of the Oligarchy Comrade Biedenbach was absent minded forgetful He was shot by one of our lookouts at the cave refuge at Carmel through failure on his part to remember the secret signals It was all a sad mistake And that he betrayed his Fighting Group is an absolute lie No truer more loyal man ever labored for the Cause Search as we may through all the material of those times that has come down to us we can find no clew to the Biedenbach here referred to No mention is made of him anywhere save in the Everhard Manuscript For nineteen years now the refuge that I selected had been almost continuously occupied and in all that time with one exception it has never been discovered by an outsider And yet it was only a quarter of a mile from Wickson s hunting lodge and a short mile from the village of Glen Ellen I was able always to hear the morning and evening trains arrive and depart and I used to set my watch by the whistle at the brickyards If the curious traveller will turn south from Glen Ellen he will find himself on a boulevard that is identical with the old country road seven centuries ago A quarter of a mile from Glen Ellen after the second bridge is passed to the right will be noticed a barranca that runs like a scar across the rolling land toward a group of wooded knolls The barranca is the site of the ancient right of way that in the time of private property in land ran across the holding of one Chauvet a French pioneer of California who came from his native country in the fabled days of gold The wooded knolls are the same knolls referred to by Avis Everhard The Great Earthquake of twenty three sixty eight A D broke off the side of one of these knolls and toppled it into the hole where the Everhards made their refuge Since the finding of the Manuscript excavations have been made and the house the two cave rooms and all the accumulated rubbish of long occupancy have been brought to light Many valuable relics have been found among which curious to relate is the smoke consuming device of Biedenbach s mentioned in the narrative Students interested in such matters should read the brochure of Arnold Bentham soon to be published A mile northwest from the wooded knolls brings one to the site of Wake Robin Lodge at the junction of Wild Water and Sonoma Creeks It may be noticed in passing that Wild Water was originally called Graham Creek and was so named on the early local maps But the later name sticks It was at Wake Robin Lodge that Avis Everhard later lived for short periods when disguised as an agent provocateur of the Iron Heel she was enabled to play with impunity her part among men and events The official permission to occupy Wake Robin Lodge is still on the records signed by no less a man than Wickson the minor oligarch of the Manuscript CHAPTER XIX TRANSFORMATION You must make yourself over again Ernest wrote to me You must cease to be You must become another woman and not merely in the clothes you wear but inside your skin under the clothes You must make yourself over again so that even I would not know you your voice your gestures your mannerisms your carriage your walk everything This command I obeyed Every day I practised for hours in burying forever the old Avis Everhard beneath the skin of another woman whom I may call my other self It was only by long practice that such results could be obtained In the mere detail of voice intonation I practised almost perpetually till the voice of my new self became fixed automatic It was this automatic assumption of a role that was considered imperative One must become so adept as to deceive oneself It was like learning a new language say the French At first speech in French is self conscious a matter of the will The student thinks in English and then transmutes into French or reads in French but transmutes into English before he can understand Then later becoming firmly grounded automatic the student reads writes and THINKS in French without any recourse to English at all And so with our disguises It was necessary for us to practise until our assumed roles became real until to be our original selves would require a watchful and strong exercise of will Of course at first much was mere blundering experiment We were creating a new art and we had much to discover But the work was going on everywhere masters in the art were developing and a fund of tricks and expedients was being accumulated This fund became a sort of text book that was passed on a part of the curriculum as it were of the school of Revolution Disguise did become a veritable art during that period The revolutionists maintained schools of acting in all their refuges They scorned accessories such as wigs and beards false eyebrows and such aids of the theatrical actors The game of revolution was a game of life and death and mere accessories were traps Disguise had to be fundamental intrinsic part and parcel of one s being second nature The Red Virgin is reported to have been one of the most adept in the art to which must be ascribed her long and successful career It was at this time that my father disappeared His letters which had come to me regularly ceased He no longer appeared at our Pell Street quarters Our comrades sought him everywhere Through our secret service we ransacked every prison in the land But he was lost as completely as if the earth had swallowed him up and to this day no clew to his end has been discovered Disappearance was one of the horrors of the time As a motif in song and story it constantly crops up It was an inevitable concomitant of the subterranean warfare that raged through those three centuries This phenomenon was almost as common in the oligarch class and the labor castes as it was in the ranks of the revolutionists Without warning without trace men and women and even children disappeared and were seen no more their end shrouded in mystery Six lonely months I spent in the refuge but they were not idle months Our organization went on apace and there were mountains of work always waiting to be done Ernest and his fellow leaders from their prisons decided what should be done and it remained for us on the outside to do it There was the organization of the mouth to mouth propaganda the organization with all its ramifications of our spy system the establishment of our secret printing presses and the establishment of our underground railways which meant the knitting together of all our myriads of places of refuge and the formation of new refuges where links were missing in the chains we ran over all the land So I say the work was never done At the end of six months my loneliness was broken by the arrival of two comrades They were young girls brave souls and passionate lovers of liberty Lora Peterson who disappeared in nineteen twenty two and Kate Bierce who later married Du Bois and who is still with us with eyes lifted to to morrow s sun that heralds in the new age Du Bois the present librarian of Ardis is a lineal descendant of this revolutionary pair The two girls arrived in a flurry of excitement danger and sudden death In the crew of the fishing boat that conveyed them across San Pablo Bay was a spy A creature of the Iron Heel he had successfully masqueraded as a revolutionist and penetrated deep into the secrets of our organization Without doubt he was on my trail for we had long since learned that my disappearance had been cause of deep concern to the secret service of the Oligarchy Luckily as the outcome proved he had not divulged his discoveries to any one He had evidently delayed reporting preferring to wait until he had brought things to a successful conclusion by discovering my hiding place and capturing me His information died with him Under some pretext after the girls had landed at Petaluma Creek and taken to the horses he managed to get away from the boat Part way up Sonoma Mountain John Carlson let the girls go on leading his horse while he went back on foot His suspicions had been aroused He captured the spy and as to what then happened Carlson gave us a fair idea I fixed him was Carlson s unimaginative way of describing the affair I fixed him he repeated while a sombre light burnt in his eyes and his huge toil distorted hands opened and closed eloquently He made no noise I hid him and tonight I will go back and bury him deep During that period I used to marvel at my own metamorphosis At times it seemed impossible either that I had ever lived a placid peaceful life in a college town or else that I had become a revolutionist inured to scenes of violence and death One or the other could not be One was real the other was a dream but which was which Was this present life of a revolutionist hiding in a hole a nightmare or was I a revolutionist who had somewhere somehow dreamed that in some former existence I have lived in Berkeley and never known of life more violent than teas and dances debating societies and lectures rooms But then I suppose this was a common experience of all of us who had rallied under the red banner of the brotherhood of man I often remembered figures from that other life and curiously enough they appeared and disappeared now and again in my new life There was Bishop Morehouse In vain we searched for him after our organization had developed He had been transferred from asylum to asylum We traced him from the state hospital for the insane at Napa to the one in Stockton and from there to the one in the Santa Clara Valley called Agnews and there the trail ceased There was no record of his death In some way he must have escaped Little did I dream of the awful manner in which I was to see him once again the fleeting glimpse of him in the whirlwind carnage of the Chicago Commune Jackson who had lost his arm in the Sierra Mills and who had been the cause of my own conversion into a revolutionist I never saw again but we all knew what he did before he died He never joined the revolutionists Embittered by his fate brooding over his wrongs he became an anarchist not a philosophic anarchist but a mere animal mad with hate and lust for revenge And well he revenged himself Evading the guards in the nighttime while all were asleep he blew the Pertonwaithe palace into atoms Not a soul escaped not even the guards And in prison while awaiting trial he suffocated himself under his blankets doctor Hammerfield and doctor Ballingford achieved quite different fates from that of Jackson They have been faithful to their salt and they have been correspondingly rewarded with ecclesiastical palaces wherein they dwell at peace with the world Both are apologists for the Oligarchy Both have grown very fat doctor Hammerfield as Ernest once said has succeeded in modifying his metaphysics so as to give God s sanction to the Iron Heel and also to include much worship of beauty and to reduce to an invisible wraith the gaseous vertebrate described by Haeckel the difference between doctor Hammerfield and doctor Ballingford being that the latter has made the God of the oligarchs a little more gaseous and a little less vertebrate Peter Donnelly the scab foreman at the Sierra Mills whom I encountered while investigating the case of Jackson was a surprise to all of us In nineteen eighteen I was present at a meeting of the Frisco Reds Of all our Fighting Groups this one was the most formidable ferocious and merciless It was really not a part of our organization Its members were fanatics madmen We dared not encourage such a spirit On the other hand though they did not belong to us we remained on friendly terms with them It was a matter of vital importance that brought me there that night I alone in the midst of a score of men was the only person unmasked After the business that brought me there was transacted I was led away by one of them In a dark passage this guide struck a match and holding it close to his face slipped back his mask For a moment I gazed upon the passion wrought features of Peter Donnelly Then the match went out I just wanted you to know it was me he said in the darkness D you remember Dallas the superintendent I nodded at recollection of the vulpine face superintendent of the Sierra Mills Well I got him first Donnelly said with pride Twas after that I joined the Reds But how comes it that you are here I queried Your wife and children Dead he answered That s why No he went on hastily tis not revenge for them They died easily in their beds sickness you see one time and another They tied my arms while they lived And now that they re gone tis revenge for my blasted manhood I m after I was once Peter Donnelly the scab foreman But to night I m Number twenty seven of the Frisco Reds Come on now and I ll get you out of this More I heard of him afterward In his own way he had told the truth when he said all were dead But one lived Timothy and him his father considered dead because he had taken service with the Iron Heel in the Mercenaries A member of the Frisco Reds pledged himself to twelve annual executions The penalty for failure was death A member who failed to complete his number committed suicide These executions were not haphazard This group of madmen met frequently and passed wholesale judgments upon offending members and servitors of the Oligarchy The executions were afterward apportioned by lot In addition to the labor castes there arose another caste the military A standing army of professional soldiers was created officered by members of the Oligarchy and known as the Mercenaries This institution took the place of the militia which had proved impracticable under the new regime Outside the regular secret service of the Iron Heel there was further established a secret service of the Mercenaries this latter forming a connecting link between the police and the military In fact the business that brought me there the night of my visit was such a trial One of our own comrades who for years had successfully maintained himself in a clerical position in the local bureau of the secret service of the Iron Heel had fallen under the ban of the Frisco Reds and was being tried Of course he was not present and of course his judges did not know that he was one of our men My mission had been to testify to his identity and loyalty It may be wondered how we came to know of the affair at all The explanation is simple One of our secret agents was a member of the Frisco Reds It was necessary for us to keep an eye on friend as well as foe and this group of madmen was not too unimportant to escape our surveillance But to return to Peter Donnelly and his son All went well with Donnelly until in the following year he found among the sheaf of executions that fell to him the name of Timothy Donnelly Then it was that that clannishness which was his to so extraordinary a degree asserted itself To save his son he betrayed his comrades In this he was partially blocked but a dozen of the Frisco Reds were executed and the group was well nigh destroyed In retaliation the survivors meted out to Donnelly the death he had earned by his treason Nor did Timothy Donnelly long survive The Frisco Reds pledged themselves to his execution Every effort was made by the Oligarchy to save him He was transferred from one part of the country to another Three of the Reds lost their lives in vain efforts to get him The Group was composed only of men In the end they fell back on a woman one of our comrades and none other than Anna Roylston Our Inner Circle forbade her but she had ever a will of her own and disdained discipline Furthermore she was a genius and lovable and we could never discipline her anyway She is in a class by herself and not amenable to the ordinary standards of the revolutionists Despite our refusal to grant permission to do the deed she went on with it Now Anna Roylston was a fascinating woman All she had to do was to beckon a man to her She broke the hearts of scores of our young comrades and scores of others she captured and by their heart strings led into our organization Yet she steadfastly refused to marry She dearly loved children but she held that a child of her own would claim her from the Cause and that it was the Cause to which her life was devoted It was an easy task for Anna Roylston to win Timothy Donnelly Her conscience did not trouble her for at that very time occurred the Nashville Massacre when the Mercenaries Donnelly in command literally murdered eight hundred weavers of that city But she did not kill Donnelly She turned him over a prisoner to the Frisco Reds This happened only last year and now she had been renamed The revolutionists everywhere are calling her the Red Virgin It was not until the Second Revolt was crushed that the Frisco Reds flourished again And for two generations the Group flourished Then an agent of the Iron Heel managed to become a member penetrated all its secrets and brought about its total annihilation This occurred in two thousand two A D The members were executed one at a time at intervals of three weeks and their bodies exposed in the labor ghetto of San Francisco Colonel Ingram and Colonel Van Gilbert are two more familiar figures that I was later to encounter Colonel Ingram rose high in the Oligarchy and became Minister to Germany He was cordially detested by the proletariat of both countries It was in Berlin that I met him where as an accredited international spy of the Iron Heel I was received by him and afforded much assistance Incidentally I may state that in my dual role I managed a few important things for the Revolution Colonel Van Gilbert became known as Snarling Van Gilbert His important part was played in drafting the new code after the Chicago Commune But before that as trial judge he had earned sentence of death by his fiendish malignancy I was one of those that tried him and passed sentence upon him Anna Roylston carried out the execution Still another figure arises out of the old life Jackson s lawyer Least of all would I have expected again to meet this man Joseph Hurd It was a strange meeting Late at night two years after the Chicago Commune Ernest and I arrived together at the Benton Harbor refuge This was in Michigan across the lake from Chicago We arrived just at the conclusion of the trial of a spy Sentence of death had been passed and he was being led away Such was the scene as we came upon it The next moment the wretched man had wrenched free from his captors and flung himself at my feet his arms clutching me about the knees in a vicelike grip as he prayed in a frenzy for mercy As he turned his agonized face up to me I recognized him as Joseph Hurd Of all the terrible things I have witnessed never have I been so unnerved as by this frantic creature s pleading for life He was mad for life It was pitiable He refused to let go of me despite the hands of a dozen comrades And when at last he was dragged shrieking away I sank down fainting upon the floor It is far easier to see brave men die than to hear a coward beg for life The Benton Harbor refuge was a catacomb the entrance of which was cunningly contrived by way of a well It has been maintained in a fair state of preservation and the curious visitor may to day tread its labyrinths to the assembly hall where without doubt occurred the scene described by Avis Everhard Farther on are the cells where the prisoners were confined and the death chamber where the executions took place Beyond is the cemetery long winding galleries hewn out of the solid rock with recesses on either hand wherein tier above tier lie the revolutionists just as they were laid away by their comrades long years agone CHAPTER XX A LOST OLIGARCH But in remembering the old life I have run ahead of my story into the new life The wholesale jail delivery did not occur until well along into nineteen fifteen Complicated as it was it was carried through without a hitch and as a very creditable achievement it cheered us on in our work From Cuba to California out of scores of jails military prisons and fortresses in a single night we delivered fifty one of our fifty two Congressmen and in addition over three hundred other leaders There was not a single instance of miscarriage Not only did they escape but every one of them won to the refuges as planned The one comrade Congressman we did not get was Arthur Simpson and he had already died in Cabanas after cruel tortures The eighteen months that followed was perhaps the happiest of my life with Ernest During that time we were never apart Later when we went back into the world we were separated much Not more impatiently do I await the flame of to morrow s revolt than did I that night await the coming of Ernest I had not seen him for so long and the thought of a possible hitch or error in our plans that would keep him still in his island prison almost drove me mad The hours passed like ages I was all alone Biedenbach and three young men who had been living in the refuge were out and over the mountain heavily armed and prepared for anything The refuges all over the land were quite empty I imagine of comrades that night Just as the sky paled with the first warning of dawn I heard the signal from above and gave the answer In the darkness I almost embraced Biedenbach who came down first but the next moment I was in Ernest s arms And in that moment so complete had been my transformation I discovered it was only by an effort of will that I could be the old Avis Everhard with the old mannerisms and smiles phrases and intonations of voice It was by strong effort only that I was able to maintain my old identity I could not allow myself to forget for an instant so automatically imperative had become the new personality I had created Once inside the little cabin I saw Ernest s face in the light With the exception of the prison pallor there was no change in him at least not much He was my same lover husband and hero And yet there was a certain ascetic lengthening of the lines of his face But he could well stand it for it seemed to add a certain nobility of refinement to the riotous excess of life that had always marked his features He might have been a trifle graver than of yore but the glint of laughter still was in his eyes He was twenty pounds lighter but in splendid physical condition He had kept up exercise during the whole period of confinement and his muscles were like iron In truth he was in better condition than when he had entered prison Hours passed before his head touched pillow and I had soothed him off to sleep But there was no sleep for me I was too happy and the fatigue of jail breaking and riding horseback had not been mine While Ernest slept I changed my dress arranged my hair differently and came back to my new automatic self Then when Biedenbach and the other comrades awoke with their aid I concocted a little conspiracy All was ready and we were in the cave room that served for kitchen and dining room when Ernest opened the door and entered At that moment Biedenbach addressed me as Mary and I turned and answered him Then I glanced at Ernest with curious interest such as any young comrade might betray on seeing for the first time so noted a hero of the Revolution But Ernest s glance took me in and questioned impatiently past and around the room The next moment I was being introduced to him as Mary Holmes To complete the deception an extra plate was laid and when we sat down to table one chair was not occupied I could have cried with joy as I noted Ernest s increasing uneasiness and impatience Finally he could stand it no longer Where s my wife he demanded bluntly She is still asleep I answered It was the crucial moment But my voice was a strange voice and in it he recognized nothing familiar The meal went on I talked a great deal and enthusiastically as a hero worshipper might talk and it was obvious that he was my hero I rose to a climax of enthusiasm and worship and before he could guess my intention threw my arms around his neck and kissed him on the lips He held me from him at arm s length and stared about in annoyance and perplexity The four men greeted him with roars of laughter and explanations were made At first he was sceptical He scrutinized me keenly and was half convinced then shook his head and would not believe It was not until I became the old Avis Everhard and whispered secrets in his ear that none knew but he and Avis Everhard that he accepted me as his really truly wife It was later in the day that he took me in his arms manifesting great embarrassment and claiming polygamous emotions You are my Avis he said and you are also some one else You are two women and therefore you are my harem At any rate we are safe now If the United States becomes too hot for us why I have qualified for citizenship in Turkey At that time polygamy was still practised in Turkey Life became for me very happy in the refuge It is true we worked hard and for long hours but we worked together We had each other for eighteen precious months and we were not lonely for there was always a coming and going of leaders and comrades strange voices from the under world of intrigue and revolution bringing stranger tales of strife and war from all our battle line And there was much fun and delight We were not mere gloomy conspirators We toiled hard and suffered greatly filled the gaps in our ranks and went on and through all the labour and the play and interplay of life and death we found time to laugh and love There were artists scientists scholars musicians and poets among us and in that hole in the ground culture was higher and finer than in the palaces of wonder cities of the oligarchs In truth many of our comrades toiled at making beautiful those same palaces and wonder cities This is not braggadocio on the part of Avis Everhard The flower of the artistic and intellectual world were revolutionists With the exception of a few of the musicians and singers and of a few of the oligarchs all the great creators of the period whose names have come down to us were revolutionists Nor were we confined to the refuge itself Often at night we rode over the mountains for exercise and we rode on Wickson s horses If only he knew how many revolutionists his horses have carried We even went on picnics to isolated spots we knew where we remained all day going before daylight and returning after dark Also we used Wickson s cream and butter and Ernest was not above shooting Wickson s quail and rabbits and on occasion his young bucks Even as late as that period cream and butter were still crudely extracted from cow s milk The laboratory preparation of foods had not yet begun Indeed it was a safe refuge I have said that it was discovered only once and this brings me to the clearing up of the mystery of the disappearance of young Wickson Now that he is dead I am free to speak There was a nook on the bottom of the great hole where the sun shone for several hours and which was hidden from above Here we had carried many loads of gravel from the creek bed so that it was dry and warm a pleasant basking place and here one afternoon I was drowsing half asleep over a volume of Mendenhall I was so comfortable and secure that even his flaming lyrics failed to stir me In all the extant literature and documents of that period continual reference is made to the poems of Rudolph Mendenhall By his comrades he was called The Flame He was undoubtedly a great genius yet beyond weird and haunting fragments of his verse quoted in the writings of others nothing of his has come down to us He was executed by the Iron Heel in nineteen twenty eight A D I was aroused by a clod of earth striking at my feet Then from above I heard a sound of scrambling The next moment a young man with a final slide down the crumbling wall alighted at my feet It was Philip Wickson though I did not know him at the time He looked at me coolly and uttered a low whistle of surprise Well he said and the next moment cap in hand he was saying I beg your pardon I did not expect to find any one here I was not so cool I was still a tyro so far as concerned knowing how to behave in desperate circumstances Later on when I was an international spy I should have been less clumsy I am sure As it was I scrambled to my feet and cried out the danger call Why did you do that he asked looking at me searchingly It was evident that he had no suspicion of our presence when making the descent I recognized this with relief For what purpose do you think I did it I countered I was indeed clumsy in those days I don t know he answered shaking his head Unless you ve got friends about Anyway you ve got some explanations to make I don t like the look of it You are trespassing This is my father s land and But at that moment Biedenbach every polite and gentle said from behind him in a low voice Hands up my young sir Young Wickson put his hands up first then turned to confront Biedenbach who held a thirty thirty automatic rifle on him Wickson was imperturbable Oh ho he said a nest of revolutionists and quite a hornet s nest it would seem Well you won t abide here long I can tell you Maybe you ll abide here long enough to reconsider that statement Biedenbach said quietly And in the meanwhile I must ask you to come inside with me Inside The young man was genuinely astonished Have you a catacomb here I have heard of such things Come and see Biedenbach answered with his adorable accent But it is unlawful was the protest Yes by your law the terrorist replied significantly But by our law believe me it is quite lawful You must accustom yourself to the fact that you are in another world than the one of oppression and brutality in which you have lived There is room for argument there Wickson muttered Then stay with us and discuss it The young fellow laughed and followed his captor into the house He was led into the inner cave room and one of the young comrades left to guard him while we discussed the situation in the kitchen Biedenbach with tears in his eyes held that Wickson must die and was quite relieved when we outvoted him and his horrible proposition On the other hand we could not dream of allowing the young oligarch to depart I ll tell you what to do Ernest said We ll keep him and give him an education I bespeak the privilege then of enlightening him in jurisprudence Biedenbach cried And so a decision was laughingly reached We would keep Philip Wickson a prisoner and educate him in our ethics and sociology But in the meantime there was work to be done All trace of the young oligarch must be obliterated There were the marks he had left when descending the crumbling wall of the hole This task fell to Biedenbach and slung on a rope from above he toiled cunningly for the rest of the day till no sign remained Back up the canyon from the lip of the hole all marks were likewise removed Then at twilight came John Carlson who demanded Wickson s shoes The young man did not want to give up his shoes and even offered to fight for them till he felt the horseshoer s strength in Ernest s hands Carlson afterward reported several blisters and much grievous loss of skin due to the smallness of the shoes but he succeeded in doing gallant work with them Back from the lip of the hole where ended the young man s obliterated trial Carlson put on the shoes and walked away to the left He walked for miles around knolls over ridges and through canyons and finally covered the trail in the running water of a creek bed Here he removed the shoes and still hiding trail for a distance at last put on his own shoes A week later Wickson got back his shoes That night the hounds were out and there was little sleep in the refuge Next day time and again the baying hounds came down the canyon plunged off to the left on the trail Carlson had made for them and were lost to ear in the farther canyons high up the mountain And all the time our men waited in the refuge weapons in hand automatic revolvers and rifles to say nothing of half a dozen infernal machines of Biedenbach s manufacture A more surprised party of rescuers could not be imagined had they ventured down into our hiding place I have now given the true disappearance of Philip Wickson one time oligarch and later comrade in the Revolution For we converted him in the end His mind was fresh and plastic and by nature he was very ethical Several months later we rode him on one of his father s horses over Sonoma Mountains to Petaluma Creek and embarked him in a small fishing launch By easy stages we smuggled him along our underground railway to the Carmel refuge There he remained eight months at the end of which time for two reasons he was loath to leave us One reason was that he had fallen in love with Anna Roylston and the other was that he had become one of us It was not until he became convinced of the hopelessness of his love affair that he acceded to our wishes and went back to his father Ostensibly an oligarch until his death he was in reality one of the most valuable of our agents Often and often has the Iron Heel been dumbfounded by the miscarriage of its plans and operations against us If it but knew the number of its own members who are our agents it would understand Young Wickson never wavered in his loyalty to the Cause In truth his very death was incurred by his devotion to duty In the great storm of nineteen twenty seven while attending a meeting of our leaders he contracted the pneumonia of which he died The case of this young man was not unusual Many young men of the Oligarchy impelled by sense of right conduct or their imaginations captured by the glory of the Revolution ethically or romantically devoted their lives to it In similar way many sons of the Russian nobility played their parts in the earlier and protracted revolution in that country CHAPTER XXI 
5224-35453-0000	train-other-500	THE ROARING ABYSMAL BEAST During the long period of our stay in the refuge we were kept closely in touch with what was happening in the world without and we were learning thoroughly the strength of the Oligarchy with which we were at war
5224-35453-0001	train-other-500	Out of the flux of transition the new institutions were forming more definitely and taking on the appearance and attributes of permanence The oligarchs had succeeded in devising a governmental machine as intricate as it was vast that worked
5224-35453-0002	train-other-500	and this despite all our efforts to clog and hamper This was a surprise to many of the revolutionists They had not conceived it possible Nevertheless the work of the country went on The men toiled in the mines and fields perforce they were no more than slaves
5224-35453-0003	train-other-500	As for the vital industries everything prospered The members of the great labor castes were contented and worked on merrily For the first time in their lives they knew industrial peace No more were they worried by slack times strike and lockout and the union label
5224-35453-0004	train-other-500	They lived in more comfortable homes and in delightful cities of their own delightful compared with the slums and ghettos in which they had formerly dwelt They had better food to eat less hours of labor more holidays and a greater amount and variety of interests and pleasures
5224-35453-0005	train-other-500	And for their less fortunate brothers and sisters the unfavored laborers the driven people of the abyss they cared nothing An age of selfishness was dawning upon mankind And yet this is not altogether true The labor castes were honeycombed by our agents
5224-35453-0006	train-other-500	men whose eyes saw beyond the belly need the radiant figure of liberty and brotherhood Another great institution that had taken form and was working smoothly was the Mercenaries This body of soldiers had been evolved out of the old regular army and was now a million strong
5224-35453-0007	train-other-500	to say nothing of the colonial forces The Mercenaries constituted a race apart They dwelt in cities of their own which were practically self governed and they were granted many privileges By them a large portion of the perplexing surplus was consumed
5224-35453-0008	train-other-500	They were losing all touch and sympathy with the rest of the people and in fact were developing their own class morality and consciousness And yet we had thousands of our agents among them
5224-35453-0009	train-other-500	The Mercenaries in the last days of the Iron Heel played an important role They constituted the balance of power in the struggles between the labor castes and the oligarchs and now to one side and now to the other threw their strength according to the play of intrigue and conspiracy
none	none	 The oligarchs themselves were going through a remarkable 
5224-35453-0010	train-other-500	and it must be confessed unexpected development As a class they disciplined themselves Every member had his work to do in the world and this work he was compelled to do There were no more idle rich young men Their strength was used to give united strength to the Oligarchy
none	none	 They served as leaders of troops and as lieutenants and captains of industry 
5224-35453-0011	train-other-500	They found careers in applied science and many of them became great engineers They went into the multitudinous divisions of the government took service in the colonial possessions and by tens of thousands went into the various secret services
5224-35453-0012	train-other-500	They were I may say apprenticed to education to art to the church to science to literature
none	none	 and in those fields they served the important function of moulding the thought processes of the nation 
5224-35453-0013	train-other-500	in the direction of the perpetuity of the Oligarchy They were taught and later they in turn taught that what they were doing was right They assimilated the aristocratic idea from the moment they began as children to receive impressions of the world The aristocratic idea was woven into the making of them
5224-35453-0014	train-other-500	until it became bone of them and flesh of them They looked upon themselves as wild animal trainers rulers of beasts From beneath their feet rose always the subterranean rumbles of revolt Violent death ever stalked in their midst
5224-35453-0015	train-other-500	bomb and knife and bullet were looked upon as so many fangs of the roaring abysmal beast they must dominate if humanity were to persist They were the saviours of humanity and they regarded themselves as heroic and sacrificing laborers for the highest good
5224-35453-0016	train-other-500	They as a class believed that they alone maintained civilization It was their belief that if ever they weakened the great beast would ingulf them and everything of beauty and wonder and joy and good in its cavernous and slime dripping maw
5224-35453-0017	train-other-500	Without them anarchy would reign and humanity would drop backward into the primitive night out of which it had so painfully emerged The horrid picture of anarchy was held always before their child s eyes until they in turn obsessed by this cultivated fear
5224-35453-0018	train-other-500	held the picture of anarchy before the eyes of the children that followed them This was the beast to be stamped upon and the highest duty of the aristocrat was to stamp upon it In short they alone by their unremitting toil and sacrifice stood between weak humanity
5224-35453-0019	train-other-500	and the all devouring beast and they believed it firmly believed it I cannot lay too great stress upon this high ethical righteousness of the whole oligarch class This has been the strength of the Iron Heel
5224-35453-0020	train-other-500	and too many of the comrades have been slow or loath to realize it Many of them have ascribed the strength of the Iron Heel to its system of reward and punishment This is a mistake Heaven and hell may be the prime factors of zeal in the religion of a fanatic
5224-35453-0021	train-other-500	but for the great majority of the religious heaven and hell are incidental to right and wrong Love of the right desire for the right unhappiness with anything less than the right in short right conduct is the prime factor of religion
5224-35453-0022	train-other-500	And so with the Oligarchy Prisons banishment and degradation honors and palaces and wonder cities are all incidental The great driving force of the oligarchs is the belief that they are doing right
5224-35453-0023	train-other-500	Never mind the exceptions and never mind the oppression and injustice in which the Iron Heel was conceived All is granted The point is that the strength of the Oligarchy today lies in its satisfied conception of its own righteousness
5224-35453-0024	train-other-500	Out of the ethical incoherency and inconsistency of capitalism the oligarchs emerged with a new ethics coherent and definite sharp and severe as steel the most absurd and unscientific and at the same time the most potent ever possessed by any tyrant class
none	none	 The oligarchs believed their ethics in spite of the fact that biology and evolution gave them the lie 
5224-35453-0025	train-other-500	and because of their faith for three centuries they were able to hold back the mighty tide of human progress a spectacle profound tremendous puzzling to the metaphysical moralist and one that to the materialist is the cause of many doubts and reconsiderations
5224-35453-0026	train-other-500	For that matter the strength of the Revolution during these frightful twenty years has resided in nothing else than the sense of righteousness In no other way can be explained our sacrifices and martyrdoms
5224-35453-0027	train-other-500	For no other reason did Rudolph Mendenhall flame out his soul for the Cause and sing his wild swan song that last night of life For no other reason did Hurlbert die under torture refusing to the last to betray his comrades
5224-35453-0028	train-other-500	For no other reason has Anna Roylston refused blessed motherhood For no other reason has John Carlson been the faithful and unrewarded custodian of the Glen Ellen Refuge It does not matter
5224-35453-0029	train-other-500	young or old man or woman high or low genius or clod go where one will among the comrades of the Revolution the motor force will be found to be a great and abiding desire for the right But I have run away from my narrative
5224-35453-0030	train-other-500	Ernest and I well understood before we left the refuge how the strength of the Iron Heel was developing The labor castes the Mercenaries and the great hordes of secret agents and police of various sorts were all pledged to the Oligarchy
5224-35453-0031	train-other-500	In the main and ignoring the loss of liberty they were better off than they had been On the other hand the great helpless mass of the population the people of the abyss was sinking into a brutish apathy of content with misery
5224-35453-0032	train-other-500	Whenever strong proletarians asserted their strength in the midst of the mass they were drawn away from the mass by the oligarchs and given better conditions by being made members of the labor castes or of the Mercenaries Thus discontent was lulled
5224-35453-0033	train-other-500	and the proletariat robbed of its natural leaders The condition of the people of the abyss was pitiable Common school education so far as they were concerned had ceased They lived like beasts in great squalid labor ghettos
5224-35453-0034	train-other-500	festering in misery and degradation All their old liberties were gone They were labor slaves Choice of work was denied them Likewise was denied them the right to move from place to place or the right to bear or possess arms
5224-35453-0035	train-other-500	They were not land serfs like the farmers They were machine serfs and labor serfs When unusual needs arose for them such as the building of the great highways and air lines of canals tunnels subways and fortifications
5224-35453-0036	train-other-500	levies were made on the labor ghettos and tens of thousands of serfs willy nilly were transported to the scene of operations Great armies of them are toiling now at the building of Ardis housed in wretched barracks where family life cannot exist
5224-35453-0037	train-other-500	and where decency is displaced by dull bestiality In all truth there in the labor ghettos is the roaring abysmal beast the oligarchs fear so dreadfully but it is the beast of their own making In it
none	none	 they will not let the ape and tiger die And just now the word has gone forth that new levies are being imposed for the building of Asgard the projected wonder city that will far exceed Ardis when the latter is completed We of the Revolution will go on with that great work but it will not be done by the miserable serfs The walls and towers and shafts of that fair city will arise to the sound of singing and into its beauty and wonder will be woven not sighs and groans but music and laughter Ardis was completed in nineteen forty two A D Asgard was not completed until nineteen eighty four A D It was fifty two years in the building during which time a permanent army of half a million serfs was employed At times these numbers swelled to over a million without any account being taken of the hundreds of thousands of the labor castes and the artists Ernest was madly impatient to be out in the world and doing for our ill fated First Revolt that had miscarried in the Chicago Commune was ripening fast Yet he possessed his soul with patience and during this time of his torment when Hadly who had been brought for the purpose from Illinois made him over into another man he revolved great plans in his head for the organization of the learned proletariat and for the maintenance of at least the rudiments of education amongst the people of the abyss 
5224-35453-0038	train-other-500	all this of course in the event of the First Revolt being a failure
5224-35453-0039	train-other-500	Among the Revolutionists were many surgeons and in vivisection they attained marvellous proficiency In Avis Everhard s words they could literally make a man over
none	none	 To them the elimination of scars and disfigurements was a trivial detail 
5224-35453-0040	train-other-500	They changed the features with such microscopic care that no traces were left of their handiwork The nose was a favorite organ to work upon Skin grafting and hair transplanting were among their commonest devices The changes in expression they accomplished were wizard like
5224-35453-0041	train-other-500	Eyes and eyebrows lips mouths and ears were radically altered By cunning operations on tongue throat larynx and nasal cavities a man s whole enunciation and manner of speech could be changed Desperate times give need for desperate remedies and the surgeons of the Revolution rose to the need
5224-35453-0042	train-other-500	Among other things they could increase an adult s stature by as much as four or five inches and decrease it by one or two inches What they did is to day a lost art We have no need for it
5224-35453-0043	train-other-500	It was not until January nineteen seventeen that we left the refuge All had been arranged
none	none	 We took our place at once as agents provocateurs in the scheme of the Iron Heel 
5224-35453-0044	train-other-500	I was supposed to be Ernest s sister By oligarchs and comrades on the inside who were high in authority place had been made for us
none	none	 we were in possession of all necessary documents and our pasts were accounted for With help on the inside this was not difficult for in that shadow world of secret service identity was nebulous Like ghosts the agents came and went obeying commands fulfilling duties following clews making their reports often to officers they never saw or cooperating with other agents they had never seen before and would never see again CHAPTER XXII THE CHICAGO COMMUNE As agents provocateurs not alone were we able to travel a great deal but our very work threw us in contact with the proletariat and with our comrades the revolutionists Thus we were in both camps at the same time ostensibly serving the Iron Heel and secretly working with all our might for the Cause There were many of us in the various secret services of the Oligarchy and despite the shakings up and reorganizations the secret services have undergone they have never been able to weed all of us out Ernest had largely planned the First Revolt and the date set had been somewhere early in the spring of nineteen eighteen In the fall of nineteen seventeen we were not ready much remained to be done and when the Revolt was precipitated of course it was doomed to failure The plot of necessity was frightfully intricate and anything premature was sure to destroy it This the Iron Heel foresaw and laid its schemes accordingly We had planned to strike our first blow at the nervous system of the Oligarchy The latter had remembered the general strike and had guarded against the defection of the telegraphers by installing wireless stations in the control of the Mercenaries We in turn had countered this move When the signal was given from every refuge all over the land and from the cities and towns and barracks devoted comrades were to go forth and blow up the wireless stations Thus at the first shock would the Iron Heel be brought to earth and lie practically dismembered At the same moment other comrades were to blow up the bridges and tunnels and disrupt the whole network of railroads Still further other groups of comrades at the signal were to seize the officers of the Mercenaries and the police as well as all Oligarchs of unusual ability or who held executive positions Thus would the leaders of the enemy be removed from the field of the local battles that would inevitably be fought all over the land Many things were to occur simultaneously when the signal went forth The Canadian and Mexican patriots who were far stronger than the Iron Heel dreamed were to duplicate our tactics Then there were comrades these were the women for the men would be busy elsewhere who were to post the proclamations from our secret presses Those of us in the higher employ of the Iron Heel were to proceed immediately to make confusion and anarchy in all our departments Inside the Mercenaries were thousands of our comrades Their work was to blow up the magazines and to destroy the delicate mechanism of all the war machinery In the cities of the Mercenaries and of the labor castes similar programmes of disruption were to be carried out In short a sudden colossal stunning blow was to be struck Before the paralyzed Oligarchy could recover itself its end would have come It would have meant terrible times and great loss of life but no revolutionist hesitates at such things Why we even depended much in our plan on the unorganized people of the abyss They were to be loosed on the palaces and cities of the masters Never mind the destruction of life and property Let the abysmal brute roar and the police and Mercenaries slay The abysmal brute would roar anyway and the police and Mercenaries would slay anyway It would merely mean that various dangers to us were harmlessly destroying one another In the meantime we would be doing our own work largely unhampered and gaining control of all the machinery of society Such was our plan every detail of which had to be worked out in secret and as the day drew near communicated to more and more comrades This was the danger point the stretching of the conspiracy But that danger point was never reached Through its spy system the Iron Heel got wind of the Revolt and prepared to teach us another of its bloody lessons Chicago was the devoted city selected for the instruction and well were we instructed Chicago was the ripest of all Chicago which of old time was the city of blood and which was to earn anew its name There the revolutionary spirit was strong Too many bitter strikes had been curbed there in the days of capitalism for the workers to forget and forgive Even the labor castes of the city were alive with revolt Too many heads had been broken in the early strikes Despite their changed and favorable conditions their hatred for the master class had not died This spirit had infected the Mercenaries of which three regiments in particular were ready to come over to us en masse Chicago was the industrial inferno of the nineteenth century A D A curious anecdote has come down to us of John Burns a great English labor leader and one time member of the British Cabinet In Chicago while on a visit to the United States he was asked by a newspaper reporter for his opinion of that city Chicago he answered is a pocket edition of hell Some time later as he was going aboard his steamer to sail to England he was approached by another reporter who wanted to know if he had changed his opinion of Chicago Yes I have was his reply My present opinion is that hell is a pocket edition of Chicago Chicago had always been the storm centre of the conflict between labor and capital a city of street battles and violent death with a class conscious capitalist organization and a class conscious workman organization where in the old days the very school teachers were formed into labor unions and affiliated with the hod carriers and brick layers in the American Federation of Labor And Chicago became the storm centre of the premature First Revolt The trouble was precipitated by the Iron Heel It was cleverly done The whole population including the favored labor castes was given a course of outrageous treatment Promises and agreements were broken and most drastic punishments visited upon even petty offenders The people of the abyss were tormented out of their apathy In fact the Iron Heel was preparing to make the abysmal beast roar And hand in hand with this in all precautionary measures in Chicago the Iron Heel was inconceivably careless Discipline was relaxed among the Mercenaries that remained while many regiments had been withdrawn and sent to various parts of the country It did not take long to carry out this programme only several weeks We of the Revolution caught vague rumors of the state of affairs but had nothing definite enough for an understanding In fact we thought it was a spontaneous spirit of revolt that would require careful curbing on our part and never dreamed that it was deliberately manufactured and it had been manufactured so secretly from the very innermost circle of the Iron Heel that we had got no inkling The counter plot was an able achievement and ably carried out I was in New York when I received the order to proceed immediately to Chicago The man who gave me the order was one of the oligarchs I could tell that by his speech though I did not know his name nor see his face His instructions were too clear for me to make a mistake Plainly I read between the lines that our plot had been discovered that we had been countermined The explosion was ready for the flash of powder and countless agents of the Iron Heel including me either on the ground or being sent there were to supply that flash I flatter myself that I maintained my composure under the keen eye of the oligarch but my heart was beating madly I could almost have shrieked and flown at his throat with my naked hands before his final cold blooded instructions were given Once out of his presence I calculated the time I had just the moments to spare if I were lucky to get in touch with some local leader before catching my train Guarding against being trailed I made a rush of it for the Emergency Hospital Luck was with me and I gained access at once to comrade Galvin the surgeon in chief I started to gasp out my information but he stopped me I already know he said quietly though his Irish eyes were flashing I knew what you had come for I got the word fifteen minutes ago and I have already passed it along Everything shall be done here to keep the comrades quiet Chicago is to be sacrificed but it shall be Chicago alone Have you tried to get word to Chicago I asked He shook his head No telegraphic communication Chicago is shut off It s going to be hell there He paused a moment and I saw his white hands clinch Then he burst out By God I wish I were going to be there There is yet a chance to stop it I said if nothing happens to the train and I can get there in time Or if some of the other secret service comrades who have learned the truth can get there in time You on the inside were caught napping this time he said I nodded my head humbly It was very secret I answered Only the inner chiefs could have known up to to day We haven t yet penetrated that far so we couldn t escape being kept in the dark If only Ernest were here Maybe he is in Chicago now and all is well doctor Galvin shook his head The last news I heard of him was that he had been sent to Boston or New Haven This secret service for the enemy must hamper him a lot but it s better than lying in a refuge I started to go and Galvin wrung my hand Keep a stout heart were his parting words What if the First Revolt is lost There will be a second and we will be wiser then Good by and good luck I don t know whether I ll ever see you again It s going to be hell there but I d give ten years of my life for your chance to be in it The Twentieth Century left New York at six in the evening and was supposed to arrive at Chicago at seven next morning But it lost time that night We were running behind another train Among the travellers in my Pullman was comrade Hartman like myself in the secret service of the Iron Heel He it was who told me of the train that immediately preceded us It was an exact duplicate of our train though it contained no passengers The idea was that the empty train should receive the disaster were an attempt made to blow up the Twentieth Century For that matter there were very few people on the train only a baker s dozen in our car This was reputed to be the fastest train in the world then It was quite a famous train There must be some big men on board Hartman concluded I noticed a private car on the rear Night had fallen when we made our first change of engine and I walked down the platform for a breath of fresh air and to see what I could see Through the windows of the private car I caught a glimpse of three men whom I recognized Hartman was right One of the men was General Altendorff and the other two were Mason and Vanderbold the brains of the inner circle of the Oligarchy s secret service It was a quiet moonlight night but I tossed restlessly and could not sleep At five in the morning I dressed and abandoned my bed I asked the maid in the dressing room how late the train was and she told me two hours She was a mulatto woman and I noticed that her face was haggard with great circles under the eyes while the eyes themselves were wide with some haunting fear What is the matter I asked Nothing miss I didn t sleep well I guess was her reply I looked at her closely and tried her with one of our signals She responded and I made sure of her Something terrible is going to happen in Chicago she said There s that fake train in front of us That and the troop trains have made us late False Troop trains I queried She nodded her head The line is thick with them We ve been passing them all night And they re all heading for Chicago And bringing them over the air line that means business I ve a lover in Chicago she added apologetically He s one of us and he s in the Mercenaries and I m afraid for him Poor girl Her lover was in one of the three disloyal regiments Hartman and I had breakfast together in the dining car and I forced myself to eat The sky had clouded and the train rushed on like a sullen thunderbolt through the gray pall of advancing day The very negroes that waited on us knew that something terrible was impending Oppression sat heavily upon them the lightness of their natures had ebbed out of them they were slack and absent minded in their service and they whispered gloomily to one another in the far end of the car next to the kitchen Hartman was hopeless over the situation What can we do he demanded for the twentieth time with a helpless shrug of the shoulders He pointed out of the window See all is ready You can depend upon it that they re holding them like this thirty or forty miles outside the city on every road He had reference to troop trains on the side track The soldiers were cooking their breakfasts over fires built on the ground beside the track and they looked up curiously at us as we thundered past without slackening our terrific speed All was quiet as we entered Chicago It was evident nothing had happened yet In the suburbs the morning papers came on board the train There was nothing in them and yet there was much in them for those skilled in reading between the lines that it was intended the ordinary reader should read into the text The fine hand of the Iron Heel was apparent in every column Glimmerings of weakness in the armor of the Oligarchy were given Of course there was nothing definite It was intended that the reader should feel his way to these glimmerings It was cleverly done As fiction those morning papers of October twenty seventh were masterpieces The local news was missing This in itself was a masterstroke It shrouded Chicago in mystery and it suggested to the average Chicago reader that the Oligarchy did not dare give the local news Hints that were untrue of course were given of insubordination all over the land crudely disguised with complacent references to punitive measures to be taken There were reports of numerous wireless stations that had been blown up with heavy rewards offered for the detection of the perpetrators Of course no wireless stations had been blown up Many similar outrages that dovetailed with the plot of the revolutionists were given The impression to be made on the minds of the Chicago comrades was that the general Revolt was beginning albeit with a confusing miscarriage in many details It was impossible for one uninformed to escape the vague yet certain feeling that all the land was ripe for the revolt that had already begun to break out It was reported that the defection of the Mercenaries in California had become so serious that half a dozen regiments had been disbanded and broken and that their members with their families had been driven from their own city and on into the labor ghettos And the California Mercenaries were in reality the most faithful of all to their salt But how was Chicago shut off from the rest of the world to know Then there was a ragged telegram describing an outbreak of the populace in New York City in which the labor castes were joining concluding with the statement intended to be accepted as a bluff that the troops had the situation in hand A lie And as the oligarchs had done with the morning papers so had they done in a thousand other ways These we learned afterward as for example the secret messages of the oligarchs sent with the express purpose of leaking to the ears of the revolutionists that had come over the wires now and again during the first part of the night I guess the Iron Heel won t need our services Hartman remarked putting down the paper he had been reading when the train pulled into the central depot They wasted their time sending us here Their plans have evidently prospered better than they expected Hell will break loose any second now He turned and looked down the train as we alighted I thought so he muttered They dropped that private car when the papers came aboard Hartman was hopelessly depressed I tried to cheer him up but he ignored my effort and suddenly began talking very hurriedly in a low voice as we passed through the station At first I could not understand I have not been sure he was saying and I have told no one I have been working on it for weeks and I cannot make sure Watch out for Knowlton I suspect him He knows the secrets of a score of our refuges He carries the lives of hundreds of us in his hands and I think he is a traitor It s more a feeling on my part than anything else But I thought I marked a change in him a short while back There is the danger that he has sold us out or is going to sell us out I am almost sure of it I wouldn t whisper my suspicions to a soul but somehow I don t think I ll leave Chicago alive Keep your eye on Knowlton Trap him Find out I don t know anything more It is only an intuition and so far I have failed to find the slightest clew We were just stepping out upon the sidewalk Remember Hartman concluded earnestly Keep your eyes upon Knowlton And Hartman was right Before a month went by Knowlton paid for his treason with his life He was formally executed by the comrades in Milwaukee All was quiet on the streets too quiet Chicago lay dead There was no roar and rumble of traffic There were not even cabs on the streets The surface cars and the elevated were not running Only occasionally on the sidewalks were there stray pedestrians and these pedestrians did not loiter They went their ways with great haste and definiteness withal there was a curious indecision in their movements as though they expected the buildings to topple over on them or the sidewalks to sink under their feet or fly up in the air A few gamins however were around in their eyes a suppressed eagerness in anticipation of wonderful and exciting things to happen From somewhere far to the south the dull sound of an explosion came to our ears That was all Then quiet again though the gamins had startled and listened like young deer at the sound The doorways to all the buildings were closed the shutters to the shops were up But there were many police and watchmen in evidence and now and again automobile patrols of the Mercenaries slipped swiftly past Hartman and I agreed that it was useless to report ourselves to the local chiefs of the secret service Our failure so to report would be excused we knew in the light of subsequent events So we headed for the great labor ghetto on the South Side in the hope of getting in contact with some of the comrades Too late We knew it But we could not stand still and do nothing in those ghastly silent streets Where was Ernest I was wondering What was happening in the cities of the labor castes and Mercenaries In the fortresses As if in answer a great screaming roar went up dim with distance punctuated with detonation after detonation It s the fortresses Hartman said God pity those three regiments At a crossing we noticed in the direction of the stockyards a gigantic pillar of smoke At the next crossing several similar smoke pillars were rising skyward in the direction of the West Side Over the city of the Mercenaries we saw a great captive war balloon that burst even as we looked at it and fell in flaming wreckage toward the earth There was no clew to that tragedy of the air We could not determine whether the balloon had been manned by comrades or enemies A vague sound came to our ears like the bubbling of a gigantic caldron a long way off and Hartman said it was machine guns and automatic rifles And still we walked in immediate quietude Nothing was happening where we were The police and the automobile patrols went by and once half a dozen fire engines returning evidently from some conflagration A question was called to the fireman by an officer in an automobile and we heard one shout in reply No water They ve blown up the mains We ve smashed the water supply Hartman cried excitedly to me If we can do all this in a premature isolated abortive attempt what can t we do in a concerted ripened effort all over the land The automobile containing the officer who had asked the question darted on Suddenly there was a deafening roar The machine with its human freight lifted in an upburst of smoke and sank down a mass of wreckage and death Hartman was jubilant Well done well done he was repeating over and over in a whisper The proletariat gets its lesson to day but it gives one too Police were running for the spot Also another patrol machine had halted As for myself I was in a daze The suddenness of it was stunning How had it happened I knew not how and yet I had been looking directly at it So dazed was I for the moment that I was scarcely aware of the fact that we were being held up by the police I abruptly saw that a policeman was in the act of shooting Hartman But Hartman was cool and was giving the proper passwords I saw the levelled revolver hesitate then sink down and heard the disgusted grunt of the policeman He was very angry and was cursing the whole secret service It was always in the way he was averring while Hartman was talking back to him and with fitting secret service pride explaining to him the clumsiness of the police The next moment I knew how it had happened There was quite a group about the wreck and two men were just lifting up the wounded officer to carry him to the other machine A panic seized all of them and they scattered in every direction running in blind terror the wounded officer roughly dropped being left behind The cursing policeman alongside of me also ran and Hartman and I ran too we knew not why obsessed with the same blind terror to get away from that particular spot Nothing really happened then but everything was explained The flying men were sheepishly coming back but all the while their eyes were raised apprehensively to the many windowed lofty buildings that towered like the sheer walls of a canyon on each side of the street From one of those countless windows the bomb had been thrown but which window There had been no second bomb only a fear of one Thereafter we looked with speculative comprehension at the windows Any of them contained possible death Each building was a possible ambuscade This was warfare in that modern jungle a great city Every street was a canyon every building a mountain We had not changed much from primitive man despite the war automobiles that were sliding by Turning a corner we came upon a woman She was lying on the pavement in a pool of blood Hartman bent over and examined her As for myself I turned deathly sick I was to see many dead that day but the total carnage was not to affect me as did this first forlorn body lying there at my feet abandoned on the pavement Shot in the breast was Hartman s report Clasped in the hollow of her arm as a child might be clasped was a bundle of printed matter Even in death she seemed loath to part with that which had caused her death for when Hartman had succeeded in withdrawing the bundle we found that it consisted of large printed sheets the proclamations of the revolutionists A comrade I said But Hartman only cursed the Iron Heel and we passed on Often we were halted by the police and patrols but our passwords enabled us to proceed No more bombs fell from the windows the last pedestrians seemed to have vanished from the streets and our immediate quietude grew more profound though the gigantic caldron continued to bubble in the distance dull roars of explosions came to us from all directions and the smoke pillars were towering more ominously in the heavens CHAPTER XXIII THE PEOPLE OF THE ABYSS Suddenly a change came over the face of things A tingle of excitement ran along the air Automobiles fled past two three a dozen and from them warnings were shouted to us One of the machines swerved wildly at high speed half a block down and the next moment already left well behind it the pavement was torn into a great hole by a bursting bomb We saw the police disappearing down the cross streets on the run and knew that something terrible was coming We could hear the rising roar of it Our brave comrades are coming Hartman said We could see the front of their column filling the street from gutter to gutter as the last war automobile fled past The machine stopped for a moment just abreast of us A soldier leaped from it carrying something carefully in his hands This with the same care he deposited in the gutter Then he leaped back to his seat and the machine dashed on took the turn at the corner and was gone from sight Hartman ran to the gutter and stooped over the object Keep back he warned me I could see he was working rapidly with his hands When he returned to me the sweat was heavy on his forehead I disconnected it he said and just in the nick of time The soldier was clumsy He intended it for our comrades but he didn t give it enough time It would have exploded prematurely Now it won t explode at all Everything was happening rapidly now Across the street and half a block down high up in a building I could see heads peering out I had just pointed them out to Hartman when a sheet of flame and smoke ran along that portion of the face of the building where the heads had appeared and the air was shaken by the explosion In places the stone facing of the building was torn away exposing the iron construction beneath The next moment similar sheets of flame and smoke smote the front of the building across the street opposite it Between the explosions we could hear the rattle of the automatic pistols and rifles For several minutes this mid air battle continued then died out It was patent that our comrades were in one building that Mercenaries were in the other and that they were fighting across the street But we could not tell which was which which building contained our comrades and which the Mercenaries By this time the column on the street was almost on us As the front of it passed under the warring buildings both went into action again one building dropping bombs into the street being attacked from across the street and in return replying to that attack Thus we learned which building was held by our comrades and they did good work saving those in the street from the bombs of the enemy Hartman gripped my arm and dragged me into a wide entrance They re not our comrades he shouted in my ear The inner doors to the entrance were locked and bolted We could not escape The next moment the front of the column went by It was not a column but a mob an awful river that filled the street the people of the abyss mad with drink and wrong up at last and roaring for the blood of their masters I had seen the people of the abyss before gone through its ghettos and thought I knew it but I found that I was now looking on it for the first time Dumb apathy had vanished It was now dynamic a fascinating spectacle of dread It surged past my vision in concrete waves of wrath snarling and growling carnivorous drunk with whiskey from pillaged warehouses drunk with hatred drunk with lust for blood men women and children in rags and tatters dim ferocious intelligences with all the godlike blotted from their features and all the fiendlike stamped in apes and tigers anaemic consumptives and great hairy beasts of burden wan faces from which vampire society had sucked the juice of life bloated forms swollen with physical grossness and corruption withered hags and death s heads bearded like patriarchs festering youth and festering age faces of fiends crooked twisted misshapen monsters blasted with the ravages of disease and all the horrors of chronic innutrition the refuse and the scum of life a raging screaming screeching demoniacal horde And why not The people of the abyss had nothing to lose but the misery and pain of living And to gain nothing save one final awful glut of vengeance And as I looked the thought came to me that in that rushing stream of human lava were men comrades and heroes whose mission had been to rouse the abysmal beast and to keep the enemy occupied in coping with it And now a strange thing happened to me A transformation came over me The fear of death for myself and for others left me I was strangely exalted another being in another life Nothing mattered The Cause for this one time was lost but the Cause would be here to morrow the same Cause ever fresh and ever burning And thereafter in the orgy of horror that raged through the succeeding hours I was able to take a calm interest Death meant nothing life meant nothing I was an interested spectator of events and sometimes swept on by the rush was myself a curious participant For my mind had leaped to a star cool altitude and grasped a passionless transvaluation of values Had it not done this I know that I should have died Half a mile of the mob had swept by when we were discovered A woman in fantastic rags with cheeks cavernously hollow and with narrow black eyes like burning gimlets caught a glimpse of Hartman and me She let out a shrill shriek and bore in upon us A section of the mob tore itself loose and surged in after her I can see her now as I write these lines a leap in advance her gray hair flying in thin tangled strings the blood dripping down her forehead from some wound in the scalp in her right hand a hatchet her left hand lean and wrinkled a yellow talon gripping the air convulsively Hartman sprang in front of me This was no time for explanations We were well dressed and that was enough His fist shot out striking the woman between her burning eyes The impact of the blow drove her backward but she struck the wall of her on coming fellows and bounced forward again dazed and helpless the brandished hatchet falling feebly on Hartman s shoulder The next moment I knew not what was happening I was overborne by the crowd The confined space was filled with shrieks and yells and curses Blows were falling on me Hands were ripping and tearing at my flesh and garments I felt that I was being torn to pieces I was being borne down suffocated Some strong hand gripped my shoulder in the thick of the press and was dragging fiercely at me Between pain and pressure I fainted Hartman never came out of that entrance He had shielded me and received the first brunt of the attack This had saved me for the jam had quickly become too dense for anything more than the mad gripping and tearing of hands I came to in the midst of wild movement All about me was the same movement I had been caught up in a monstrous flood that was sweeping me I knew not whither Fresh air was on my cheek and biting sweetly in my lungs Faint and dizzy I was vaguely aware of a strong arm around my body under the arms and half lifting me and dragging me along Feebly my own limbs were helping me In front of me I could see the moving back of a man s coat It had been slit from top to bottom along the centre seam and it pulsed rhythmically the slit opening and closing regularly with every leap of the wearer This phenomenon fascinated me for a time while my senses were coming back to me Next I became aware of stinging cheeks and nose and could feel blood dripping on my face My hat was gone My hair was down and flying and from the stinging of the scalp I managed to recollect a hand in the press of the entrance that had torn at my hair My chest and arms were bruised and aching in a score of places My brain grew clearer and I turned as I ran and looked at the man who was holding me up He it was who had dragged me out and saved me He noticed my movement It s all right he shouted hoarsely I knew you on the instant I failed to recognize him but before I could speak I trod upon something that was alive and that squirmed under my foot I was swept on by those behind and could not look down and see and yet I knew that it was a woman who had fallen and who was being trampled into the pavement by thousands of successive feet It s all right he repeated I m Garthwaite He was bearded and gaunt and dirty but I succeeded in remembering him as the stalwart youth that had spent several months in our Glen Ellen refuge three years before He passed me the signals of the Iron Heel s secret service in token that he too was in its employ I ll get you out of this as soon as I can get a chance he assured me But watch your footing On your life don t stumble and go down All things happened abruptly on that day and with an abruptness that was sickening the mob checked itself I came in violent collision with a large woman in front of me the man with the split coat had vanished while those behind collided against me A devilish pandemonium reigned shrieks curses and cries of death while above all rose the churning rattle of machine guns and the put a put put a put of rifles At first I could make out nothing People were falling about me right and left The woman in front doubled up and went down her hands on her abdomen in a frenzied clutch A man was quivering against my legs in a death struggle It came to me that we were at the head of the column Half a mile of it had disappeared where or how I never learned To this day I do not know what became of that half mile of humanity whether it was blotted out by some frightful bolt of war whether it was scattered and destroyed piecemeal or whether it escaped But there we were at the head of the column instead of in its middle and we were being swept out of life by a torrent of shrieking lead As soon as death had thinned the jam Garthwaite still grasping my arm led a rush of survivors into the wide entrance of an office building Here at the rear against the doors we were pressed by a panting gasping mass of creatures For some time we remained in this position without a change in the situation I did it beautifully Garthwaite was lamenting to me Ran you right into a trap We had a gambler s chance in the street but in here there is no chance at all It s all over but the shouting Vive la Revolution Then what he expected began The Mercenaries were killing without quarter At first the surge back upon us was crushing but as the killing continued the pressure was eased The dead and dying went down and made room Garthwaite put his mouth to my ear and shouted but in the frightful din I could not catch what he said He did not wait He seized me and threw me down Next he dragged a dying woman over on top of me and with much squeezing and shoving crawled in beside me and partly over me A mound of dead and dying began to pile up over us and over this mound pawing and moaning crept those that still survived But these too soon ceased and a semi silence settled down broken by groans and sobs and sounds of strangulation I should have been crushed had it not been for Garthwaite As it was it seemed inconceivable that I could bear the weight I did and live And yet outside of pain the only feeling I possessed was one of curiosity How was it going to end What would death be like Thus did I receive my red baptism in that Chicago shambles Prior to that death to me had been a theory but ever afterward death has been a simple fact that does not matter it is so easy But the Mercenaries were not content with what they had done They invaded the entrance killing the wounded and searching out the unhurt that like ourselves were playing dead I remember one man they dragged out of a heap who pleaded abjectly until a revolver shot cut him short Then there was a woman who charged from a heap snarling and shooting She fired six shots before they got her though what damage she did we could not know We could follow these tragedies only by the sound Every little while flurries like this occurred each flurry culminating in the revolver shot that put an end to it In the intervals we could hear the soldiers talking and swearing as they rummaged among the carcasses urged on by their officers to hurry up At last they went to work on our heap and we could feel the pressure diminish as they dragged away the dead and wounded Garthwaite began uttering aloud the signals At first he was not heard Then he raised his voice Listen to that we heard a soldier say And next the sharp voice of an officer Hold on there Careful as you go Oh that first breath of air as we were dragged out Garthwaite did the talking at first but I was compelled to undergo a brief examination to prove service with the Iron Heel Agents provocateurs all right was the officer s conclusion He was a beardless young fellow a cadet evidently of some great oligarch family It s a hell of a job Garthwaite grumbled I m going to try and resign and get into the army You fellows have a snap You ve earned it was the young officer s answer I ve got some pull and I ll see if it can be managed I can tell them how I found you He took Garthwaite s name and number then turned to me And you Oh I m going to be married I answered lightly and then I ll be out of it all And so we talked while the killing of the wounded went on It is all a dream now as I look back on it but at the time it was the most natural thing in the world Garthwaite and the young officer fell into an animated conversation over the difference between so called modern warfare and the present street fighting and sky scraper fighting that was taking place all over the city I followed them intently fixing up my hair at the same time and pinning together my torn skirts And all the time the killing of the wounded went on Sometimes the revolver shots drowned the voices of Garthwaite and the officer and they were compelled to repeat what they had been saying I lived through three days of the Chicago Commune and the vastness of it and of the slaughter may be imagined when I say that in all that time I saw practically nothing outside the killing of the people of the abyss and the mid air fighting between sky scrapers I really saw nothing of the heroic work done by the comrades I could hear the explosions of their mines and bombs and see the smoke of their conflagrations and that was all The mid air part of one great deed I saw however and that was the balloon attacks made by our comrades on the fortresses That was on the second day The three disloyal regiments had been destroyed in the fortresses to the last man The fortresses were crowded with Mercenaries the wind blew in the right direction and up went our balloons from one of the office buildings in the city Now Biedenbach after he left Glen Ellen had invented a most powerful explosive expedite he called it This was the weapon the balloons used They were only hot air balloons clumsily and hastily made but they did the work I saw it all from the top of an office building The first balloon missed the fortresses completely and disappeared into the country but we learned about it afterward Burton and O Sullivan were in it As they were descending they swept across a railroad directly over a troop train that was heading at full speed for Chicago They dropped their whole supply of expedite upon the locomotive The resulting wreck tied the line up for days And the best of it was that released from the weight of expedite the balloon shot up into the air and did not come down for half a dozen miles both heroes escaping unharmed The second balloon was a failure Its flight was lame It floated too low and was shot full of holes before it could reach the fortresses Herford and Guinness were in it and they were blown to pieces along with the field into which they fell Biedenbach was in despair we heard all about it afterward and he went up alone in the third balloon He too made a low flight but he was in luck for they failed seriously to puncture his balloon I can see it now as I did then from the lofty top of the building that inflated bag drifting along the air and that tiny speck of a man clinging on beneath I could not see the fortress but those on the roof with me said he was directly over it I did not see the expedite fall when he cut it loose But I did see the balloon suddenly leap up into the sky An appreciable time after that the great column of the explosion towered in the air and after that in turn I heard the roar of it Biedenbach the gentle had destroyed a fortress Two other balloons followed at the same time One was blown to pieces in the air the expedite exploding and the shock of it disrupted the second balloon which fell prettily into the remaining fortress It couldn t have been better planned though the two comrades in it sacrificed their lives But to return to the people of the abyss My experiences were confined to them They raged and slaughtered and destroyed all over the city proper and were in turn destroyed but never once did they succeed in reaching the city of the oligarchs over on the west side The oligarchs had protected themselves well No matter what destruction was wreaked in the heart of the city they and their womenkind and children were to escape hurt I am told that their children played in the parks during those terrible days and that their favorite game was an imitation of their elders stamping upon the proletariat But the Mercenaries found it no easy task to cope with the people of the abyss and at the same time fight with the comrades Chicago was true to her traditions and though a generation of revolutionists was wiped out it took along with it pretty close to a generation of its enemies Of course the Iron Heel kept the figures secret but at a very conservative estimate at least one hundred and thirty thousand Mercenaries were slain But the comrades had no chance Instead of the whole country being hand in hand in revolt they were all alone and the total strength of the Oligarchy could have been directed against them if necessary As it was hour after hour day after day in endless train loads by hundreds of thousands the Mercenaries were hurled into Chicago And there were so many of the people of the abyss Tiring of the slaughter a great herding movement was begun by the soldiers the intent of which was to drive the street mobs like cattle into Lake Michigan It was at the beginning of this movement that Garthwaite and I had encountered the young officer This herding movement was practically a failure thanks to the splendid work of the comrades Instead of the great host the Mercenaries had hoped to gather together they succeeded in driving no more than forty thousand of the wretches into the lake Time and again when a mob of them was well in hand and being driven along the streets to the water the comrades would create a diversion and the mob would escape through the consequent hole torn in the encircling net Garthwaite and I saw an example of this shortly after meeting with the young officer The mob of which we had been a part and which had been put in retreat was prevented from escaping to the south and east by strong bodies of troops The troops we had fallen in with had held it back on the west The only outlet was north and north it went toward the lake driven on from east and west and south by machine gun fire and automatics Whether it divined that it was being driven toward the lake or whether it was merely a blind squirm of the monster I do not know but at any rate the mob took a cross street to the west turned down the next street and came back upon its track heading south toward the great ghetto Garthwaite and I at that time were trying to make our way westward to get out of the territory of street fighting and we were caught right in the thick of it again As we came to the corner we saw the howling mob bearing down upon us Garthwaite seized my arm and we were just starting to run when he dragged me back from in front of the wheels of half a dozen war automobiles equipped with machine guns that were rushing for the spot Behind them came the soldiers with their automatic rifles By the time they took position the mob was upon them and it looked as though they would be overwhelmed before they could get into action Here and there a soldier was discharging his rifle but this scattered fire had no effect in checking the mob On it came bellowing with brute rage It seemed the machine guns could not get started The automobiles on which they were mounted blocked the street compelling the soldiers to find positions in between and on the sidewalks More and more soldiers were arriving and in the jam we were unable to get away Garthwaite held me by the arm and we pressed close against the front of a building The mob was no more than twenty five feet away when the machine guns opened up but before that flaming sheet of death nothing could live The mob came on but it could not advance It piled up in a heap a mound a huge and growing wave of dead and dying Those behind urged on and the column from gutter to gutter telescoped upon itself Wounded creatures men and women were vomited over the top of that awful wave and fell squirming down the face of it till they threshed about under the automobiles and against the legs of the soldiers The latter bayoneted the struggling wretches though one I saw who gained his feet and flew at a soldier s throat with his teeth Together they went down soldier and slave into the welter The firing ceased The work was done The mob had been stopped in its wild attempt to break through Orders were being given to clear the wheels of the war machines They could not advance over that wave of dead and the idea was to run them down the cross street The soldiers were dragging the bodies away from the wheels when it happened We learned afterward how it happened A block distant a hundred of our comrades had been holding a building Across roofs and through buildings they made their way till they found themselves looking down upon the close packed soldiers Then it was counter massacre Without warning a shower of bombs fell from the top of the building The automobiles were blown to fragments along with many soldiers We with the survivors swept back in mad retreat Half a block down another building opened fire on us As the soldiers had carpeted the street with dead slaves so in turn did they themselves become carpet Garthwaite and I bore charmed lives As we had done before so again we sought shelter in an entrance But he was not to be caught napping this time As the roar of the bombs died away he began peering out The mob s coming back he called to me We ve got to get out of this We fled hand in hand down the bloody pavement slipping and sliding and making for the corner Down the cross street we could see a few soldiers still running Nothing was happening to them The way was clear So we paused a moment and looked back The mob came on slowly It was busy arming itself with the rifles of the slain and killing the wounded We saw the end of the young officer who had rescued us He painfully lifted himself on his elbow and turned loose with his automatic pistol There goes my chance of promotion Garthwaite laughed as a woman bore down on the wounded man brandishing a butcher s cleaver Come on It s the wrong direction but we ll get out somehow And we fled eastward through the quiet streets prepared at every cross street for anything to happen To the south a monster conflagration was filling the sky and we knew that the great ghetto was burning At last I sank down on the sidewalk I was exhausted and could go no farther I was bruised and sore and aching in every limb yet I could not escape smiling at Garthwaite who was rolling a cigarette and saying I know I m making a mess of rescuing you but I can t get head nor tail of the situation It s all a mess Every time we try to break out something happens and we re turned back We re only a couple of blocks now from where I got you out of that entrance Friend and foe are all mixed up It s chaos You can t tell who is in those darned buildings Try to find out and you get a bomb on your head Try to go peaceably on your way and you run into a mob and are killed by machine guns or you run into the Mercenaries and are killed by your own comrades from a roof And on the top of it all the mob comes along and kills you too He shook his head dolefully lighted his cigarette and sat down beside me And I m that hungry he added I could eat cobblestones The next moment he was on his feet again and out in the street prying up a cobblestone He came back with it and assaulted the window of a store behind us It s ground floor and no good he explained as he helped me through the hole he had made but it s the best we can do You get a nap and I ll reconnoitre I ll finish this rescue all right but I want time time lots of it and something to eat It was a harness store we found ourselves in and he fixed me up a couch of horse blankets in the private office well to the rear To add to my wretchedness a splitting headache was coming on and I was only too glad to close my eyes and try to sleep I ll be back were his parting words I don t hope to get an auto but I ll surely bring some grub anyway Food And that was the last I saw of Garthwaite for three years Instead of coming back he was carried away to a hospital with a bullet through his lungs and another through the fleshy part of his neck CHAPTER XXIV 
5224-35456-0000	train-other-500	NIGHTMARE I had not closed my eyes the night before on the Twentieth Century and what of that and of my exhaustion I slept soundly When I first awoke it was night
5224-35456-0001	train-other-500	Garthwaite had not returned I had lost my watch and had no idea of the time As I lay with my eyes closed I heard the same dull sound of distant explosions The inferno was still raging I crept through the store to the front

5224-35456-0003	train-other-500	and from a long way off came a long series of heavy explosions
none	none	 I crept back to my horse blankets and slept again 
5224-35456-0004	train-other-500	When next I awoke a sickly yellow light was filtering in on me It was dawn of the second day I crept to the front of the store A smoke pall shot through with lurid gleams filled the sky
5224-35456-0005	train-other-500	Down the opposite side of the street tottered a wretched slave One hand he held tightly against his side and behind him he left a bloody trail His eyes roved everywhere and they were filled with apprehension and dread Once he looked straight across at me
5224-35456-0006	train-other-500	and in his face was all the dumb pathos of the wounded and hunted animal He saw me
none	none	 but there was no kinship between us 
5224-35456-0007	train-other-500	and with him at least no sympathy of understanding for he cowered perceptibly and dragged himself on He could expect no aid in all God s world He was a helot in the great hunt of helots that the masters were making
5224-35456-0008	train-other-500	All he could hope for all he sought was some hole to crawl away in and hide like any animal The sharp clang of a passing ambulance at the corner gave him a start Ambulances were not for such as he With a groan of pain he threw himself into a doorway
5224-35456-0009	train-other-500	A minute later he was out again and desperately hobbling on
none	none	 I went back to my horse blankets and waited an hour for Garthwaite 
5224-35456-0010	train-other-500	My headache had not gone away On the contrary it was increasing It was by an effort of will only that I was able to open my eyes and look at objects And with the opening of my eyes and the looking came intolerable torment Also a great pulse was beating in my brain
5224-35456-0011	train-other-500	Weak and reeling I went out through the broken window and down the street seeking to escape instinctively and gropingly from the awful shambles And thereafter I lived nightmare
5224-35456-0012	train-other-500	My memory of what happened in the succeeding hours is the memory one would have of nightmare Many events are focussed sharply on my brain but between these indelible pictures I retain are intervals of unconsciousness What occurred in those intervals I know not and never shall know
5224-35456-0013	train-other-500	I remember stumbling at the corner over the legs of a man It was the poor hunted wretch that had dragged himself past my hiding place How distinctly do I remember his poor pitiful gnarled hands as he lay there on the pavement hands that were more hoof and claw than hands
5224-35456-0014	train-other-500	all twisted and distorted by the toil of all his days with on the palms a horny growth of callous a half inch thick And as I picked myself up and started on I looked into the face of the thing and saw that it still lived for the eyes dimly intelligent were looking at me
5224-35456-0015	train-other-500	and seeing me After that came a kindly blank I knew nothing saw nothing merely tottered on in my quest for safety My next nightmare vision was a quiet street of the dead
5224-35456-0016	train-other-500	I came upon it abruptly as a wanderer in the country would come upon a flowing stream Only this stream I gazed upon did not flow It was congealed in death From pavement to pavement and covering the sidewalks it lay there spread out quite evenly
none	none	 with only here and there a lump or mound of bodies to break the surface Poor driven people of the abyss hunted helots they lay there as the rabbits in California after a drive Up the street and down I looked There was no movement no sound The quiet buildings looked down upon the scene from their many windows And once and once only I saw an arm that moved in that dead stream I swear I saw it move with a strange writhing gesture of agony and with it lifted a head gory with nameless horror that gibbered at me and then lay down again and moved no more In those days so sparsely populated was the land that wild animals often became pests In California the custom of rabbit driving obtained On a given day all the farmers in a locality would assemble and sweep across the country in converging lines driving the rabbits by scores of thousands into a prepared enclosure where they were clubbed to death by men and boys I remember another street with quiet buildings on either side and the panic that smote me into consciousness as again I saw the people of the abyss 
5224-35456-0017	train-other-500	but this time in a stream that flowed and came on And then I saw there was nothing to fear The stream moved slowly while from it arose groans and lamentations cursings babblings of senility hysteria and insanity for these were the very young and the very old
5224-35456-0018	train-other-500	the feeble and the sick the helpless and the hopeless all the wreckage of the ghetto The burning of the great ghetto on the South Side had driven them forth into the inferno of the street fighting and whither they wended and whatever became of them I did not know and never learned It
none	none	 was long a question of debate whether the burning of the South Side ghetto was accidental or whether it was done by the Mercenaries 
5224-35456-0019	train-other-500	but it is definitely settled now that the ghetto was fired by the Mercenaries under orders from their chiefs I have faint memories of breaking a window and hiding in some shop to escape a street mob that was pursued by soldiers
5224-35456-0020	train-other-500	Also a bomb burst near me once in some still street where look as I would up and down I could see no human being But my next sharp recollection begins with the crack of a rifle
none	none	 and an abrupt becoming aware that I am being fired at by a soldier in an automobile 
5224-35456-0021	train-other-500	The shot missed and the next moment I was screaming and motioning the signals My memory of riding in the automobile is very hazy though this ride in turn is broken by one vivid picture The crack of the rifle of the soldier sitting beside me made me open my eyes
5224-35456-0022	train-other-500	and I saw George Milford whom I had known in the Pell Street days sinking slowly down to the sidewalk Even as he sank the soldier fired again and Milford doubled in
none	none	 then flung his body out and fell sprawling 
5224-35456-0023	train-other-500	The soldier chuckled and the automobile sped on The next I knew after that I was awakened out of a sound sleep by a man who walked up and down close beside me His face was drawn and strained and the sweat rolled down his nose from his forehead
5224-35456-0024	train-other-500	One hand was clutched tightly against his chest by the other hand and blood dripped down upon the floor as he walked He wore the uniform of the Mercenaries From without as through thick walls came the muffled roar of bursting bombs I was in some building that was locked in combat with some other building
5224-35456-0025	train-other-500	A surgeon came in to dress the wounded soldier and I learned that it was two in the afternoon My headache was no better and the surgeon paused from his work long enough to give me a powerful drug that would depress the heart and bring relief I slept again and the next I knew I was on top of the building
none	none	 The immediate fighting had ceased and I was watching the balloon attack on the fortresses 
5224-35456-0026	train-other-500	Some one had an arm around me and I was leaning close against him It came to me quite as a matter of course that this was Ernest and I found myself wondering how he had got his hair and eyebrows so badly singed It was by the merest chance that we had found each other in that terrible city
5224-35456-0027	train-other-500	He had had no idea that I had left New York and coming through the room where I lay asleep could not at first believe that it was I Little more I saw of the Chicago Commune After watching the balloon attack Ernest took me down into the heart of the building where I slept the afternoon out and the night
5224-35456-0028	train-other-500	The third day we spent in the building and on the fourth Ernest having got permission and an automobile from the authorities we left Chicago My headache was gone but body and soul I was very tired I lay back against Ernest in the automobile
5224-35456-0029	train-other-500	and with apathetic eyes watched the soldiers trying to get the machine out of the city Fighting was still going on but only in isolated localities Here and there whole districts were still in possession of the comrades but such districts were surrounded and guarded by heavy bodies of troops
5224-35456-0030	train-other-500	In a hundred segregated traps were the comrades thus held while the work of subjugating them went on Subjugation meant death for no quarter was given and they fought heroically to the last man Numbers
none	none	 of the buildings held out over a week 
5224-35456-0031	train-other-500	while one held out eleven days Each building had to be stormed like a fort and the Mercenaries fought their way upward floor by floor It was deadly fighting Quarter was neither given nor taken and in the fighting the revolutionists had the advantage of being above
5224-35456-0032	train-other-500	While the revolutionists were wiped out the loss was not one sided The proud Chicago proletariat lived up to its ancient boast For as many of itself as were killed it killed that many of the enemy
5224-35456-0033	train-other-500	Whenever we approached such localities the guards turned us back and sent us around Once the only way past two strong positions of the comrades was through a burnt section that lay between From either side we could hear the rattle and roar of war
5224-35456-0034	train-other-500	while the automobile picked its way through smoking ruins and tottering walls Often the streets were blocked by mountains of debris that compelled us to go around We were in a labyrinth of ruin and our progress was slow The stockyards ghetto plant and everything
5224-35456-0035	train-other-500	were smouldering ruins Far off to the right a wide smoke haze dimmed the sky the town of Pullman the soldier chauffeur told us or what had been the town of Pullman for it was utterly destroyed He had driven the machine out there with despatches on the afternoon of the third day
5224-35456-0036	train-other-500	Some of the heaviest fighting had occurred there he said many of the streets being rendered impassable by the heaps of the dead Swinging around the shattered walls of a building in the stockyards district the automobile was stopped by a wave of dead It was for all the world like a wave tossed up by the sea
5224-35456-0037	train-other-500	It was patent to us what had happened As the mob charged past the corner it had been swept at right angles and point blank range by the machine guns drawn up on the cross street But disaster had come to the soldiers A chance bomb must have exploded among them for the mob
5224-35456-0038	train-other-500	checked until its dead and dying formed the wave had white capped and flung forward its foam of living fighting slaves Soldiers and slaves lay together torn and mangled around and over the wreckage of the automobiles and guns Ernest sprang out
5224-35456-0039	train-other-500	A familiar pair of shoulders in a cotton shirt and a familiar fringe of white hair had caught his eye I did not watch him and it was not until he was back beside me and we were speeding on that he said It was Bishop Morehouse
5224-35456-0040	train-other-500	Soon we were in the green country and I took one last glance back at the smoke filled sky
none	none	 Faint and far came the low thud of an explosion Then I turned my face against Ernest s breast and wept softly 
5224-35456-0041	train-other-500	for the Cause that was lost Ernest s arm about me was eloquent with love For this time lost dear heart he said but not forever We have learned To morrow the Cause will rise again
5224-35456-0042	train-other-500	strong with wisdom and discipline The automobile drew up at a railroad station
none	none	 Here we would catch a train to New York 
5224-35456-0043	train-other-500	As we waited on the platform three trains thundered past bound west to Chicago They were crowded with ragged unskilled laborers people of the abyss Slave levies for the rebuilding of Chicago Ernest said
none	none	 You see the Chicago slaves are all killed CHAPTER XXV THE TERRORISTS It was not until Ernest and I were back in New York and after weeks had elapsed that we were able to comprehend thoroughly the full sweep of the disaster that had befallen the Cause The situation was bitter and bloody In many places scattered over the country slave revolts and massacres had occurred The roll of the martyrs increased mightily Countless executions took place everywhere The mountains and waste regions were filled with outlaws and refugees who were being hunted down mercilessly Our own refuges were packed with comrades who had prices on their heads Through information furnished by its spies scores of our refuges were raided by the soldiers of the Iron Heel Many of the comrades were disheartened and they retaliated with terroristic tactics The set back to their hopes made them despairing and desperate Many terrorist organizations unaffiliated with us sprang into existence and caused us much trouble These misguided people sacrificed their own lives wantonly very often made our own plans go astray and retarded our organization The annals of this short lived era of despair make bloody reading Revenge was the ruling motive and the members of the terroristic organizations were careless of their own lives and hopeless about the future The Danites taking their name from the avenging angels of the Mormon mythology sprang up in the mountains of the Great West and spread over the Pacific Coast from Panama to Alaska The Valkyries were women They were the most terrible of all No woman was eligible for membership who had not lost near relatives at the hands of the Oligarchy They were guilty of torturing their prisoners to death Another famous organization of women was The Widows of War A companion organization to the Valkyries was the Berserkers These men placed no value whatever upon their own lives and it was they who totally destroyed the great Mercenary city of Bellona along with its population of over a hundred thousand souls The Bedlamites and the Helldamites were twin slave organizations while a new religious sect that did not flourish long was called The Wrath of God Among others to show the whimsicality of their deadly seriousness may be mentioned the following The Bleeding Hearts Sons of the Morning the Morning Stars The Flamingoes The Triple Triangles The Three Bars The Rubonics The Vindicators The Comanches and the Erebusites And through it all moved the Iron Heel impassive and deliberate shaking up the whole fabric of the social structure in its search for the comrades combing out the Mercenaries the labor castes and all its secret services punishing without mercy and without malice suffering in silence all retaliations that were made upon it and filling the gaps in its fighting line as fast as they appeared And hand in hand with this Ernest and the other leaders were hard at work reorganizing the forces of the Revolution The magnitude of the task may be understood when it is taken into This is the end of the Everhard Manuscript It breaks off abruptly in the middle of a sentence She must have received warning of the coming of the Mercenaries for she had time safely to hide the Manuscript before she fled or was captured It is to be regretted that she did not live to complete her narrative for then undoubtedly would have been cleared away the mystery that has shrouded for seven centuries the execution of Ernest Everhard End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Iron Heel by Jack London END OF THIS PROJECT
