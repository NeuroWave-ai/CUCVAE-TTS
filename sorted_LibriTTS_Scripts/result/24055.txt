him for not dethroning at once the tyrant Chou Hsin two Tzu chang asked Confucius How should men be governed The Master said To govern men we must honour five fair things and spurn four evil things Tzu chang said What are the five fair things The Master said A gentleman is kind but not wasteful he burdens but he does not embitter he is covetous but not greedy high minded but not proud stern but not fierce Tzu chang said What is meant by kindness without waste The Master said To further what furthers the people is not that kindness without waste If burdens be sorted to strength who will grumble To covet love and get love is that greed Few or many small or great all is one to a gentleman he dares not slight any man Is not this to be high minded but not proud A gentleman straightens his robe and cap and settles his look He is severe and men look up to him with awe Is not this to be stern but not fierce Tzu chang said What are the four evil things The Master said To leave untaught and then kill is cruelty not to give warning and to expect things to be done is tyranny to give careless orders and be strict when the day comes is robbery to be stingy in rewarding men is littleness three The Master said He that does not know the Bidding cannot be a gentleman Not to know good form is to have no foothold Not to know words is to know nothing of men INDEX The Index has been
