none	none	Elsie Clover where s papa He went over the river to see that son of mister White s who broke his leg Why what s the matter asked Clover Is somebody hurt inquired Elsie startled at Katy s agitated looks No not hurt but poor missus Ashe is in such trouble missus Ashe it should be explained was a widow who had come to Burnet some months previously and had taken a pleasant house not far from the Carrs She was a pretty lady like woman with a particularly graceful appealing manner and very fond of her one child a little girl Katy and papa both took a fancy to her at once and the families had grown neighborly and intimate in a short time as people occasionally do when circumstances are favorable I ll tell you all about it in a minute went on Katy But first I must find Alexander and send him off to meet papa and beg him to hurry home She went to the head of the stairs as she spoke and called Debby Debby Debby answered Katy gave her direction and then came back again to the room where the other two were sitting Now she said speaking more collectedly I must explain as fast as I can for I have got to go back You know that missus Ashe s little nephew is here for a visit don t you Yes he came on Saturday Well he was ailing all day yesterday and to day he is worse and she is afraid it is scarlet fever Luckily Amy was spending the day with the Uphams yesterday so she scarcely saw the boy at all and as soon as her mother became alarmed she sent her out into the garden to play and hasn t let her come indoors since so she can t have been exposed to any particular danger yet I went by the house on my way down street and there sat the poor little thing all alone in the arbor with her dolly in her lap looking so disconsolate I spoke to her over the fence and missus Ashe heard my voice and opened the upstairs window and called to me She said Amy had never had the fever and that the very idea of her having it frightened her to death She is such a delicate child you know Oh poor missus Ashe cried Clover I am so sorry for her Well Katy what did you do I hope I didn t do wrong but I offered to bring Amy here Papa won t object I am almost sure

none	none	didn t kiss me for good by sobbed the little girl She didn t come downstairs at all She just put her head out of the window and said Good by Amy be very good and don t make Miss Carr any trouble and then she went away I never went anywhere before without kissing mamma for good by Mamma was afraid to kiss you for fear she might give you the fever explained Katy taking her turn as a comforter It wasn t because she forgot She felt worse about it than you did I imagine You know the thing she cares most for is that you shall not be ill as your cousin Walter is She would rather do anything than have that happen As soon as he gets well she will kiss you dozens of times see if she doesn t Meanwhile she says in this note that you must write her a little letter every day and she will hang a basket by a string out of the window and you and I will go and drop the letters into the basket and stand by the gate and see her pull it up That will be funny won t it We will play that you are my little girl and that you have a real mamma and a make believe mamma Shall I sleep with you demanded Amy Yes in that bed over there It s a pretty bed pronounced Amy after examining it gravely for a moment Will you tell me a story every morning Illustration She was having the measles on the back shelf of the closet you know If you don t wake me up too early My stories are always sleepy till seven o clock Let us see what Ellen has packed in that bag and then I ll give you some drawers of your own and we will put the things away The bag was full of neat little frocks and underclothes stuffed hastily in all together Katy took them out smoothing the folds and crimping the tumbled ruffles with her fingers As she lifted the last skirt Amy with a cry of joy pounced on something that lay beneath it It is Maria Matilda she said I m glad of that I thought Ellen would forget her and the poor child wouldn t know what to do with me and her little sister not coming to see her for so long She was having the measles on the back shelf of the closet you know and nobody would have heard her if she had cried ever so loud What a pretty face she has said Katy taking the doll out of Amy s hands Yes but not so pretty as Mabel Miss Upham says that Mabel is the prettiest child she ever saw Look Miss Clover lifting the other doll from the table where she had laid it hasn t she got sweet eyes She s older than Maria Matilda and she knows a great deal more She s begun on French verbs Not really Which ones Oh only J aime tu aimes il aime you know the same that our class is learning at school She hasn t tried any but that Sometimes she says it quite nicely but sometimes she s very stupid and I have to scold her Amy had quite recovered her spirits by this time Are these the only dolls you have Oh please don t call them that urged Amy It hurts their feelings dreadfully I never let them know that they are dolls They think that they are real children only sometimes when they are very bad I use the word for a punishment I ve got several other children There s old Ragazza My uncle named her and she s made of rag but she has such bad rheumatism that I don t play with her any longer I just give her medicine Then there s Effie Deans she s only got one leg and Mopsa the Fairy she s a tiny one made out of china and Peg of Linkinvaddy but she don t count for she s all come to pieces What very queer names your children have said Elsie who had come in during the enumeration Yes Uncle Ned named them He s a very funny uncle but he s nice He s always so much interested in my children There s papa now cried Katy and she ran downstairs to meet him Did

none	none	right she asked anxiously after she had told her story Yes my dear perfectly right replied doctor Carr I only hope Amy was taken away in time I will go round at once to see missus Ashe and the boy and Katy keep away from me when I come back and keep the others away till I have changed my coat It is odd how soon and how easily human beings accustom themselves to a new condition of things When sudden illness comes or sudden sorrow or a house is burned up or blown down by a tornado there are a few hours or days of confusion and bewilderment and then people gather up their wits and their courage and set to work to repair damages They clear away ruins plant rebuild very much as ants whose hill has been trodden upon after running wildly about for a little while begin all together to reconstruct the tiny cone of sand which is so important in their eyes In a very short time the changes which at first seem so sad and strange become accustomed and matter of course things which no longer surprise us It seemed to the Carrs after a few days as if they had always had Amy in the house with them Papa s daily visit to the sick room their avoidance of him till after he had changed his coat Amy s lessons and games of play her dressing and undressing the walks with the make believe mamma the dropping of notes into the little basket seemed part of a system of things which had been going on for a long long time and which everybody would miss should they suddenly stop But they by no means suddenly stopped Little Walter Ashe s case proved to be rather a severe one and after he had begun to mend he caught cold somehow and was taken worse again There were some serious symptoms and for a few days doctor Carr did not feel sure how things would turn He did not speak of his anxiety at home but kept silence and a cheerful face as doctors know how to do Only Katy who was more intimate with her father than the rest guessed that things were going gravely at the other house and she was too well trained to ask questions The threatening symptoms passed off however and little Walter slowly got better but it was a long convalescence and missus Ashe grew thin and pale before he began to look rosy There was no one on whom she could devolve the charge of the child His mother was dead his father an overworked business man had barely time to run up once a week to see about him there was no one at his home but a housekeeper in whom missus Ashe had not full confidence So the good aunt denied herself the sight of her own child and devoted her strength and time to Walter and nearly two months passed and still little Amy remained at doctor Carr s She was entirely happy there She had grown very fond of Katy and was perfectly at home with the others Phil and Johnnie who had returned from her visit to Cecy were by no means too old or too proud to be play fellows to a child of eight and with all the older members of the family Amy was a chosen pet Debby baked turnovers and twisted cinnamon cakes into all sorts of fantastic shapes to please her Alexander would let her drive if she happened to sit on the front seat of the carryall doctor Carr was seldom so tired that he could not tell her a story and nobody told such nice stories as doctor Carr Amy thought Elsie invented all manner of charming games for the hour before bedtime Clover made wonderful capes and bonnets for Mabel and Maria Matilda and Katy Katy did all sorts of things Katy had a peculiar gift with children which is not easy to define Some people possess it and some do not it cannot be learned it comes by nature She was bright and firm and equable all at once She both amused and influenced them There was something about her which excited the childish imagination and always they felt her sympathy Amy was a tractable child and intelligent beyond her age but she was never quite so good with any one as with Katy She followed her about like a little lover she lavished upon her certain special words and caresses which she gave to no one else and would kneel on her lap patting Katy s shoulders with her soft hand and cooing up into her face like a happy dove for a half hour together Katy laughed at these demonstrations but they pleased her very much She loved to be loved as all affectionate people do but most of all to be loved by a child At last the long convalescence ended Walter was carried away to his father with every possible precaution against fatigue and exposure and an army of workpeople was turned into missus Ashe s house Plaster was scraped and painted wall papers torn down mattresses made over and clothing burned At last doctor Carr pronounced the premises in a sanitary condition and missus Ashe sent for her little girl to come home again Amy was overjoyed at the prospect of seeing her mother but at the last moment she clung to Katy and cried as if her heart would break I want you too she said Oh if doctor Carr would only let you come and live with me and mamma I should be so happy I shall be so lone ly Nonsense cried Clover Lonely with mamma and those poor children of yours who have been wondering all these weeks what has become of you They ll want a great deal of attention at first I am sure medicine and new clothes and whippings all manner of things You remember I promised to make a dress for Effie Deans out of that blue and brown plaid like Johnnie s balmoral I mean to begin it to morrow Oh will you forgetting her grief that will be lovely The skirt needn t be very full you know Effie doesn t walk much because of only having one leg She will be so pleased for she hasn t had a new dress I don t know when Consoled by the prospect of Effie s satisfaction Amy departed quite cheerfully and missus Ashe was spared the pain of seeing her only child in tears on the first evening of their reunion But Amy talked so constantly of Katy and seemed to love her so much that it put a plan into her mother s head which led to important results as the next chapter will show 
4054_11077_000002_000000	train-clean-360	CHAPTER II 
none	none	AN INVITATION 
4054_11077_000004_000000	train-clean-360	It is a curious fact and makes life very interesting that generally speaking none of us have any expectation that things are going to happen till the very moment when they do happen 
none	none	We wake up some morning with no idea that a great happiness is at hand and before night it has come and all the world is changed for us or we wake bright and cheerful with never a guess that clouds of sorrow are lowering in our sky to put all the sunshine out for a while and before noon all is dark Nothing whispers of either the joy or the grief 
4054_11077_000004_000003	train-clean-360	No instinct bids us to delay or to hasten the opening of the letter or telegram or the lifting of the latch of the door at which stands the messenger of good or ill 
4054_11077_000004_000004	train-clean-360	And because it may be and often is happy tidings that come and joyful things which happen each fresh day as it dawns upon us is like an unread story full of possible interest and adventure to be made ours as soon as we have cut the pages and begun to read 
4054_11077_000005_000000	train-clean-360	Nothing whispered to Katy Carr as she sat at the window mending a long rent in Johnnie s school coat and saw missus Ashe come in at the side gate and ring the office bell that the visit had any special significance for her 
4054_11077_000005_000001	train-clean-360	missus Ashe often did come to the office to consult doctor Carr 
4054_11077_000005_000002	train-clean-360	Amy might not be quite well Katy thought or there might be a letter with something about Walter in it or perhaps matters had gone wrong at the house where paperers and painters were still at work 
none	none	So she went calmly on with her darning drawing the ravelling with which her needle was threaded carefully in and out and taking nice even stitches without one prophetic thrill or tremor while if only she could have looked through the two walls and two doors which separated the room in which she sat from the office and have heard what missus Ashe was saying the school coat would have been thrown to the winds and for all her tall stature and propriety she would have been skipping with delight and astonishment 
4054_11077_000005_000004	train-clean-360	For missus Ashe was asking papa to let her do the very thing of all others that she most longed to do she was asking him to let Katy go with her to Europe 
none	none	I am not very well she told the Doctor
4054_11077_000006_000001	train-clean-360	 I got tired and run down while Walter was ill and I don t seem to throw it off as I hoped I should 
none	none	I feel as if a change would do me good 
4054_11077_000010_000004	train-clean-360	Don t you think so 
4054_11077_000006_000003	train-clean-360	Don t you think so yourself 
4054_11077_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes I do doctor Carr admitted 
none	none	This idea of Europe is not altogether a new one continued missus Ashe I have always meant to go some time and have put it off partly because I dreaded going alone and didn t know anybody whom I exactly wanted to take with me 
4054_11077_000008_000001	train-clean-360	But if you will let me have Katy doctor Carr it will settle all my difficulties 
none	none	Amy loves her dearly and so do I she is just the companion I need if I have her with me I sha n t be afraid of anything 
4054_11077_000008_000003	train-clean-360	I do hope you will consent 
4054_11077_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 How long do you mean to be away asked doctor Carr divided between pleasure at these compliments to Katy and dismay at the idea of losing her 
4054_11077_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 About a year I think 
4054_11077_000010_000001	train-clean-360	My plans are rather vague as yet but my idea was to spend a few weeks in Scotland and England first I have some cousins in London who will be good to us and an old friend of mine married a gentleman who lives on the Isle of Wight perhaps we might go there 
4054_11077_000010_000002	train-clean-360	Then we could cross over to France and visit Paris and a few other places and before it gets cold go down to Nice and from there to Italy 
4054_11077_000010_000003	train-clean-360	Katy would like to see Italy 
none	none	Don t you think so
4054_11077_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 I dare say she would said doctor Carr with a smile 
4054_11077_000011_000001	train-clean-360	 She would be a queer girl if she didn t 
none	none	There is one reason why I thought Italy would be particularly pleasant this winter for me and for her too went on missus Ashe and that is because my brother will be there He is a lieutenant in the navy you know and his ship the Natchitoches is one of the Mediterranean squadron They will be in Naples by and by and if we were there at the same time we should have Ned to go about with and he would take us to the receptions on the frigate and all that which would be a nice chance for Katy 
4054_11077_000012_000003	train-clean-360	Then toward spring I should like to go to Florence and Venice and visit the Italian lakes and Switzerland in the early summer But all this depends on your letting Katy go 
4054_11077_000012_000004	train-clean-360	If you decide against it I shall give the whole thing up 
none	none	But you won t decide against it coaxingly you will be kinder than that I will take the best possible care of her and do all I can to make her happy if only you will consent to lend her to me and I shall consider it such a favor And it is to cost you nothing 
4054_11077_000012_000007	train-clean-360	You understand Doctor she is to be my guest all through 
none	none	That is a point I want to make clear in the outset for she goes for my sake and I cannot take her on any other conditions Now doctor Carr please please 
4054_11077_000012_000009	train-clean-360	I am sure you won t deny me when I have so set my heart upon having her 
4054_11077_000013_000000	train-clean-360	missus Ashe was very pretty and persuasive but still doctor Carr hesitated To send Katy for a year s pleasuring in Europe was a thing that had never occurred to his mind as possible 
none	none	The cost alone would have prevented for country doctors with six children are not apt to be rich men even in the limited and old fashioned construction of the word wealth It seemed equally impossible to let her go at missus Ashe s expense at the same time the chance was such a good one and missus Ashe so much in earnest and so urgent that it was difficult to refuse point blank 
4054_11077_000013_000002	train-clean-360	He finally consented to take time for consideration before making his decision 
4054_11077_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 I will talk it over with Katy he said 
4054_11077_000014_000001	train-clean-360	 The child ought to have a say in the matter and whatever we decide you must let me thank you in her name as well as my own for your great kindness in proposing it 
4054_11077_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 Doctor I m not kind at all and I don t want to be thanked 
4054_11077_000015_000001	train-clean-360	My desire to take Katy with me to Europe is purely selfish 
4054_11077_000015_000002	train-clean-360	I am a lonely person she went on I have no mother or sister and no cousins of my own age My brother s profession keeps him at sea I scarcely ever see him 
4054_11077_000015_000003	train-clean-360	I have no one but a couple of old aunts too feeble in health to travel with me or to be counted on in case of any emergency 
4054_11077_000015_000004	train-clean-360	You see I am a real case for pity 
4054_11077_000016_000000	train-clean-360	missus Ashe spoke gayly but her brown eyes were dim with tears as she ended her little appeal 
4054_11077_000016_000001	train-clean-360	doctor Carr who was soft hearted where women were concerned was touched 
4054_11077_000016_000002	train-clean-360	Perhaps his face showed it for missus Ashe added in a more hopeful tone 
4054_11077_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 But I won t tease any more 
4054_11077_000017_000001	train-clean-360	I know you will not refuse me unless you think it right and necessary and she continued mischievously I have great faith in Katy as an ally 
4054_11077_000017_000002	train-clean-360	I am pretty sure that she will say that she wants to go 
4054_11077_000018_000000	train-clean-360	And indeed Katy s cry of delight when the plan was proposed to her said that sufficiently without need of further explanation 
4054_11077_000018_000001	train-clean-360	To go to Europe for a year with missus Ashe and Amy seemed simply too delightful to be true 
none	none	All the things she had heard about and read about cathedrals pictures Alpine peaks famous places famous people came rushing into her mind in a sort of bewildering tide as dazzling as it was overwhelming 
4054_11077_000018_000003	train-clean-360	doctor Carr s objections his reluctance to part with her melted before the radiance of her satisfaction 
4054_11077_000018_000004	train-clean-360	He had no idea that Katy would care so much about it 
4054_11077_000018_000005	train-clean-360	After all it was a great chance perhaps the only one of the sort that she would ever have missus Ashe could well afford to give Katy this treat he knew and it was quite true what she said that it was a favor to her as well as to Katy 
4054_11077_000018_000006	train-clean-360	This train of reasoning led to its natural results 
4054_11077_000018_000007	train-clean-360	doctor Carr began to waver in his mind 
4054_11077_000019_000000	train-clean-360	But the first excitement over Katy s second thoughts were more sober ones 
4054_11077_000019_000001	train-clean-360	How could papa manage without her for a whole year she asked herself 
4054_11077_000019_000002	train-clean-360	He would miss her she well knew and might not the charge of the house be too much for Clover 
none	none	The preserves were almost all made that was one comfort but there were the winter clothes to be seen to Dorry needed new flannels Elsie s dresses must be altered over for Johnnie there were cucumbers to pickle the coal to order 
4054_11077_000019_000004	train-clean-360	A host of housewifely cares began to troop through Katy s mind and a little pucker came into her forehead and a worried look across the face which had been so bright a few minutes before 
none	none	Strange to say it was that little pucker and the look of worry which decided doctor Carr
4054_11077_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 She is only twenty one he reflected hardly out of childhood 
4054_11077_000020_000001	train-clean-360	I don t want her to settle into an anxious drudging state and lose her youth with caring for us all 
4054_11077_000020_000002	train-clean-360	She shall go though how we are to manage without her I don t see 
none	none	Little Clover will have to come to the fore and show what sort of stuff there is in her
4054_11077_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 Little Clover came gallantly to the fore when the first shock of surprise was over and she had relieved her mind with one long private cry over having to do without Katy for a year 
none	none	Then she wiped her eyes and began to revel unselfishly in the idea of her sister s having so great a treat 
4054_11077_000021_000002	train-clean-360	Anything and everything seemed possible to secure it for her and she made light of all Katy s many anxieties and apprehensions 
4054_11077_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 My dear child I know a flannel undershirt when I see one just as well as you do she declared 
4054_11077_000022_000001	train-clean-360	 Tucks in Johnnie s dress forsooth 
none	none	why of course 
4054_11077_000022_000003	train-clean-360	Ripping out a tuck doesn t require any superhuman ingenuity Give me your scissors and I ll show you at once 
4054_11077_000022_000004	train-clean-360	Quince marmalade Debby can make that 
none	none	Hers is about as good as yours and if it wasn t what should we care as long as you are ascending Mont Blanc and hob nobbing with Michael Angelo and the crowned heads of Europe 
4054_11077_000022_000006	train-clean-360	I ll make the spiced peaches 
4054_11077_000022_000007	train-clean-360	I ll order the kindling 
none	none	And if there ever comes a time when I feel lost and can t manage without advice I ll go across to missus Hall 
4054_11077_000022_000009	train-clean-360	Don t worry about us 
none	none	We shall get on happily and easily in fact I shouldn t be surprised if I developed such a turn for housekeeping that when you come back the family refused to change and you had just to sit for the rest of your life and twirl your thumbs and watch me do it 
4054_11077_000022_000011	train-clean-360	Wouldn t that be fine and Clover laughed merrily 
4054_11077_000022_000012	train-clean-360	 So Katy darling cast that shadow from your brow and look as a girl ought to look who s going to Europe 
none	none	Why if it were I who were going I should simply stand on my head every moment of the time
4054_11077_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 Not a very convenient position for packing said Katy smiling 
4054_11077_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes it is if you just turn your trunk upside down 
4054_11077_000024_000001	train-clean-360	When I think of all the delightful things you are going to do I can hardly sit still 
none	none	I love missus Ashe for inviting you
4054_11077_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 So do I said Katy soberly 
4054_11077_000025_000001	train-clean-360	 It was the kindest thing 
4054_11077_000025_000002	train-clean-360	I can t think why she did it 
4054_11077_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 Well I can replied Clover always ready to defend Katy even against herself 
4054_11077_000026_000001	train-clean-360	 She did it because she wanted you and she wanted you because you are the dearest old thing in the world and the nicest to have about 
4054_11077_000026_000002	train-clean-360	You needn t say you re not for you are 
4054_11077_000026_000003	train-clean-360	Now Katy don t waste another thought on such miserable things as pickles and undershirts 
4054_11077_000026_000004	train-clean-360	We shall get along perfectly well I do assure you 
4054_11077_000026_000005	train-clean-360	Just fix your mind instead on the dome of saint Peter s or try to fancy how you ll feel the first time you step into a gondola or see the Mediterranean 
4054_11077_000026_000006	train-clean-360	There will be a moment 
4054_11077_000026_000007	train-clean-360	I feel a forty horse power of housekeeping developing within me and what fun it will be to get your letters 
none	none	We shall fetch out the Encyclopaedia and the big Atlas and the History of Modern Europe and read all about everything you see and all the places you go to and it will be as good as a lesson in geography and history and political economy all combined only a great deal more interesting 
4054_11077_000026_000009	train-clean-360	We shall stick out all over with knowledge before you come back and this makes it a plain duty to go if it were only for our sakes With these zealous promises Katy was forced to be content 
4054_11077_000026_000010	train-clean-360	Indeed contentment was not difficult with such a prospect of delight before her 
4054_11077_000026_000011	train-clean-360	When once her little anxieties had been laid aside the idea of the coming journey grew in pleasantness every moment 
none	none	Night after night she and papa and the children pored over maps and made out schemes for travel and sight seeing every one of which was likely to be discarded as soon as the real journey began 
4054_11077_000026_000013	train-clean-360	But they didn t know that and it made no real difference 
none	none	Such schemes are the preliminary joys of travel and it doesn t signify that they come to nothing after they have served their purpose 
4054_11077_000027_000000	train-clean-360	Katy learned a great deal while thus talking over what she was to see and do 
4054_11077_000027_000001	train-clean-360	She read every scrap she could lay her hand on which related to Rome or Florence or Venice or London 
4054_11077_000027_000002	train-clean-360	The driest details had a charm for her now that she was likely to see the real places 
4054_11077_000027_000003	train-clean-360	She went about with scraps of paper in her pocket on which were written such things as these Forum 
4054_11077_000027_000004	train-clean-360	When built 
4054_11077_000027_000005	train-clean-360	By whom built 
4054_11077_000027_000006	train-clean-360	More than one 
none	none	What does Cenacola mean
4054_11077_000027_000008	train-clean-360	 Cecilia Metella 
none	none	Who was she Find out about Saint Catherine of Siena Who was Beatrice Cenci How she wished that she had studied harder and more carefully before this wonderful chance came to her 
4054_11077_000027_000010	train-clean-360	People always wish this when they are starting for Europe and they wish it more and more after they get there and realize of what value exact ideas and information and a fuller knowledge of the foreign languages are to all travellers how they add to the charm of everything seen and enhance the ease of everything done 
4054_11077_000028_000000	train-clean-360	All Burnet took an interest in Katy s plans and almost everybody had some sort of advice or help or some little gift to offer 
none	none	Old missus Worrett who though fatter than ever still retained the power of locomotion drove in from Conic Section in her roomy carryall with the present of a rather obsolete copy of Murray s Guide in faded red covers which her father had used in his youth and which she was sure Katy would find convenient also a bottle of Brown s Jamaica Ginger in case of sea sickness 
4054_11077_000028_000002	train-clean-360	Debby s sister in law brought a bundle of dried chamomile for the same purpose 
none	none	Some one had told her it was the handiest thing in the world to take along with you on them steamboats Cecy sent a wonderful old gold and scarlet contrivance to hang on the wall of the stateroom There were pockets for watches and pockets for medicines and pockets for handkerchief and hairpins in short there were pockets for everything besides a pincushion with Bon Voyage in rows of shining pins a bottle of eau de cologne a cake of soap and a hammer and tacks to nail the whole up with 
4054_11077_000028_000005	train-clean-360	missus Hall s gift was a warm and very pretty woollen wrapper of dark blue flannel with a pair of soft knitted slippers to match 
4054_11077_000028_000006	train-clean-360	Old mister Worrett sent a note of advice recommending Katy to take a quinine pill every day that she was away never to stay out late because the dews over there were said to be unwholesome and on no account to drink a drop of water which had not been boiled 
none	none	From Cousin Helen came a delightful travelling bag light and strong at once and fitted up with all manner of nice little conveniences 
4054_11077_000029_000001	train-clean-360	Miss Inches sent a History of Europe in five fat volumes which was so heavy that it had to be left at home 
4054_11077_000029_000002	train-clean-360	In fact a good many of Katy s presents had to be left at home including a bronze paper weight in the shape of a griffin a large pair of brass screw candlesticks and an ormolu inkstand with a pen rest attached which weighed at least a pound and a half 
4054_11077_000029_000003	train-clean-360	These Katy laid aside to enjoy after her return 
4054_11077_000029_000004	train-clean-360	missus Ashe and Cousin Helen had both warned her of the inconvenient consequences of weight in baggage and by their advice she had limited herself to a single trunk of moderate size besides a little flat valise for use in her stateroom 
4054_11077_000030_000000	train-clean-360	Clover s gift was a set of blank books for notes journals et cetera 
4054_11077_000030_000001	train-clean-360	In one of these Katy made out a list of Things I must see Things I must do Things I would like to see Things I would like to do Another she devoted to various good shopping addresses which had been given her for though she did not expect to do any shopping herself she thought missus Ashe might find them useful 
none	none	Katy s ideas were still so simple and unworldly and her experience of life so small that it had not occurred to her how very tantalizing it might be to stand in front of shop windows full of delightful things and not be able to buy any of them She was accordingly overpowered with surprise gratitude and the sense of sudden wealth when about a week before the start her father gave her three little thin strips of paper which he told her were circular notes and worth a hundred dollars apiece 
4054_11077_000030_000003	train-clean-360	He also gave her five English sovereigns 
4054_11077_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 Those are for immediate use he said 
4054_11077_000031_000001	train-clean-360	 Put the notes away carefully and don t lose them 
none	none	You had better have them cashed one at a time as you require them 
4054_11077_000031_000003	train-clean-360	missus Ashe will explain how 
none	none	You will need a gown or so before you come back and you ll want to buy some photographs and so on and there will be fees
4054_11077_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 But papa protested Katy opening wide her candid eyes I didn t expect you to give me any money and I m afraid you are giving me too much 
none	none	Do you think you can afford it 
4054_11077_000032_000002	train-clean-360	Really and truly I don t want to buy things 
4054_11077_000032_000003	train-clean-360	I shall see everything you know and that s enough 
4054_11077_000033_000000	train-clean-360	Her father only laughed 
4054_11077_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 You ll be wiser and greedier before the year is out my dear he replied 
4054_11077_000034_000001	train-clean-360	 Three hundred dollars won t go far as you ll find 
none	none	But it s all I can spare and I trust you to keep within it and not come home with any long bills for me to pay Papa 
4054_11077_000035_000001	train-clean-360	I should think not cried Katy with unsophisticated horror 
4054_11077_000036_000000	train-clean-360	One very interesting thing was to happen before they sailed the thought of which helped both Katy and Clover through the last hard days when the preparations were nearly complete and the family had leisure to feel dull and out of spirits 
4054_11077_000036_000001	train-clean-360	Katy was to make Rose Red a visit 
4054_11077_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 Rose Red 
none	none	a visit 
4054_11077_000037_000000	train-clean-360	Rose had by no means been idle during the three years and a half which had elapsed since they all parted at Hillsover and during which the girls had not seen her 
none	none	In fact she had made more out of the time than any of the rest of them for she had been engaged for eighteen months had been married and was now keeping house near Boston with a little Rose of her own who she wrote to Clover was a perfect angel and more delicious than words could say 
4054_11077_000037_000002	train-clean-360	missus Ashe had taken passage in the Spartacus sailing from Boston and it was arranged that Katy should spend the last two days before sailing with Rose while missus Ashe and Amy visited an old aunt in Hingham 
4054_11077_000037_000003	train-clean-360	To see Rose in her own home and Rose s husband and Rose s baby was only next in interest to seeing Europe 
none	none	None of the changes in her lot seemed to have changed her particularly to judge by the letter she sent in reply to Katy s announcing her plans which letter ran as follows LONGWOOD September twenty
4054_11077_000039_000000	train-clean-360	 My dearest child Your note made me dance with delight 
none	none	I stood on my head waving my heels wildly to the breeze till Deniston thought I must be taken suddenly mad but when I explained he did the same 
4054_11077_000039_000002	train-clean-360	It is too enchanting the whole of it 
4054_11077_000039_000003	train-clean-360	I put it at the head of all the nice things that ever happened except my baby 
4054_11077_000039_000004	train-clean-360	Write the moment you get this by what train you expect to reach Boston and when you roll into the station you will behold two forms one tall and stalwart the other short and fatsome waiting for you 
4054_11077_000039_000005	train-clean-360	They will be those of Deniston and myself 
none	none	Deniston is not beautiful but he is good and he is prepared to adore you 
4054_11077_000039_000007	train-clean-360	The baby is both good and beautiful and you will adore her 
4054_11077_000039_000008	train-clean-360	I am neither but you know all about me and I always did adore you and always shall 
none	none	I am going out this moment to the butcher s to order a calf fatted for your special behoof and he shall be slain and made into cutlets the moment I hear from you 
4054_11077_000039_000010	train-clean-360	My funny little house which is quite a dear little house too assumes a new interest in my eyes from the fact that you so soon are to see it 
none	none	It is somewhat queer as you might know my house would be but I think you will like it
4054_11077_000040_000000	train-clean-360	 I saw Silvery Mary the other day and told her you were coming 
none	none	She is the same mouse as ever I shall ask her and some of the other girls to come out to lunch on one of your days Good by with a hundred and fifty kisses to Clovy and the rest
4054_11077_000041_000000	train-clean-360	 Your loving
none	none	 ROSE RED
4054_11077_000043_000000	train-clean-360	 She never signs herself Browne I observe said Clover as she finished the letter 
4054_11077_000044_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh Rose Red Browne would sound too funny 
none	none	Rose Red she must stay till the end of the chapter no other name could suit her half so well and I can t imagine her being called anything else 
4054_11077_000044_000002	train-clean-360	What fun it will be to see her and little Rose 
4054_11077_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 And Deniston Browne put in Clover 
none	none	Somehow I find it rather hard to take in the fact that there is a Deniston Browne observed Katy It will be easier after you have seen him perhaps 
4054_11077_000048_000000	train-clean-360	The last day came as last days will 
none	none	Katy s trunk most carefully and exactly packed by the united efforts of the family stood in the hall locked and strapped not to be opened again till the party reached London This fact gave it a certain awful interest in the eyes of Phil and Johnnie and even Elsie gazed upon it with respect The little valise was also ready and Dorry the neat handed had painted a red star on both ends of both it and the trunk that they might be easily picked from among a heap of luggage 
4054_11077_000048_000003	train-clean-360	He now proceeded to prepare and paste on two square cards labelled respectively Hold and State room missus Hall had told them that this was the correct thing to do 
none	none	missus Ashe had been full of business likewise in putting her house to rights for a family who had rented it for the time of her absence and Katy and Clover had taken a good many hours from their own preparations to help her All was done at last and one bright morning in October Katy stood on the wharf with her family about her and a lump in her throat which made it difficult to speak to any of them She stood so very still and said so very little that a bystander not acquainted with the circumstances might have dubbed her unfeeling while the fact was that she was feeling too much 
4054_11077_000050_000000	train-clean-360	The first bell rang 
4054_11077_000050_000001	train-clean-360	Katy kissed everybody quietly and went on board with her father 
4054_11077_000050_000002	train-clean-360	Her parting from him hardest of all took place in the midst of a crowd of people then he had to leave her and as the wheels began to revolve she went out on the side deck to have a last glimpse of the home faces 
none	none	There they were Elsie crying tumultuously with her head on papa s coat sleeve John laughing or trying to laugh with big tears running down her cheeks the while and brave little Clover waving her handkerchief encouragingly but with a very sober look on her face Katy s heart went out to the little group with a sudden passion of regret and yearning 
4054_11077_000050_000004	train-clean-360	Why had she said she would go 
4054_11077_000050_000005	train-clean-360	What was all Europe in comparison with what she was leaving 
4054_11077_000050_000006	train-clean-360	Life was so short how could she take a whole year out of it to spend away from the people she loved best 
none	none	If it had been left to her to choose I think she would have flown back to the shore then and there and given up the journey I also think she would have been heartily sorry a little later had she done so 
4054_11077_000051_000000	train-clean-360	But it was not left for her to choose 
none	none	Already the throb of the engines was growing more regular and the distance widening between the great boat and the wharf Gradually the dear faces faded into distance and after watching till the flutter of Clover s handkerchief became an undistinguishable speck Katy went to the cabin with a heavy heart 
4054_11077_000051_000003	train-clean-360	But there were missus Ashe and Amy inclined to be homesick also and in need of cheering and Katy as she tried to brighten them gradually grew bright herself and recovered her hopeful spirits 
4054_11077_000051_000004	train-clean-360	Burnet pulled less strongly as it got farther away and Europe beckoned more brilliantly now that they were fairly embarked on their journey 
none	none	The sun shone the lake was a beautiful dazzling blue and Katy said to herself After all a year is not very long and how happy I am going to be CHAPTER III ROSE AND ROSEBUD Thirty six hours later the Albany train running smoothly across the green levels beyond the Mill Dam brought the travellers to Boston Katy looked eagerly from the window for her first glimpse of the city of which she had heard so much Dear little Boston How nice it is to see it again she heard a lady behind her say but why it should be called little Boston she could not imagine Seen from the train it looked large imposing and very picturesque after flat Burnet with its one bank down to the edge of the lake She studied the towers steeples and red roofs crowding each other up the slopes of the Tri Mountain and the big State House dome crowning all and made up her mind that she liked the looks of it better than any other city she had ever seen The train slackened its speed ran for a few moments between rows of tall shabby brick walls and with a long final screech of its whistle came to halt in the station house Every one made a simultaneous rush for the door and Katy and missus Ashe waiting to collect their books and bags found themselves wedged into their seats and unable to get out It was a confusing moment and not comfortable such moments never are But the discomfort brightened into a sense of relief as looking out of the window Katy caught sight of a face exactly opposite which had evidently caught sight of her a fresh pretty face with light waving hair pink cheeks all a dimple and eyes which shone with laughter and welcome It was Rose herself not a bit changed during the years since they parted A tall young man stood beside her who must of course be her husband Deniston Browne There is Rose Red cried Katy to missus Ashe Oh doesn t she look dear and natural Do wait and let me introduce you I want you to know her But the train had come in a little behind time and missus Ashe was afraid of missing the Hingham boat so she only took a hasty peep from the window at Rose pronounced her to be charming looking kissed Katy hurriedly reminded her that they must be on the steamer punctually at twelve o clock the following Saturday and was gone with Amy beside her so that Katy following last of all the slow moving line of passengers stepped all alone down from the platform into the arms of Rose Red You darling was Rose s first greeting I began to think you meant to spend the night in the car you were so long in getting out Well how perfectly lovely this is Deniston here is Katy Katy this is my husband Rose looked about fifteen as she spoke and so absurdly young to have a husband that Katy could not help laughing as she shook hands with Deniston and his own eyes twinkled with fun and evident recognition of the same joke He was a tall young man with a pleasant steady face and seemed to be infinitely amused in a quiet way with everything which his wife said and did Let us make haste and get out of this hole went on Rose I can scarcely see for the smoke Deniston dear please find the cab and have Katy s luggage put on it I am wild to get her home and exhibit baby before she chews up her new sash or does something else that is dreadful to spoil her looks I left her sitting in state Katy with all her best clothes on waiting to be made known to you My large trunk is to go straight to the steamer explained Katy as she gave her checks to mister Browne I only want the little one taken out to Longwood please Now this is cosey remarked Rose when they were seated in the cab with Katy s bag at their feet Deniston my love I wish you were going out with us There s a nice little bench here all ready and vacant which is just suited to a man of your inches You won t Well come in the early train then Don t forget Now isn t he just as nice as I told you he was she demanded the moment the cab began to move He looks very nice indeed as far as I can judge in three minutes and a quarter My dear it ought not to take anybody of ordinary discernment a minute and a quarter to perceive that he is simply the dearest fellow that ever lived said Rose I discovered it three seconds after I first beheld him and was desperately in love with him before he had fairly finished his first bow after introduction And was he equally prompt asked Katy He says so replied Rose with a pretty blush But then you know he could hardly say less after such a frank confession on my part It is no more than decent of him to make believe even if it is not true Now Katy look at Boston and see if you don t love it The cab had now turned into Boylston Street and on the right hand lay the Common green as summer after the autumn rains with the elm arches leafy still Long slant beams of afternoon sun were filtering through the boughs and falling across the turf and the paths where people were walking and sitting and children and babies playing together It was a delightful scene and Katy received an impression of space and cheer and air and freshness which ever after was associated with her recollection of Boston Rose was quite satisfied with her raptures as they drove through Charles Street between the Common and the Public Garden all ablaze with autumn flowers and down the length of Beacon Street with the blue bay shining between the handsome houses on the water side Every vestibule and bay window was gay with potted plants and flower boxes and a concourse of happy looking people on foot on horseback and in carriages was surging to and fro like an equal prosperous tide while the sunlight glorified all Boston shows a soft Venetian side quoted Katy after a while I know now what mister Lowell meant when he wrote that I don t believe there is a more beautiful place in the world Why of course there isn t retorted Rose who was a most devoted little Bostonian in spite of the fact that she had lived in Washington nearly all her life I ve not seen much beside to be sure but that is no matter I know it is true It is the dream of my life to come into the city to live I don t care what part I live in West End South End North End it s all one to me so long as it is Boston But don t you like Longwood asked Katy looking out admiringly at the pretty places set amid vines and shrubberies which they were now passing It looks so very pretty and pleasant Yes it s well enough for any one who has a taste for natural beauties replied Rose I haven t I never had There is nothing I hate so much as Nature I m a born cockney I d rather live in one room over Jordan and Marsh s and see the world wag past than be the owner of the most romantic villa that ever was built I don t care where it may be situated The cab now turned in at a gate and followed a curving drive bordered with trees to a pretty stone house with a porch embowered with Virginia creepers before which it stopped Here we are cried Rose springing out Now Katy you mustn t even take time to sit down before I show you the dearest baby that ever was sent to this sinful earth Here let me take your bag come straight upstairs and I will exhibit her to you They ran up accordingly and Rose took Katy into a large sunny nursery where tied with pink ribbon into a little basket chair and watched over by a pretty young nurse sat a dear fat fair baby so exactly like Rose in miniature that no one could possibly have mistaken the relationship The baby began to laugh and coo as soon as it caught sight of its gay little mother and exhibited just such another dimple as hers in the middle of a pink cheek Katy was enchanted Oh you darling she said Would she come to me do you think Rose Why of course she shall replied Rose picking up the baby as if she had been a pillow and stuffing her into Katy s arms head first Now just look at her and tell me if ever you saw anything so enchanting in the whole course of your life before Isn t she big Isn t she beautiful Isn t she good Just see her little hands and her hair She never cries except when it is clearly her duty to cry See her turn her head to look at me Oh you angel And seizing the long suffering baby she smothered it with kisses I never never never did see anything so sweet Smell her Katy Doesn t she smell like heaven Little Rose was indeed a delicious baby all dimples and good humor and violet powder with a skin as soft as a lily s leaf and a happy capacity for allowing herself to be petted and cuddled without remonstrance Katy wanted to hold her all the time but this Rose would by no means permit in fact I may as well say at once that the two girls spent a great part of their time during the visit in fighting for the possession of the baby who looked on at the struggle and smiled on the victor whichever it happened to be with all the philosophic composure of Helen of Troy She was so soft and sunny and equable that it was no more trouble to care for and amuse her than if she had been a bird or a kitten and as Rose remarked it was ten times better fun I was never allowed as much doll as I wanted in my infancy she said I suppose I tore them to pieces too soon and they couldn t give me tin ones to play with as they did wash bowls when I broke the china ones Were you such a very bad child asked Katy Oh utterly depraved I believe You wouldn t think so now would you I recollect some dreadful occasions at school Once I had my head pinned up in my apron because I would make faces at the other scholars and they laughed but I promptly bit a bay window through the apron and ran my tongue out of it till they laughed worse than ever The teacher used to send me home with notes fastened to my pinafore with things like this written in them Little Frisk has been more troublesome than usual to day She has pinched all the younger children and bent the bonnets of all the older ones We hope to see an amendment soon or we do not know what we shall do Why did they call you Little Frisk inquired Katy after she had recovered from the laugh which Rose s reminiscences called forth It was a term of endearment I suppose but somehow my family never seemed to enjoy it as they ought I cannot understand she went on reflectively why I had not sense enough to suppress those awful little notes It would have been so easy to lose them on the way home but somehow it never occurred to me Little Rose will be wiser than that won t you my angel She will tear up the horrid notes mammy will show her how All the time that Katy was washing her face and brushing the dust of the railway from her dress Rose sat by with the little Rose in her lap entertaining her thus When she was ready the droll little mamma tucked her baby under her arm and led the way downstairs to a large square parlor with a bay window through which the westering sun was shining It was a pretty room and had a flavor about it just like Rose Katy declared No one else would have hung the pictures or looped back the curtains in exactly that way or have hit upon the happy device of filling the grate with a great bunch of marigolds pale brown golden and orange to simulate the fire which would have been quite too warm on so mild an evening Morris papers and chintzes and artistic shades of color were in their infancy at that date but Rose s taste was in advance of her time and with a foreshadowing of the coming reaction she had chosen a greenery yallery paper for her walls against which hung various articles which looked a great deal queerer then than they would to day There was a mandolin picked up at some Eastern sale a warming pan in shining brass from her mother s attic two old samplers worked in faded silks and a quantity of gayly tinted Japanese fans and embroideries She had also begged from an old aunt at Beverly Farms a couple of droll little armchairs in white painted wood with covers of antique needle work One had Chit embroidered on the middle of its cushion the other Chat These stood suggestively at the corners of the hearth Now Katy said Rose seating herself in Chit pull up Chat and let us begin So they did begin and went on interrupted only by Baby Rose s coos and splutters till the dusk fell till appetizing smells floated through from the rear of the house and the click of a latch key announced mister Browne come home just in time for dinner The two days visit went only too quickly There is nothing more fascinating to a girl than the menage of a young couple of her own age It is a sort of playing at real life without the cares and the sense of responsibility that real life is sure to bring Rose was an adventurous housekeeper She was still new to the position she found it very entertaining and she delighted in experiments of all sorts If they turned out well it was good fun if not that was funnier still Her husband for all his serious manner had a real boy s love of a lark and he aided and abetted her in all sorts of whimsical devices They owned a dog who was only less dear than the baby a cat only less dear than the dog a parrot whose education required constant supervision and a hutch of ring doves whose melancholy little whuddering coos were the delight of Rose the less The house seemed astir with young life all over The only elderly thing in it was the cook who had the reputation of a dreadful temper only unfortunately Rose made her laugh so much that she never found time to be cross Katy felt quite an old experienced person amid all this movement and liveliness and cheer It seemed to her that nobody in the world could possibly be having such a good time as Rose but Rose did not take the same view of the situation It s all very well now she said while the warm weather lasts but in winter Longwood is simply grewsome The wind never stops blowing day nor night It howls and it roars and it screams till I feel as if every nerve in my body were on the point of snapping in two And the snow ugh And the wind ugh And burglars Every night of our lives they come or I think they come and I lie awake and hear them sharpening their tools and forcing the locks and murdering the cook and kidnapping Baby till I long to die and have done with them forever Oh Nature is the most unpleasant thing Burglars are not Nature objected Katy What are they then Art High Art Well whatever they are I do not like them Oh if ever the happy day comes when Deniston consents to move into town I never wish to set my eyes on the country again as long as I live unless well yes I should like to come out just once more in the horse cars and kick that elm tree by the fence The number of times that I have lain awake at night listening to its creaking You might kick it without waiting to have a house in town Oh I shouldn t dare as long as we are living here You never know what Nature may do She has ways of her own of getting even with people remarked her friend solemnly No time must be lost in showing Boston to Katy Rose said So the morning after her arrival she was taken in bright and early to see the sights There were not quite so many sights to be seen then as there are today The Art Museum had not got much above its foundations the new Trinity Church was still in the future but the big organ and the bronze statue of Beethoven were in their glory and every day at high noon a small straggling audience wandered into Music Hall to hear the instrument played To this extempore concert Katy was taken and to Faneuil Hall and the Athenaeum to Doll and Richards s where was an exhibition of pictures to the Granary Graveyard and the Old South Then the girls did a little shopping and by that time they were quite tired enough to make the idea of luncheon agreeable so they took the path across the Common to the Joy Street Mall Katy was charmed by all she had seen The delightful nearness of so many interesting things surprised her She perceived what is one of Boston s chief charms that the Common and its surrounding streets make a natural centre and rallying point for the whole city as the heart is the centre of the body and keeps up a quick correspondence and regulates the life of all its extremities The stately old houses on Beacon Street with their rounded fronts deep window casements and here and there a mauve or a lilac pane set in the sashes took her fancy greatly and so did the State House whose situation made it sufficiently imposing even before the gilding of the dome Up the steep steps of the Joy Street Mall they went to the house on Mt Vernon Street which the Reddings had taken on their return from Washington nearly three years before Rose had previously shown Katy the site of the old family house on Summer Street where she was born now given over wholly to warehouses and shops Their present residence was one of those wide old fashioned brick houses on the crest of the hill whose upper windows command the view across to the Boston Highlands in the rear was a spacious yard almost large enough to be called a garden walled in with ivies and grapevines under which were long beds full of roses and chrysanthemums and marigolds and mignonette Rose carried a latch key in her pocket which she said had been one of her wedding gifts with this she unlocked the front door and let Katy into a roomy white painted hall We will go straight through to the back steps she said Mamma is sure to be sitting there she always sits there till the first frost she says it makes her think of the country How different people are I don t want to think of the country but I m never allowed to forget it for a moment Mamma is so fond of those steps and the garden There to be sure missus Redding was found sitting in a wicker work chair under the shade of the grapevines with a big basket of mending at her side It looked so homely and country like to find a person thus occupied in the middle of a busy city that Katy s heart warmed to her at once missus Redding was a fair little woman scarcely taller than Rose and very much like her She gave Katy a kind welcome You do not seem like a stranger she said Rose has told us so much about you and your sister Sylvia will be very disappointed not to see you She went off to make some visits when we broke up in the country and is not to be home for three weeks yet Katy was disappointed too for she had heard a great deal about Sylvia and had wished very much to meet her She was shown her picture from which she gathered that she did not look in the least like Rose for though equally fair her fairness was of the tall aquiline type quite different from Rose s dimpled prettiness In fact Rose resembled her mother and Sylvia her father they were only alike in little peculiarities of voice and manner of which a portrait did not enable Katy to judge The two girls had a cosey little luncheon with missus Redding after which Rose carried Katy off to see the house and everything in it which was in any way connected with her own personal history the room where she used to sleep the high chair in which she sat as a baby and which was presently to be made over to little Rose the sofa where Deniston offered himself and the exact spot on the carpet on which she had stood while they were being married Last of all Now you shall see the best and dearest thing in the whole house she said opening the door of a room in the second story Grandmamma here is my friend Katy Carr whom you have so often heard me tell about It was a large pleasant room with a little wood fire blazing in a grate by which in an arm chair full of cushions with a Solitaire board on a little table beside her sat a sweet old lady This was Rose s father s mother She was nearly eighty but she was beautiful still and her manner had a gracious old fashioned courtesy which was full of charm She had been thrown from a carriage the year before and had never since been able to come downstairs or to mingle in the family life They come to me instead she told Katy There is no lack of pleasant company she added every one is very good to me I have a reader for two hours a day and I read to myself a little and play Patience and Solitaire and never lack entertainment There was something restful in the sight of such a lovely specimen of old age Katy realized as she looked at her what a loss it had been to her own life that she had never known either of her grandparents She sat and gazed at old missus Redding with a mixture of regret and fascination She longed to hold her hand and kiss her and play with her beautiful silvery hair as Rose did Rose was evidently the old lady s peculiar darling They were on the most intimate terms and Rose dimpled and twinkled and made saucy speeches and told all her little adventures and the baby s achievements and made jests and talked nonsense as freely as to a person of her own age It was a delightful relation Grandmamma has taken a fancy to you I can see she told Katy as they drove back to Longwood She always wants to know my friends and she has her own opinions about them I can tell you Do you really think she liked me said Katy warmly I am so glad if she did for I loved her I never saw a really beautiful old person before Oh there s nobody like her rejoined Rose I can t imagine what it would be not to have her Her merry little face was quite sad and serious as she spoke I wish she were not so old she added with a sigh If we could only put her back twenty years Then perhaps she would live as long as I do But alas there is no putting back the hands on the dial of time no matter how much we may desire it The second day of Katy s visit was devoted to the luncheon party of which Rose had written in her letter and which was meant to be a reunion or side chapter of the S S U C Rose had asked every old Hillsover girl who was within reach There was Mary Silver of course and Esther Dearborn both of whom lived in Boston and by good luck Alice Gibbons happened to be making Esther a visit and Ellen Gray came in from Waltham where her father had recently been settled over a parish so that all together they made six of the original nine of the society and Quaker Row itself never heard a merrier confusion of tongues than resounded through Rose s pretty parlor for the first hour after the arrival of the guests There was everybody to ask after and everything to tell The girls all seemed wonderfully unchanged to Katy but they professed to find her very grown up and dignified I wonder if I am she said Clover never told me so But perhaps she has grown dignified too Nonsense cried Rose Clover could no more be dignified than my baby could Mary Silver give me that child this moment I never saw such a greedy thing as you are you have kept her to yourself at least a quarter of an hour and it isn t fair Oh I beg your pardon said Mary laughing and covering her mouth with her hand exactly in her old shy half frightened way We only need missus Nipson to make our little party complete went on Rose or dear Miss Jane What has become of Miss Jane by the way Do any of you know Oh she is still teaching at Hillsover and waiting for her missionary He has never come back Berry Searles says that when he goes out to walk he always walks away from the United States for fear of diminishing the distance between them What a shame said Katy though she could not help laughing Miss Jane was really quite nice no not nice exactly but she had good things about her Had she remarked Rose satirically I never observed them It required eyes like yours real double million magnifying glasses of h extra power to find them out She was all teeth and talons as far as I was concerned but I think she really did have a softish spot in her old heart for you Katy and it s the only good thing I ever knew about her What has become of Lilly Page asked Ellen She s in Europe with her mother I dare say you ll meet Katy and what a pleasure that will be And have you heard about Bella she s teaching school in the Indian Territory Just fancy that scrap teaching school Isn t it dangerous asked Mary Silver Dangerous How To her scholars do you mean Oh the Indians Well her scalp will be easy to identify if she has adhered to her favorite pomatum that s one comfort put in naughty Rose It was a merry luncheon indeed as little Rose seemed to think for she laughed and cooed incessantly The girls were enchanted with her and voted her by acclamation an honorary member of the S S U C Her health was drunk in Apollinaris water with all the honors and Rose returned thanks in a droll speech The friends told each other their histories for the past three years but it was curious how little on the whole most of them had to tell Though perhaps that was because they did not tell all for Alice Gibbons confided to Katy in a whisper that she strongly suspected Esther of being engaged and at the same moment Ellen Gray was convulsing Rose by the intelligence that a theological student from Andover was very attentive to Mary Silver My dear I don t believe it Rose said not even a theological student would dare and if he did I am quite sure Mary would consider it most improper You must be mistaken Ellen No I m not mistaken for the theological student is my second cousin and his sister told me all about it They are not engaged exactly but she hasn t said no so he hopes she will say yes Oh she ll never say no but then she will never say yes either He would better take silence as consent Well I never did think I should live to see Silvery Mary married I should as soon have expected to find the Thirty nine Articles engaged in a flirtation She s a dear old thing though and as good as gold and I shall consider your second cousin a lucky man if he persuades her I wonder where we shall all be when you come back Katy said Esther Dearborn as they parted at the gate A year is a long time all sorts of things may happen in a year These words rang in Katy s ears as she fell asleep that night All sorts of things may happen in a year she thought and they may not be all happy things either Almost she wished that the journey to Europe had never been thought of But when she waked the next morning to the brightest of October suns shining out of a clear blue sky her misgivings fled There could not have been a more beautiful day for their start She and Rose went early into town for old missus Bedding had made Katy promise to come for a few minutes to say good by They found her sitting by the fire as usual though her windows were open to admit the sun warmed air A little basket of grapes stood on the table beside her with a nosegay of tea roses on top These were from Rose s mother for Katy to take on board the steamer and there was something else a small parcel twisted up in thin white paper It is my good by gift said the dear old lady Don t open it now Keep it till you are well out at sea and get some little thing with it as a keepsake from me Grateful and wondering Katy put the little parcel in her pocket With kisses and good wishes she parted from these new made friends and she and Rose drove to the steamer stopping for mister Browne by the way They were a little late so there was not much time for farewells after they arrived but Rose snatched a moment for a private interview with the stewardess unnoticed by Katy who was busy with missus Ashe and Amy The bell rang and the great steam vessel slowly backed into the stream Then her head was turned to sea and down the bay she went leaving Rose and her husband still waving their handkerchiefs on the pier Katy watched them to the last and when she could no longer distinguish them felt that her final link with home was broken It was not till she had settled her things in the little cabin which was to be her home for the next ten days had put her bonnet and dress for safe keeping in the upper berth nailed up her red and yellow bag and donned the woollen gown ulster and soft felt hat which were to do service during the voyage that she found time to examine the mysterious parcel Behold it was a large beautiful gold piece twenty dollars What a darling old lady said Katy and she gave the gold piece a kiss How did she come to think of such a thing I wonder if there is anything in Europe good enough to buy with it 
4138_11079_000000_000000	train-clean-360	CHAPTER IV 
none	none	ON THE SPARTACUS 
4138_11079_000002_000000	train-clean-360	The ulster and the felt hat soon came off again for a head wind lay waiting in the offing and the Spartacus began to pitch and toss in a manner which made all her unseasoned passengers glad to betake themselves to their berths 
4138_11079_000002_000001	train-clean-360	missus Ashe and Amy were among the earliest victims of sea sickness and Katy after helping them to settle in their staterooms found herself too dizzy and ill to sit up a moment longer and thankfully resorted to her own 
none	none	As the night came on the wind grew stronger and the motion worse 
4138_11079_000003_000001	train-clean-360	The Spartacus had the reputation of being a dreadful roller and seemed bound to justify it on this particular voyage 
4138_11079_000003_000002	train-clean-360	Down down down the great hull would slide till Katy would hold her breath with fear lest it might never right itself again then slowly slowly the turn would be made and up up up it would go till the cant on the other side was equally alarming 
4138_11079_000003_000003	train-clean-360	On the whole Katy preferred to have her own side of the ship the downward one for it was less difficult to keep herself in the berth from which she was in continual danger of being thrown 
4138_11079_000003_000004	train-clean-360	The night seemed endless for she was too frightened to sleep except in broken snatches and when day dawned and she looked through the little round pane of glass in the port hole only gray sky and gray weltering waves and flying spray and rain met her view 
4138_11079_000004_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh dear why do people ever go to sea unless they must she thought feebly to herself 
4138_11079_000004_000001	train-clean-360	She wanted to get up and see how missus Ashe had lived through the night but the attempt to move made her so miserably ill that she was glad to sink again on her pillows 
4138_11079_000005_000000	train-clean-360	The stewardess looked in with offers of tea and toast the very idea of which was simply dreadful and pronounced the other lady orridly ill worse than you are Miss and the little girl takin on dreadful in the h upper berth Of this fact Katy soon had audible proof for as her dizzy senses rallied a little she could hear Amy in the opposite stateroom crying and sobbing pitifully 
4138_11079_000005_000001	train-clean-360	She seemed to be angry as well as sick for she was scolding her poor mother in the most vehement fashion 
4138_11079_000006_000000	train-clean-360	 I hate being at sea Katy heard her say 
4138_11079_000006_000001	train-clean-360	 I won t stay in this nasty old ship 
none	none	Mamma 
4138_11079_000006_000003	train-clean-360	Mamma do you hear me 
4138_11079_000006_000004	train-clean-360	I won t stay in this ship 
4138_11079_000006_000005	train-clean-360	It wasn t a bit kind of you to bring me to such a horrid place 
none	none	It was very unkind it was cru el 
4138_11079_000006_000007	train-clean-360	I want to go back mamma 
4138_11079_000006_000008	train-clean-360	Tell the captain to take me back to the land 
4138_11079_000006_000009	train-clean-360	Mamma why don t you speak to me 
none	none	Oh I am so sick and so very un happy 
4138_11079_000006_000011	train-clean-360	Don t you wish you were dead 
none	none	I do 
4138_11079_000007_000000	train-clean-360	And then came another storm of sobs but never a sound from missus Ashe who Katy suspected was too ill to speak 
4138_11079_000007_000001	train-clean-360	She felt very sorry for poor little Amy raging there in her high berth like some imprisoned creature but she was powerless to help her 
4138_11079_000007_000002	train-clean-360	She could only resign herself to her own discomforts and try to believe that somehow sometime this state of things must mend either they should all get to land or all go to the bottom and be drowned and at that moment she didn t care very much which it turned out to be 
4138_11079_000008_000000	train-clean-360	The gale increased as the day wore on and the vessel pitched dreadfully 
4138_11079_000008_000001	train-clean-360	Twice Katy was thrown out of her berth on the floor then the stewardess came and fixed a sort of movable side to the berth which held her in but made her feel like a child fastened into a railed crib At intervals she could still hear Amy crying and scolding her mother and conjectured that they were having a dreadful time of it in the other stateroom 
4138_11079_000008_000002	train-clean-360	It was all like a bad dream 
4138_11079_000008_000003	train-clean-360	 And they call this travelling for pleasure thought poor Katy 
4138_11079_000009_000000	train-clean-360	One droll thing happened in the course of the second night at least it seemed droll afterward at the time Katy was too uncomfortable to enjoy it 
4138_11079_000009_000001	train-clean-360	Amid the rush of the wind the creaking of the ship s timbers and the shrill buzz of the screw she heard a sound of queer little footsteps in the entry outside of her open door hopping and leaping together in an odd irregular way like a regiment of mice or toy soldiers 
4138_11079_000009_000002	train-clean-360	Nearer and nearer they came and Katy opening her eyes saw a procession of boots and shoes of all sizes and shapes which had evidently been left on the floors or at the doors of various staterooms and which in obedience to the lurchings of the vessel had collected in the cabin 
4138_11079_000009_000003	train-clean-360	They now seemed to be acting in concert with one another and really looked alive as they bumped and trotted side by side and two by two in at the door and up close to her bedside 
4138_11079_000009_000004	train-clean-360	There they remained for several moments executing what looked like a dance then the leading shoe turned on its heel as if giving a signal to the others and they all hopped slowly again into the passage way and disappeared 
4138_11079_000009_000005	train-clean-360	It was exactly like one of Hans Christian Andersen s fairy tales Katy wrote to Clover afterward 
4138_11079_000009_000006	train-clean-360	She heard them going down the cabin but how it ended or whether the owners of the boots and shoes ever got their own particular pairs again she never knew 
4138_11079_000010_000000	train-clean-360	Toward morning the gale abated the sea became smoother and she dropped asleep 
4138_11079_000010_000001	train-clean-360	When she woke the sun was struggling through the clouds and she felt better 
none	none	The stewardess opened the port hole to freshen the air and helped her to wash her face and smooth her tangled hair then she produced a little basin of gruel and a triangular bit of toast and Katy found that her appetite was come again and she could eat
4138_11079_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 And ere s a letter ma am which has come for you by post this morning said the nice old stewardess producing an envelope from her pocket and eying her patient with great satisfaction 
4138_11079_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 By post cried Katy in amazement why how can that be Then catching sight of Rose s handwriting on the envelope she understood and smiled at her own simplicity 
none	none	The stewardess beamed at her as she opened it then saying again Yes m by post m m withdrew and left Katy to enjoy the little surprise 
4138_11079_000015_000000	train-clean-360	The letter was not long but it was very like its writer 
none	none	Rose drew a picture of what Katy would probably be doing at the time it reached her a picture so near the truth that Katy felt as if Rose must have the spirit of prophecy especially as she kindly illustrated the situation with a series of pen and ink drawings in
4138_11079_000066_000000	train-clean-360	 which Katy 
none	none	was depicted as prone in her berth refusing with horror to go to dinner looking longingly backward toward the quarter where the United States was supposed to be and fishing out of her port hole with a crooked pin in hopes of grappling the submarine cable and sending a message to her family to come out at once and take her home It ended with this short poem over which Katy laughed till missus Ashe called feebly across the entry to ask what was the matter
4138_11079_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 Break break 
none	none	break And mis behave O sea And I wish that my tongue could utter The hatred I feel for thee Oh well for the fisherman s child On the sandy beach at his play Oh well for all sensible folk Who are safe at home to day
4138_11079_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 But this horrible ship keeps on And is never a moment still And I yearn for the touch of the nice dry land Where I needn t feel so ill 
none	none	Break break 
4138_11079_000019_000001	train-clean-360	break There is no good left in me For the dinner I ate on the shore so late Has vanished into the sea 
none	none	Laughter is very restorative after the forlornity of sea sickness and Katy was so stimulated by her letter that she managed to struggle into her dressing gown and slippers and across the entry to missus Ashe s stateroom 
4138_11079_000020_000001	train-clean-360	Amy had fallen asleep at last and must not be waked up so their interview was conducted in whispers 
4138_11079_000020_000002	train-clean-360	missus Ashe had by no means got to the tea and toast stage yet and was feeling miserable enough 
none	none	I have had the most dreadful time with Amy she said
4138_11079_000021_000001	train-clean-360	 All day yesterday when she wasn t sick she was raging at me from the upper berth and I too ill to say a word in reply 
none	none	I never knew her so naughty 
4138_11079_000021_000003	train-clean-360	And it seemed very neglectful not to come to see after you poor dear child but really I couldn t raise my head 
4138_11079_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 Neither could I and I felt just as guilty not to be taking care of you said Katy 
4138_11079_000022_000001	train-clean-360	 Well the worst is over with all of us I hope 
4138_11079_000022_000002	train-clean-360	The vessel doesn t pitch half so much now and the stewardess says we shall feel a great deal better as soon as we get on deck 
none	none	She is coming presently to help me up and when Amy wakes won t you let her be dressed and I will take care of her while missus Barrett attends to you I don t think I can be dressed sighed poor missus Ashe I feel as if I should just lie here till we get to Liverpool
4138_11079_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh no h indeed mum no you won t put in missus Barrett who at that moment appeared gruel cup in hand 
none	none	I don t never let my ladies lie in their berths a moment longer than there is need of 
4138_11079_000024_000002	train-clean-360	I h always gets them on deck as soon as possible to get the h air 
none	none	It s the best medicine you can ave ma am the fresh h air h indeed it h is 
4138_11079_000025_000000	train-clean-360	Stewardesses are all powerful on board ship and missus Barrett was so persuasive as well as positive that it was not possible to resist her She got Katy into her dress and wraps and seated her on deck in a chair with a great rug wrapped about her feet with very little effort on Katy s part 
none	none	Then she dived down the companion way again and in the course of an hour appeared escorting a big burly steward who carried poor little pale Amy in his arms as easily as though she had been a kitten 
4138_11079_000025_000002	train-clean-360	Amy gave a scream of joy at the sight of Katy and cuddled down in her lap under the warm rug with a sigh of relief and satisfaction 
4138_11079_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 I thought I was never going to see you again she said with a little squeeze 
4138_11079_000026_000001	train-clean-360	 Oh Miss Katy it has been so horrid 
4138_11079_000026_000002	train-clean-360	I never thought that going to Europe meant such dreadful things as this 
4138_11079_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 This is only the beginning we shall get across the sea in a few days and then we shall find out what going to Europe really means 
4138_11079_000027_000001	train-clean-360	But what made you behave so Amy and cry and scold poor mamma when she was sick I could hear you all the way across the entry 
4138_11079_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 Could you 
4138_11079_000028_000001	train-clean-360	Then why didn t you come to me 
4138_11079_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 I wanted to but I was sick too so sick that I couldn t move 
none	none	But why were you so naughty you didn t tell me
4138_11079_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 I didn t mean to be naughty but I couldn t help crying 
4138_11079_000030_000001	train-clean-360	You would have cried too and so would Johnnie if you had been cooped up in a dreadful old berth at the top of the wall that you couldn t get out of and hadn t had anything to eat and nobody to bring you any water when you wanted some 
4138_11079_000030_000002	train-clean-360	And mamma wouldn t answer when I called to her 
4138_11079_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 She couldn t answer she was too ill explained Katy 
none	none	Well my pet it was pretty hard for you I hope we sha n t have any more such days The sea is a great deal smoother now
4138_11079_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 Mabel looks quite pale she was sick too said Amy regarding the doll in her arms with an anxious air 
4138_11079_000032_000001	train-clean-360	 I hope the fresh h air will do her good 
4138_11079_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 Is she going to have any fresh hair asked Katy wilfully misunderstanding 
4138_11079_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 That was what that woman called it the fat one who made me come up here 
4138_11079_000034_000001	train-clean-360	But I m glad she did for I feel heaps better already only I keep thinking of poor little Maria Matilda shut up in the trunk in that dark place and wondering if she s sick 
none	none	There s nobody to explain to her down there
4138_11079_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 They say that you don t feel the motion half so much in the bottom of the ship said Katy 
4138_11079_000035_000001	train-clean-360	 Perhaps she hasn t noticed it at all 
none	none	Dear me how good something smells 
4138_11079_000035_000003	train-clean-360	I wish they would bring us something to eat 
4138_11079_000036_000000	train-clean-360	A good many passengers had come up by this time and Robert the deck steward was going about tray in hand taking orders for lunch 
4138_11079_000036_000001	train-clean-360	Amy and Katy both felt suddenly ravenous and when missus Ashe awhile later was helped up the stairs she was amazed to find them eating cold beef and roasted potatoes with the finest appetites in the world 
4138_11079_000036_000002	train-clean-360	 They had served out their apprenticeships the kindly old captain told them and were made free of the nautical guild from that time on So it proved for after these two bad days none of the party were sick again during the voyage 
none	none	Amy had a clamorous appetite for stories as well as for cold beef and to appease this craving Katy started a sort of ocean serial called The History of Violet and Emma which she meant to make last till they got to Liverpool but which in reality lasted much longer 
4138_11079_000037_000001	train-clean-360	It might with equal propriety have been called The Adventures of two little Girls who didn t have any Adventures for nothing in particular happened to either Violet or Emma during the whole course of their long drawn out history 
4138_11079_000037_000002	train-clean-360	Amy however found them perfectly enchanting and was never weary of hearing how they went to school and came home again how they got into scrapes and got out of them how they made good resolutions and broke them about their Christmas presents and birthday treats and what they said and how they felt 
none	none	The first instalment of this un exciting romance was given that first afternoon on deck and after that Amy claimed a new chapter daily and it was a chief ingredient of her pleasure during the voyage On the third morning Katy woke and dressed so early that she gained the deck before the sailors had finished their scrubbing and holystoning She took refuge within the companion way and sat down on the top step of the ladder to wait till the deck was dry enough to venture upon it There the Captain found her and drew near for a talk 
4138_11079_000039_000000	train-clean-360	Captain Bryce was exactly the kind of sea captain that is found in story books but not always in real life 
4138_11079_000039_000001	train-clean-360	He was stout and grizzled and brown and kind 
4138_11079_000039_000002	train-clean-360	He had a bluff weather beaten face lit up with a pair of shrewd blue eyes which twinkled when he was pleased and his manner though it was full of the habit of command was quiet and pleasant 
4138_11079_000039_000003	train-clean-360	He was a Martinet on board his ship 
4138_11079_000039_000004	train-clean-360	Not a sailor under him would have dared dispute his orders for a moment but he was very popular with them notwithstanding they liked him as much as they feared him for they knew him to be their best friend if it came to sickness or trouble with any of them 
4138_11079_000040_000000	train-clean-360	Katy and he grew quite intimate during their long morning talk 
4138_11079_000040_000001	train-clean-360	The Captain liked girls 
4138_11079_000040_000002	train-clean-360	He had one of his own about Katy s age and was fond of talking about her 
4138_11079_000040_000003	train-clean-360	Lucy was his mainstay at home he told Katy Her mother had been weakly now this long time back and Bess and Nanny were but children yet so Lucy had to take command and keep things ship shape when he was away 
4138_11079_000041_000000	train-clean-360	 She ll be on the lookout when the steamer comes in said the Captain There s a signal we ve arranged which means All s well and when we get up the river a little way I always look to see if it s flying 
4138_11079_000041_000001	train-clean-360	It s a bit of a towel hung from a particular window and when I see it I say to myself Thank God another voyage safely done and no harm come of it It s a sad kind of work for a man to go off for a twenty four days cruise leaving a sick wife on shore behind him 
none	none	If it wasn t that I have Lucy to look after things I should have thrown up my command long ago Indeed I am glad you have Lucy she must be a great comfort to you said Katy sympathetically for the Captain s hearty voice trembled a little as he spoke She made him tell her the color of Lucy s hair and eyes and exactly how tall she was and what she had studied and what sort of books she liked 
4138_11079_000042_000002	train-clean-360	She seemed such a very nice girl and Katy thought she should like to know her 
4138_11079_000043_000000	train-clean-360	The deck had dried fast in the fresh sea wind and the Captain had just arranged Katy in her chair and was wrapping the rug about her feet in a fatherly way when missus Barrett all smiles appeared from below 
none	none	Oh ere you h are Miss 
4138_11079_000044_000001	train-clean-360	I couldn t think what ad come to you so early and you re looking ever so well again I m pleased to see and ere s a bundle just arrived Miss by the Parcels Delivery 
4138_11079_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 What cried simple Katy 
4138_11079_000045_000001	train-clean-360	Then she laughed at her own foolishness and took the bundle which was directed in Rose s unmistakable hand 
4138_11079_000046_000000	train-clean-360	It contained a pretty little green bound copy of Emerson s Poems with Katy s name and To be read at sea written on the flyleaf 
none	none	Somehow the little gift seemed to bridge the long misty distance which stretched between the vessel s stern and Boston Bay and to bring home and friends a great deal nearer 
4138_11079_000046_000002	train-clean-360	With a half happy half tearful pleasure Katy recognized the fact that distance counts for little if people love one another and that hearts have a telegraph of their own whose messages are as sure and swift as any of those sent over the material lines which link continent to continent and shore with shore 
4138_11079_000047_000000	train-clean-360	Later in the morning Katy going down to her stateroom for something came across a pallid exhausted looking lady who lay stretched on one of the long sofas in the cabin with a baby in her arms and a little girl sitting at her feet quite still with a pair of small hands folded in her lap 
4138_11079_000047_000001	train-clean-360	The little girl did not seem to be more than four years old She had two pig tails of thick flaxen hair hanging over her shoulders and at Katy s approach raised a pair of solemn blue eyes which had so much appeal in them though she said nothing that Katy stopped at once 
4138_11079_000048_000000	train-clean-360	 Can I do anything for you she asked 
4138_11079_000048_000001	train-clean-360	 I am afraid you have been very ill 
4138_11079_000049_000000	train-clean-360	At the sound of her voice the lady on the sofa opened her eyes 
4138_11079_000049_000001	train-clean-360	She tried to speak but to Katy s dismay began to cry instead and when the words came they were strangled with sobs 
none	none	You are so kin d to ask she said
4138_11079_000050_000001	train-clean-360	 If you would give my little girl something to eat 
none	none	She has had nothing since yesterday and I have been so ill and no nobody has c ome near us Oh cried Katy with horror nothing to eat since yesterday 
4138_11079_000051_000001	train-clean-360	How did it happen 
4138_11079_000052_000000	train-clean-360	 Everybody has been sick on our side the ship explained the poor lady and I suppose the stewardess thought as I had a maid with me that I needed her less than the others 
4138_11079_000052_000001	train-clean-360	But my maid has been sick too and oh so selfish 
4138_11079_000052_000002	train-clean-360	She wouldn t even take the baby into the berth with her and I have had all I could do to manage with him when I couldn t lift up my head 
4138_11079_000052_000003	train-clean-360	Little Gretchen has had to go without anything and she has been so good and patient 
4138_11079_000053_000000	train-clean-360	Katy lost no time but ran for missus Barrett whose indignation knew no bounds when she heard how the helpless party had been neglected 
none	none	It s a new person that stewardess h is ma am she explained and most h inefficient I told the Captain when she come aboard that I didn t ave much opinion of her and now he ll see how it h is 
4138_11079_000054_000002	train-clean-360	I m h ashamed that such a thing should appen on the Spartacus ma am I h am h indeed 
none	none	H it never would ave ben so h under h Eliza ma am she s the one that went h off and got herself married the trip before last when this person came to take her place 
4138_11079_000055_000000	train-clean-360	All the time that she talked missus Barrett was busy in making missus Ware for that it seemed was the sick lady s name more comfortable and Katy was feeding Gretchen out of a big bowl full of bread and milk which one of the stewards had brought 
4138_11079_000055_000001	train-clean-360	The little uncomplaining thing was evidently half starved but with the mouthfuls the pink began to steal back into her cheeks and lips and the dark circles lessened under the blue eyes 
none	none	By the time the bottom of the bowl was reached she could smile but still she said not a word except a whispered Danke schon Her mother explained that she had been born in Germany and always till now had been cared for by a German nurse so that she knew that language better than English Illustration Katy was feeding Gretchen out of a big bowl full of bread and milk Gretchen was a great amusement to Katy and Amy during the rest of the voyage 
4138_11079_000057_000001	train-clean-360	They kept her on deck with them a great deal and she was perfectly content with them and very good though always solemn and quiet 
4138_11079_000057_000002	train-clean-360	Pleasant people turned up among the passengers as always happens on an ocean steamship and others not so pleasant perhaps who were rather curious and interesting to watch 
4138_11079_000058_000000	train-clean-360	Katy grew to feel as if she knew a great deal about her fellow travellers as time went on 
4138_11079_000058_000001	train-clean-360	There was the young girl going out to join her parents under the care of a severe governess whom everybody on board rather pitied 
4138_11079_000058_000002	train-clean-360	There was the other girl on her way to study art who was travelling quite alone and seemed to have nobody to meet her or to go to except a fellow student of her own age already in Paris but who seemed quite unconscious of her lonely position and competent to grapple with anything or anybody 
none	none	There was the queer old gentleman who had crossed eleven times before and had advice and experience to spare for any one who would listen to them and the other gentleman not so old but even more queer who had frozen his stomach eight years before by indulging on a hot summer s day in sixteen successive ice creams alternated with ten glasses of equally cold soda water and who related this exciting experience in turn to everybody on board There was the bad little boy whose parents were powerless to oppose him and who carried terror to the hearts of all beholders whenever he appeared and the pretty widow who filled the role of reigning belle and the other widow not quite so pretty or so much a belle who had a good deal to say in a voice made discreetly low about what a pity it was that dear missus So and so should do this or that and Doesn t it strike you as very unfortunate that she should not consider the other thing 
4138_11079_000058_000004	train-clean-360	A great sea going steamer is a little world in itself and gives one a glimpse of all sorts and conditions of people and characters 
4138_11079_000059_000000	train-clean-360	On the whole there was no one on the Spartacus whom Katy liked so well as sedate little Gretchen except the dear old Captain with whom she was a prime favorite 
4138_11079_000059_000001	train-clean-360	He gave missus Ashe and herself the seats next to him at table looked after their comfort in every possible way and each night at dinner sent Katy one of the apple dumplings made specially for him by the cook who had gone many voyages with the Captain and knew his fancies 
4138_11079_000059_000002	train-clean-360	Katy did not care particularly for the dumpling but she valued it as a mark of regard and always ate it when she could 
4138_11079_000060_000000	train-clean-360	Meanwhile every morning brought a fresh surprise from that dear painstaking Rose who had evidently worked hard and thought harder in contriving pleasures for Katy s first voyage at sea 
4138_11079_000060_000001	train-clean-360	missus Barrett was enlisted in the plot there could be no doubt of that and enjoyed the joke as much as any one as she presented herself each day with the invariable formula A letter for you ma am or A bundle Miss come by the Parcels Delivery On the fourth morning it was a photograph of Baby Rose in a little flat morocco case 
4138_11079_000060_000002	train-clean-360	The fifth brought a wonderful epistle full of startling pieces of news none of them true 
4138_11079_000060_000003	train-clean-360	On the sixth appeared a long narrow box containing a fountain pen 
4138_11079_000060_000004	train-clean-360	Then came mister Howells s A Foregone Conclusion which Katy had never seen then a box of quinine pills then a sachet for her trunk then another burlesque poem last of all a cake of delicious violet soap to wash the sea smell from her hands the label said 
4138_11079_000060_000005	train-clean-360	It grew to be one of the little excitements of ship life to watch for the arrival of these daily gifts and What did the mail bring for you this time Miss Carr was a question frequently asked 
none	none	Each arrival Katy thought must be the final one but Rose s forethought had gone so far even as to provide an extra parcel in case the voyage was a day longer than usual and Miss Carr s mail continued to come in till the very last morning 
4138_11079_000061_000000	train-clean-360	Katy never forgot the thrill that went through her when after so many days of sea her eyes first caught sight of the dim line of the Irish coast 
none	none	An exciting and interesting day followed as after stopping at Queenstown to leave the mails they sped northeastward between shores which grew more distinct and beautiful with every hour on one side Ireland on the other the bold mountain lines of the Welsh coast 
4138_11079_000061_000002	train-clean-360	It was late afternoon when they entered the Mersey and dusk had fallen before the Captain got out his glass to look for the white fluttering speck in his own window which meant so much to him 
4138_11079_000061_000003	train-clean-360	Long he studied before he made quite sure that it was there 
4138_11079_000061_000004	train-clean-360	At last he shut the glass with a satisfied air 
4138_11079_000062_000000	train-clean-360	 It s all right he said to Katy who stood near almost as much interested as he 
4138_11079_000062_000001	train-clean-360	 Lucy never forgets bless her 
none	none	Well there s another voyage over and done with thank God and my Mary is where she was 
4138_11079_000062_000003	train-clean-360	It s a load taken from my mind 
4138_11079_000063_000000	train-clean-360	The moon had risen and was shining softly on the river as the crowded tender landed the passengers from the Spartacus at the Liverpool docks 
4138_11079_000064_000000	train-clean-360	 We shall meet again in London or in Paris said one to another and cards and addresses were exchanged 
none	none	Then after a brief delay at the Custom House they separated each to his own particular destination and as a general thing none of them ever saw any of the others again It is often thus with those who have been fellow voyagers at sea and it is always a surprise and perplexity to inexperienced travellers that it can be so and that those who have been so much to each other for ten days can melt away into space and disappear as though the brief intimacy had never existed
4138_11079_000065_000000	train-clean-360	 Four wheeler or hansom ma am said a porter to missus Ashe 
none	none	Which Katy
4138_11079_000067_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh let us have a hansom 
4138_11079_000067_000001	train-clean-360	I never saw one and they look so nice in Punch 
4138_11079_000068_000000	train-clean-360	So a hansom cab was called the two ladies got in Amy cuddled down between them the folding doors were shut over their knees like a lap robe and away they drove up the solidly paved streets to the hotel where they were to pass the night 
none	none	It was too late to see or do anything but enjoy the sense of being on firm land once more
4138_11079_000069_000000	train-clean-360	 How lovely it will be to sleep in a bed that doesn t tip or roll from side to side said missus Ashe 
4138_11079_000070_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes and that is wide enough and long enough and soft enough to be comfortable replied Katy 
4138_11079_000070_000001	train-clean-360	 I feel as if I could sleep for a fortnight to make up for the bad nights at sea 
none	none	Everything seemed delightful to her the space for undressing the great tub of fresh water which stood beside the English looking washstand with its ample basin and ewer the chintz curtained bed the coolness the silence and she closed her eyes with the pleasant thought in her mind It is really England and we are really here CHAPTER V STORYBOOK ENGLAND Oh is it raining was Katy s first question next morning when the maid came to call her The pretty room with its gayly flowered chintz and china and its brass bedstead did not look half so bright as when lit with gas the night before and a dim gray light struggled in at the window which in America would certainly have meant bad weather coming or already come Oh no h indeed ma am it s a very fine day not bright ma am but very dry was the answer Katy couldn t imagine what the maid meant when she peeped between the curtains and saw a thick dull mist lying over everything and the pavements opposite her window shining with wet Afterwards when she understood better the peculiarities of the English climate she too learned to call days not absolutely rainy fine and to be grateful for them but on that first morning her sensations were of bewildered surprise almost vexation missus Ashe and Amy were waiting in the coffee room when she went in search of them What shall we have for breakfast asked missus Ashe our first meal in England Katy you order it Let s have all the things we have read about in books and don t have at home said Katy eagerly But when she came to look over the bill of fare there didn t seem to be many such things Soles and muffins she finally decided upon and as an after thought gooseberry jam Muffins sound so very good in Dickens you know she explained to missus Ashe and I never saw a sole The soles when they came proved to be nice little pan fish not unlike what in New England are called scup All the party took kindly to them but the muffins were a great disappointment tough and tasteless with a flavor about them as of scorched flannel How queer and disagreeable they are said Katy I feel as if I were eating rounds cut from an old ironing blanket and buttered Dear me what did Dickens mean by making such a fuss about them I wonder And I don t care for gooseberry jam either it isn t half as good as the jams we have at home Books are very deceptive I am afraid they are We must make up our minds to find a great many things not quite so nice as they sound when we read about them replied missus Ashe Mabel was breakfasting with them of course and was heard to remark at this juncture that she didn t like muffins either and would a great deal rather have waffles whereupon Amy reproved her and explained that nobody in England knew what waffles were they were such a stupid nation and that Mabel must learn to eat whatever was given her and not find fault with it After this moral lesson it was found to be dangerously near train time and they all hurried to the railroad station which fortunately was close by There was rather a scramble and confusion for a few moments for Katy who had undertaken to buy the tickets was puzzled by the unaccustomed coinage and missus Ashe whose part was to see after the luggage found herself perplexed and worried by the absence of checks and by no means disposed to accept the porter s statement that if she d only bear in mind that the trunks were in the second van from the engine and get out to see that they were safe once or twice during the journey and call for them as soon as they reached London she d have no trouble please remember the porter ma am However all was happily settled at last and without any serious inconveniences they found themselves established in a first class carriage and presently after running smoothly at full speed across the rich English midlands toward London and the eastern coast The extreme greenness of the October landscape was what struck them first and the wonderfully orderly and trim aspect of the country with no ragged stump dotted fields or reaches of wild untended woods Late in October as it was the hedgerows and meadows were still almost summer like in color though the trees were leafless The delightful looking old manor houses and farm houses of which they had glimpses now and again were a constant pleasure to Katy with their mullioned windows twisted chimney stacks porches of quaint build and thick growing ivy She contrasted them with the uncompromising ugliness of farm houses which she remembered at home and wondered whether it could be that at the end of another thousand years or so America would have picturesque buildings like these to show in addition to her picturesque scenery Suddenly into the midst of these reflections there glanced a picture so vivid that it almost took away her breath as the train steamed past a pack of hounds in full cry followed by a galloping throng of scarlet coated huntsmen One horse and rider were in the air going over a wall Another was just rising to the leap A string of others headed by a lady were tearing across a meadow bounded by a little brook and beyond that streamed the hounds following the invisible fox It was like one of Muybridge s instantaneous photographs of The Horse in Motion for the moment that it lasted and Katy put it away in her memory distinct and brilliant as she might a real picture Their destination in London was Batt s Hotel in Dover Street The old gentleman on the Spartacus who had crossed so many times had furnished missus Ashe with a number of addresses of hotels and lodging houses from among which Katy had chosen Batt s for the reason that it was mentioned in Miss Edgeworth s Patronage It was the place she explained where Godfrey Percy didn t stay when Lord Oldborough sent him the letter It seemed an odd enough reason for going anywhere that a person in a novel didn t stay there But missus Ashe knew nothing of London and had no preference of her own so she was perfectly willing to give Katy hers and Batt s was decided upon It is just like a dream or a story said Katy as they drove away from the London station in a four wheeler It is really ourselves and this is really London Can you imagine it She looked out Nothing met her eyes but dingy weather muddy streets long rows of ordinary brick or stone houses It might very well have been New York or Boston on a foggy day yet to her eyes all things had a subtle difference which made them unlike similar objects at home Wimpole Street she cried suddenly as she caught sight of the name on the corner that is the street where Maria Crawford in Mansfield Park you know opened one of the best houses after she married mister Rushworth Think of seeing Wimpole Street What fun She looked eagerly out after the best houses but the whole street looked uninteresting and old fashioned the best house to be seen was not of a kind Katy thought to reconcile an ambitious young woman to a dull husband Katy had to remind herself that Miss Austen wrote her novels nearly a century ago that London was a growing place and that things were probably much changed since that day More fun awaited them when they arrived at Batt s and exactly such a landlady sailed forth to welcome them as they had often met with in books an old landlady smiling and rubicund with a towering lace cap on her head a flowered silk gown a gold chain and a pair of fat mittened hands demurely crossed over a black brocade apron She alone would have been worth crossing the ocean to see they all declared Their telegram had been received and rooms were ready with a bright smoky fire of soft coals the dinner table was set and a nice formal white cravated old waiter who seemed to have stepped out of the same book with the landlady was waiting to serve it Everything was dingy and old fashioned but very clean and comfortable and Katy concluded that on the whole Godfrey Percy would have done wisely to go to Batt s and could have fared no better at the other hotel where he did stay The first of Katy s London sights came to her next morning before she was out of her bedroom She heard a bell ring and a queer squeaking little voice utter a speech of which she could not make out a single word Then came a laugh and a shout as if several boys were amused at something or other and altogether her curiosity was roused so that she finished dressing as fast as she could and ran to the drawing room window which commanded a view of the street Quite a little crowd was collected under the window and in their midst was a queer box raised high on poles with little red curtains tied back on either side to form a miniature stage on which puppets were moving and vociferating Katy knew in a moment that she was seeing her first Punch and Judy The box and the crowd began to move away Katy in despair ran to Wilkins the old waiter who was setting the breakfast table Oh please stop that man she said I want to see him What man is it Miss said Wilkins When he reached the window and realized what Katy meant his sense of propriety seemed to receive a severe shock He even ventured on remonstrance H I wouldn t Miss h if h I was you Them Punches are a low lot Miss they h ought to be put down really they h ought Gentlefolks h as a general thing pays no h attention to them But Katy didn t care what gentlefolks did or did not do and insisted upon having Punch called back So Wilkins was forced to swallow his remonstrances and his dignity and go in pursuit of the objectionable object Amy came rushing out with her hair flying and Mabel in her arms and she and Katy had a real treat of Punch and Judy with all the well known scenes and perhaps a few new ones thrown in for their especial behoof for the showman seemed to be inspired by the rapturous enjoyment of his little audience of three at the first floor windows Punch beat Judy and stole the baby and Judy banged Punch in return and the constable came in and Punch outwitted him and the hangman and the devil made their appearance duly and it was all perfectly satisfactory and just exactly what she hoped it would be and it quite made up for the muffins Katy declared Then when Punch had gone away the question arose as to what they should choose out of the many delightful things in London for their first morning Like ninety nine Americans out of a hundred they decided on Westminster Abbey and indeed there is nothing in England better worth seeing or more impressive in its dim rich antiquity to eyes fresh from the world which still calls itself new So to the Abbey they went and lingered there till missus Ashe declared herself to be absolutely dropping with fatigue If you don t take me home and give me something to eat she said I shall drop down on one of these pedestals and stay there and be exhibited forever after as an h effigy of somebody belonging to ancient English history So Katy tore herself away from Henry the Seventh and the Poets Corner and tore Amy away from a quaint little tomb shaped like a cradle with the marble image of a baby in it which had greatly taken her fancy She could only be consoled by the promise that she should soon come again and stay as long as she liked She reminded Katy of this promise the very next morning Mamma has waked up with rather a bad headache and she thinks she will lie still and not come to breakfast she reported And she sends her love and says will you please have a cab and go where you like and if I won t be a trouble she would be glad if you would take me with you And I won t be a trouble Miss Katy and I know where I wish you would go Where is that To see that cunning little baby again that we saw yesterday I want to show her to Mabel she didn t go with us you know and I don t like to have her mind not improved and darling Miss Katy mayn t I buy some flowers and put them on the Baby She s so dusty and so old that I don t believe anybody has put any flowers for her for ever so long Katy found this idea rather pretty and willingly stopped at Covent Garden where they bought a bunch of late roses for eighteen pence which entirely satisfied Amy With them in her hand and Mabel in her arms she led the way through the dim aisles of the Abbey through grates and doors and up and down steps the guide following but not at all needed for Amy seemed to have a perfectly clear recollection of every turn and winding When the chapel was reached she laid the roses on the tomb with gentle fingers and a pitiful reverent look in her gray eyes Then she lifted Mabel up to kiss the odd little baby effigy above the marble quilt whereupon the guide seemed altogether surprised out of his composure and remarked to Katy Little Miss is an h American as is plain to see no h English child would be likely to think of doing such a thing Do not English children take any interest in the tombs of the Abbey asked Katy Oh yes m m h interest but they don t take no special notice of one tomb above h another Katy could scarcely keep from laughing especially as she heard Amy who had been listening to the conversation give an audible sniff and inform Mabel that she was glad she was not an English child who didn t notice things and liked grown up graves as much as she did dear little cunning ones like this Later in the day when missus Ashe was better they all drove together to the quaint old keep which has been the scene of so many tragedies and is known as the Tower of London Here they were shown various rooms and chapels and prisons and among the rest the apartments where Queen Elizabeth when a friendless young Princess was shut up for many months by her sister Queen Mary Katy had read somewhere and now told Amy the pretty legend of the four little children who lived with their parents in the Tower and used to play with the royal captive and how one little boy brought her a key which he had picked up on the ground and said Now you can go out when you will lady and how the Lords of the Council getting wind of it sent for the children to question them and frightened them and their friends almost to death and forbade them to go near the Princess again A story about children always brings the past much nearer to a child and Amy s imagination was so excited by this tale that when they got to the darksome closet which is said to have been the prison of Sir Walter Raleigh she marched out of it with a pale and wrathful face If this is English history I never mean to learn any more of it and neither shall Mabel she declared But it is not possible for Amy or any one else not to learn a great deal of history simply by going about London So many places are associated with people or events and seeing the places makes one care so much more for the people or the events that one insensibly questions and wonders Katy who had browsed all through her childhood in a good old fashioned library had her memory stuffed with all manner of little scraps of information and literary allusions which now came into use It was like owning the disjointed bits of a puzzle and suddenly discovering that properly put together they make a pattern missus Ashe who had never been much of a reader considered her young friend a prodigy of intelligence but Katy herself realized how inadequate and inexact her knowledge was and how many bits were missing from the pattern of her puzzle She wished with all her heart as every one wishes under such circumstances that she had studied harder and more wisely while the chance was in her power On a journey you cannot read to advantage Remember that dear girls who are looking forward to travelling some day and be industrious in time October is not a favorable month in which to see England Water water is everywhere you breathe it you absorb it it wets your clothes and it dampens your spirits missus Ashe s friends advised her not to think of Scotland at that time of the year One by one their little intended excursions were given up A single day and night in Oxford and Stratford on Avon a short visit to the Isle of Wight where in a country place which seemed provokingly pretty as far as they could see it for the rain lived that friend of missus Ashe who had married an Englishman and in so doing had as Katy privately thought renounced the sun a peep at Stonehenge from under the shelter of an umbrella and an hour or two in Salisbury Cathedral was all that they accomplished except a brief halt at Winchester that Katy might have the privilege of seeing the grave of her beloved Miss Austen Katy had come abroad with a terribly long list of graves to visit missus Ashe declared They laid a few rain washed flowers upon the tomb and listened with edification to the verger who inquired Whatever was it ma am that lady did which brings so many h Americans to h ask about her Our h English people don t seem to take the same h interest She wrote such delightful stories explained Katy but the old verger shook his head I think h it must be some other party Miss you ve confused with this here It stands to reason Miss that we d have heard of em h over ere in England sooner than you would h over there in h America if the books ad been h anything so h extraordinary The night after their return to London they were dining for the second time with the cousins of whom missus Ashe had spoken to doctor Carr and as it happened Katy sat next to a quaint elderly American who had lived for twenty years in London and knew it much better than most Londoners do This gentleman mister Allen Beach had a hobby for antiquities old books especially and passed half his time at the British Museum and the other half in sales rooms and the old shops in Wardour Street Katy was lamenting over the bad weather which stood in the way of their plans It is so vexatious she said missus Ashe meant to go to York and Lincoln and all the cathedral towns and to Scotland and we have had to give it all up because of the rains We shall go away having seen hardly anything You can see London We have that is we have seen the things that everybody sees But there are so many things that people in general do not see How much longer are you to stay Miss Carr A week I believe Why don t you make out a list of old buildings which are connected with famous people in history and visit them in turn I did that the second year after I came I gave up three months to it and it was most interesting I unearthed all manner of curious stories and traditions Or cried Katy struck with a sudden bright thought why mightn t I put into the list some of the places I know about in books novels as well as history and the places where the people who wrote the books lived You might do that and it wouldn t be a bad idea either said mister Beach pleased with her enthusiasm I will get a pencil after dinner and help you with your list if you will allow me mister Beach was better than his word He not only suggested places and traced a plan of sight seeing but on two different mornings he went with them himself and his intelligent knowledge of London added very much to the interest of the excursions Under his guidance the little party of four for Mabel was never left out it was such a chance for her to improve her mind Amy declared visited the Charter House where Thackeray went to school and the Home of the Poor Brothers connected with it in which Colonel Newcome answered Adsum to the roll call of the angels They took a look at the small house in Curzon Street which is supposed to have been in Thackeray s mind when he described the residence of Becky Sharpe and the other house in Russell Square which is unmistakably that where George Osborne courted Amelia Sedley They went to service in the delightful old church of saint Mary in the Temple and thought of Ivanhoe and Brian de Bois Guilbert and Rebecca the Jewess From there mister Beach took them to Lamb s Court where Pendennis and George Warrington dwelt in chambers together and to Brick Court where Oliver Goldsmith passed so much of his life and the little rooms in which Charles and Mary Lamb spent so many sadly happy years On another day they drove to Whitefriars for the sake of Lord Glenvarloch and the old privilege of Sanctuary in the Fortunes of Nigel and took a peep at Bethnal Green where the Blind Beggar and his Pretty Bessee lived and at the old Prison of the Marshalsea made interesting by its associations with Little Dorrit They also went to see Milton s house and saint Giles Church in which he is buried and stood a long time before saint James Palace trying to make out which could have been Miss Burney s windows when she was dresser to Queen Charlotte of bitter memory And they saw Paternoster Row and No five Cheyne Walk sacred forevermore to the memory of Thomas Carlyle and Whitehall where Queen Elizabeth lay in state and King Charles was beheaded and the state rooms of Holland House and by great good luck had a glimpse of George Eliot getting out of a cab She stood for a moment while she gave her fare to the cabman and Katy looked as one who might not look again and carried away a distinct picture of the unbeautiful interesting remarkable face With all this to see and to do the last week sped all too swiftly and the last day came before they were at all ready to leave what Katy called Story book England missus Ashe had decided to cross by Newhaven and Dieppe because some one had told her of the beautiful old town of Rouen and it seemed easy and convenient to take it on the way to Paris Just landed from the long voyage across the Atlantic the little passage of the Channel seemed nothing to our travellers and they made ready for their night on the Dieppe steamer with the philosophy which is born of ignorance They were speedily undeceived The English Channel has a character of its own which distinguishes it from other seas and straits It seems made fractious and difficult by Nature and set as on purpose to be barrier between two nations who are too unlike to easily understand each other and are the safer neighbors for this wholesome difficulty of communication between them The chop was worse than usual on the night when our travellers crossed the steamer had to fight her way inch by inch And oh such a little steamer and oh such a long night CHAPTER VI ACROSS THE CHANNEL Dawn had given place to day and day was well advanced toward noon before the stout little steamer gained her port It was hours after the usual time for arrival 
2588-11081-0001	train-other-500	the train for Paris must long since have started and Katy felt dejected and forlorn as making her way out of the terrible ladies cabin she crept on deck for her first glimpse of France
2588-11081-0002	train-other-500	The sun was struggling through the fog with a watery smile and his faint beams shone on a confusion of stone piers higher than the vessel s deck intersected with canal like waterways
2588-11081-0003	train-other-500	through whose intricate windings the steamer was slowly threading her course to the landing place Looking up Katy could see crowds of people assembled to watch the boat come in workmen peasants women children soldiers
none	none	 custom house officers 
2588-11081-0004	train-other-500	moving to and fro and all this crowd were talking all at once and all were talking French
none	none	 I don t know why this should have startled her as it did 
2588-11081-0005	train-other-500	She knew of course that people of different countries were liable to be found speaking their own languages but somehow the spectacle of the chattering multitude
none	none	 all seeming so perfectly at ease with their preterits and subjunctives and never once having to refer to Ollendorf or a dictionary 
2588-11081-0006	train-other-500	filled her with a sense of dismayed surprise Good gracious she said to herself even the babies understand it She racked her brains to recall what she had once known of French
none	none	 but very little seemed to have survived the horrors of the night Oh dear 
2588-11081-0007	train-other-500	what is the word for trunk key she asked herself They will all begin to ask questions
none	none	 and I shall not have a word to say 
2588-11081-0008	train-other-500	and missus Ashe will be even worse off I know
none	none	 She saw the red trousered custom house officers pounce upon the passengers as they landed one by one 
2588-11081-0009	train-other-500	and she felt her heart sink within her But after all when the time came it did not prove so very bad Katy s pleasant looks and courteous manner stood her in good stead
2588-11081-0010	train-other-500	She did not trust herself to say much
none	none	 but the officials seemed to understand without saying They bowed and gestured whisked the keys in and out 
2588-11081-0011	train-other-500	and in a surprisingly short time all was pronounced right the baggage had passed
none	none	 and it and its owners were free to proceed to the railway station 
2588-11081-0012	train-other-500	which fortunately was close at hand Inquiry revealed the fact that no train for Paris left till four in the afternoon I am rather glad declared poor missus Ashe for I feel too used up to move
2588-11081-0013	train-other-500	I will lie here on this sofa and Katy dear
none	none	 please see if there is an eating place and get some breakfast for yourself and Amy 
2588-11081-0014	train-other-500	and send me a cup of tea I don t like to leave you alone Katy was beginning but at that moment a nice old woman who seemed to be in charge of the waiting room appeared and with a flood of French which none of them could follow
2588-11081-0015	train-other-500	but which was evidently sympathetic in its nature flew at missus Ashe and began to make her comfortable From a cupboard in the wall she produced a pillow
none	none	 from another cupboard a blanket in a trice she had one under missus Ashe s head and the other wrapped round her feet Pauvre madame she said si pale si souffrante Il faut avoir quelque chose a boire et a manger tout de suite She trotted across the room and into the restaurant which opened out of it while missus Ashe smiled at Katy and said You see you can leave me quite safely 
2588-11081-0016	train-other-500	I am to be taken care of And Katy and Amy passed through the same door into the buffet and sat down at a little table It was a particularly pleasant looking place to breakfast in
2588-11081-0017	train-other-500	There were many windows with bright polished panes and very clean short muslin curtains and on the window sills stood rows of thrifty potted plants in full bloom marigolds balsams nasturtiums
2588-11081-0018	train-other-500	and many colored geraniums Two birds in cages were singing loudly the floor was waxed to a glass like polish
none	none	 nothing could have been whiter than the marble of the tables except the napkins laid over them 
2588-11081-0019	train-other-500	And such a good breakfast as was presently brought to them delicious coffee in bowl like cups crisp rolls and rusks
none	none	 an omelette with a delicate flavor of fine herbs 
2588-11081-0020	train-other-500	stewed chicken little pats of freshly churned butter without salt shaped like shells and tasting like solidified cream and a pot of some sort of nice preserve Amy made great delighted eyes at Katy and remarking
none	none	 I think France is heaps nicer than that old England 
2588-11081-0021	train-other-500	began to eat with a will and Katy herself felt that if this railroad meal was a specimen of what they had to expect in the future they had indeed come to a land of plenty Fortified with the satisfactory breakfast
2588-11081-0022	train-other-500	she felt equal to a walk and after they had made sure that missus Ashe had all she needed she and Amy and Mabel set off by themselves
none	none	 to see the sights of Dieppe I don t know that travellers generally have considered Dieppe an interesting place but Katy found it so There was a really old church and some quaint buildings of the style of two centuries back 
2588-11081-0023	train-other-500	and even the more modern streets had a novel look to her unaccustomed eyes At first they only ventured a timid turn or two marking each corner and going back now and then to reassure themselves by a look at the station but after a while
2588-11081-0024	train-other-500	growing bolder Katy ventured to ask a question or two in French and was surprised and charmed to find herself understood After that she grew adventurous and no longer fearful of being lost
2588-11081-0025	train-other-500	led Amy straight down a long street lined with shops almost all of which were for the sale of articles in ivory
none	none	 Ivory wares are one of the chief industries of Dieppe 
2588-11081-0026	train-other-500	There were cases full windows full counters full of the most exquisite combs and brushes some with elaborate monograms in silver and colors others plain there were boxes and caskets of every size and shape
2588-11081-0027	train-other-500	ornaments fans parasol handles looking glasses frames for pictures large and small napkin rings Katy was particularly smitten with a paper knife in the form of an angel
2588-11081-0028	train-other-500	with long slender wings raised over its head and meeting to form a point Its price was twenty francs and she was strongly tempted to buy it for Clover or Rose Red
none	none	 But she said to herself sensibly 
2588-11081-0029	train-other-500	This is the first shop I have been into and the first thing I have really wanted to buy and very likely as we go on I shall see things I like better and want more so it would be foolish to do it No I won t
2588-11081-0030	train-other-500	And she resolutely turned her back on the ivory angel and walked away
2588-11081-0031	train-other-500	The next turn brought them to a gay looking little market place where old women in white caps were sitting on the ground beside baskets and panniers full of apples pears and various queer and curly vegetables none of which Katy recognized as familiar
2588-11081-0032	train-other-500	fish of all shapes and colors were flapping in shallow tubs of sea water there were piles of stockings muffetees and comforters in vivid blue and red worsted and coarse pottery glazed in bright patterns
2588-11081-0033	train-other-500	The faces of the women were brown and wrinkled there were no pretty ones among them but their black eyes were full of life and quickness and their fingers one and all clicked with knitting needles as their tongues flew equally fast in the chatter and the chaffer
2588-11081-0034	train-other-500	which went on without stop or stay though customers did not seem to be many and sales were few Returning to the station they found that missus Ashe had been asleep during their absence
none	none	 and seemed so much better that it was with greatly amended spirits that they took their places in the late afternoon train which was to set them down at Rouen Katy said they were like the Wise Men of the East 
2588-11081-0035	train-other-500	following a star in their choice of a hotel for having no better advice they had decided upon one of those thus distinguished in Baedeker s Guide book The star did not betray their confidence for the
none	none	 Hotel de la Cloche 
2588-11081-0036	train-other-500	to which it led them proved to be quaint and old and very pleasant of aspect The lofty chambers with their dimly frescoed ceilings and beds curtained with faded patch
2588-11081-0037	train-other-500	might to all appearances have been furnished about the time when Columbus crossed the ocean blue but everything was clean and had an air of old time respectability The dining room which was evidently of more modern build
none	none	 opened into a square courtyard where oleanders and lemon trees in boxes stood round the basin of a little fountain 
2588-11081-0038	train-other-500	whose tinkle and plash blended agreeably with the rattle of the knives and forks In one corner of the room was a raised and railed platform where behind a desk sat the mistress of the house busy with her account books
2588-11081-0039	train-other-500	but keeping an eye the while on all that went forward missus Ashe walked past this personage without taking any notice of her as Americans are wont to do under such circumstances but presently the observant Katy noticed that every one else
2588-11081-0040	train-other-500	as they went in or out of the room addressed a bow or a civil remark to this lady
none	none	 She quite blushed at the recollection afterward as she made ready for bed 
2588-11081-0041	train-other-500	How rude we must have seemed she thought I am afraid the people here think that Americans have awful manners everybody is so polite
none	none	 They said Bon soir and Merci and Voulez vous avoir la bonte 
2588-11081-0042	train-other-500	to the waiters even Well there is one thing I am going to reform
none	none	 To morrow I will be as polite as anybody 
2588-11081-0043	train-other-500	They will think that I am miraculously improved by one night on French soil but never mind
none	none	 I am going to do it 
2588-11081-0044	train-other-500	She kept her resolution and astonished missus Ashe next morning by bowing to the dame on the platform in the most winning manner
none	none	 and saying Bon jour madame 
2588-11081-0045	train-other-500	as they went by But Katy who is that person Why do you speak to her Don t you see that they all do She is the landlady I think at all events everybody bows to her
2588-11081-0046	train-other-500	And just notice how prettily these ladies at the next table speak to the waiter
none	none	 They do not order him to do things as we do at home 
2588-11081-0047	train-other-500	I noticed it last night and I liked it so much that I made a resolution to get up and be as polite as the French themselves this morning
none	none	 So all the time that they went about the sumptuous old city rich in carvings and sculptures and traditions while they were looking at the Cathedral and the wonderful church of saint Ouen and the Palace of Justice and the Place of the Maid where poor Jeanne d Arc was burned and her ashes scattered to the winds Katy remembered her manners and smiled and bowed and used courteous prefixes in a soft pleasant voice and as missus Ashe and Amy fell in with her example more or less I think the guides and coachmen and the old women who showed them over the buildings felt that the air of France was very civilizing indeed and that these strangers from savage countries over the sea were in a fair way to be as well bred as if they had been born in a more favored part of the world Paris looked very modern after the peculiar quaint richness and air of the Middle Ages which distinguish Rouen Rooms had been engaged for missus Ashe s party in a pension near the Arc d Etoile and there they drove immediately on arriving The rooms were not in the pension itself but in a house close by a sitting room with six mirrors three clocks and a pinched little grate about a foot wide a dining room just large enough for a table and four chairs and two bedrooms A maid called Amandine had been detailed to take charge of these rooms and serve their meals Dampness as Katy afterward wrote to Clover was the first impression they received of gay Paris The tiny fire in the tiny grate had only just been lighted and the walls and the sheets and even the blankets felt chilly and moist to the touch They spent their first evening in hanging the bedclothes round the grate and piling on fuel they even set the mattresses up on edge to warm and dry It was not very enlivening it must be confessed Amy had taken a cold missus Ashe looked worried and Katy thought of Burnet and the safety and comfort of home with a throb of longing The days that ensued were not brilliant enough to remove this impression The November fogs seemed to have followed them across the Channel and Paris remained enveloped in a wet blanket which dimmed and hid its usually brilliant features Going about in cabs with the windows drawn up and now and then making a rush through the drip into shops was not exactly delightful but it seemed pretty much all that they could do It was worse for Amy whose cold kept her indoors and denied her even the relaxation of the cab missus Ashe had engaged a well recommended elderly English maid to come every morning and take care of Amy while they were out and with this respectable functionary whose ideas were of a rigidly British type and who did not speak a word of any language but her own poor Amy was compelled to spend most of her time Her only consolation was in persuading this serene attendant to take a part in the French lessons which she made a daily point of giving to Mabel out of her own little phrase book Wilkins is getting on I think she told Katy one night She says Biscuit glace quite nicely now But I never will let her look at the book though she always wants to for if once she saw how the words are spelled she would never in the world pronounce them right again They look so very different you know Katy looked at Amy s pale little face and eager eyes with a real heartache Her rapture when at the end of the long dull afternoons her mother returned to her was touching Paris was very triste to poor Amy with all her happy facility for amusing herself and Katy felt that the sooner they got away from it the better it would be So in spite of the delight which her brief glimpses at the Louvre gave her and the fun it was to go about with missus Ashe and see her buy pretty things and the real satisfaction she took in the one perfectly made walking suit to which she had treated herself she was glad when the final day came when the belated dressmakers and artistes in jackets and wraps had sent home their last wares and the trunks were packed It had been rather the fault of circumstances than of Paris but Katy had not learned to love the beautiful capital as most Americans do and did not feel at all as if she wanted that her reward of virtue should be to go there when she died There must be more interesting places for live people and ghosts too to be found on the map of Europe she was sure Next morning as they drove slowly down the Champs Elysees and looked back for a last glimpse of the famous Arch a bright object met their eyes moving vaguely against the mist It was the gay red wagon of the Bon Marche carrying bundles home to the dwellers of some up town street Katy burst out laughing It is an emblem of Paris she said of our Paris I mean It has been all Bon Marche and fog Miss Katy interrupted Amy do you like Europe For my part I was never so disgusted with any place in my life Poor little bird her views of Europe are rather dark just now and no wonder said her mother Never mind darling you shall have something pleasanter by and by if I can find it for you Burnet is a great deal pleasanter than Paris pronounced Amy decidedly It doesn t keep always raining there and I can take walks and I understand everything that people say All that day they sped southward and with every hour came a change in the aspect of their surroundings Now they made brief stops in large busy towns which seemed humming with industry Now they whirled through grape countries with miles of vineyards where the brown leaves still hung on the vines Then again came glimpses of old Roman ruins amphitheatres viaducts fragments of wall or arch or a sudden chill betokened their approach to mountains where snowy peaks could be seen on the far horizon And when the long night ended and day roused them from broken slumbers behold the world was made over Autumn had vanished and the summer which they thought fled for good had taken his place Green woods waved about them fresh leaves were blowing in the wind roses and hollyhocks beckoned from white walled gardens and before they had done with exclaiming and rejoicing the Mediterranean shot into view intensely blue with white fringes of foam white sails blowing across white gulls flying above it and over all a sky of the same exquisite blue whose clouds were white as the drifting sails on the water below and they were at Marseilles It was like a glimpse of Paradise to eyes fresh from autumnal grays and glooms as they sped along the lovely coast every curve and turn showing new combinations of sea and shore olive crowned cliff and shining mountain peak With every mile the blue became bluer the wind softer the feathery verdure more dense and summer like Hyeres and Cannes and Antibes were passed and then as they rounded a long point came the view of a sunshiny city lying on a sunlit shore the train slackened its speed and they knew that their journey s end was come and they were in Nice The place seemed to laugh with gayety as they drove down the Promenade des Anglais and past the English garden where the band was playing beneath the acacias and palm trees On one side was a line of bright windowed hotels and pensions with balconies and striped awnings on the other the long reach of yellow sand beach where ladies were grouped on shawls and rugs and children ran up and down in the sun while beyond stretched the waveless sea The December sun felt as warm as on a late June day at home and had the same soft caressing touch The pavements were thronged with groups of leisurely looking people all wearing an unmistakable holiday aspect pretty girls in correct Parisian costumes walked demurely beside their mothers with cavaliers in attendance and among these young men appeared now and again the well known uniform of the United States Navy I wonder said missus Ashe struck by a sudden thought if by any chance our squadron is here She asked the question the moment they entered the hotel and the porter who prided himself on understanding zose Eenglesh replied Mais oui Madame ze Americaine fleet it is here zat is not here but at Villefranche just a leetle four mile away it is ze same zing exactly Katy do you hear that cried missus Ashe The frigates are here and the Natchitoches among them of course and we shall have Ned to go about with us everywhere It is a real piece of good luck for us Ladies are at such a loss in a place like this with nobody to escort them I am perfectly delighted So am I said Katy I never saw a frigate and I always wanted to see one Do you suppose they will let us go on board of them Why of course they will Then to the porter Give me a sheet of paper and an envelope please I must let Ned know that I am here at once missus Ashe wrote her note and despatched it before they went upstairs to take off their bonnets She seemed to have a half hope that some bird of the air might carry the news of her arrival to her brother for she kept running to the window as if in expectation of seeing him She was too restless to lie down or sleep and after she and Katy had lunched proposed that they should go out on the beach for a while Perhaps we may come across Ned she remarked They did not come across Ned but there was no lack of other delightful objects to engage their attention The sands were smooth and hard as a floor Soft pink lights were beginning to tinge the western sky To the north shone the peaks of the maritime Alps and the same rosy glow caught them here and there and warmed their grays and whites into color I wonder what that can be said Katy indicating the rocky point which bounded the beach to the east where stood a picturesque building of stone with massive towers and steep pitches of roof It looks half like a house and half like a castle but it is quite fascinating I think Do you suppose that people live there We might ask suggested missus Ashe Just then they came to a shallow river spanned by a bridge beside whose pebbly bed stood a number of women who seemed to be washing clothes by the simple and primitive process of laying them in the water on top of the stones and pounding them with a flat wooden paddle till they were white Katy privately thought that the clothes stood a poor chance of lasting through these cleansing operations but she did not say so and made the inquiry which missus Ashe had suggested in her best French Celle la answered the old woman whom she had addressed Mais c est la Pension Suisse A pension why that means a boarding house cried Katy What fun it must be to board there Well why shouldn t we board there said her friend You know we meant to look for rooms as soon as we were rested and had found out a little about the place Let us walk on and see what the Pension Suisse is like If the inside is as pleasant as the outside we could not do better I should think Oh I do hope all the rooms are not already taken said Katy who had fallen in love at first sight with the Pension Suisse She felt quite oppressed with anxiety as they rang the bell The Pension Suisse proved to be quite as charming inside as out The thick stone walls made deep sills and embrasures for the casement windows which were furnished with red cushions to serve as seats and lounging places Every window seemed to command a view for those which did not look toward the sea looked toward the mountains The house was by no means full either Several sets of rooms were to be had and Katy felt as if she had walked straight into the pages of a romance When missus Ashe engaged for a month a delightful suite of three a sitting room and two sleeping chambers in a round tower with a balcony overhanging the water and a side window from which a flight of steps led down into a little walled garden nestled in among the masonry where tall laurestinus and lemon trees grew and orange and brown wallflowers made the air sweet Her contentment knew no bounds I am so glad that I came she told missus Ashe I never confessed it to you before but sometimes when we were sick at sea you know and when it would rain all the time and after Amy caught that cold in Paris I have almost wished just for a minute or two at a time that we hadn t But now I wouldn t not have come for the world This is perfectly delicious I am glad glad glad we are here and we are going to have a lovely time I know They were passing out of the rooms into the hall as she said these words and two ladies who were walking up a cross passage turned their heads at the sound of her voice To her great surprise Katy recognized missus Page and Lilly Why Cousin Olivia is it you she cried springing forward with the cordiality one naturally feels in seeing a familiar face in a foreign land missus Page seemed rather puzzled than cordial She put up her eyeglass and did not seem to quite make out who Katy was It is Katy Carr mamma explained Lilly Well Katy this is a surprise Who would have thought of meeting you in Nice There was a decided absence of rapture in Lilly s manner She was prettier than ever as Katy saw in a moment and beautifully dressed in soft brown velvet which exactly suited her complexion and her pale colored wavy hair Katy Carr why so it is admitted missus Page It is a surprise indeed We had no idea that you were abroad What has brought you so far from Tunket Burnet I mean Who are you with With my friend missus Ashe explained Katy rather chilled by this cool reception Let me introduce you missus Ashe these are my cousins missus Page and Miss Page Amy why where is Amy Amy had walked back to the door of the garden staircase and was standing there looking down upon the flowers Cousin Olivia bowed rather distantly Her quick eye took in the details of missus Ashe s travelling dress and Katy s dark blue ulster Some countrified friend from that dreadful Western town where they live she said to herself How foolish of Philip Carr to try to send his girls to Europe He can t afford it I know Her voice was rather rigid as she inquired And what brings you here to this house I mean Oh we are coming to morrow to stay we have taken rooms for a month explained Katy What a delicious looking old place it is Have you said Lilly in a voice which did not express any particular pleasure Why we are staying here too CHAPTER VII THE PENSION SUISSE What do you suppose can have brought Katy Carr to Europe inquired Lilly as she stood in the window watching the three figures walk slowly down the sands She is the last person I expected to turn up here I supposed she was stuck in that horrid place what is the name of it where they live for the rest of her life I confess I am surprised at meeting her myself rejoined missus Page I had no idea that her father could afford so expensive a journey And who is this woman that she has got along with her I have no idea I m sure Some Western friend I suppose Dear me I wish they were going to some other house than this said Lilly discontentedly If they were at the Rivoir for instance or one of those places at the far end of the beach we shouldn t need to see anything of them or even know that they were in town It s a real nuisance to have people spring upon you this way people you don t want to meet and when they happen to be relations it is all the worse Katy will be hanging on us all the time I m afraid Oh my dear there is no fear of that A little repression on our part will prevent her from being any trouble I m quite certain But we must treat her politely you know Lilly her father is my cousin That s the saddest part of it Well there s one thing I shall not take her with me every time we go to the frigates said Lilly decisively I am not going to inflict a country cousin on Lieutenant Worthington and spoil all my own fun beside So I give you fair warning mamma and you must manage it somehow Certainly dear I will It would be a great pity to have your visit to Nice spoiled in any way with the squadron here too and that pleasant mister Worthington so very attentive Unconscious of these plans for her suppression Katy walked back to the hotel in a mood of pensive pleasure Europe at last promised to be as delightful as it had seemed when she only knew it from maps and books and Nice so far appeared to her the most charming place in the world Somebody was waiting for them at the Hotel des Anglais a tall bronzed good looking somebody in uniform with pleasant brown eyes beaming from beneath a gold banded cap at the sight of whom Amy rushed forward with her long locks flying and missus Ashe uttered an exclamation of pleasure It was Ned Worthington missus Ashe s only brother whom she had not met for two years and a half and you can easily imagine how glad she was to see him You got my note then she said after the first eager greetings were over and she had introduced him to Katy Note No Did you write me a note Yes to Villefranche To the ship I shan t get that till tomorrow No finding out that you were here is just a bit of good fortune I came over to call on some friends who are staying down the beach a little way and dropping in to look over the list of arrivals as I generally do I saw your names and the porter not being able to say which way you had gone I waited for you to come in We have been looking at such a delightful old place the Pension Suisse and have taken rooms The Pension Suisse eh Why that was where I was going to call I know some people who are staying there It seems a pleasant house I m glad you are going there Polly It s first rate luck that the ships happen to be here just now I can see you every day But Ned surely you are not leaving me so soon Surely you will stay and dine with us urged his sister as he took up his cap I wish I could but I can t to night Polly You see I had engaged to take some ladies out to drive and they will expect me I had no idea that you would be here or I should have kept myself free apologetically Tomorrow I will come over early and be at your service for whatever you like to do That s right dear boy We shall expect you Then the moment he was gone Now Katy isn t he nice Very nice I should think said Katy who had watched the brief interview with interest I like his face so much and how fond he is of you Dear fellow so he is I am seven years older than he but we have always been intimate Brothers and sisters are not always intimate you know or perhaps you don t know for all of yours are Yes indeed said Katy with a happy smile There is nobody like Clover and Elsie except perhaps Johnnie and Dorry and Phil she added with a laugh The remove to the Pension Suisse was made early the next morning missus Page and Lilly did not appear to welcome them Katy rather rejoiced in their absence for she wanted the chance to get into order without interruptions There was something comfortable in the thought that they were to stay a whole month in these new quarters for so long a time it seemed worth while to make them pretty and homelike So while missus Ashe unpacked her own belongings and Amy s Katy who had a natural turn for arranging rooms took possession of the little parlor pulled the furniture into new positions laid out portfolios and work cases and their few books pinned various photographs which they had bought in Oxford and London on the walls and tied back the curtains to admit the sunshine Then she paid a visit to the little garden and came back with a long branch of laurestinus which she trained across the mantelpiece and a bunch of wallflowers for their one little vase The maid by her orders laid a fire of wood and pine cones ready for lighting and when all was done she called missus Ashe to pronounce upon the effect It is lovely she said sinking into a great velvet arm chair which Katy had drawn close to the seaward window I haven t seen anything so pleasant since we left home You are a witch Katy and the comfort of my life I am so glad I brought you Now pray go and unpack your own things and make yourself look nice for the second breakfast We have been a shabby set enough since we arrived I saw those cousins of yours looking askance at our old travelling dresses yesterday Let us try to make a more respectable impression to day So they went down to breakfast missus Ashe in one of her new Paris gowns Katy in a pretty dress of olive serge and Amy all smiles and ruffled pinafore walking hand in hand with her uncle Ned who had just arrived and whose great ally she was and missus Page and Lilly who were already seated at table had much ado to conceal their somewhat unflattering surprise at the conjunction For one moment Lilly s eyes opened into a wide stare of incredulous astonishment then she remembered herself nodded as pleasantly as she could to missus Ashe and Katy and favored Lieutenant Worthington with a pretty blushing smile as he went by while she murmured Mamma do you see that What does it mean Why Ned do you know those people asked missus Ashe at the same moment Do you know them Yes we met yesterday They are connections of my friend Miss Carr Really There is not the least family likeness between them And mister Worthington s eyes travelled deliberately from Lilly s delicate golden prettiness to Katy who truth to say did not shine by the contrast She has a nice sensible sort of face he thought and she looks like a lady but for beauty there is no comparison between the two Then he turned to listen to his sister as she replied No indeed not the least no two girls could be less like missus Ashe had made the same comparison but with quite a different result Katy s face was grown dear to her and she had not taken the smallest fancy to Lilly Page Her relationship to the young naval officer however made a wonderful difference in the attitude of missus Page and Lilly toward the party Katy became a person to be cultivated rather than repressed and thenceforward there was no lack of cordiality on their part I want to come in and have a good talk said Lilly slipping her arm through Katy s as they left the dining room Mayn t I come now while mamma is calling on missus Ashe This arrangement brought her to the side of Lieutenant Worthington and she walked between him and Katy down the hall and into the little drawing room Oh how perfectly charming You have been fixing up ever since you came haven t you It looks like home I wish we had a salon but mamma thought it wasn t worth while as we were only to be here such a little time What a delicious balcony over the water too May I go out on it Oh mister Worthington do see this She pushed open the half closed window and stepped out as she spoke mister Worthington after hesitating a moment followed Katy paused uncertain There was hardly room for three in the balcony yet she did not quite like to leave them But Lilly had turned her back and was talking in a low tone it was nothing more in reality than the lightest chit chat but it had the air of being something confidential so Katy after waiting a little while retreated to the sofa and took up her work joining now and then in the conversation which missus Ashe was keeping up with Cousin Olivia She did not mind Lilly s ill breeding nor was she surprised at it missus Ashe was less tolerant Isn t it rather damp out there Ned she called to her brother you had better throw my shawl round Miss Page s shoulders Oh it isn t a bit damp said Lilly recalled to herself by this broad hint Thank you so much for thinking of it missus Ashe but I am just coming in She seated herself beside Katy and began to question her rather languidly When did you leave home and how were they all when you came away All well thank you We sailed from Boston on the fourteenth of October and before that I spent two days with Rose Red you remember her She is married now and has the dearest little home and such a darling baby Yes I heard of her marriage It didn t seem much of a match for mister Redding s daughter to make did it I never supposed she would be satisfied with anything less than a member of Congress or a Secretary of Legation Rose isn t particularly ambitious I think and she seems perfectly happy replied Katy flushing Oh you needn t fire up in her defence you and Clover always did adore Rose Red I know but I never could see what there was about her that was so wonderfully fascinating She never had the least style and she was always just as rude to me as she could be You were not intimate at school but I am sure Rose was never rude said Katy with spirit Well we won t fight about her at this late day Tell me where you have been and where you are going and how long you are to stay in Europe Katy glad to change the subject complied and the conversation diverged into comparison of plans and experiences Lilly had been in Europe nearly a year and had seen almost everything as she phrased it She and her mother had spent the previous winter in Italy had taken a run into Russia done Switzerland and the Tyrol thoroughly and France and Germany and were soon going into Spain and from there to Paris to shop in preparation for their return home in the spring Of course we shall want quantities of things she said No one will believe that we have been abroad unless we bring home a lot of clothes The lingerie and all that is ordered already but the dresses must be made at the last moment and we shall have a horrid time of it I suppose Worth has promised to make me two walking suits and two ball dresses but he s very bad about keeping his word Did you do much when you were in Paris Katy We went to the Louvre three times and to Versailles and saint Cloud said Katy wilfully misunderstanding her Oh I didn t mean that kind of stupid thing I meant gowns What did you buy One tailor made suit of dark blue cloth My what moderation Shopping played a large part in Lilly s reminiscences She recollected places not from their situation or beauty or historical associations or because of the works of art which they contained but as the places where she bought this or that Oh that dear Piazza di Spagna she would say that was where I found my rococo necklace the loveliest thing you ever saw Katy Or Prague oh yes mother got the most enchanting old silver chatelaine there with all kinds of things hanging to it needlecases and watches and scent bottles all solid and so beautifully chased Or again Berlin was horrid we thought but the amber is better and cheaper than anywhere else great strings of beads of the largest size and that beautiful pale yellow for a hundred francs You must get yourself one Katy Poor Lilly Europe to her was all things She had collected trunks full of objects to carry home but of the other collections which do not go into trunks she had little or none Her mind was as empty her heart as untouched as ever the beauty and the glory and the pathos of art and history and Nature had been poured out in vain before her closed and indifferent eyes Life soon dropped into a peaceful routine at the Pension Suisse which was at the same time restful and stimulating Katy s first act in the morning as soon as she opened her eyes was to hurry to the window in hopes of getting a glimpse of Corsica She had discovered that this elusive island could almost always be seen from Nice at the dawning but that as soon as the sun was fairly up it vanished to appear no more for the rest of the day There was something fascinating to her imagination in the hovering mountain outline between sea and sky She felt as if she were under an engagement to be there to meet it and she rarely missed the appointment Then after Corsica had pulled the bright mists over its face and melted from view she would hurry with her dressing and as soon as was practicable set to work to make the salon look bright before the coffee and rolls should appear a little after eight o clock missus Ashe always found the fire lit the little meal cosily set out beside it and Katy s happy untroubled face to welcome her when she emerged from her room and the cheer of these morning repasts made a good beginning for the day Then came walking and a French lesson and a long sitting on the beach while Katy worked at her home letters and Amy raced up and down in the sun and then toward noon Lieutenant Ned generally appeared and some scheme of pleasure was set on foot missus Ashe ignored his evident penchant for Lilly Page and claimed his time and attentions as hers by right Young Worthington was a good deal taken with the pretty Lilly still he had an old time devotion for his sister and the habit of doing what she desired and he yielded to her behests with no audible objections He made a fourth in the carriage while they drove over the lovely hills which encircle Nice toward the north to Cimiers and the Val de saint Andre or down the coast toward Ventimiglia He went with them to Monte Carlo and Mentone and was their escort again and again when they visited the great war ships as they lay at anchor in a bay which in its translucent blue was like an enormous sapphire missus Page and her daughter were included in these parties more than once but there was something in missus Ashe s cool appropriation of her brother which was infinitely vexatious to Lilly who before her arrival had rather looked upon Lieutenant Worthington as her own especial property I wish that missus Ashe had stayed at home she told her mother She quite spoils everything mister Worthington isn t half so nice as he was before she came I do believe she has a plan for making him fall in love with Katy but there she makes a miss of it for he doesn t seem to care anything about her Katy is a nice girl enough pronounced her mother but not of the sort to attract a gay young man I should fancy I don t believe she is thinking of any such thing You needn t be afraid Lilly I m not afraid said Lilly with a pout only it s so provoking missus Page was quite right Katy was not thinking of any such thing She liked Ned Worthington s frank manners she owned quite honestly that she thought him handsome and she particularly admired the sort of deferential affection which he showed to missus Ashe and his nice ways with Amy For herself she was aware that he scarcely noticed her except as politeness demanded that he should be civil to his sister s friend but the knowledge did not trouble her particularly Her head was full of interesting things plans ideas She was not accustomed to being made the object of admiration and experienced none of the vexations of a neglected belle If Lieutenant Worthington happened to talk to her she responded frankly and freely if he did not she occupied herself with something else in either case she was quite unembarrassed both in feeling and manner and had none of the awkwardness which comes from disappointed vanity and baffled expectations and the need for concealing them Toward the close of December the officers of the flag ship gave a ball which was the great event of the season to the gay world of Nice Americans were naturally in the ascendant on an American frigate and of all the American girls present Lilly Page was unquestionably the prettiest Exquisitely dressed in white lace with bands of turquoises on her neck and arms and in her hair she had more partners than she knew what to do with more bouquets than she could well carry and compliments enough to turn any girl s head Thrown off her guard by her triumphs she indulged a little vindictive feeling which had been growing in her mind of late on account of what she chose to consider certain derelictions of duty on the part of Lieutenant Worthington and treated him to a taste of neglect She was engaged three deep when he asked her to dance she did not hear when he invited her to walk she turned a cold shoulder when he tried to talk and seemed absorbed by the other cavaliers naval and otherwise who crowded about her Piqued and surprised Ned Worthington turned to Katy She did not dance saying frankly that she did not know how and was too tall and she was rather simply dressed in a pearl gray silk which had been her best gown the winter before in Burnet with a bunch of red roses in the white lace of the tucker and another in her hand both the gifts of little Amy but she looked pleasant and serene and there was something about her which somehow soothed his disturbed mind as he offered her his arm for a walk on the decks For a while they said little and Katy was quite content to pace up and down in silence enjoying the really beautiful scene the moonlight on the Bay the deep wavering reflections of the dark hulls and slender spars the fairy effect of the colored lamps and lanterns and the brilliant moving maze of the dancers Do you care for this sort of thing he suddenly asked What sort of thing do you mean Oh all this jigging and waltzing and amusement I don t know how to jig but it s delightful to look on she answered merrily I never saw anything so pretty in my life The happy tone of her voice and the unruffled face which she turned upon him quieted his irritation I really believe you mean it he said and yet if you won t think me rude to say so most girls would consider the thing dull enough if they were only getting out of it what you are if they were not dancing I mean and nobody in particular was trying to entertain them But everything is being done to entertain me cried Katy I can t imagine what makes you think that it could seem dull I am in it all don t you see I have my share Oh I am stupid I can t make you understand Yes you do I understand perfectly I think only it is such a different point of view from what girls in general would take By girls he meant Lilly Please do not think me uncivil You are not uncivil at all but don t let us talk any more about me Look at the lights between the shadows of the masts on the water How they quiver I never saw anything so beautiful I think And how warm it is I can t believe that we are in December and that it is nearly Christmas How is Polly going to celebrate her Christmas Have you decided Amy is to have a Christmas tree for her dolls and two other dolls are coming We went out this morning to buy things for it tiny little toys and candles fit for Lilliput And that reminds me do you suppose one can get any Christmas greens here Why not The place seems full of green That s just it the summer look makes it unnatural But I should like some to dress the parlor with if they could be had I ll see what I can find and send you a load I don t know why this very simple little talk should have made an impression on Lieutenant Worthington s mind but somehow he did not forget it Don t let us talk any more about me he said to himself that night when alone in his cabin I wonder how long it would be before the other one did anything to divert the talk from herself Some time I fancy He smiled rather grimly as he unbuckled his sword belt It is unlucky for a girl when she starts a train of reflection like this Lilly s little attempt to pique her admirer had somehow missed its mark The next afternoon Katy in her favorite place on the beach was at work on the long weekly letter which she never failed to send home to Burnet She held her portfolio in her lap and her pen ran rapidly over the paper as rapidly almost as her tongue would have run could her correspondents have been brought nearer Nice December twenty two Dear Papa and everybody Amy and I are sitting on my old purple cloak which is spread over the sand just where it was spread the last time I wrote you We are playing the following game I am a fairy and she is a little girl Another fairy not sitting on the cloak at present has enchanted the little girl and I am telling her various ways by which she can work out her deliverance At present the task is to find twenty four dull red pebbles of the same color failing to do which she is to be changed into an owl When we began to play I was the wicked fairy but Amy objected to that because I am so nice so we changed the characters I wish you could see the glee in her pretty gray eyes over this infantile game into which she has thrown herself so thoroughly that she half believes in it But I needn t really be changed into an owl she says with a good deal of anxiety in her voice To think that you are shivering in the first snow storm or sending the children out with their sleds and india rubbers to slide How I wish instead that you were sharing the purple cloak with Amy and me and could sit all this warm balmy afternoon close to the surf line which fringes this bluest of blue seas There is plenty of room for you all Not many people come down to this end of the beach and if you were very good we would let you play Our life here goes on as delightfully as ever Nice is very full of people and there seem to be some pleasant ones among them Here at the Pension Suisse we do not see a great many Americans The fellow boarders are principally Germans and Austrians with a sprinkling of French Amy has found her twenty four red pebbles so she is let off from being an owl She is now engaged in throwing them one by one into the sea Each must hit the water under penalty of her being turned into a Muscovy duck She doesn t know exactly what a Muscovy duck is which makes her all the more particular about her shots But as I was saying our little suite in the round tower is so on one side of the rest of the Pension that it is as good as having a house of our own The salon is very bright and sunny we have two sofas and a square table and a round table and a sort of what not and two easy chairs and two uneasy chairs and a lamp of our own and a clock There is also a sofa pillow There s richness for you We have pinned up all our photographs on the walls including Papa s and Clovy s and that bad one of Phil and Johnnie making faces at each other and three lovely red and yellow Japanese pictures on muslin which Rose Red put in my trunk the last thing for a spot of color There are some autumn leaves too and we always have flowers and in the mornings and evenings a fire Amy is now finding fifty snow white pebbles which when found are to be interred in one common grave among the shingle If she fails to do this she is to be changed to an electrical eel The chief difficulty is that she loses her heart to particular pebbles I can t bury you I hear her saying To return we have jolly little breakfasts together in the salon They consist of coffee and rolls and are served by a droll snappish little garcon with no teeth and an Italian French patois which is very hard to understand when he sputters He told me the other day that he had been a garcon for forty six years which seemed rather a long boyhood The company as we meet them at table are rather entertaining Cousin Olivia and Lilly are on their best behavior to me because I am travelling with missus Ashe and missus Ashe is Lieutenant Worthington s sister and Lieutenant Worthington is Lilly s admirer and they like him very much In fact Lilly has intimated confidentially that she is all but engaged to him but I am not sure about it or if that was what she meant and I fear if it proves true that dear Polly will not like it at all She is quite unmanageable and snubs Lilly continually in a polite way which makes me fidgety for fear Lilly will be offended but she never seems to notice it Cousin Olivia looks very handsome and gorgeous She quite takes the color out of the little Russian Countess who sits next to her and who is as dowdy and meek as if she came from Akron or Binghampton or any other place where countesses are unknown Then there are two charming well bred young Austrians The one who sits nearest to me is a Candidat for a Doctorate of Laws and speaks eight languages well He has only studied English for the past six weeks but has made wonderful progress I wish my French were half as good as his English is already There is a very gossiping young woman on the story beneath ours whom I meet sometimes in the garden and from her I hear all manner of romantic tales about people in the house One little French girl is dying of consumption and a broken heart because of a quarrel with her lover who is a courier and the padrona who is young and pretty and has only been married a few months to our elderly landlord has a story also I forget some of the details but there was a stern parent and an admirer and a cup of cold poison and now she says she wishes she were dying of consumption like poor Alphonsine For all that she looks quite fat and rosy and I often see her in her best gown with a great deal of Roman scarf and mosaic jewelry stationed in the doorway making the Pension look attractive to the passers by So she has a sense of duty though she is unhappy Amy has buried all her pebbles and says she is tired of playing fairy She is now sitting with her head on my shoulder and professedly studying her French verb for to morrow but in reality I am sorry to say she is conversing with me about be headings a subject which since her visit to the Tower has exercised a horrible fascination over her mind Do people die right away she asks Don t they feel one minute and doesn t it feel awfully There is a good deal of blood she supposes because there was so much straw laid about the block in the picture of Lady Jane Gray s execution which enlivened our walls in Paris On the whole I am rather glad that a fat little white dog has come waddling down the beach and taken off her attention Speaking of Paris seems to renew the sense of fog which we had there Oh how enchanting sunshine is after weeks of gloom I shall never forget how the Mediterranean looked when we saw it first all blue and such a lovely color There ought according to Morse s Atlas to have been a big red letter T on the water about where we were but I didn t see any Perhaps they letter it so far out from shore that only people in boats notice it Now the dusk is fading and the odd chill which hides under these warm afternoons begins to be felt Amy has received a message written on a mysterious white pebble to the effect Katy was interrupted at this point by a crunching step on the gravel behind her Good afternoon said a voice Polly has sent me to fetch you and Amy in She says it is growing cool We were just coming said Katy beginning to put away her papers Ned Worthington sat down on the cloak beside her The distance was now steel gray against the sky then came a stripe of violet and then a broad sheet of the vivid iridescent blue which one sees on the necks of peacocks which again melted into the long line of flashing surf See that gull he said how it drops plumb into the sea as if bound to go through to China missus Hawthorne calls skylarks little raptures replied Katy Sea gulls seem to me like grown up raptures Are you going said Lieutenant Worthington in a tone of surprise as she rose Didn t you say that Polly wanted us to come in Why yes but it seems too good to leave doesn t it Oh by the way Miss Carr I came across a man to day and ordered your greens They will be sent on Christmas Eve Is that right Quite right and we are ever so much obliged to you She turned for a last look at the sea and unseen by Ned Worthington formed her lips into a good night Katy had made great friends with the Mediterranean The promised greens appeared on the afternoon before Christmas Day in the shape of an enormous fagot of laurel and laurestinus and holly and box orange and lemon boughs with ripe fruit hanging from them thick ivy tendrils whole yards long arbutus pepper tree and great branches of acacia covered with feathery yellow bloom The man apologized for bringing so little The gentleman had ordered two francs worth he said but this was all he could carry he would fetch some more if the young lady wished But Katy exclaiming with delight over her wealth wished no more so the man departed and the three friends proceeded to turn the little salon into a fairy bower Every photograph and picture was wreathed in ivy long garlands hung on either side the windows and the chimney piece and door frames became clustering banks of leaf and blossom A great box of flowers had come with the greens and bowls of fresh roses and heliotrope and carnations were set everywhere violets and primroses gold hearted brown auriculas spikes of veronica all the zones and all the seasons combining to make the Christmas tide sweet and to turn winter topsy turvy in the little parlor Mabel and Mary Matilda with their two doll visitors sat gravely round the table in the laps of their little mistresses and Katy putting on an apron and an improvised cap and speaking Irish very fast served them with a repast of rolls and cocoa raspberry jam and delicious little almond cakes The fun waxed fast and furious and Lieutenant Worthington coming in with his hands full of parcels for the Christmas tree was just in time to hear Katy remark in a strong County Kerry brogue Och thin indade Miss Amy and it s no more cake you ll be getting out of me the night That s four pieces you ve ate and it s little slape your poor mother ll git with you a tossin and tumblin forenenst her all night long because of your big appetite Oh Miss Katy talk Irish some more cried the delighted children Is it Irish you d be afther having me talk when it s me own langwidge and sorrow a bit of another do I know demanded Katy Then she caught sight of the new arrival and stopped short with a blush and a laugh Come in mister Worthington she said we re at supper as you see and I am acting as waitress Oh Uncle Ned please go away pleaded Amy or Katy will be polite and not talk Irish any more Indade and the less ye say about politeness the betther when ye re afther ordering the jantleman out of the room in that fashion said the waitress Then she pulled off her cap and untied her apron Now for the Christmas tree she said It was a very little tree but it bore some remarkable fruits for in addition to the tiny toys and candles fit for Lilliput various parcels were found to have been hastily added at the last moment for various people The Natchitoches had lately come from the Levant and delightful Oriental confections now appeared for Amy and missus Ashe Turkish slippers all gold embroidery towels with richly decorated ends in silks and tinsel all the pretty superfluities which the East holds out to charm gold from the pockets of her Western visitors A pretty little dagger in agate and silver fell to Katy s share out of what Lieutenant Worthington called his loot and beside a most beautiful specimen of the inlaid work for which Nice is famous a looking glass with a stand and little doors to close it in which was a present from missus Ashe It was quite unlike a Christmas Eve at home but altogether delightful and as Katy sat next morning on the sand after the service in the English church to finish her home letter and felt the sun warm on her cheek and the perfumed air blow past as softly as in June she had to remind herself that Christmas is not necessarily synonymous with snow and winter but means the great central heat and warmth the advent of Him who came to lighten the whole earth A few days after this pleasant Christmas they left Nice All of them felt a reluctance to move and Amy loudly bewailed the necessity If I could stay here till it is time to go home I shouldn t be homesick at all she declared But what a pity it would be not to see Italy said her mother Think of Naples and Rome and Venice I don t want to think about them It makes me feel as if I was studying a great long geography lesson and it tires me so to learn it Amy dear you re not well Yes I am quite well only I don t want to go away from Nice You only have to learn a little bit at a time of your geography lesson you know suggested Katy and it s a great deal nicer way to study it than out of a book But though she spoke cheerfully she was conscious that she shared Amy s reluctance It s all laziness she told herself Nice has been so pleasant that it has spoiled me It was a consolation and made going easier that they were to drive over the famous Cornice Road as far as San Remo instead of going to Genoa by rail as most travellers now a days do They departed from the Pension Suisse early on an exquisite morning fair and balmy as June but with a little zest and sparkle of coolness in the air which made it additionally delightful The Mediterranean was of the deepest violet blue a sort of bloom of color seemed to lie upon it The sky was like an arch of turquoise every cape and headland shone jewel like in the golden sunshine The carriage as it followed the windings of the road cut shelf like on the cliffs seemed poised between earth and heaven the sea below the mountain summits above with a fairy world of verdure between The journey was like a dream of enchantment and rapidly changing surprises and when it ended in a quaint hostelry at San Remo with palm trees feathering the Bordighera Point and Corsica for once seen by day lying in bold clear outlines against the sunset Katy had to admit to herself that Nice much as she loved it was not the only not even the most beautiful place in Europe Already she felt her horizon growing her convictions changing and who should say what lay beyond The next day brought them to Genoa to a hotel once the stately palace of an archbishop where they were lodged all three together in an enormous room so high and broad and long that their three little curtained beds set behind a screen of carved wood made no impression on the space There were not less than four sofas and double that number of arm chairs in the room besides a couple of monumental wardrobes but as Katy remarked several grand pianos could still have been moved in without anybody s feeling crowded On one side of them lay the port of Genoa filled with craft from all parts of the world and flying the flags of a dozen different nations From the other they caught glimpses of the magnificent old city rising in tier over tier of churches and palaces and gardens while nearer still were narrow streets which glittered with gold filigree and the shops of jewel workers And while they went in and out and gazed and wondered Lilly Page at the Pension Suisse was saying I am so glad that Katy and that missus Ashe are gone Nothing has been so pleasant since they came Lieutenant Worthington is dreadfully stiff and stupid and seems quite different from what he used to be But now that we have got rid of them it will all come right again I really don t think that Katy was to blame said missus Page She never seemed to me to be making any effort to attract him Oh Katy is sly responded Lilly vindictively She never seems to do anything but somehow she always gets her own way I suppose she thought I didn t see her keeping him down there on the beach the other day when he was coming in to call on us but I did It was just out of spite and because she wanted to vex me I know it was Well dear she s gone now and you won t be worried with her again said her mother soothingly Don t pout so Lilly and wrinkle up your forehead It s very unbecoming Yes she s gone snapped Lilly and as she s bound for the East and we for the West we are not likely to meet again for which I am devoutly thankful CHAPTER VIII ON THE TRACK OF ULYSSES We are going to follow the track of Ulysses said Katy with her eyes fixed on the little travelling map in her guide book Do you realize that Polly dear He and his companions sailed these very seas before us and we shall see the sights they saw Circe s Cape and the Isles of the Sirens and Polyphemus himself perhaps who knows The Marco Polo had just cast off her moorings and was slowly steaming out of the crowded port of Genoa into the heart of a still rosy sunset The water was perfectly smooth no motion could be felt but the engine s throb The trembling foam of the long wake showed glancing points of phosphorescence here and there while low on the eastern sky a great silver planet burned like a signal lamp Polyphemus was a horrible giant I read about him once and I don t want to see him observed Amy from her safe protected perch in her mother s lap He may not be so bad now as he was in those old times Some missionary may have come across him and converted him If he were good you wouldn t mind his being big would you suggested Katy N o replied Amy doubtfully but it would take a great lot of missionaries to make him good I should think One all alone would be afraid to speak to him We shan t really see him shall we I don t believe we shall and if we stuff cotton in our ears and look the other way we need not hear the sirens sing said Katy who was in the highest spirits And oh Polly dear there is one delightful thing I forgot to tell you about The captain says he shall stay in Leghorn all day to morrow taking on freight and we shall have plenty of time to run up to Pisa and see the Cathedral and the Leaning Tower and everything else Now that is something Ulysses didn t do I am so glad I didn t die of measles when I was little as Rose Red used to say She gave her book a toss into the air as she spoke and caught it again as it fell very much as the Katy Carr of twelve years ago might have done What a child you are said missus Ashe approvingly you never seem out of sorts or tired of things Out of sorts I should think not And pray why should I be Polly dear Katy had taken to calling her friend Polly dear of late a trick picked up half unconsciously from Lieutenant Ned missus Ashe liked it it was sisterly and intimate she said and made her feel nearer Katy s age Does the tower really lean questioned Amy far over I mean so that we can see it We shall know to morrow replied Katy If it doesn t I shall lose all my confidence in human nature Katy s confidence in human nature was not doomed to be impaired There stood the famous tower when they reached the Place del Duomo in Pisa next morning looking all aslant exactly as it does in the pictures and the alabaster models and seeming as if in another moment it must topple over from its own weight upon their heads missus Ashe declared that it was so unnatural that it made her flesh creep and when she was coaxed up the winding staircase to the top she turned so giddy that they were all thankful to get her safely down to firm ground again She turned her back upon the tower as they crossed the grassy space to the majestic old Cathedral saying that if she thought about it any more she should become a disbeliever in the attraction of gravitation which she had always been told all respectable people must believe in The guide showed them the lamp swinging by a long slender chain before which Galileo is said to have sat and pondered while he worked out his theory of the pendulum This lamp seemed a sort of own cousin to the attraction of gravitation and they gazed upon it with respect Then they went to the Baptistery to see Niccolo Pisano s magnificent pulpit of creamy marble a mass of sculpture supported on the backs of lions and the equally lovely font and to admire the extraordinary sound which their guide evoked from a mysterious echo with which he seemed to be on intimate terms for he made it say whatever he would and almost answer back It was in coming out of the Baptistery that they met with an adventure which Amy could never quite forget Pisa is the mendicant city of Italy and her streets are infested with a band of religious beggars who call themselves the Brethren of the Order of Mercy They wear loose black gowns sandals laced over their bare feet and black cambric masks with holes through which their eyes glare awfully and they carry tin cups for the reception of offerings which they thrust into the faces of all strangers visiting the city whom they look upon as their lawful prey As our party emerged from the Baptistery two of these Brethren espied them and like great human bats came swooping down upon them with long strides their black garments flying in the wind their eyes rolling strangely behind their masks and brandishing their alms cups which had Pour les Pauvres lettered upon them and gave forth a clapping sound like a watchman s rattle There was something terrible in their appearance and the rushing speed of their movements Amy screamed and ran behind her mother who visibly shrank Katy stood her ground but the bat winged fiends in Dore s illustrations to Dante occurred to her and her fingers trembled as she dropped some money in the cups Even mendicant friars are human Katy ceased to tremble as she observed that one of them as he retreated walked backward for some distance in order to gaze longer at missus Ashe whose cheeks were flushed with bright pink and who was looking particularly handsome She began to laugh instead and missus Ashe laughed too but Amy could not get over the impression of having been attacked by demons and often afterward recurred with a shudder to the time when those awful black things flew at her and she hid behind mamma The ghastly pictures of the Triumph of Death which were presently exhibited to them on the walls of the Campo Santo did not tend to reassure her and it was with quite a pale scared little face that she walked toward the hotel where they were to lunch and she held fast to Katy s hand Their way led them through a narrow street inhabited by the poorer classes a dusty street with high shabby buildings on either side and wide doorways giving glimpses of interior courtyards where empty hogsheads and barrels and rusty caldrons lay and great wooden trays of macaroni were spread out in the sun to dry Some of the macaroni was gray some white some yellow none of it looked at all desirable to eat as it lay exposed to the dust with long lines of ill washed clothes flapping above on wires stretched from one house to another As is usual in poor streets there were swarms of children and the appearance of little Amy with her long bright hair falling over her shoulders and Mabel clasped in her arms created a great sensation The children in the street shouted and exclaimed and other children within the houses heard the sounds and came trooping out while mothers and older sisters peeped from the doorways The very air seemed full of eager faces and little brown and curly heads bobbing up and down with excitement and black eyes all fixed upon big beautiful Mabel who with her thick wig of flaxen hair her blue velvet dress and jacket feathered hat and little muff seemed to them like some strange small marvel from another world They could not decide whether she was a living child or a make believe one and they dared not come near enough to find out so they clustered at a little distance pointed with their fingers and whispered and giggled while Amy much pleased with the admiration shown for her darling lifted Mabel up to view At last one droll little girl with a white cap on her round head seemed to make up her mind and darting indoors returned with her doll a poor little image of wood its only garment a coarse shirt of red cotton This she held out for Amy to see Amy smiled for the first time since her encounter with the bat like friars and Katy taking Mabel from her made signs that the two dolls should kiss each other But though the little Italian screamed with laughter at the idea of a bacio between two dolls she would by no means allow it and hid her treasure behind her back blushing and giggling and saying something very fast which none of them understood while she waved two fingers at them with a curious gesture I do believe she is afraid Mabel will cast the evil eye on her doll said Katy at last with a sudden understanding as to what this pantomime meant Why you silly thing cried the outraged Amy do you suppose for one moment that my child could hurt your dirty old dolly You ought to be glad to have her noticed at all by anybody that s clean The sound of the foreign tongue completed the discomfiture of the little Italian With a shriek she fled and all the other children after her pausing at a distance to look back at the alarming creatures who didn t speak the familiar language Katy wishing to leave a pleasant impression made Mabel kiss her waxen fingers toward them This sent the children off into another fit of laughter and chatter and they followed our friends for quite a distance as they proceeded on their way to the hotel All that night over a sea as smooth as glass the Marco Polo slipped along the coasts past which the ships of Ulysses sailed in those old legendary days which wear so charmed a light to our modern eyes Katy roused at three in the morning and looking from her cabin window had a glimpse of an island which her map showed her must be Elba where that war eagle Napoleon was chained for a while Then she fell asleep again and when she roused in full daylight the steamer was off the coast of Ostia and nearing the mouth of the Tiber Dreamy mountain shapes rose beyond the far away Campagna and every curve and indentation of the coast bore a name which recalled some interesting thing About eleven a dim drawn bubble appeared on the horizon which the captain assured them was the dome of saint Peter s nearly thirty miles distant This was one of the moments which Clover had been fond of speculating about and Katy contrasting the real with the imaginary moment could not help smiling Neither she nor Clover had ever supposed that her first glimpse of the great dome was to be so little impressive On and on they went till the air hung bubble disappeared and Amy grown very tired of scenery with which she had no associations and grown up raptures which she did not comprehend squeezed herself into the end of the long wooden settee on which Katy sat and began to beg for another story concerning Violet and Emma Just a little tiny chapter you know Miss Katy about what they did on New Year s Day or something It s so dull to keep sailing and sailing all day and have nothing to do and it s ever so long since you told me anything about them really and truly it is Now Violet and Emma if the truth is to be told had grown to be the bane of Katy s existence She had rung the changes on their uneventful adventures and racked her brains to invent more and more details till her imagination felt like a dry sponge from which every possible drop of moisture had been squeezed Amy was insatiable Her interest in the tale never flagged and when her exhausted friend explained that she really could not think of another word to say on the subject she would turn the tables by asking Then Miss Katy mayn t I tell you a chapter whereupon she would proceed somewhat in this fashion It was the day before Christmas no we won t have it the day before Christmas it shall be three days before Thanksgiving Violet and Emma got up in the morning and well they didn t do anything in particular that day They just had their breakfasts and dinners and played and studied a little and went to bed early you know and the next morning well there didn t much happen that day either they just had their breakfasts and dinners and played Listening to Amy s stories was so much worse than telling them to her that Katy in self defence was driven to recommence her narrations but she had grown to hate Violet and Emma with a deadly hatred So when Amy made this appeal on the steamer s deck a sudden resolution took possession of her and she decided to put an end to these dreadful children once for all Yes Amy she said I will tell you one more story about Violet and Emma but this is positively the last So Amy cuddled close to her friend and listened with rapt attention as Katy told how on a certain day just before the New Year Violet and Emma started by themselves in a little sleigh drawn by a pony to carry to a poor woman who lived in a lonely house high up on a mountain slope a basket containing a turkey a mould of cranberry jelly a bunch of celery and a mince pie They were so pleased at having all these nice things to take to poor widow Simpson and in thinking how glad she would be to see them proceeded the naughty Katy that they never noticed how black the sky was getting to be or how the wind howled through the bare boughs of the trees They had to go slowly for the road was up hill all the way and it was hard work for the poor pony But he was a stout little fellow and tugged away up the slippery track and Violet and Emma talked and laughed and never thought what was going to happen Just half way up the mountain there was a rocky cliff which overhung the road and on this cliff grew an enormous hemlock tree The branches were loaded with snow which made them much heavier than usual Just as the sleigh passed slowly underneath the cliff a violent blast of wind blew up from the ravine struck the hemlock and tore it out of the ground roots and all It fell directly across the sleigh and Violet and Emma and the pony and the basket with the turkey and the other things in it were all crushed as flat as pancakes Well said Amy as Katy stopped go on what happened then Nothing happened then replied Katy in a tone of awful solemnity nothing could happen Violet and Emma were dead the pony was dead the things in the basket were broken all to little bits and a great snowstorm began and covered them up and no one knew where they were or what had become of them till the snow melted in the spring With a loud shriek Amy jumped up from the bench No no no she cried they aren t dead I won t let them be dead Then she burst into tears ran down the stairs locked herself into her mother s stateroom and did not appear again for several hours Katy laughed heartily at first over this outburst but presently she began to repent and to think that she had treated her pet unkindly She went down and knocked at the stateroom door but Amy would not answer She called her softly through the key hole and coaxed and pleaded but it was all in vain Amy remained invisible till late in the afternoon and when she finally crept up again to the deck her eyes were red with crying and her little face as pale and miserable as if she had been attending the funeral of her dearest friend Katy s heart smote her Come here my darling she said holding out her hand come and sit in my lap and forgive me Violet and Emma shall not be dead They shall go on living since you care so much for them and I will tell stories about them to the end of the chapter No said Amy shaking her head mournfully you can t They re dead and they won t come to life again ever It s all over and I m so so o rry All Katy s apologies and efforts to resuscitate the story were useless Violet and Emma were dead to Amy s imagination and she could not make herself believe in them any more She was too woe begone to care for the fables of Circe and her swine which Katy told as they rounded the magnificent Cape Circello and the isles where the sirens used to sing appealed to her in vain The sun set the stars came out and under the beams of their countless lamps and the beckonings of a slender new moon the Marco Polo sailed into the Bay of Naples past Vesuvius whose dusky curl of smoke could be seen outlined against the luminous sky and brought her passengers to their landing place They woke next morning to a summer atmosphere full of yellow sunshine and true July warmth Flower vendors stood on every corner and pursued each newcomer with their fragrant wares Katy could not stop exclaiming over the cheapness of the flowers which were thrust in at the carriage windows as they drove slowly up and down the streets They were tied into flat nosegays whose centre was a white camellia encircled with concentric rows of pink tea rosebuds ring after ring till the whole was the size of an ordinary milk pan all to be had for the sum of ten cents But after they had bought two or three of these enormous bouquets and had discovered that not a single rose boasted an inch of stem and that all were pierced with long wires through their very hearts she ceased to care for them I would rather have one Souvenir or General Jacqueminot with a long stem and plenty of leaves than a dozen of these stiff platters of bouquets Katy told missus Ashe But when they drove beyond the city gates and the coachman came to anchor beneath walls overhung with the same roses and she found that she might stand on the seat and pull down as many branches of the lovely flowers as she desired and gather wallflowers for herself out of the clefts in the masonry she was entirely satisfied This is the Italy of my dreams she said With all its beauty there was an underlying sense of danger about Naples which interfered with their enjoyment of it Evil smells came in at the windows or confronted them as they went about the city There seemed something deadly in the air Whispered reports met their ears of cases of fever which the landlords of the hotels were doing their best to hush up An American gentleman was said to be lying very ill at one house A lady had died the week before at another missus Ashe grew nervous We will just take a rapid look at a few of the principal things she told Katy and then get away as fast as we can Amy is so on my mind that I have no peace of my life I keep feeling her pulse and imagining that she does not look right and though I know it is all my fancy I am impatient to be off You won t mind will you Katy After that everything they did was done in a hurry Katy felt as if she were being driven about by a cyclone as they rushed from one sight to another filling up all the chinks between with shopping which was irresistible where everything was so pretty and so wonderfully cheap She herself purchased a tortoise shell fan and chain for Rose Red and had her monogram carved upon it a coral locket for Elsie some studs for Dorry and for her father a small beautiful vase of bronze copied from one of the Pompeian antiques How charming it is to have money to spend in such a place as this she said to herself with a sigh of satisfaction as she surveyed these delightful buyings I only wish I could get ten times as many things and take them to ten times as many people Papa was so wise about it I can t think how it is that he always knows beforehand exactly how people are going to feel and what they will want missus Ashe also bought a great many things for herself and Amy and to take home as presents and it was all very pleasant and satisfactory except for that subtle sense of danger from which they could not escape and which made them glad to go See Naples and die says the old adage and the saying has proved sadly true in the case of many an American traveller Beside the talk of fever there was also a good deal of gossip about brigands going about as is generally the case in Naples and its vicinity Something was said to have happened to a party on one of the heights above Sorrento and though nobody knew exactly what the something was or was willing to vouch for the story missus Ashe and Katy felt a good deal of trepidation as they entered the carriage which was to take them to the neighborhood where the mysterious something had occurred The drive between Castellamare and Sorrento is in reality as safe as that between Boston and Brookline but as our party did not know this fact till afterward it did them no good It is also one of the most beautiful drives in the world following the windings of the exquisite coast mile after mile in long links of perfectly made road carved on the face of sharp cliffs with groves of oranges and lemons and olive orchards above and the Bay of Naples beneath stretching away like a solid sheet of lapis lazuli and gemmed with islands of the most picturesque form It is a pity that so much beauty should have been wasted on missus Ashe and Katy but they were too frightened to half enjoy it Their carriage was driven by a shaggy young savage who looked quite wild enough to be a bandit himself He cracked his whip loudly as they rolled along and every now and then gave a long shrill whistle missus Ashe was sure that these were signals to his band who were lurking somewhere on the olive hung hillsides She thought she detected him once or twice making signs to certain questionable looking characters as they passed and she fancied that the people they met gazed at them with an air of commiseration as upon victims who were being carried to execution Her fears affected Katy so though they talked and laughed and made jokes to amuse Amy who must not be scared or led to suppose that anything was amiss and to the outward view seemed a very merry party they were privately quaking in their shoes all the way and enjoying a deal of highly superfluous misery And after all they reached Sorrento in perfect safety and the driver who looked so dangerous turned out to be a respectable young man enough with a wife and family to support who considered a plateful of macaroni and a glass of sour red wine as the height of luxury and was grateful for a small gratuity of thirty cents or so which would enable him to purchase these dainties missus Ashe had a very bad headache next day to pay for her fright but she and Katy agreed that they had been very foolish and resolved to pay no more attention to unaccredited rumors or allow them to spoil their enjoyment which was a sensible resolution to make Their hotel was perched directly over the sea From the balcony of their sitting room they looked down a sheer cliff some sixty feet high into the water their bedrooms opened on a garden of roses with an orange grove beyond Not far from them was the great gorge which cuts the little town of Sorrento almost in two and whose seaward end makes the harbor of the place Katy was never tired of peering down into this strange and beautiful cleft whose sides two hundred feet in depth are hung with vines and trailing growths of all sorts and seem all a tremble with the fairy fronds of maiden hair ferns growing out of every chink and crevice She and Amy took walks along the coast toward Massa to look off at the lovely island shapes in the bay and admire the great clumps of cactus and Spanish bayonet which grew by the roadside and they always came back loaded with orange flowers which could be picked as freely as apple blossoms from New England orchards in the spring The oranges themselves at that time of the year were very sour but they answered as well for a romantic date From an orange grove as if they had been the sweetest in the world They made two different excursions to Pompeii which is within easy distance of Sorrento They scrambled on donkeys over the hills and had glimpses of the far away Calabrian shore of the natural arch and the temples of Paestum shining in the sun many miles distant On Katy s birthday which fell toward the end of January missus Ashe let her have her choice of a treat and she elected to go to the Island of Capri which none of them had seen It turned out a perfect day with sea and wind exactly right for the sail and to allow of getting into the famous Blue Grotto which can only be entered under particular conditions of tide and weather And they climbed the great cliff rise at the island s end and saw the ruins of the villa built by the wicked emperor Tiberius and the awful place known as his Leap down which it is said he made his victims throw themselves and they lunched at a hotel which bore his name and just at sunset pushed off again for the row home over the charmed sea This return voyage was almost the pleasantest thing of all the day The water was smooth the moon at its full It was larger and more brilliant than American moons are and seemed to possess an actual warmth and color The boatmen timed their oar strokes to the cadence of Neapolitan barcaroles and folk songs full of rhythmic movement which seemed caught from the pulsing tides And when at last the bow grated on the sands of the Sorrento landing place Katy drew a long regretful breath and declared that this was her best birthday gift of all better than Amy s flowers or the pretty tortoise shell locket that missus Ashe had given her better even than the letter from home which timed by happy accident had arrived by the morning s post to make a bright opening for the day All pleasant things must come to an ending Katy said missus Ashe one afternoon in early February I heard some ladies talking just now in the salon and they said that Rome is filling up very fast The Carnival begins in less than two weeks and everybody wants to be there then If we don t make haste we shall not be able to get any rooms Oh dear said Katy it is very trying not to be able to be in two places at once I want to see Rome dreadfully and yet I cannot bear to leave Sorrento We have been very happy here haven t we So they took up their wandering staves again and departed for Rome like the Apostle not knowing what should befall them there CHAPTER IX A ROMAN HOLIDAY Oh dear said missus Ashe as she folded her letters and laid them aside I wish those Pages would go away from Nice or else that the frigates were not there Why what s the matter asked Katy looking up from the many leaved journal from Clover over which she was poring Nothing is the matter except that those everlasting people haven t gone to Spain yet as they said they would and Ned seems to keep on seeing them replied missus Ashe petulantly But dear Polly what difference does it make And they never did promise you to go on any particular time did they N o they didn t but I wish they would all the same Not that Ned is such a goose as really to care anything for that foolish Lilly Then she gave a little laugh at her own inconsistency and added But I oughtn t to abuse her when she is your cousin Don t mention it said Katy cheerfully But really I don t see why poor Lilly need worry you so Polly dear The room in which this conversation took place was on the very topmost floor of the Hotel del Hondo in Rome It was large and many windowed and though there was a little bed in one corner half hidden behind a calico screen with a bureau and washing stand and a sort of stout mahogany hat tree on which Katy s dresses and jackets were hanging the remaining space with a sofa and easy chairs grouped round a fire and a round table furnished with books and a lamp was ample enough to make a good substitute for the private sitting room which missus Ashe had not been able to procure on account of the near approach of the Carnival and the consequent crowding of strangers to Rome In fact she was assured that under the circumstances she was lucky in finding rooms as good as these and she made the most of the assurance as a consolation for the somewhat unsatisfactory food and service of the hotel and the four long flights of stairs which must be passed every time they needed to reach the dining room or the street door The party had been in Rome only four days but already they had seen a host of interesting things They had stood in the strange sunken space with its marble floor and broken columns which is all that is left of the great Roman Forum They had visited the Coliseum at that period still overhung with ivy garlands and trailing greeneries and not as now scraped clean and bare and tidied out of much of its picturesqueness They had seen the Baths of Caracalla and the Temple of Janus and saint Peter s and the Vatican marbles and had driven out on the Campagna and to the Pamphili Doria Villa to gather purple and red anemones and to the English cemetery to see the grave of Keats They had also peeped into certain shops and attended a reception at the American Minister s in short like most unwarned travellers they had done about twice as much as prudence and experience would have permitted had those worthies been consulted All the romance of Katy s nature responded to the fascination of the ancient city the capital of the world as it may truly be called The shortest drive or walk brought them face to face with innumerable and unexpected delights Now it was a wonderful fountain with plunging horses and colossal nymphs and Tritons holding cups and horns from which showers of white foam rose high in air to fall like rushing rain into an immense marble basin Now it was an arched doorway with traceries as fine as lace sole remaining fragment of a heathen temple flung and stranded as it were by the waves of time on the squalid shore of the present Now it was a shrine at the meeting of three streets where a dim lamp burned beneath the effigy of the Madonna with always a fresh rose beside it in a vase and at its foot a peasant woman kneeling in red bodice and blue petticoat with a lace trimmed towel folded over her hair Or again it would be a sunlit terrace lifted high on a hillside and crowded with carriages full of beautifully dressed people while below all Rome seemed spread out like a panorama dim mighty majestic and bounded by the blue wavy line of the Campagna and the Alban hills Or perhaps it might be a wonderful double flight of steps with massive balustrades and pillars with urns on which sat a crowd of figures in strange costumes and attitudes who all looked as though they had stepped out of pictures but who were in reality models waiting for artists to come by and engage them No matter what it was a bit of oddly tinted masonry with a tuft of brown and orange wallflowers hanging upon it or a vegetable stall where endive and chiccory and curly lettuces were arranged in wreaths with tiny orange gourds and scarlet peppers for points of color it was all Rome and by virtue of that word different from any other place more suggestive more interesting ten times more mysterious than any other could possibly be so Katy thought This fact consoled her for everything and anything for the fleas the dirt for the queer things they had to eat and the still queerer odors they were forced to smell Nothing seemed of any particular consequence except the deep sense of enjoyment and the newly discovered world of thought and sensation of which she had become suddenly conscious The only drawback to her happiness as the days went on was that little Amy did not seem quite well or like herself She had taken a cold on the journey from Naples and though it did not seem serious that or something made her look pale and thin Her mother said she was growing fast but the explanation did not quite account for the wistful look in the child s eyes and the tired feeling of which she continually complained missus Ashe with vague uneasiness began to talk of cutting short their Roman stay and getting Amy off to the more bracing air of Florence But meanwhile there was the Carnival close at hand which they must by no means lose and the feeling that their opportunity might be a brief one made her and Katy all the more anxious to make the very most of their time So they filled the days full with sights to see and things to do and came and went sometimes taking Amy with them but more often leaving her at the hotel under the care of a kind German chambermaid who spoke pretty good English and to whom Amy had taken a fancy The marble things are so cold and the old broken things make me so sorry she explained and I hate beggars because they are dirty and the stairs make my back ache and I d a great deal rather stay with Maria and go up on the roof if you don t mind mamma This roof which Amy had chosen as a playplace covered the whole of the great hotel and had been turned into a sort of upper air garden by the simple process of gravelling it all over placing trellises of ivy here and there and setting tubs of oranges and oleanders and boxes of gay geraniums and stock gillyflowers on the balustrades A tame fawn was tethered there Amy adopted him as a playmate and what with his company and that of the flowers the times when her mother and Katy were absent from her passed not unhappily Katy always repaired to the roof as soon as they came in from their long mornings and afternoons of sight seeing Years afterward she would remember with contrition how pathetically glad Amy always was to see her She would put her little head on Katy s breast and hold her tight for many minutes without saying a word When she did speak it was always about the house and the garden that she talked She never asked any questions as to where Katy had been or what she had done it seemed to tire her to think about it I should be very lonely sometimes if it were not for my dear little fawn she told Katy once He is so sweet that I don t miss you and mamma very much while I have him to play with I call him Florio don t you think that is a pretty name I like to stay with him a great deal better than to go about with you to those nasty smelling old churches with fleas hopping all over them So Amy was left in peace with her fawn and the others made haste to see all they could before the time came to go to Florence Illustration Amy was left in peace with her fawn Katy realized one of the moments for which she had come to Europe when she stood for the first time on the balcony overhanging the Corso which missus Ashe had hired in company with some acquaintances made at the hotel and looked down at the ebb and surge of the just begun Carnival The narrow street seemed humming with people of all sorts and conditions Some were masked some were not There were ladies and gentlemen in fashionable clothes peasants in the gayest costumes surprised looking tourists in tall hats and linen dusters harlequins clowns devils nuns dominoes of every color red white blue black while above the balconies bloomed like a rose garden with pretty faces framed in lace veils or picturesque hats Flowers were everywhere wreathed along the house fronts tied to the horses ears in ladies hands and gentlemen s button holes while venders went up and down the street bearing great trays of violets and carnations and camellias for sale The air was full of cries and laughter and the shrill calls of merchants advertising their wares candy fruit birds lanterns and confetti the latter being merely lumps of lime large or small with a pea or a bean embedded in each lump to give it weight Boxes full of this unpleasant confection were suspended in front of each balcony with tin scoops to use in ladling it out and flinging it about Everybody wore or carried a wire mask as protection against this white incessant shower and before long the air became full of a fine dust which hung above the Corso like a mist and filled the eyes and noses and clothes of all present with irritating particles Pasquino s Car was passing underneath just as Katy and missus Ashe arrived a gorgeous affair hung with silken draperies and bearing as symbol an enormous egg in which the Carnival was supposed to be in act of incubation A huge wagon followed in its wake on which was a house some sixteen feet square whose sole occupant was a gentleman attended by five servants who kept him supplied with confetti which he showered liberally on the heads of the crowd Then came a car in the shape of a steamboat with a smoke pipe and sails over which flew the Union Jack and which was manned with a party wearing the dress of British tars The next wagon bore a company of jolly maskers equipped with many colored bladders which they banged and rattled as they went along Following this was a troupe of beautiful circus horses cream colored with scarlet trappings or sorrel with blue ridden by ladies in pale green velvet laced with silver or blue velvet and gold Another car bore a bird cage which was an exact imitation of saint Peter s within which perched a lonely old parrot This device evidently had a political signification for it was alternately hissed and applauded as it went along The whole scene was like a brilliant rapidly shifting dream and Katy as she stood with lips apart and eyes wide open with wonderment and pleasure forgot whether she was in the body or not forgot everything except what was passing before her gaze She was roused by a stinging shower of lime dust An Englishman in the next balcony had take courteous advantage of her preoccupation and had flung a scoopful of confetti in her undefended face It is generally Anglo Saxons of the less refined class English or Americans who do these things at Carnival times The national love of a rough joke comes to the surface encouraged by the license of the moment and all the grace and prettiness of the festival vanish Katy laughed and dusted herself as well as she could and took refuge behind her mask while a nimble American boy of the party changed places with her and thenceforward made that particular Englishman his special target plying such a lively and adroit shovel as to make Katy s assailant rue the hour when he evoked this national reprisal His powdered head and rather clumsy efforts to retaliate excited shouts of laughter from the adjoining balconies The young American fresh from tennis and college athletics darted about and dodged with an agility impossible to his heavily built foe and each effective shot and parry on his side was greeted with little cries of applause and the clapping of hands on the part of those who were watching the contest Exactly opposite them was a balcony hung with white silk in which sat a lady who seemed to be of some distinction for every now and then an officer in brilliant uniform or some official covered with orders and stars would be shown in by her servants bow before her with the utmost deference and after a little conversation retire kissing her gloved hand as he went The lady was a beautiful person with lustrous black eyes and dark hair over which a lace mantilla was fastened with diamond stars She wore pale blue with white flowers and altogether as Katy afterward wrote to Clover reminded her exactly of one of those beautiful princesses whom they used to play about in their childhood and quarrel over because every one of them wanted to be the Princess and nobody else I wonder who she is said missus Ashe in a low tone She might be almost anybody from her looks She keeps glancing across to us Katy Do you know I think she has taken a fancy to you Perhaps the lady had for just then she turned her head and said a word to one of her footmen who immediately placed something in her hand It was a little shining bonbonniere and rising she threw it straight at Katy Alas it struck the edge of the balcony and fell into the street below where it was picked up by a ragged little peasant girl in a red jacket who raised a pair of astonished eyes to the heavens as if sure that the gift must have fallen straight from thence Katy bent forward to watch its fate and went through a little pantomime of regret and despair for the benefit of the opposite lady who only laughed and taking another from her servant flung with better aim so that it fell exactly at Katy s feet This was a gilded box in the shape of a mandolin with sugar plums tucked cunningly away inside Katy kissed both her hands in acknowledgment for the pretty toy and tossed back a bunch of roses which she happened to be wearing in her dress After that it seemed the chief amusement of the fair unknown to throw bonbons at Katy Some went straight and some did not but before the afternoon ended Katy had quite a lapful of confections and trifles roses sugared almonds a satin casket a silvered box in the shape of a horseshoe a tiny cage with orange blossoms for birds on the perches a minute gondola with a marron glacee by way of passenger and prettiest of all a little ivory harp strung with enamelled violets instead of wires For all these favors she had nothing better to offer in return than a few long tailed bonbons with gay streamers of ribbon These the lady opposite caught very cleverly rarely missing one and kissing her hand in thanks each time Isn t she exquisite demanded Katy her eyes shining with excitement Did you ever see any one so lovely in your life Polly dear I never did There now she is buying those birds to set them free I do believe It was indeed so A vender of larks had by the aid of a long staff thrust a cage full of wretched little prisoners up into the balcony and Katy s lady as missus Ashe called her was paying for the whole As they watched she opened the cage door and with the sweetest look on her face encouraged the birds to fly away The poor little creatures cowered and hesitated not knowing at first what use to make of their new liberty but at last one the boldest of the company hopped to the door and with a glad exultant chirp flew straight upward Then the others taking courage from his example followed and all were lost to view in the twinkling of an eye Oh you angel cried Katy leaning over the edge of the balcony and kissing both hands impulsively I never saw any one so sweet as you are in my life Polly dear I think carnivals are the most perfectly bewitching things in the world How glad I am that this lasts a week and that we can come every day Won t Amy be delighted with these bonbons I do hope my lady will be here tomorrow How little she dreamed that she was never to enter that balcony again How little can any of us see what lies before us till it comes so near that we cannot help seeing it or shut our eyes or turn away The next morning almost as soon as it was light missus Ashe tapped at Katy s door She was in her dressing gown and her eyes looked large and frightened Amy is ill she cried She has been hot and feverish all night and she says that her head aches dreadfully What shall I do Katy We ought to have a doctor at once and I don t know the name even of any doctor here Katy sat up in bed and for one bewildered moment did not speak Her brain felt in a whirl of confusion but presently it cleared and she saw what to do I will write a note to missus Sands she said missus Sands was the wife of the American Minister and one of the few acquaintances they had made since they came to Rome You remember how nice she was the other day and how we liked her and she has lived here so long that of course she must know all about the doctors Don t you think that is the best thing to do The very best said missus Ashe looking relieved I wonder I did not think of it myself but I am so confused that I can t think Write the note at once please dear Katy I will ring your bell for you and then I must hurry back to Amy Katy made haste with the note The answer came promptly in half an hour and by ten o clock the physician recommended appeared doctor Hilary was a dark little Italian to all appearance but his mother had been a Scotch woman and he spoke English very well a great comfort to poor missus Ashe who knew not a word of Italian and not a great deal of French He felt Amy s pulse for a long time and tested her temperature but he gave no positive opinion only left a prescription and said that he would call later in the day and should then be able to judge more clearly what the attack was likely to prove Katy augured ill from this reserve There was no talk of going to the Carnival that afternoon no one had any heart for it Instead Katy spent the time in trying to recollect all she had ever heard about the care of sick people what was to be done first and what next and in searching the shops for a feather pillow which luxury Amy was imperiously demanding The pillows of Roman hotels are as a general thing stuffed with wool and very hard I won t have this horrid pillow any longer poor Amy was screaming It s got bricks in it It hurts the back of my neck Take it away mamma and give me a nice soft American pillow I won t have this a minute longer Don t you hear me mamma Take it away So while missus Ashe pacified Amy to the best of her ability Katy hurried out in quest of the desired pillow It proved almost an unattainable luxury but at last after a long search she secured an air cushion a down cushion about twelve inches square and one old feather pillow which had come from some auction and had apparently lain for years in the corner of the shop When this was encased in a fresh cover of Canton flannel it did very well and stilled Amy s complaints a little but all night she grew worse and when doctor Hilary came next day he was forced to utter plainly the dreaded words Roman fever Amy was in for an attack a light one he hoped it might be but they had better know the truth and make ready for it missus Ashe was utterly overwhelmed by this verdict and for the first bewildered moments did not know which way to turn Katy happily kept a steadier head She had the advantage of a little preparation of thought and had decided beforehand what it would be necessary to do in case Oh that fateful in case The doctor and she consulted together and the result was that Katy sought out the padrona of the establishment and without hinting at the nature of Amy s attack secured some rooms just vacated which were at the end of a corridor and a little removed from the rooms of other people There was a large room with corner windows a smaller one opening from it and another still smaller close by which would serve as a storeroom or might do for the use of a nurse These rooms without much consultation with missus Ashe who seemed stunned and sat with her eyes fixed on Amy just answering Certainly dear anything you say when applied to Katy had arranged according to her own ideas of comfort and hygienic necessity as learned from Miss Nightingale s excellent little book on nursing From the larger room she had the carpet curtains and nearly all the furniture taken away the floor scrubbed with hot soapsuds and the bed pulled out from the wall to allow of a free circulation of air all round it The smaller one she made as comfortable as possible for the use of missus Ashe choosing for it the softest sofa and the best mattresses that were obtainable for she knew that her friend s strength was likely to be severely tried if Amy s illness proved serious When all was ready Amy well wrapped in her coverings was carried down the entry and laid in the fresh bed with the soft pillows about her and Katy as she went to and fro conveying clothes and books and filling drawers felt that they were perhaps making arrangements for a long hard trial of faith and spirits By the next day the necessity of a nurse became apparent and in the afternoon Katy started out in a little hired carriage in search of one She had a list of names and went first to the English nurses but finding them all engaged she ordered the coachman to drive to a convent where there was hope that a nursing sister might be procured Their route lay across the Corso So utterly had the Carnival with all its gay follies vanished from her mind that she was for a moment astonished at finding herself entangled in a motley crowd so dense that the coachman was obliged to rein in his horses and stand still for some time There were the same masks and dominos the same picturesque peasant costumes which had struck her as so gay and pretty only three days before The same jests and merry laughter filled the air but somehow it all seemed out of tune The sense of cold lonely fear that had taken possession of her killed all capacity for merriment the apprehension and solicitude of which her heart was full made the gay chattering and squeaking of the crowd sound harsh and unfeeling The bright colors affronted her dejection she did not want to see them She lay back in the carriage trying to be patient under the detention and half shut her eyes A shower of lime dust aroused her It came from a party of burly figures in white cotton dominos whose carriage had been stayed by the crowd close to her own She signified by gestures that she had no confetti and no protection that she was not playing in fact but her appeal made no difference The maskers kept on shovelling lime all over her hair and person and the carriage and never tired of the sport till an opportune break in the procession enabled their vehicle to move on Katy was shaking their largesse from her dress and parasol as well as she could when an odd gibbering sound close to her ear and the laughter of the crowd attracted her attention to the back of the carriage A masker attired as a scarlet devil had climbed into the hood and was now perched close behind her She shook her head at him but he only shook his in return and chattered and grimaced and bent over till his fiery mask almost grazed her shoulder There was no hope but in good humor as she speedily realized and recollecting that in her shopping bag one or two of the Carnival bonbons still remained she took these out and offered them in the hope of propitiating him The fiend bit one to insure that it was made of sugar and not lime while the crowd laughed more than ever then seeming satisfied he made Katy a little speech in rapid Italian of which she did not comprehend a word kissed her hand jumped down from the carriage and disappeared in the crowd to her great relief Presently after that the driver spied an opening of which he took advantage They were across the Corso now the roar and rush of the Carnival dying into silence as they drove rapidly on and Katy as she finished wiping away the last of the lime dust wiped some tears from her cheeks as well How hateful it all was she said to herself Then she remembered a sentence read somewhere How heavily roll the wheels of other people s joys when your heart is sorrowful and she realized that it is true The convent was propitious and promised to send a sister next morning with the proviso that every second day she was to come back to sleep and rest Katy was too thankful for any aid to make objections and drove home with visions of saintly nuns with pure pale faces full of peace and resignation such as she had read of in books floating before her eyes Sister Ambrogia when she appeared next day did not exactly realize these imaginations She was a plump little person with rosy cheeks a pair of demure black eyes and a very obstinate mouth and chin It soon appeared that natural inclination combined with the rules of her convent made her theory of a nurse s duties a very limited one If missus Ashe wished her to go down to the office with an order she was told We sisters care for the sick we are not allowed to converse with porters and hotel people If Katy suggested that on the way home she should leave a prescription at the chemist s it was We sisters are for nursing only we do not visit shops And when she was asked if she could make beef tea she replied calmly but decisively We sisters are not cooks In fact all that Sister Ambrogia seemed able or willing to do beyond the bathing of Amy s face and brushing her hair which she accomplished handily was to sit by the bedside telling her rosary or plying a little ebony shuttle in the manufacture of a long strip of tatting Even this amount of usefulness was interfered with by the fact that Amy who by this time was in a semi delirious condition had taken an aversion to her at the first glance and was not willing to be left with her for a single moment I won t stay here alone with Sister Embroidery she would cry if her mother and Katy went into the next room for a moment s rest or a private consultation I hate Sister Embroidery Come back mamma come back this moment She s making faces at me and chattering just like an old parrot and I don t understand a word she says Take Sister Embroidery away mamma I tell you Don t you hear me Come back I say The little voice would be raised to a shrill scream and missus Ashe and Katy hurrying back would find Amy sitting up on her pillow with wet scarlet flushed cheeks and eyes bright with fever ready to throw herself out of bed while calm as Mabel whose curly head lay on the pillow beside her little mistress Sister Ambrogia unaware of the intricacies of the English language was placidly telling her beads and muttering prayers to herself Some of these prayers I do not doubt related to Amy s recovery if not to her conversion and were well meant but they were rather irritating under the circumstances CHAPTER X CLEAR SHINING AFTER RAIN When the first shock is over and the inevitable realized and accepted those who tend a long illness are apt to fall into a routine of life which helps to make the days seem short The apparatus of nursing is got together Every day the same things need to be done at the same hours and in the same way Each little appliance is kept at hand and sad and tired as the watchers may be the very monotony and regularity of their proceedings give a certain stay for their thoughts to rest upon But there was little of this monotony to help missus Ashe and Katy through with Amy s illness Small chance was there for regularity or exact system for something unexpected was always turning up and needful things were often lacking The most ordinary comforts of the sick room or what are considered so in America were hard to come by and much of Katy s time was spent in devising substitutes to take their places Was ice needed A pailful of dirty snow would be brought in full of straws sticks and other refuse which had apparently been scraped from the surface of the street after a frosty night Not a particle of it could be put into milk or water all that could be done was to make the pail serve the purpose of a refrigerator and set bowls and tumblers in it to chill Was a feeding cup wanted It came of a cumbrous and antiquated pattern which the infant Hercules may have enjoyed but which the modern Amy abominated and rejected Such a thing as a glass tube could not be found in all Rome Bed rests were unknown Katy searched in vain for an India rubber hot water bag But the greatest trial of all was the beef tea It was Amy s sole food and almost her only medicine for doctor Hilary believed in leaving Nature pretty much to herself in cases of fever The kitchen of the hotel sent up under that name a mixture of grease and hot water which could not be given to Amy at all In vain Katy remonstrated and explained the process In vain did she go to the kitchen herself to translate a carefully written recipe to the cook and to slip a shining five franc piece in his hand which it was hoped would quicken his energies and soften his heart In vain did she order private supplies of the best of beef from a separate market The cooks stole the beef and ignored the recipe and day after day the same bottle full of greasy liquid came upstairs which Amy would not touch and which would have done her no good had she swallowed it all At last driven to desperation Katy procured a couple of stout bottles and every morning slowly and carefully cut up two pounds of meat into small pieces sealed the bottle with her own seal ring and sent it down to be boiled for a specified time This answered better for the thieving cook dared not tamper with her seal but it was a long and toilsome process and consumed more time than she well knew how to spare for there were continual errands to be done which no one could attend to but herself and the interminable flights of stairs taxed her strength painfully and seemed to grow longer and harder every day At last a good Samaritan turned up in the shape of an American lady with a house of her own who hearing of their plight from missus Sands undertook to send each day a supply of strong perfectly made beef tea from her own kitchen for Amy s use It was an inexpressible relief and the lightening of this one particular care made all the rest seem easier of endurance Another great relief came when after some delay doctor Hilary succeeded in getting an English nurse to take the places of the unsatisfactory Sister Ambrogia and her substitute Sister Agatha whom Amy in her half comprehending condition persisted in calling Sister Nutmeg Grater missus Swift was a tall wiry angular person who seemed made of equal parts of iron and whalebone She was never tired she could lift anybody do anything and for sleep she seemed to have a sort of antipathy preferring to sit in an easy chair and drop off into little dozes whenever it was convenient to going regularly to bed for a night s rest Amy took to her from the first and the new nurse managed her beautifully No one else could soothe her half so well during the delirious period when the little shrill voice seemed never to be still and went on all day and all night in alternate raving or screaming or what was saddest of all to hear low pitiful moans There was no shutting in these sounds People moved out of the rooms below and on either side because they could get no sleep and till the arrival of Nurse Swift there was no rest for poor missus Ashe who could not keep away from her darling for a moment while that mournful wailing sounded in her ears Somehow the long dry Englishwoman seemed to have a mesmeric effect on Amy who was never quite so violent after she arrived Katy was more thankful for this than can well be told for her great underlying dread a dread she dared not whisper plainly even to herself was that Polly dear might break down before Amy was better and then what should they do She took every care that was possible of her friend She made her eat she made her lie down She forced daily doses of quinine and port wine down her throat and saved her every possible step But no one however affectionate and willing could do much to lift the crushing burden of care which was changing missus Ashe s rosy fairness to wan pallor and laying such dark shadows under the pretty gray eyes She had taken small thought of looks since Amy s illness All the little touches which had made her toilette becoming all the crimps and fluffs had disappeared yet somehow never had she seemed to Katy half so lovely as now in the plain black gown which she wore all day long with her hair tucked into a knot behind her ears Her real beauty of feature and outline seemed only enhanced by the rigid plainness of her attire and the charm of true expression grew in her face Never had Katy admired and loved her friend so well as during those days of fatigue and wearing suspense or realized so strongly the worth of her sweetness of temper her unselfishness and power of devoting herself to other people Polly bears it wonderfully she wrote her father she was all broken down for the first day or two but now her courage and patience are surprising When I think how precious Amy is to her and how lonely her life would be if she were to die I can hardly keep the tears out of my eyes But Polly does not cry She is quiet and brave and almost cheerful all the time keeping herself busy with what needs to be done she never complains and she looks oh so pretty I think I never knew how much she had in her before All this time no word had come from Lieutenant Worthington His sister had written him as soon as Amy was taken ill and had twice telegraphed since but no answer had been received and this strange silence added to the sense of lonely isolation and distance from home and help which those who encounter illness in a foreign land have to bear So first one week and then another wore themselves away somehow The fever did not break on the fourteenth day as had been hoped and must run for another period the doctor said but its force was lessened and he considered that a favorable sign Amy was quieter now and did not rave so constantly but she was very weak All her pretty hair had been shorn away which made her little face look tiny and sharp Mabel s golden wig was sacrificed at the same time Amy had insisted upon it and they dared not cross her She has got a fever too and it s a great deal badder than mine is she protested Her cheeks are as hot as fire She ought to have ice on her head and how can she when her bang is so thick Cut it all off every bit and then I will let you cut mine You had better give ze child her way said doctor Hilary She s in no state to be fretted with triffles trifles the doctor meant and in ze end it will be well for ze fever infection might harbor in zat doll s head as well as elsewhere and I should have to disinfect it which would be bad for ze skin of her She isn t a doll cried Amy overhearing him she s my child and you sha n t call her names She hugged Mabel tight in her arms and glared at doctor Hilary defiantly So Katy with pitiful fingers slashed away at Mabel s blond wig till her head was as bare as a billiard ball and Amy quite content patted her child while her own locks were being cut and murmured Perhaps your hair will all come out in little round curls darling as Johnnie Carr s did then she fell into one of the quietest sleeps she had yet had It was the day after this that Katy coming in from a round of errands found missus Ashe standing erect and pale with a frightened look in her eyes and her back against Amy s door as if defending it from somebody Confronting her was Madame Frulini the padrona of the hotel Madame s cheeks were red and her eyes bright and fierce she was evidently in a rage about something and was pouring out a torrent of excited Italian with now and then a French or English word slipped in by way of punctuation and all so rapidly that only a trained ear could have followed or grasped her meaning What is the matter asked Katy in amazement Oh Katy I am so glad you have come cried poor missus Ashe I can hardly understand a word that this horrible woman says but I think she wants to turn us out of the hotel and that we shall take Amy to some other place It would be the death of her I know it would I never never will go unless the doctor says it is safe I oughtn t to I couldn t she can t make me can she Katy Madame said Katy and there was a flash in her eyes before which the landlady rather shrank what is all this Why do you come to trouble madame while her child is so ill Then came another torrent of explanation which didn t explain but Katy gathered enough of the meaning to make out that missus Ashe was quite correct in her guess and that Madame Frulini was requesting nay insisting that they should remove Amy from the hotel at once There were plenty of apartments to be had now that the Carnival was over she said her own cousin had rooms close by it could easily be arranged and people were going away from the Del Mondo every day because there was fever in the house Such a thing could not be it should not be the landlady s voice rose to a shriek the child must go You are a cruel woman said Katy indignantly when she had grasped the meaning of the outburst It is wicked it is cowardly to come thus and attack a poor lady under your roof who has so much already to bear It is her only child who is lying in there her only one do you understand madame and she is a widow What you ask might kill the child I shall not permit you or any of your people to enter that door till the doctor comes and then I shall tell him how you have behaved and we shall see what he will say As she spoke she turned the key of Amy s door took it out and put it in her pocket then faced the padrona steadily looking her straight in the eyes Mademoiselle stormed the landlady I give you my word four people have left this house already because of the noises made by little miss More will go I shall lose my winter s profit all of it all it will be said there is fever at the Del Mondo no one will hereafter come to me There are lodgings plenty comfortable oh so comfortable I will not have my season ruined by a sickness no I will not Madame Frulini s voice was again rising to a scream Be silent said Katy sternly you will frighten the child I am sorry that you should lose any customers madame but the fever is here and we are here and here we must stay till it is safe to go The child shall not be moved till the doctor gives permission Money is not the only thing in the world missus Ashe will pay anything that is fair to make up your losses to you but you must leave this room now and not return till doctor Hilary is here Where Katy found French for all these long coherent speeches she could never afterward imagine She tried to explain it by saying that excitement inspired her for the moment but that as soon as the moment was over the inspiration died away and left her as speechless and confused as ever Clover said it made her think of the miracle of Balaam and Katy merrily rejoined that it might be so and that no donkey in any age of the world could possibly have been more grateful than was she for the sudden gift of speech But it is not the money it is my prestige declared the landlady Thank Heaven here is the doctor now cried missus Ashe The doctor had in fact been standing in the doorway for several moments before they noticed him and had overheard part of the colloquy with Madame Frulini With him was some one else at the sight of whom missus Ashe gave a great sob of relief It was her brother at last When Italian meets Italian then comes the tug of expletive It did not seem to take one second for doctor Hilary to whirl the padrona out into the entry where they could be heard going at each other like two furious cats Hiss roll sputter recrimination objurgation In five minutes Madame Frulini was metaphorically speaking on her knees and the doctor standing over her with drawn sword making her take back every word she had said and every threat she had uttered Prestige of thy miserable hotel he thundered where will that be when I go and tell the English and Americans all of whom I know every one how thou hast served a countrywoman of theirs in thy house Dost thou think thy prestige will help thee much when doctor Hilary has fixed a black mark on thy door I tell thee no not a stranger shalt thou have next year to eat so much as a plate of macaroni under thy base roof I will advertise thy behavior in all the foreign papers in Figaro in Galignani in the Swiss Times and the English one which is read by all the nobility and the Heraldo of New York which all Americans peruse Oh doctor pardon me I regret what I said I am afflicted I will post thee in the railroad stations continued the doctor implacably I will bid my patients to write letters to all their friends warning them against thy flea ridden Del Mondo I will apprise the steamboat companies at Genoa and Naples Thou shalt see what comes of it truly thou shalt see Having thus reduced Madame Frulini to powder the doctor now condescended to take breath and listen to her appeals for mercy and presently he brought her in with her mouth full of protestations and apologies and assurances that the ladies had mistaken her meaning she had only spoken for the good of all nothing was further from her intention than that they should be disturbed or offended in any way and she and all her household were at the service of the little sick angel of God After which the doctor dismissed her with an air of contemptuous tolerance and laid his hand on the door of Amy s room Behold it was locked Oh I forgot cried Katy laughing and she pulled the key out of her pocket You are a hee roine mademoiselle said doctor Hilary I watched you as you faced that tigress and your eyes were like a swordsman s as he regards his enemy s rapier Oh she was so brave and such a help said missus Ashe kissing her impulsively You can t think how she has stood by me all through Ned or what a comfort she has been Yes I can said Ned Worthington with a warm grateful look at Katy I can believe anything good of Miss Carr But where have you been all this time said Katy who felt this flood of compliment to be embarrassing we have so wondered at not hearing from you I have been off on a ten days leave to Corsica for moufflon shooting replied mister Worthington I only got Polly s telegrams and letters day before yesterday and I came away as soon as I could get my leave extended It was a most unlucky absence I shall always regret it Oh it is all right now that you have come his sister said leaning her head on his arm with a look of relief and rest which was good to see Everything will go better now I am sure Katy Carr has behaved like a perfect angel she told her brother when they were alone She is a trump of a girl I came in time for part of that scene with the landlady and upon my word she was glorious I didn t suppose she could look so handsome Have the Pages left Nice yet asked his sister rather irrelevantly No at least they were there on Thursday but I think that they were to start to day mister Worthington answered carelessly but his face darkened as he spoke There had been a little scene in Nice which he could not forget He was sitting in the English garden with Lilly and her mother when his sister s telegrams were brought to him and he had read them aloud partly as an explanation for the immediate departure which they made necessary and which broke up an excursion just arranged with the ladies for the afternoon It is not pleasant to have plans interfered with and as neither missus Page nor her daughter cared personally for little Amy it is not strange that disappointment at the interruption of their pleasure should have been the first impulse with them Still this did not excuse Lilly s unstudied exclamation of Oh bother and though she speedily repented it as an indiscretion and was properly sympathetic and hoped the poor little thing would soon be better Amy s uncle could not forget the jarring impression It completed a process of disenchantment which had long been going on and as hearts are sometimes caught at the rebound missus Ashe was not so far astray when she built certain little dim sisterly hopes on his evident admiration for Katy s courage and this sudden awakening to a sense of her good looks But no space was left for sentiment or match making while still Amy s fate hung in the balance and all three of them found plenty to do during the next fortnight The fever did not turn on the twenty first day and another weary week of suspense set in each day bringing a decrease of the dangerous symptoms but each day as well marking a lessening in the childish strength which had been so long and severely tested Amy was quite conscious now and lay quietly sleeping a great deal and speaking seldom There was not much to do but to wait and hope but the flame of hope burned low at times as the little life flickered in its socket and seemed likely to go out like a wind blown torch Now and then Lieutenant Worthington would persuade his sister to go with him for a few minutes drive or walk in the fresh air from which she had so long been debarred and once or twice he prevailed on Katy to do the same but neither of them could bear to be away long from Amy s bedside Intimacy grows fast when people are thus united by a common anxiety sharing the same hopes and fears day after day speaking and thinking of the same thing The gay young officer at Nice who had counted so little in Katy s world seemed to have disappeared and the gentle considerate tender hearted fellow who now filled his place was quite a different person in her eyes Katy began to count on Ned Worthington as a friend who could be trusted for help and sympathy and comprehension and appealed to and relied upon in all emergencies She was quite at ease with him now and asked him to do this and that to come and help her or to absent himself as freely as if he had been Dorry or Phil He on his part found this easy intimacy charming In the reaction of his temporary glamour for the pretty Lilly Katy s very difference from her was an added attraction This difference consisted as much as anything else in the fact that she was so truly in earnest in what she said and did Had Lilly been in Katy s place she would probably have been helpful to missus Ashe and kind to Amy so far as in her lay but the thought of self would have tinctured all that she did and said and the need of keeping to what was tasteful and becoming would have influenced her in every emergency and never have been absent from her mind Katy on the contrary absorbed in the needs of the moment gave little heed to how she looked or what any one was thinking about her Her habit of neatness made her take time for the one thorough daily dressing the brushing of hair and freshening of clothes which were customary with her but this tax paid to personal comfort she gave little further heed to appearances She wore an old gray gown day in and day out which Lilly would not have put on for half an hour without a large bribe so unbecoming was it but somehow Lieutenant Worthington grew to like the gray gown as a part of Katy herself And if by chance he brought a rose in to cheer the dim stillness of the sick room and she tucked it into her buttonhole immediately it was as though she were decked for conquest Pretty dresses are very pretty on pretty people they certainly play an important part in this queer little world of ours but depend upon it dear girls no woman ever has established so distinct and clear a claim on the regard of her lover as when he has ceased to notice or analyze what she wears and just accepts it unquestioningly whatever it is as a bit of the dear human life which has grown or is growing to be the best and most delightful thing in the world to him The gray gown played its part during the long anxious night when they all sat watching breathlessly to see which way the tide would turn with dear little Amy The doctor came at midnight and went away to come again at dawn missus Swift sat grim and watchful beside the pillow of her charge rising now and then to feel pulse and skin or to put a spoonful of something between Amy s lips The doors and windows stood open to admit the air In the outer room all was hushed A dim Roman lamp fed with olive oil burned in one corner behind a screen missus Ashe lay on the sofa with her eyes closed bearing the strain of suspense in absolute silence Her brother sat beside her holding in his one of the hot hands whose nervous twitches alone told of the surgings of hope and fear within Katy was resting in a big chair near by her wistful eyes fixed on Amy s little figure seen in the dim distance her ears alert for every sound from the sick room So they watched and waited Now and then Ned Worthington or Katy would rise softly steal on tiptoe to the bedside and come back to whisper to missus Ashe that Amy had stirred or that she seemed to be asleep It was one of the nights which do not come often in a lifetime and which people never forget The darkness seems full of meaning the hush of sound God is beyond holding the sunrise in his right hand holding the sun of our earthly hopes as well will it dawn in sorrow or in joy We dare not ask we can only wait A faint stir of wind and a little broadening of the light roused Katy from a trance of half understood thoughts She crept once more into Amy s room missus Swift laid a warning finger on her lips Amy was sleeping she said with a gesture Katy whispered the news to the still figure on the sofa then she went noiselessly out of the room The great hotel was fast asleep not a sound stirred the profound silence of the dark halls A longing for fresh air led her to the roof There was the dawn just tingeing the east The sky even thus early wore the deep mysterious blue of Italy A fresh tramontana was blowing and made Katy glad to draw her shawl about her Far away in the distance rose the Alban Hills above the dim Campagna with the more lofty Sabines beyond and Soracte clear cut against the sky like a wave frozen in the moment of breaking Below lay the ancient city with its strange mingling of the old and the new of past things embedded in the present or is it the present thinly veiling the rich and mighty past who shall say Faint rumblings of wheels and here and there a curl of smoke showed that Rome was waking up The light insensibly grew upon the darkness A pink flush lit up the horizon Florio stirred in his lair stretched his dappled limbs and as the first sun ray glinted on the roof raised himself crossed the gravelled tiles with soundless feet and ran his soft nose into Katy s hand She fondled him for Amy s sake as she stood bent over the flower boxes inhaling the scent of the mignonette and gilly flowers with her eyes fixed on the distance but her heart was at home with the sleepers there and a rush of strong desire stirred her Would this dreary time come to an end presently and should they be set at liberty to go their ways with no heavy sorrow to press them down to be care free and happy again in their own land A footstep startled her Ned Worthington was coming over the roof on tiptoe as if fearful of disturbing somebody His face looked resolute and excited I wanted to tell you he said in a hushed voice that the doctor is here and he says Amy has no fever and with care may be considered out of danger Thank God cried Katy bursting into tears The long fatigue the fears kept in check so resolutely the sleepless night just passed had their revenge now and she cried and cried as if she could never stop but with all the time such joy and gratitude in her heart She was conscious that Ned had his arm round her and was holding both her hands tight but they were so one in the emotion of the moment that it did not seem strange How sweet the sun looks she said presently releasing herself with a happy smile flashing through her tears it hasn t seemed really bright for ever so long How silly I was to cry Where is dear Polly I must go down to her at once Oh what does she say CHAPTER XI NEXT Lieut Worthington s leave had nearly expired He must rejoin his ship but he waited till the last possible moment in order to help his sister through the move to Albano where it had been decided that Amy should go for a few days of hill air before undertaking the longer journey to Florence It was a perfect morning in late March when the pale little invalid was carried in her uncle s strong arms and placed in the carriage which was to take them to the old town on the mountain slopes which they had seen shining from far away for so many weeks past Spring had come in her fairest shape to Italy The Campagna had lost its brown and tawny hues and taken on a tinge of fresher color The olive orchards were budding thickly Almond boughs extended their dazzling shapes across the blue sky Arums and acanthus and ivy filled every hollow roses nodded from over every gate while a carpet of violets and cyclamen and primroses stretched over the fields and freighted every wandering wind with fragrance When once the Campagna with its long line of aqueducts arches and hoary tombs was left behind and the carriage slowly began to mount the gradual rises of the hill Amy revived With every breath of the fresher air her eyes seemed to brighten and her voice to grow stronger She held Mabel up to look at the view and the sound of her laugh faint and feeble as it was was like music to her mother s ears Amy wore a droll little silk lined cap on her head over which a downy growth of pale brown fuzz was gradually thickening Already it showed a tendency to form into tiny rings which to Amy who had always hankered for curls was an extreme satisfaction Strange to say the same thing exactly had happened to Mabel her hair had grown out into soft little round curls also Uncle Ned and Katy had ransacked Rome for this baby wig which filled and realized all Amy s hopes for her child On the same excursion they had bought the materials for the pretty spring suit which Mabel wore for it had been deemed necessary to sacrifice most of her wardrobe as a concession to possible fever germs Amy admired the pearl colored dress and hat the fringed jacket and little lace trimmed parasol so much that she was quite consoled for the loss of the blue velvet costume and ermine muff which had been the pride of her heart ever since they left Paris and whose destruction they had scarcely dared to confess to her So up up up they climbed till the gateway of the old town was passed and the carriage stopped before a quaint building once the residence of the Bishop of Albano but now known as the Hotel de la Poste Here they alighted and were shown up a wide and lofty staircase to their rooms which were on the sunny side of the house and looked across a walled garden where roses and lemon trees grew beside old fountains guarded by sculptured lions and heathen divinities with broken noses and a scant supply of fingers and toes to the Campagna purple with distance and stretching miles and miles away to where Rome sat on her seven hills lifting high the Dome of saint Peter s into the illumined air Nurse Swift said that Amy must go to bed at once and have a long rest But Amy nearly wept at the proposal and declared that she was not a bit tired and couldn t sleep if she went to bed ever so much The change of air had done her good already and she looked more like herself than for many weeks past They compromised their dispute on a sofa where Amy well wrapped up was laid and where in spite of her protestations she presently fell asleep leaving the others free to examine and arrange their new quarters Such enormous rooms as they were It was quite a journey to go from one side of them to another The floors were of stone with squares of carpet laid down over them which looked absurdly small for the great spaces they were supposed to cover The beds and tables were of the usual size but they seemed almost like doll furniture because the chambers were so big A quaint old paper with an enormous pattern of banyan trees and pagodas covered the walls and every now and then betrayed by an oblong of regular cracks the existence of a hidden door papered to look exactly like the rest of the wall These mysterious doors made Katy nervous and she never rested till she had opened every one of them and explored the places they led to One gave access to a queer little bathroom Another led through a narrow dark passage to a sort of balcony or loggia overhanging the garden A third ended in a dusty closet with an artful chink in it from which you could peep into what had been the Bishop s drawing room but which was now turned into the dining room of the hotel It seemed made for purposes of espial and Katy had visions of a long line of reverend prelates with their ears glued to the chink overhearing what was being said about them in the apartment beyond The most surprising of all she did not discover till she was going to bed on the second night after their arrival when she thought she knew all about the mysterious doors and what they led to A little unexplained draught of wind made her candle flicker and betrayed the existence of still another door so cunningly hid in the wall pattern that she had failed to notice it She had quite a creepy feeling as she drew her dressing gown about her took a light and entered the narrow passage into which it opened It was not a long passage and ended presently in a tiny oratory There was a little marble altar with a kneeling step and candlesticks and a great crucifix above Ends of wax candles still remained in the candlesticks and bunches of dusty paper flowers filled the vases which stood on either side of them A faded silk cushion lay on the step Doubtless the Bishop had often knelt there Katy felt as if she were the first person to enter the place since he went away Her common sense told her that in a hotel bedroom constantly occupied by strangers for years past some one must have discovered the door and found the little oratory before her but common sense is sometimes less satisfactory than romance Katy liked to think that she was the first and to make believe that no one else knew about it so she did so and invented legends about the place which Amy considered better than any fairy story Before he left them Lieutenant Worthington had a talk with his sister in the garden She rather forced this talk upon him for various things were lying at her heart about which she longed for explanation but he yielded so easily to her wiles that it was evident he was not averse to the idea Come Polly don t beat about the bush any longer he said at last amused and a little irritated at her half hints and little feminine finesses I know what you want to ask and as there s no use making a secret of it I will take my turn in asking Have I any chance do you think Any chance about Katy do you mean Oh Ned you make me so happy Yes about her of course I don t see why you should say of course remarked his sister with the perversity of her sex when it s only five or six weeks ago that I was lying awake at night for fear you were being gobbled up by that Lilly Page There was a little risk of it replied her brother seriously She s awfully pretty and she dances beautifully and the other fellows were all wild about her and well you know yourself how such things go I can t see now what it was that I fancied so much about her I don t suppose I could have told exactly at the time but I can tell without the smallest trouble what it is in the other In Katy I should think so cried missus Ashe emphatically the two are no more to be compared than than well bread and syllabub You can live on one and you can t live on the other Come now Miss Page isn t so bad as that She is a nice girl enough and a pretty girl too prettier than Katy I m not so far gone that I can t see that But we won t talk about her she s not in the present question at all very likely she d have had nothing to say to me in any case I was only one out of a dozen and she never gave me reason to suppose that she cared more for me than the rest Let us talk about this friend of yours have I any chance at all do you think Polly Ned you are the dearest boy I would rather have Katy for a sister than any one else I know She s so nice all through so true and sweet and satisfactory She is all that and more she s a woman to tie to for life to be perfectly sure of always She would make a splendid wife for any man I m not half good enough for her but the question is and you haven t answered it yet Polly what s my chance I don t know said his sister slowly Then I must ask herself and I shall do so to day I don t know repeated missus Ashe She is a woman therefore to be won and I don t think there is any one ahead of you that is the best hope I have to offer Ned Katy never talks of such things and though she s so frank I can t guess whether or not she ever thinks about them She likes you however I am sure of that But Ned it will not be wise to say anything to her yet Not say anything Why not No Recollect that it is only a little while since she looked upon you as the admirer of another girl and a girl she doesn t like very much though they are cousins You must give her time to get over that impression Wait awhile that s my advice Ned I ll wait any time if only she will say yes in the end But it s hard to go away without a word of hope and it s more like a man to speak out it seems to me It s too soon persisted his sister You don t want her to think you a fickle fellow falling in love with a fresh girl every time you go into port and falling out again when the ship sails Sailors have a bad reputation for that sort of thing No woman cares to win a man like that Great Scott I should think not Do you mean to say that is the way my conduct appears to her Polly No I don t mean just that but wait dear Ned I am sure it is better Fortified by this sage counsel Lieutenant Worthington went away next morning without saying anything to Katy in words though perhaps eyes and tones may have been less discreet He made them promise that some one should send a letter every day about Amy and as missus Ashe frequently devolved the writing of these bulletins upon Katy and the replies came in the shape of long letters she found herself conducting a pretty regular correspondence without quite intending it Ned Worthington wrote particularly nice letters He had the knack more often found in women than men of giving a picture with a few graphic touches and indicating what was droll or what was characteristic with a single happy phrase His letters grew to be one of Katy s pleasures and sometimes as missus Ashe watched the color deepen in her cheeks while she read her heart would bound hopefully within her But she was a wise woman in her way and she wanted Katy for a sister very much so she never said a word or looked a look to startle or surprise her but left the thing to work itself out which is the best course always in love affairs Little Amy s improvement at Albano was something remarkable missus Swift watched over her like a lynx Her vigilance never relaxed Amy was made to eat and sleep and walk and rest with the regularity of a machine and this exact system combined with the good air worked like a charm The little one gained hour by hour They could absolutely see her growing fat her mother declared Fevers when they do not kill operate sometimes as spring bonfires do in gardens burning up all the refuse and leaving the soil free for the growth of fairer things and Amy promised in time to be only the better and stronger for her hard experience She had gained so much before the time came to start for Florence that they scarcely dreaded the journey but it proved worse than their expectations They had not been able to secure a carriage to themselves and were obliged to share their compartment with two English ladies and three Roman Catholic priests one old the others young The older priest seemed to be a person of some consequence for quite a number of people came to see him off and knelt for his blessing devoutly as the train moved away The younger ones Katy guessed to be seminary students under his charge Her chief amusement through the long dusty journey was in watching the terrible time that one of these young men was having with his own hat It was a large three cornered black affair with sharp angles and excessively stiff and a perpetual struggle seemed to be going on between it and its owner who was evidently unhappy when it was on his head and still more unhappy when it was anywhere else If he perched it on his knees it was sure to slide away from him and fall with a thump on the floor whereupon he would pick it up blushing furiously as he did so Then he would lay it on the seat when the train stopped at a station and jump out with an air of relief but he invariably forgot and sat down upon it when he returned and sprang up with a look of horror at the loud crackle it made after which he would tuck it into the baggage rack overhead from which it would presently descend generally into the lap of one of the staid English ladies who would hand it back to him with an air of deep offence remarking to her companion I never knew anything like it Fancy that makes four times that hat has fallen on me The young man is a feedgit He s the most feegitty creature I ever saw in my life The young seminariat did not understand a word she said but the tone needed no interpreter and set him to blushing more painfully than ever Altogether the hat was never off his mind for a moment Katy could see that he was thinking about it even when he was thumbing his Breviary and making believe to read At last the train steaming down the valley of the Arno revealed fair Florence sitting among olive clad hills with Giotto s beautiful Bell tower and the great many colored soft hued Cathedral and the square tower of the old Palace and the quaint bridges over the river looking exactly as they do in the photographs and Katy would have felt delighted in spite of dust and fatigue had not Amy looked so worn out and exhausted They were seriously troubled about her and for the moment could think of nothing else Happily the fatigue did no permanent harm and a day or two of rest made her all right again By good fortune a nice little apartment in the modern quarter of the city had been vacated by its winter occupants the very day of their arrival and missus Ashe secured it for a month with all its conveniences and advantages including a maid named Maria who had been servant to the just departed tenants Maria was a very tall woman at least six feet two and had a splendid contralto voice which she occasionally exercised while busy over her pots and pans It was so remarkable to hear these grand arias and recitatives proceeding from a kitchen some eight feet square that Katy was at great pains to satisfy her curiosity about it By aid of the dictionary and much persistent questioning she made out that Maria in her youth had received a partial training for the opera but in the end it was decided that she was too big and heavy for the stage and the poor giantess as Amy named her had been forced to abandon her career and gradually had sunk to the position of a maid of all work Katy suspected that heaviness of mind as well as of body must have stood in her way for Maria though a good natured giantess was by no means quick of intelligence I do think that the manner in which people over here can make homes for themselves at five minutes notice is perfectly delightful cried Katy at the end of their first day s housekeeping I wish we could do the same in America How cosy it looks here already It was indeed cosy Their new domain consisted of a parlor in a corner furnished in bright yellow brocade with windows to south and west a nice little dining room three bedrooms with dimity curtained beds a square entrance hall lighted at night by a tall slender brass lamp whose double wicks were fed with olive oil and the aforesaid tiny kitchen behind which was a sleeping cubby quite too small to be a good fit for the giantess The rooms were full of conveniences easy chairs sofas plenty of bureaus and dressing tables and corner fireplaces like Franklin stoves in which odd little fires burned on cool days made of pine cones cakes of pressed sawdust exactly like Boston brown bread cut into slices and a few sticks of wood thriftily adjusted for fuel is worth its weight in gold in Florence Katy s was the smallest of the bedrooms but she liked it best of all for the reason that its one big window opened on an iron balcony over which grew a Banksia rose vine with a stem as thick as her wrist It was covered just now with masses of tiny white blossoms whose fragrance was inexpressibly delicious and made every breath drawn in their neighborhood a delight The sun streamed in on all sides of the little apartment which filled a narrowing angle at the union of three streets and from one window and another glimpses could be caught of the distant heights about the city San Miniato in one direction Bellosguardo in another and for the third the long olive hung ascent of Fiesole crowned by its gray cathedral towers It was astonishing how easily everything fell into train about the little establishment Every morning at six the English baker left two small sweet brown loaves and a dozen rolls at the door Then followed the dairyman with a supply of tiny leaf shaped pats of freshly churned butter a big flask of milk and two small bottles of thick cream with a twist of vine leaf in each by way of a cork Next came a contadino with a flask of red Chianti wine a film of oil floating on top to keep it sweet People in Florence must drink wine whether they like it or not because the lime impregnated water is unsafe for use without some admixture Dinner came from a trattoria in a tin box with a pan of coals inside to keep it warm which box was carried on a man s head It was furnished at a fixed price per day a soup two dishes of meat two vegetables and a sweet dish and the supply was so generous as always to leave something toward next day s luncheon Salad fruit and fresh eggs Maria bought for them in the old market From the confectioners came loaves of pane santo a sort of light cake made with arrowroot instead of flour and sometimes by way of treat a square of pan forte da Siena compounded of honey almonds and chocolate a mixture as pernicious as it is delicious and which might take a medal anywhere for the sure production of nightmares Amy soon learned to know the shops from which these delicacies came She had her favorites too among the strolling merchants who sold oranges and those little sweet native figs dried in the sun without sugar which are among the specialties of Florence They in their turn learned to know her and to watch for the appearance of her little capped head and Mabel s blond wig at the window lingering about till she came and advertising their wares with musical modulations so appealing that Amy was always running to Katy who acted as housekeeper to beg her to please buy this or that because it is my old man and he wants me to so much But chicken we have plenty of figs for to day No matter get some more please do I ll eat them all really I will And Amy was as good as her word Her convalescent appetite was something prodigious There was another branch of shopping in which they all took equal delight The beauty and the cheapness of the Florence flowers are a continual surprise to a stranger Every morning after breakfast an old man came creaking up the two long flights of stairs which led to missus Ashe s apartment tapped at the door and as soon as it opened inserted a shabby elbow and a large flat basket full of flowers Such flowers Great masses of scarlet and cream colored tulips and white and gold narcissus knots of roses of all shades carnations heavy headed trails of wistaria wild hyacinths violets deep crimson and orange ranunculus giglios or wild irises the Florence emblem so deeply purple as to be almost black anemones spring beauties faintly tinted wood blooms tied in large loose nosegays ivy fruit blossoms everything that can be thought of that is fair and sweet These enticing wares the old man would tip out on the table missus Ashe and Katy would select what they wanted and then the process of bargaining would begin without which no sale is complete in Italy The old man would name an enormous price five times as much as he hoped to get Katy would offer a very small one considerably less than she expected to give The old man would dance with dismay wring his hands assure them that he should die of hunger and all his family with him if he took less than the price named he would then come down half a franc in his demand So it would go on for five minutes ten sometimes for a quarter of an hour the old man s price gradually descending and Katy s terms very slowly going up a cent or two at a time Next the giantess would mingle with the fray She would bounce out of her kitchen berate the flower vender snatch up his flowers declare that they smelt badly fling them down again pouring out all the while a voluble tirade of reproaches and revilings and looking so enormous in her excitement that Katy wondered that the old man dared to answer her at all Finally there would be a sudden lull The old man would shrug his shoulders and remarking that he and his wife and his aged grandmother must go without bread that day since it was the Signora s will take the money offered and depart leaving such a mass of flowers behind him that Katy would begin to think that they had paid an unfair price for them and to feel a little rueful till she observed that the old man was absolutely dancing downstairs with rapture over the good bargain he had made and that Maria was black with indignation over the extravagance of her ladies The Americani are a nation of spend thrifts she would mutter to herself as she quickened the charcoal in her droll little range by fanning it with a palm leaf fan they squander money like water Well all the better for us Italians with a shrug of her shoulders But Maria it was only sixteen cents that we paid and look at those flowers There are at least half a bushel of them Sixteen cents for garbage like that The Signorina would better let me make her bargains for her Gia Gia No Italian lady would have paid more than eleven sous for such useless roba It is evident that the Signorina s countrymen eat gold when at home they think so little of casting it away Altogether what with the comfort and quiet of this little home the numberless delightful things that there were to do and to see and Viessieux s great library from which they could draw books at will to make the doing and seeing more intelligible the month at Florence passed only too quickly and was one of the times to which they afterward looked back with most pleasure Amy grew steadily stronger and the freedom from anxiety about her after their long strain of apprehension was restful and healing beyond expression to both mind and body Their very last excursion of all and one of the pleasantest was to the old amphitheatre at Fiesole and it was while they sat there in the soft glow of the late afternoon tying into bunches the violets which they had gathered from under walls whose foundations antedate Rome itself that a cheery call sounded from above and an unexpected surprise descended upon them in the shape of Lieutenant Worthington who having secured another fifteen days furlough had come to take his sister on to Venice I didn t write you that I had applied for leave he explained because there seemed so little chance of my getting off again so soon but as luck had it Carruthers whose turn it was sprained his ankle and was laid up and the Commodore let us exchange I made all the capital I could out of Amy s fever but upon my word I felt like a humbug when I came upon her and missus Swift in the Cascine just now as I was hunting for you How she has picked up I should never have known her for the same child Yes she seems perfectly well again and as strong as before she had the fever though that dear old Goody Swift is just as careful of her as ever She would not let us bring her here this afternoon for fear we should stay out till the dew fell Ned it is perfectly delightful that you were able to come It makes going to Venice seem quite a different thing doesn t it Katy I don t want it to seem quite different because going to Venice was always one of my dreams replied Katy with a little laugh I hope at least it doesn t make it seem less pleasant said mister Worthington as his sister stopped to pick a violet No indeed I am glad said Katy we shall all be seeing it for the first time too shall we not I think you said you had never been there She spoke simply and frankly but she was conscious of an odd shyness I simply couldn t stand it any longer Ned Worthington confided to his sister when they were alone My head is so full of her that I can t attend to my work and it came to me all of a sudden that this might be my last chance You ll be getting north before long you know to Switzerland and so on where I cannot follow you So I made a clean breast of it to the Commodore and the good old fellow who has a soft spot in his heart for a love story behaved like a brick and made it all straight for me to come away missus Ashe did not join in these commendations of the Commodore her attention was fixed on another part of her brother s discourse Then you won t be able to come to me again I sha n t see you again after this she exclaimed Dear me I never realized that before What shall I do without you You will have Miss Carr She is a host in herself suggested Ned Worthington His sister shook her head Katy is a jewel she remarked presently but somehow one wants a man to call upon I shall feel lost without you Ned The month s housekeeping wound up that night with a thick tea in honor of Lieutenant Worthington s arrival which taxed all the resources of the little establishment Maria was sent out hastily to buy pan forte da Siena and vino d Asti and fresh eggs for an omelette and chickens breasts smothered in cream from the restaurant and artichokes for a salad and flowers to garnish all and the guest ate and praised and admired and Amy and Mabel sat on his knee and explained everything to him and they were all very happy together Their merriment was so infectious that it extended to the poor giantess who had been very pensive all day at the prospect of losing her good place and who now raised her voice in the grand aria from Orfeo and made the kitchen ring with the passionate demand Che faro senza Eurydice The splendid notes full of fire and lamentation rang out across the saucepans as effectively as if they had been footlights and Katy rising softly opened the kitchen door a little way that they might not lose a sound The next day brought them to Venice It was a moment indeed as Katy seated herself for the first time in a gondola and looked from beneath its black hood at the palace walls on the Grand Canal past which they were gliding Some were creamy white and black some orange tawny others of a dull delicious ruddy color half pink half red but all in build and ornament were unlike palaces elsewhere High on the prow before her stood the gondolier his form defined in dark outline against the sky as he swayed and bent to his long oar raising his head now and again to give a wild musical cry as warning to other approaching gondolas It was all like a dream Ned Worthington sat beside her looking more at the changes in her expressive face than at the palaces Venice was as new to him as to Katy but she was a new feature in his life also and even more interesting than Venice They seemed to float on pleasures for the next ten days Their arrival had been happily timed to coincide with a great popular festival which for nearly a week kept Venice in a state of continual brilliant gala All the days were spent on the water only landing now and then to look at some famous building or picture or to eat ices in the Piazza with the lovely facade of saint Mark s before them Dining or sleeping seemed a sheer waste of time The evenings were spent on the water too for every night immediately after sunset a beautiful drifting pageant started from the front of the Doge s Palace to make the tour of the Grand Canal and our friends always took a part in it In its centre went a barge hung with embroideries and filled with orange trees and musicians This was surrounded by a great convoy of skiffs and gondolas bearing colored lanterns and pennons and gay awnings and managed by gondoliers in picturesque uniforms All these floated and shifted and swept on together with a sort of rhythmic undulation as if keeping time to the music while across their path dazzling showers and arches of colored fire poured from the palace fronts and the hotels Every movement of the fairy flotilla was repeated in the illuminated water every torch tip and scarlet lantern and flake of green or rosy fire above all the bright full moon looked down as if surprised It was magically beautiful in effect Katy felt as if her previous sober ideas about life and things had melted away For the moment the world was turned topsy turvy There was nothing hard or real or sordid left in it it was just a fairy tale and she was in the middle of it as she had longed to be in her childhood She was the Princess encircled by delights as when she and Clover and Elsie played in Paradise only this was better and dear me who was this Prince who seemed to belong to the story and to grow more important to it every day Fairy tales must come to ending Katy s last chapter closed with a sudden turn over of the leaf when toward the end of this happy fortnight missus Ashe came into her room with the face of one who has unpleasant news to communicate Katy she began should you be awfully disappointed should you consider me a perfect wretch if I went home now instead of in the autumn Katy was too much astonished to reply I am grown such a coward I am so knocked up and weakened by what I suffered in Rome that I find I cannot face the idea of going on to Germany and Switzerland alone without Ned to take care of me You are a perfect angel dear and I know that you would do all you could to make it easy for me but I am such a fool that I do not dare I think my nerves must have given way she continued half tearfully but the very idea of shifting for myself for five months longer makes me so miserably homesick that I cannot endure it I dare say I shall repent afterward and I tell myself now how silly it is but it s no use I shall never know another easy moment till I have Amy safe again in America and under your father s care I find she continued after another little pause that we can go down with Ned to Genoa and take a steamer there which will carry us straight to New York without any stops I hate to disappoint you dreadfully Katy but I have almost decided to do it Shall you mind very much Can you ever forgive me She was fairly crying now Katy had to swallow hard before she could answer the sense of disappointment was so sharp and with all her efforts there was almost a sob in her voice as she said Why yes indeed dear Polly there is nothing to forgive You are perfectly right to go home if you feel so Then with another swallow she added You have given me the loveliest six months treat that ever was and I should be a greedy girl indeed if I found fault because it is cut off a little sooner than we expected You are so dear and good not to be vexed said her friend embracing her It makes me feel doubly sorry about disappointing you Indeed I wouldn t if I could help it but I simply can t I must go home Perhaps we ll come back some day when Amy is grown up or safely married to somebody who will take good care of her This distant prospect was but a poor consolation for the immediate disappointment The more Katy thought about it the sorrier did she feel It was not only losing the chance very likely the only one she would ever have of seeing Switzerland and Germany it was all sorts of other little things besides They must go home in a strange ship with a captain they did not know instead of in the Spartacus as they had planned and they should land in New York where no one would be waiting for them and not have the fun of sailing into Boston Bay and seeing Rose on the wharf where she had promised to be Furthermore they must pass the hot summer in Burnet instead of in the cool Alpine valleys and Polly s house was let till October She and Amy would have to shift for themselves elsewhere Perhaps they would not be in Burnet at all Oh dear what a pity it was what a dreadful pity Then the first shock of surprise and discomfiture over other ideas asserted themselves and as she realized that in three weeks more or four at the longest she was to see papa and Clover and all her dear people at home she began to feel so very glad that she could hardly wait for the time to come After all there was nothing in Europe quite so good as that No I m not sorry she told herself I am glad Poor Polly it s no wonder she feels nervous after all she has gone through I hope I wasn t cross to her And it will be very nice to have Lieutenant Worthington to take care of us as far as Genoa The next three days were full of work There was no more floating in gondolas except in the way of business All the shopping which they had put off must be done and the trunks packed for the voyage Every one recollected last errands and commissions there was continual coming and going and confusion and Amy wild with excitement popping up every other moment in the midst of it all to demand of everybody if they were not glad that they were going back to America Katy had never yet bought her gift from old missus Redding She had waited thinking continually that she should see something more tempting still in the next place they went to but now with the sense that there were to be no more next places she resolved to wait no longer and with a hundred francs in her pocket set forth to choose something from among the many tempting things for sale in the Piazza A bracelet of old Roman coins had caught her fancy one day in a bric a brac shop and she walked straight toward it only pausing by the way to buy a pale blue iridescent pitcher at Salviate s for Cecy Slack and see it carefully rolled in seaweed and soft paper The price of the bracelet was a little more than she expected and quite a long process of bargaining was necessary to reduce it to the sum she had to spend She had just succeeded and was counting out the money when missus Ashe and her brother appeared having spied her from the opposite side of the Piazza where they were choosing last photographs at Naga s Katy showed her purchase and explained that it was a present for of course I should never walk out in cold blood and buy a bracelet for myself she said with a laugh This is a fascinating little shop said missus Ashe I wonder what is the price of that queer old chatelaine with the bottles hanging from it The price was high but missus Ashe was now tolerably conversant with shopping Italian which consists chiefly of a few words repeated many times over and it lowered rapidly under the influence of her troppo s and e molto caro s accompanied with telling little shrugs and looks of surprise In the end she bought it for less than two thirds of what had been originally asked for it As she put the parcel in her pocket her brother said If you have done your shopping now Polly can t you come out for a last row Katy may but I can t replied missus Ashe The man promised to bring me gloves at six o clock and I must be there to pay for them Take her down to the Lido Ned It s an exquisite evening for the water and the sunset promises to be delicious You can take the time can t you Katy Katy could missus Ashe turned to leave them but suddenly stopped short Katy look Isn t that a picture The picture was Amy who had come to the Piazza with missus Swift to feed the doves of saint Mark s which was one of her favorite amusements These pretty birds are the pets of all Venice and so accustomed to being fondled and made much of by strangers that they are perfectly tame Amy when her mother caught sight of her was sitting on the marble pavement with one on her shoulder two perched on the edge of her lap which was full of crumbs and a flight of others circling round her head She was looking up and calling them in soft tones The sunlight caught the little downy curls on her head and made them glitter The flying doves lit on the pavement and crowded round her their pearl and gray and rose tinted and white feathers their scarlet feet and gold ringed eyes making a shifting confusion of colors as they hopped and fluttered and cooed about the little maid unstartled even by her clear laughter Close by stood Nurse Swift observant and grimly pleased The mother looked on with happy tears in her eyes Oh Katy think what she was a few weeks ago and look at her now Can I ever be thankful enough She squeezed Katy s hand convulsively and walked away turning her head now and then for another glance at Amy and the doves while Ned and Katy silently crossed to the landing and got into a gondola It was the perfection of a Venice evening with silver waves lapsing and lulling under a rose and opal sky and the sense that it was their last row on those enchanted waters made every moment seem doubly precious I cannot tell you exactly what it was that Ned Worthington said to Katy during that row or why it took so long to say it that they did not get in till after the sun was set and the stars had come out to peep at their bright glinting faces reflected in the Grand Canal In fact no one can tell for no one overheard except Giacomo the brown yellow jacketed gondolier and as he did not understand a word of English he could not repeat the conversation Venetian boatmen however know pretty well what it means when a gentleman and lady both young find so much to say in low tones to each other under the gondola hood and are so long about giving the order to return and Giacomo deeply sympathetic rowed as softly and made himself as imperceptible as he could a display of tact which merited the big silver piece with which Lieutenant Worthington crossed his palm on landing missus Ashe had begun to look for them long before they appeared but I think she was neither surprised nor sorry that they were so late Katy kissed her hastily and went away at once to pack she said and Ned was equally undemonstrative but they looked so happy both of them that Polly dear was quite satisfied and asked no questions Five days later the parting came when the Florio steamer put into the port of Genoa for passengers It was not an easy good by to say missus Ashe and Amy both cried and Mabel was said to be in deep affliction also But there were alleviations The squadron was coming home in the autumn and the officers would have leave to see their friends and of course Lieutenant Worthington must come to Burnet to visit his sister Five months would soon go he declared but for all the cheerful assurance his face was rueful enough as he held Katy s hand in a long tight clasp while the little boat waited to take him ashore After that it was just a waiting to be got through with till they sighted Sandy Hook and the Neversinks a waiting varied with peeps at Marseilles and Gibraltar and the sight of a whale or two and one distant iceberg The weather was fair all the way and the ocean smooth Amy was never weary of lamenting her own stupidity in not having taken Maria Matilda out of confinement before they left Venice That child has hardly been out of the trunk since we started she said She hasn t seen anything except a little bit of Nice I shall really be ashamed when the other children ask her about it I think I shall play that she was left at boarding school and didn t come to Europe at all Don t you think that would be the best way mamma You might play that she was left in the States prison for having done something naughty suggested Katy but Amy scouted this idea She never does naughty things she said because she never does anything at all She s just stupid poor child It s not her fault The thirty six hours between New York and Burnet seemed longer than all the rest of the journey put together Katy thought But they ended at last as the Lake Queen swung to her moorings at the familiar wharf where doctor Carr stood surrounded with all his boys and girls just as they had stood the previous October only that now there were no clouds on anybody s face and Johnnie was skipping up and down for joy instead of grief It was a long moment while the plank was being lowered from the gangway but the moment it was in place Katy darted across first ashore of all the passengers and was in her father s arms missus Ashe and Amy spent two or three days with them while looking up temporary quarters elsewhere and so long as they stayed all seemed a happy confusion of talking and embracing and exclaiming and distributing of gifts After they went away things fell into their customary train and a certain flatness became apparent Everything had happened that could happen The long talked of European journey was over Here was Katy at home again months sooner than they expected yet she looked remarkably cheerful and content Clover could not understand it she was likewise puzzled to account for one or two private conversations between Katy and papa in which she had not been invited to take part and the occasional arrival of a letter from foreign parts about whose contents nothing was said It seems a dreadful pity that you had to come so soon she said one day when they were alone in their bedroom It s delightful to have you of course but we had braced ourselves to do without you till October and there are such lots of delightful things that you could have been doing and seeing at this moment Oh yes indeed replied Katy but not at all as if she were particularly disappointed Katy Carr I don t understand you persisted Clover Why don t you feel worse about it Here you have lost five months of the most splendid time you ever had and you don t seem to mind it a bit Why if I were in your place my heart would be perfectly broken And you needn t have come either that s the worst of it It was just a whim of Polly s Papa says Amy might have stayed as well as not Why aren t you sorrier Katy Oh I don t know Perhaps because I had so much as it was enough to last all my life I think though I should like to go again You can t imagine what beautiful pictures are put away in my memory I don t see that you had so awfully much said the aggravated Clover you were there only a little more than six months for I don t count the sea and ever so much of that time was taken up with nursing Amy You can t have any pleasant pictures of that part of it Yes I have some Well I should really like to know what There you were in a dark room frightened to death and tired to death with only missus Ashe and the old nurse to keep you company Oh yes that brother was there part of the time I forgot him Clover stopped short in sudden amazement Katy was standing with her back toward her smoothing her hair but her face was reflected in the glass At Clover s words a sudden deep flush had mounted in Katy s cheeks Deeper and deeper it burned as she became conscious of Clover s astonished gaze till even the back of her neck was pink Then as if she could not bear it any longer she put the brush down turned and fled out of the room while Clover looking after her exclaimed in a tone of sudden comical dismay What does it mean Oh dear me is that what Katy is going to
