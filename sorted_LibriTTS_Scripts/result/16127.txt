none	none	woman Outside the rain was falling Not a heavy downpour which splashed cheerfully on umbrellas and formed swollen streams in the gutters whence they rushed toward the sewer basins carrying with them an accumulation of sticks leaves and dirt Not a windy gusty rain that made a man glad to get indoors near a genial fire with his pipe and a book It was a drizzle a steady persistent drizzle which a half hearted wind blew this way and that as though neither element cared much for the task in hand that of thoroughly soaking the particular part of the universe in the neighborhood of Colchester and taking its own time in which to do it Early in the unequal contest the sun had given up its effort to pierce through the leaden clouds and had taken its beams to other places to busy cities to smiling country villages and farms Above around below on all sides soaking through and through drizzling it soaking it sprinkling it half hiding it in fog and mist the rain enveloped Colchester a sodden damp garment Early paper boys slunk along the slippery streets trying to protect their limp wares from becoming mere blotters The gongs of the few trolley cars that were sent out to take the early toilers to their tasks rang as though covered with a blanket of fog The thud of the feet of the milkmen s horses was muffled and the rattle of bottles seemed to come from afar off as though over some misty lake James Darcy shivering as he arose silently protesting from his warm bed pulled on his garments audibly grumbling the grumble becoming a voiced protest as he shuffled in his slippers along the corridor above the jewelry shop and went down the private stairs into the main sales room The electric light in front of the massive safe seemed to lear at him with a bleared eye like that of a toper who having spent the night in convivial company found himself most unaccountably on his own doorstep in the gray dawn Raining murmured James Darcy as he reached over to switch on the light above the little table where he set precious stones into gold and platinum of rare and beautiful designs Raining and cold I wish the steam was on The fog from outside seemed to have penetrated into the jewelry shop It swirled about the gleaming showcases reflected from the cut glass danced away from the silver cups broke into points of light from the times of forks became broad splotches on the blades of knives and perchance made its way through the cracks into the safe where it bathed the diamonds the rubies the sapphires the aqua marines the pearls the jades and the bloodstones in a white mist The bloodstones Strange that James Darcy should have thought of them as he looked at the rain outside heard its drip drip drip on the windows and saw the fog and swirls of mist inside and without the store Strange and First as he gazed at the prostrate body the horrid red blotch like a gay ribbon in the white hair he thought the small insistent sound which seemed to fill the room was the beating of her heart Then as he listened his ears attuned with fear he knew it was the ticking of the watch in the hand of the dead woman James Darcy rubbed his eyes as though to clear them from the fog He rubbed them again he passed his hand before his face as if cobwebs had drifted there he touched his ears which seemed not a part of himself Tick tick Tick tick Tick tick The sound seemed to grow louder It was not her heart Hello Come here somebody Amelia

none	none	know Looks to me more like murder The milkman whistled set his collection of bottles back in his wagon and hurried with Darcy toward the store The other man bringing his rattling vehicle to a stop followed Where is she whispered Casey as soon as he reached the side of his business rival Tremlain On the floor right in the middle between the showcases answered Darcy and he too whispered It seemed the right thing to do There see her He pointed a trembling finger Lord Her head s smashed exclaimed Casey Look at the blood I I don t want to look at it murmured Darcy faintly Hark cautioned Tremlain What s that noise They all listened they all heard it It s a watch ticking answered Darcy 
6371_63713_000040_000001	train-clean-360	First I thought it was her heart beating 
none	none	it sounded so But it s only a watch Maybe so assented Casey 
6371_63713_000114_000001	train-clean-360	We 
none	none	d better make sure before we telephone for the police She may only have fallen and cut her head You you go and see suggested Tremlain I I don t like to go near her I never could bear the sight of dead folks not even my own father You look Casey hesitated a moment and then stepped closer to the body He leaned over it and put the backs of his hard fingers on the white wrinkled and shrunken cheeks They were cold and wax like to his touch She s dead he whispered softly Better get the police right away Murdered asked Tremlain who had remained beside Darcy near the showcase where the silver gleamed I don t know Her head s cut bad though there s not so much blood as I thought at first We mustn t touch the body that s the law Got to leave it until the coroner sees it Where s the telephone Right back here answered Darcy eagerly Police headquarters number is I know it interrupted Casey I had to call em up once when I had a horse stole I ll get em What s that watch ticking he asked pausing Oh it s in her hand and the other two looked and saw clasped close in the palm of the woman lying huddled on the floor a watch of uncommon design It was ticking loudly What makes it sound so plain asked Tremlain Cause it s so quiet in here answered Casey It ll be noisy enough later on though But it s so quiet that s what makes the ticking of the watch sound so plain It is quiet observed Tremlain But in a jewelry store there s always a lot of clocks making a noise and Say he suddenly cried there s not a clock in this place ticking notice that Not a clock ticking They ve all stopped You re right exclaimed Casey The watch is the only thing going in the whole place The milkmen looked quickly at Darcy
6371_63713_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes 
6371_63713_000125_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes 
none	none	the clocks have all stopped he said wetting his lips with his tongue I didn t notice it before though I did hear the watch in her hand ticking I thought it was her heart beating I guess I said that before I don t know what I am saying This has upset me frightfully I should think it would agreed Casey Funny thing about the clocks all stopping though S pose they all ran down at once They couldn t Darcy answered I wound the regulator only yesterday and he pointed to the tall timepiece in the show window the solemn ticking clock by which many passersby set their watches The other clocks And they ve all stopped at different times added Tremlain That s funny too If anything could be funny in that place of death this fact might be And it was a fact Of the many clocks in the store not one was ticking and all pointed to different hours The big regulator indicated ten twenty two a chronometer in a showcase was five hours and some minutes ahead of that The clock over Darcy s work table noted the hour of seven fifty six Some cheaper clocks alarms among them on the shelves which were usually going showed various hours They had all stopped Only the watch in the dead woman s hand was ticking and that showed approximately the right time

none	none	six o clock Well we ve got to get the police said Casey Then I ve got to travel on customers waiting for me You you won t leave me here alone will you asked Darcy Isn t there any one else in the house asked Tremlain for the living rooms were above the jewelry store a substantial brown stone building of the style of three decades ago Only Sallie Page the cook 
6371_63713_000068_000002	train-clean-360	She s deaf 
none	none	and she ll be more of a nuisance than a help missus Darcy s maid won t be in until noon I don t want to be left Oh you won t be alone long observed Casey The police will be here as soon as we send em word And here s a crowd outside already There was one made up of men and boys with here and there a factory girl on her way to work They had seen the two milk wagons in front of the jewelry store the store which though most of the more valuable pieces were in the safe still showed in the gleaming windows much that caught the eye of the passerby Some one sensed the unusual Some one stopped then another Some one had caught sight on peering into the store of the prostrate figure with that blotch of red in the white hair The crowd increasing each minute pressed against the still locked front doors Those in the van flattened their noses against the glass in grotesque fashion Hurry and get the police begged Darcy Casey was about to telephone when Tremlain who had gone out into the alley from the side door hurried back to report Here comes a cop now Saw the crowd I guess We can just tell him what we saw Casey and then slide along I m late as it is So m I The policeman his heavy soled shoes creaking importantly came along the street hurrying not in the least He knew whatever it was would keep for him What s the row demanded Patrolman Mulligan Looks like the old lady was murdered Casey answered I was just going to telephone to headquarters He told briefly what he knew which was corroborated by Tremlain then the two left to cover their routes after giving their addresses to the policeman The crowd grew larger From outside it looked like a convention of umbrellas The rain still drizzled and turned to steam and mist as it warmed on the many bodies in the throng a mist that mingled with that of the rain itself In spite of the storm the crowd grew and remained Those who might be late at bench lathe or loom unheeded the passing of time It was not every day they could be so close to a murder The crowd filled the entire space in front of the jewelry store The bolder spirits rattled the knob of the locked portals and tapped on the glass that was now misty and grimy from hands and noses pressed against it The crowd began to surge into the alley whence a side door gave entrance into missus Darcy s place Some even ventured to press into the store itself the store where the silent figure lay huddled between the showcases Now then slide out of here take a walk advised Mulligan as he shoved out some of the men and boys who had entered Get out You can read all about it in the papers The reporters ll be here soon enough he added with a wink at Darcy I ll lock the door and keep the crowd out The sleuths can knock when they get here Where s your phone I ll have to report to the station Darcy pointed to the telephone and the policeman showing no more than a passing interest in the body at which he glanced casually as he passed called up his precinct and reported being told to remain on guard until relieved How d it happen he asked as he came back from the instrument and leaned against a showcase containing much glittering silver Who did it when how I haven t the least idea replied Darcy turning away so as not to see the faces now pressed against both the front and side doors each being locked from the inside I found her just as she is now and called in the milkmen who happened to be passing I had come down to the store early to do a little repair job and the first thing I saw was her What time did it happen I don t even know that All the clocks have stopped I don t usually wind the watches that are left for repair unless I m regulating them and I haven t any like that in now The only thing going is that one watch What one watch I do hear something ticking and the policeman looked at Darcy What watch The one in her hand Oh I see Hum Well we ll leave that for the county physician He ll be here pretty soon I guess They ll notify him from the precinct Now how about last night was there any row any noise 
6371_63713_000039_000002	train-clean-360	Did you hear anything 
none	none	I didn t hear anything much There s always a lot of noise around here until after midnight theaters and moving picture places let out about eleven thirty I awoke once in the night But I guess that doesn t matter Anybody else in the house besides you and the policeman yawned for he had gone out on dog watch and looked into the wet shiny drizzle swept street Only Sallie Page the cook I ll call her There s missus Darcy s maid Jane Metson But she went away yesterday afternoon and won t be back until about noon It s past time Sallie was down to get breakfast I ll call her Darcy made a move as though to go to the rear of the store whence a side door gave entrance to the stairs leading to the rooms above I ll go with you said Mulligan and he shoved himself to an erect posture by forcing his elbows against the showcase on which he had been leaning in a manner to give himself as much rest as possible without sitting down it was a way he had acquired from long patrolling of city streets You you ll go with me faltered Darcy Yes to call the cook She won t run away and he nodded toward the dead woman Oh There was a world of meaning in Darcy s interjection You mean that I I don t mean nothin broke in Mulligan I leave that to the gum shoe men 
6371_63713_000096_000001	train-clean-360	Come on 
none	none	if you want to call what s her name It took some little time by calling and pounding outside her door to arouse deaf Sallie Page and longer to make her understand that she was wanted Then just as Darcy had expected she began to cry and moan when she heard her mistress was dead and refused to come from her room She had served the owner of the jewelry store for more than a score of years Hark exclaimed Mulligan as he and Darcy came downstairs after having roused Sallie Page What s that Some one is knocking remarked his companion Maybe it s the men from headquarters It was Carroll and Thong who always teamed it when there was a case of sufficient importance as this seemed to be They were insistently knocking at the side door having forced their way through the crowd that was still there larger than ever maintaining positions in spite of the dripping driving drizzling rain Killed eh murmured Carroll as he bent over the body Gun asked Thong who was making a quick visual inventory of the interior of the place No doesn t seem so Looks more like her head s been busted in Hit with something Doc Warren can tend to that end of it Now let s get down to business Who found her this way I did answered Darcy And who are you Her second cousin Her name was missus Amelia Darcy and her husband and my father were first cousins I have worked for her about seven years ever since just after her husband died She continued his business It s one of the oldest in the city and Yes I know all about that Robbery here once before your time We got back some of the stuff for the old lady She treated us pretty decent too When d you find her like this About half an hour ago I got up a little before six o clock to do some repair work on a man s watch He wanted to get the early train out of town I see And you found the old lady like this asked Carroll Just like this yes Then I called in the milkmen I saw them interrupted Mulligan I know em They re all right so I let em go We can get em after they finish their routes
6371_63713_000071_000000	train-clean-360	 Um 
none	none	assented Thong Anything gone from the store he asked Darcy I haven t looked Better take a look around It s probably a robbery You know the stock don t you As well as she did herself I ve been doing the buying lately Well have a look Who s that at the door he asked sharply for a knock as of authority sounded different from the aimless and impatient kickings and tappings of the wet throng outside It s Daley from the Times reported Mulligan peering out He s all right Shall I let him in Oh yes I guess so assented Carroll with a glance at Thong who confirmed by a nod of his head what his partner said He ll give us what s right Let him in The reporter entered nodded to the detectives gave a short glance at the body a longer one at Darcy poked Mulligan in the ribs lighted a cigarette which he let hang from one lip where it gyrated in eccentric circles as he mumbled What s the dope Don t know yet answered Carroll The old lady s dead murdered it looks like and What s that interrupted Thong What s that ticking sound It s the watch in her hand replied Darcy and his voice was a hoarse whisper 
6371_63713_000001_000000	train-clean-360	CHAPTER II
none	none	 KING S DAGGER Carroll and Thong proceeding along the lines they usually followed in cases like this keeping to the rules which had come to them through the instructions of superior officers and some which they had worked out for themselves had in a comparatively short time ascertained the name age and somewhat of the personal history of missus Amelia Darcy together with that of her cousin as the detectives called him though the relationship was not as close as that 
6371_63713_000004_000000	train-clean-360	missus Darcy who was sixty five years of age had carried on the jewelry business of her husband Mortimer Darcy after his death which preceded her more tragic one by about seven years 
6371_63713_000004_000001	train-clean-360	Mortimer Darcy had been a diamond salesman for a large New York house in his younger days and had come to be an expert in precious stones 
6371_63713_000004_000002	train-clean-360	Many good wishes and not a little trade had gone to him from his former employers and some of their customers bought of him when he went into business for himself in the thriving city of Colchester 
none	none	Knowing that to start anew in a strange town would mean uphill work for him and his wife Mortimer Darcy had awaited an opportunity to buy the business of a man whom he had known for a number of years and to whom he had sold many diamonds and other stones 
6371_63713_000005_000001	train-clean-360	This man Harrison Van Doren by name had what was termed the best jewelry trade in Colchester 
6371_63713_000005_000002	train-clean-360	The old families not that any of them could trace their ancestry back very far liked to say that we get all our stuff at Van Doren s 
6371_63713_000006_000000	train-clean-360	This name on little white plush lined boxes containing pins or sparkling rings came to mean almost as much as some of the more expensive names in New York 
6371_63713_000006_000001	train-clean-360	Young ladies counted it a point in the favor of their lovers if the engagement circlet came from Van Doren s And Mortimer Darcy knowing the value of that class of trade had when he purchased mister Van Doren s business fostered that spirit 
none	none	missus Darcy on the death of her husband had further catered to it so that the Darcy establishment though it was not the richest or most showy in Colchester was safely counted the most exclusive that is it had a full line of the best goods be it clocks or diamonds and it had what in bygone days was called a carriage trade but which is now referred to as automobile 
6371_63713_000007_000000	train-clean-360	That is to say those aside from a casual trade with people who dropped in as they might have done to a grocery to get what they really needed in the way of jewelry came in gasolene or electric cars where their ancestors had come with horses and carriage 
6371_63713_000008_000000	train-clean-360	So Darcy s jewelry store was known and though a bit old fashioned in a way was favorably known not only to the older members of the rich families of the place but to the younger set as well 
6371_63713_000008_000001	train-clean-360	The pretty girls and their well groomed companions of the Assembly Ball set liked to stop in there for their rings brooches scarf pins or cuff links and very frequent were the rather languid orders 
6371_63713_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 You may send it charge 
6371_63713_000010_000000	train-clean-360	It was to that class of trade that missus Darcy catered 
6371_63713_000010_000001	train-clean-360	She understood it and it understood her 
6371_63713_000010_000002	train-clean-360	That was enough 
none	none	She took a personal interest in the business to the extent of being in the store almost every day as her husband had been before her to advise and be available for consultation whether it was the buying of a gold teething ring for the newest member of the family an engagement ring for the latest debutante a watch for son attaining his majority or perhaps new gold glasses for grandpapa or grandmama The store was not a large one and four clerks one a young woman with James Darcy and an assistant who looked after the repair work and made anything unusual in the way of pins or rings constituted the force But missus Darcy was as good as a clerk herself and during the holiday rush she was in the store night and day 
6371_63713_000011_000001	train-clean-360	This was the easier for her since she owned the building in which her display was kept and lived in a quiet and tastefully furnished apartment over the store 
6371_63713_000012_000000	train-clean-360	On the death of her husband she had sent for his second cousin who at that time was in the employ of a well known New York jewelry house and he agreed to come to her 
6371_63713_000013_000000	train-clean-360	Rather more than a repair man and clerk was James Darcy 
6371_63713_000013_000001	train-clean-360	He was an expert jewelry designer and a setter of precious stones and often when some fastidious customer did not seem to care for what was shown from the glittering trays in the showcases missus Darcy or one of her clerks would say 
6371_63713_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 We will have mister Darcy design something different for you 
6371_63713_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 That s what I want the customer would say something different something you don t see everywhere 
6371_63713_000016_000000	train-clean-360	And so the Darcy trade had grown and prospered 
6371_63713_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 Well let s hear what you have to say said Carroll after James Darcy had given what the detectives considered was for the time a sufficient history of himself and his relative and had hastily gone over such of the stock as was kept outside the safe 
6371_63713_000017_000001	train-clean-360	The latter had not been forced open it did not take long to ascertain that 
6371_63713_000017_000002	train-clean-360	 Is anything gone 
6371_63713_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 I can t say for sure answered the young man he was this side of thirty 
6371_63713_000018_000001	train-clean-360	His long artistic fingers were trembling and he felt weak and faint 
6371_63713_000018_000002	train-clean-360	 But if there has been a robbery they didn t get much 
6371_63713_000018_000003	train-clean-360	The safe hasn t been opened and the best of the goods all the diamonds and other stones are in that 
6371_63713_000064_000000	train-clean-360	 Nothing 
6371_63713_000018_000004	train-clean-360	Nothing seems to be gone from the cases though I d have to make a better search and go over the inventory to make certain 
6371_63713_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 Well let that go for the time 
6371_63713_000019_000001	train-clean-360	How d you find things when you came downstairs 
6371_63713_000019_000002	train-clean-360	What happened during the night 
6371_63713_000019_000003	train-clean-360	Any of the doors or windows forced and the detective fairly shot these questions at Darcy 
6371_63713_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 I think not 
6371_63713_000020_000001	train-clean-360	The front door was locked just as it is now 
6371_63713_000020_000002	train-clean-360	I went out the side one 
6371_63713_000020_000003	train-clean-360	That was locked with the spring catch from the inside 
6371_63713_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 Wasn t it bolted came sharply from Thong 
none	none	I didn t notice about that 
6371_63713_000022_000001	train-clean-360	You see I was all excited like 
6371_63713_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes assented Thong 
6371_63713_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 There s a bolt on the door Carroll snapped 
6371_63713_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes but missus Darcy may have slipped it back herself 
6371_63713_000025_000001	train-clean-360	She was down first though why I can t say 
6371_63713_000025_000002	train-clean-360	She seldom came down ahead of me especially of late years 
6371_63713_000025_000003	train-clean-360	I generally opened the store 
none	none	The clerks report at eighty thirty there s some of em now 
6371_63713_000026_000000	train-clean-360	More knockings had sounded on the front door and the faces of two young men peered in through the misty glass the crowd having made a lane for them on learning that they worked in the place of death 
none	none	Let em in sure assented Thong We got to talk to all of em Let em in 
6371_63713_000028_000000	train-clean-360	Darcy did so Mulligan helping him keep back the crowd of curious ones 
none	none	Here comes Miss Brill said one of the men clerks to Darcy What s the matter Is missus Darcy Dead 
6371_63713_000030_000001	train-clean-360	Killed I m afraid 
6371_63713_000030_000002	train-clean-360	The store won t open to day but the police want to see every one 
6371_63713_000030_000003	train-clean-360	Oh Miss Brill come in and he held out his hand to the one young woman clerk who drew back in horrified fright as she saw the silent figure on the floor 
none	none	Oh Oh she gasped and then she went into hysterics adding to the excitement and giving Mulligan a bad five minutes while he fought to keep the crowd from surging in 
6371_63713_000032_000000	train-clean-360	But when Miss Brill had been carried to a rear room and quieted and when the shades had been drawn to keep the curious ones from peering in the questioning of Darcy was resumed 
6371_63713_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 Did you come directly down to the store from your room asked Thong 
none	none	Yes 
6371_63713_000034_000001	train-clean-360	As soon as I awakened 
6371_63713_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 Where is your room 
6371_63713_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 In the rear on the second floor the one next above 
6371_63713_000036_000001	train-clean-360	missus Darcy has her rooms in front 
6371_63713_000036_000002	train-clean-360	Then come those of her maid Jane Metson 
6371_63713_000036_000003	train-clean-360	Sallie Page sleeps on the top floor where the janitor s family lives and he of course sleeps up there also 
6371_63713_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 I see murmured Carroll 
6371_63713_000037_000001	train-clean-360	 Then you came downstairs and found missus Darcy lying here dead 
none	none	I wasn t sure she was dead Oh she was dead all right broke in Thong
6371_63713_000039_000001	train-clean-360	 No question about that 
none	none	Did you hear anything
6371_63713_000040_000000	train-clean-360	 Only the watch ticking in her hand 
none	none	First I thought it was her heart beating No I mean did you hear anything in the night went on the detective Any queer noise It s mighty funny if there was murder done and no robbery 
6371_63713_000041_000002	train-clean-360	But of course she might have heard a noise if you didn t and she might have come down to find out what it was about 
none	none	She might have caught a burglar at work and he may have killed her to get away 
6371_63713_000041_000004	train-clean-360	But if it was a burglar it s funny you didn t hear any noise like a fall or something 
6371_63713_000041_000005	train-clean-360	How about that mister Darcy 
none	none	Well no I didn t exactly hear anything 
6371_63713_000042_000001	train-clean-360	I went to bed about half past ten after working at my table down here awhile 
none	none	Was missus Darcy in bed then Thong asked
6371_63713_000044_000000	train-clean-360	 I couldn t say 
6371_63713_000044_000001	train-clean-360	She had gone to her apartment but I don t have to pass near that to get to my room 
6371_63713_000044_000002	train-clean-360	I came straight up and went to bed 
6371_63713_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 At ten o clock you say 
none	none	A little after 
6371_63713_000046_000001	train-clean-360	It may have been a quarter to eleven 
6371_63713_000047_000000	train-clean-360	 And you didn t hear anything all night Carroll shot this question at Darcy suddenly 
none	none	No
6371_63713_000054_000000	train-clean-360	 no not exactly 
none	none	I did hear something it wasn t exactly a noise and yet it was a noise
6371_63713_000049_000000	train-clean-360	 What kind of talk is that demanded Thong roughly 
none	none	Either it was a noise or it wasn t 
6371_63713_000049_000002	train-clean-360	Now which was it 
6371_63713_000050_000000	train-clean-360	 Well if you call a clock striking a noise then it was one 
6371_63713_000051_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh a clock struck and Thong settled back in his chair more at his ease 
6371_63713_000051_000001	train-clean-360	His manner seemed to indicate that he was on the track of something 
6371_63713_000052_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes a clock struck 
6371_63713_000052_000001	train-clean-360	It was either three or four I can t be sure which Darcy replied 
6371_63713_000052_000002	train-clean-360	 You know when you awaken in the night and hear the strokes you can t be sure you haven t missed some of the first ones 
6371_63713_000052_000003	train-clean-360	I heard three anyhow I m sure of that 
6371_63713_000053_000000	train-clean-360	 Well put it down as three suggested Thong 
6371_63713_000053_000001	train-clean-360	 Was it the striking of the clock that awakened you 
none	none	No not exactly It was more as if some one had been in my room Some one in your room exclaimed both detectives 
6371_63713_000055_000001	train-clean-360	They were questioning Darcy in the living room of missus Darcy s suite the clerks being detained downstairs by Mulligan 
6371_63713_000055_000002	train-clean-360	The county physician who was also the coroner had not yet arrived 
6371_63713_000056_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes at first I thought some one had been in my room and then after I thought about it I wasn t quite sure 
6371_63713_000056_000001	train-clean-360	All I know is I slept quite soundly sounder than usual in fact and all at once I heard a clock strike 
6371_63713_000057_000000	train-clean-360	 Three or four murmured Thong 
6371_63713_000058_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes three anyhow maybe four 
6371_63713_000058_000001	train-clean-360	Something awakened me suddenly but what I can t say 
6371_63713_000058_000002	train-clean-360	I remember at the time it felt as though something had passed over my face 
6371_63713_000059_000000	train-clean-360	 Like a hand suggested Carroll 
6371_63713_000060_000000	train-clean-360	 Well I couldn t be sure 
6371_63713_000060_000001	train-clean-360	It may have been I dreamed it 
none	none	But what did it feel like insisted Thong
6371_63713_000062_000000	train-clean-360	 Well like a cloth brushing my face more than like a hand or it may have been a hand with a glove on it 
none	none	Yes it may have been that 
6371_63713_000062_000002	train-clean-360	Then I tried to arouse myself but I heard the wind blowing and a sprinkle of rain and as my window was open I thought the curtain might have blown across my face 
6371_63713_000062_000003	train-clean-360	That would account for it I reasoned so 
none	none	Yes it may have been the curtain said Thong slowly
6371_63713_000063_000001	train-clean-360	 But what did you do 
none	none	Nothing 
6371_63713_000064_000001	train-clean-360	I lay still a little while and then I went to sleep again I was only awake maybe two or three minutes 
6371_63713_000065_000000	train-clean-360	 You didn t call missus Darcy 
none	none	No
6371_63713_000067_000000	train-clean-360	 Nor the servant what s her name 
none	none	Sallie No 
6371_63713_000068_000001	train-clean-360	There wasn t any use in that 
none	none	She s deaf
6371_63713_000069_000000	train-clean-360	 And you didn t call the janitor 
none	none	No 
6371_63713_000070_000001	train-clean-360	I wasn t very wide awake and I didn t really attach any importance to it until after I saw her dead 
6371_63713_000101_000000	train-clean-360	 Um Yes 
6371_63713_000071_000001	train-clean-360	Yes murmured Carroll 
6371_63713_000071_000002	train-clean-360	 Well then you went to sleep again What did you do next 
6371_63713_000072_000000	train-clean-360	 I awakened with a sudden start just before six o clock 
6371_63713_000072_000001	train-clean-360	I had not set an alarm though I wanted to get up early to do a little repair job I had promised for early this morning 
none	none	But I have gotten so in the habit of rousing at almost any hour I mentally set for myself the night before that I don t need an alarm clock I had fixed my mind on the fact that I wanted to get up at five thirty and I think it was just a quarter to six when I got up 
6371_63713_000072_000004	train-clean-360	I was anxious to finish the repair job for a man who was to leave on an early train this morning 
6371_63713_000072_000005	train-clean-360	He may be in any time now and I haven t it ready for him 
6371_63713_000073_000000	train-clean-360	 What sort of a repair job asked Carroll 
6371_63713_000074_000000	train-clean-360	 On a watch 
6371_63713_000075_000000	train-clean-360	 Where s the watch now and the detective flicked the ashes from a cigar the reporter had given him 
none	none	Daley was down in the jewelry store interviewing the clerks while Darcy was on the grill up above
6371_63713_000076_000000	train-clean-360	 The watch murmured Darcy 
6371_63713_000076_000001	train-clean-360	 It it s in her hand and he nodded in the direction of the silent figure downstairs 
6371_63713_000077_000000	train-clean-360	 The watch that is still ticking 
6371_63713_000078_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes but the funny part of it is that the watch wasn t going last night when I planned to start work on it 
6371_63713_000078_000001	train-clean-360	I forget just why I didn t do it and Darcy seemed a bit confused a point not lost sight of by Carroll 
none	none	I guess it must have been because I couldn t see well with the electric light on my work table went on the jewelry worker I ve got to get that fixed 
6371_63713_000078_000003	train-clean-360	Anyhow I didn t do anything to the Indian s watch more than look at it and I made up my mind to rise early and hurry it through 
6371_63713_000078_000004	train-clean-360	So I didn t even wind it 
6371_63713_000078_000005	train-clean-360	I can t understand what makes it go unless some one got in and wound it and they wouldn t do that 
6371_63713_000079_000000	train-clean-360	 Whose watch is it asked Thong 
none	none	It belongs to Singa Phut
6371_63713_000081_000000	train-clean-360	 Singa Phut ejaculated Carroll 
6371_63713_000081_000001	train-clean-360	 Crimps what a name 
6371_63713_000081_000002	train-clean-360	Who belongs to it 
none	none	Singa Phut is an East Indian explained Darcy
6371_63713_000082_000001	train-clean-360	 He has a curio store down on Water Street 
6371_63713_000082_000002	train-clean-360	We have bought some odd things from him for our customers queer bead necklaces and the like 
6371_63713_000082_000003	train-clean-360	He left the watch with my cousin who told me to repair it 
6371_63713_000082_000004	train-clean-360	It needed a new case spring and some of the screws were loose 
none	none	How did missus Darcy come to have the watch in her hand Carroll demanded
6371_63713_000084_000000	train-clean-360	 That I couldn t say 
none	none	What sort of a man is this Indian Singa Singa began Thong hesitatingly Singa Phut is a quiet studious Indian answered Darcy
6371_63713_000086_000001	train-clean-360	 He has not lived here very long but I knew him in New York 
6371_63713_000086_000002	train-clean-360	He has done business with me for some years 
6371_63713_000087_000000	train-clean-360	 Is he all right safe not one of them gars you know the fellows that use a silk cord to strangle you with asked Thong who had some imagination regarding garroters 
none	none	Not at all like that said Darcy and there was the trace of a smile on his face He is a gentleman
6371_63713_000089_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh said Carroll and Thong in unison 
6371_63713_000090_000000	train-clean-360	There came another knock on the side door downstairs 
6371_63713_000090_000001	train-clean-360	There was less of a crowd about now and Mulligan did not have to keep back a rush as he opened the portal 
6371_63713_000091_000000	train-clean-360	 doctor Warren reported the policeman calling upstairs to Carroll and Thong 
6371_63713_000092_000000	train-clean-360	 The county physician explained Carroll 
6371_63713_000092_000001	train-clean-360	 Better come down and meet him mister Darcy 
6371_63713_000092_000002	train-clean-360	He ll want to ask you some questions 
6371_63713_000092_000003	train-clean-360	Then we ll have another go at you 
6371_63713_000092_000004	train-clean-360	Got to ask a lot of questions in a case like this he half apologized 
6371_63713_000093_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh sure assented the jewelry worker 
6371_63713_000094_000000	train-clean-360	 Doc Warren eh mused Thong to his partner as Darcy preceded them downstairs 
none	none	Now we ll know what killed her and we ll have something to start on maybe I think we ve got something already observed Carroll Oh yes maybe and then again maybe not Come on Morning boys Nice crisp day if you say it quick cried the county physician as he shook the rain from his coat and tossed his auto gloves on a shiny glass showcase
6371_63713_000097_000002	train-clean-360	 Second time this week you ve got me out of bed before my time 
6371_63713_000097_000003	train-clean-360	What s the matter if they ve got to have a murder with doing it in the afternoon 
6371_63713_000097_000004	train-clean-360	I like my sleep 
6371_63713_000098_000000	train-clean-360	He was smiling and cheerful was doctor Warren 
6371_63713_000098_000001	train-clean-360	Murders and autopsies were all in the day s work with him 
none	none	He had been county physician for a number of years Hum yes 
6371_63713_000099_000001	train-clean-360	quite an old lady he mused as he took off his coat which Carroll held for him 
6371_63713_000099_000002	train-clean-360	The doctor rolled up his shirt sleeves and stooped down 
6371_63713_000099_000003	train-clean-360	 Head s badly cut let s see what we have here 
6371_63713_000099_000004	train-clean-360	Let s have a light it s too dark to see 
6371_63713_000100_000000	train-clean-360	One of the clerks switched on more electric lights and they glinted and sparkled on the silver and cut glass 
6371_63713_000100_000001	train-clean-360	They flashed on the white still face and the gleams seemed to be swallowed up in that red blotch in the snowy hair 
none	none	Um yes 
6371_63713_000101_000001	train-clean-360	Depressed fracture 
6371_63713_000101_000002	train-clean-360	Bad place too 
none	none	Shouldn t wonder but what it had done the trick 
6371_63713_000101_000004	train-clean-360	Might have been from a black jack and he glanced questioningly at the detectives 
none	none	Carroll shook his head in negation
6371_63713_000103_000000	train-clean-360	 That ll crack a skull but it won t draw blood not if it s used right and he brought from his hip pocket one of the weapons in question a short stout flexible reed covered with leather the end forming a pocket in which was a chunk of lead 
none	none	I ll gamble it wasn t one of them said Carroll
6371_63713_000105_000000	train-clean-360	 Maybe not assented the doctor 
6371_63713_000105_000001	train-clean-360	 Let s look a bit further 
none	none	He glanced at the floor about the body peered around the edge of a showcase underneath which there was a space for refuse odds and ends discarded wrapping paper and the like a place into which neither of the detectives had as yet glanced doctor Warren uttered an exclamation and drew out a metal statue about two feet high 
6371_63713_000107_000000	train-clean-360	It was that of a hunter standing as though he had just delivered a shot and was peering to see the effect 
6371_63713_000107_000001	train-clean-360	The butt of his gun projected behind him and as doctor Warren moved the statue into the light of the jewelry store chandeliers they all saw clinging to the stock of the gun some straggling white hairs 
6371_63713_000108_000000	train-clean-360	 That s what did it exclaimed the county physician 
none	none	I ll wager when I try I can fit that gun butt into the depression of the fracture 
6371_63713_000108_000002	train-clean-360	The burglar or whoever it was swung this statue as a club It would make a deadly one using the foot end for a handle and doctor Warren waved the ornament in the air over the dead woman s head to illustrate what he meant 
6371_63713_000109_000000	train-clean-360	 Don t muttered Darcy in a strained voice 
6371_63713_000110_000000	train-clean-360	 Don t what asked the physician sharply 
6371_63713_000111_000000	train-clean-360	 Use the statue that way 
6371_63713_000112_000000	train-clean-360	 Why not 
none	none	Well er I we were going to buy it for our new home 
6371_63713_000113_000001	train-clean-360	But now Oh I never want to see it in the house 
6371_63713_000113_000002	train-clean-360	I couldn t bear to look at it nor could she 
none	none	She We 
6371_63713_000114_000002	train-clean-360	What do you mean asked Carroll quickly 
6371_63713_000114_000003	train-clean-360	 Say do you know something about this killing that you re keeping back from us 
6371_63713_000115_000000	train-clean-360	He took a step nearer Darcy a threatening step it would seem from the fact that the jewelry worker drew back as if in alarm 
none	none	No I don t know anything said Darcy in a low voice Then what s this talk about the statue not wanting it in the house whose house
6371_63713_000118_000000	train-clean-360	 The house I hope to live in with my wife Miss Amy Mason answered Darcy and he spoke in calm contrast to his former excitement We are going to be married in the fall he went on 
6371_63713_000118_000001	train-clean-360	 I had asked missus Darcy to set that statue aside for me 
6371_63713_000118_000002	train-clean-360	Miss Mason admired it and I planned to buy it 
6371_63713_000118_000003	train-clean-360	We had the place all picked out where it would stand But now 
none	none	He did not finish but a shudder seemed to shake his frame It would be a rather grewsome object to have around after it had killed the old lady murmured the reporter
6371_63713_000120_000001	train-clean-360	 But are you sure it did Doc 
6371_63713_000121_000000	train-clean-360	 Pretty sure yes 
6371_63713_000121_000001	train-clean-360	I never make a statement though until after the autopsy 
6371_63713_000121_000002	train-clean-360	No telling what that may develop 
6371_63713_000121_000003	train-clean-360	I ll get at it right away I guess you remember that Murray case he went on to no one in particular 
none	none	There they all thought the man was murdered when as a matter of fact he had been taken with a heart spell fell downstairs and a knife he had in his hand pierced his heart
6371_63713_000122_000000	train-clean-360	 That wasn t your case Doc observed Carroll 
6371_63713_000123_000000	train-clean-360	 No it was before my time 
6371_63713_000123_000001	train-clean-360	But I remember it 
6371_63713_000123_000002	train-clean-360	That s why I m saying nothing until I ve made an examination 
6371_63713_000123_000003	train-clean-360	Better phone the morgue keeper he went on and have them come for the body 
6371_63713_000124_000000	train-clean-360	 Have you have you got to take her away faltered Darcy 
none	none	Yes 
6371_63713_000125_000001	train-clean-360	I m sorry but it wouldn t do here and the doctor motioned to the glittering array of cut glass and plate 
6371_63713_000125_000002	train-clean-360	 You won t keep the store open he inquired 
none	none	No 
6371_63713_000126_000001	train-clean-360	I ll put a notice in the door now and Darcy wrote out one which a clerk affixed to the front door for him 
6371_63713_000127_000000	train-clean-360	 Well that s all I can do now doctor Warren said after his very perfunctory examination 
6371_63713_000127_000001	train-clean-360	 The rest will have to be at the morgue 
6371_63713_000127_000002	train-clean-360	Got a place where I can wash my hands he asked 
6371_63713_000128_000000	train-clean-360	Darcy indicated a little closet near his work bench 
6371_63713_000128_000001	train-clean-360	doctor Warren soon resumed his coat accepted a cigarette from Daley slipped into his still damp rain garment and was soon throbbing down the street in his automobile having announced that he was going to breakfast and would perform the autopsy immediately afterward 
none	none	Soon a black wagon rattled up to the jewelry store bringing fresh acquisitions to the crowd which persisted in staying in spite of the rain which had now changed from a drizzle to a more pronounced downpour 
6371_63713_000130_000000	train-clean-360	More reporters came and Daley fraternized with them the newspaper men aside from the police and Jim Holiday a detective from Prosecutor Bardon s office being the only people admitted to the shop when the clerks had been sent home 
none	none	The morgue keeper s men lifted the fast stiffening body and were about to place it in the wicker carrier when Carroll who was watching them rather idly uttered an exclamation
6371_63713_000132_000000	train-clean-360	 What s up asked Thong quickly 
6371_63713_000132_000001	train-clean-360	He had been strolling about the shop and had come to a stop near Darcy s work table a sort of bench against the wall and behind one of the showcases 
6371_63713_000132_000002	train-clean-360	The bench was fitted with a lathe and on it were parts of watches like the dead specimens preserved in alcohol in a doctor s office 
6371_63713_000132_000003	train-clean-360	 What s up Bill 
6371_63713_000133_000000	train-clean-360	 Look exclaimed Carroll pointing 
6371_63713_000134_000000	train-clean-360	The men from the morgue had the body raised in the air 
6371_63713_000134_000001	train-clean-360	And then in the gleam from the electric lights there was revealed underneath and in the left side of the dead woman a clean slit through her light dress a slit the edges of which were stained with blood 
6371_63713_000135_000000	train-clean-360	 Another wound exclaimed Daley his newspaper instincts quickly aroused by this addition of evidence of mystery 
6371_63713_000135_000001	train-clean-360	 This is getting interesting 
6371_63713_000136_000000	train-clean-360	 It s a cut a deep one too murmured Carroll as he drew nearer to look 
6371_63713_000136_000001	train-clean-360	 Wonder what did it 
6371_63713_000137_000000	train-clean-360	 Shouldn t wonder but it was done with this and Thong held out on the palm of his large hand a slender dagger on the otherwise bright blade of which were some dark stains 
6371_63713_000138_000000	train-clean-360	 Where d you get it demanded Carroll 
6371_63713_000139_000000	train-clean-360	 Over on the watch repair table 
6371_63713_000140_000000	train-clean-360	Darcy gasped 
6371_63713_000141_000000	train-clean-360	 Is that your dagger snapped Carroll at the jewelry worker 
6371_63713_000142_000000	train-clean-360	 It isn t a dagger it s a paper cutter a magazine knife 
6371_63713_000143_000000	train-clean-360	 Well whatever it is who owns it 
6371_63713_000143_000001	train-clean-360	The words were as crisp as the steel of the stained blade 
6371_63713_000144_000000	train-clean-360	Darcy stared at the keen knife and then at the dead woman 
none	none	Who owns it and the question snapped like a whip I don t 
6371_63713_000146_000001	train-clean-360	It was left here by 
none	none	There was a commotion at the side door which had been opened by Mulligan in order that the men might carry out the body of missus Darcy There was a shuffling of feet and a rather thick and unsteady voice asked Whash matter here 
6371_63713_000148_000001	train-clean-360	Place on fire

6371_63713_000149_000000	train-clean-360	 Lo Darcy went on a young man who walked unsteadily into the jewelry store

6371_63713_000152_000001	train-clean-360	The detective held it out and the red spots on it seemed to show brighter in the gleam of the electric lights 
6371_63713_000153_000000	train-clean-360	 Is that your knife Harry King demanded Thong 
6371_63713_000154_000000	train-clean-360	 Sure thash mine

6371_63713_000157_000000	train-clean-360	 No answered the jewelry worker hollowly 
none	none	Then Harry King seemingly for the first time became aware that all was not well in the place he had entered He turned and saw the body of the murdered woman as the men from the morgue Started out with it He started back as though some one had struck him a blow Is she is she dead he gasped Dead missus Darcy Looks that way said Carroll in cool tones You d better come in here and sit down a while Harry he went on and he led the unsteady young man to the rear room while the men from the morgue carried out the lifeless body CHAPTER III THE FISHERMAN From a little green book which from the evidence of its worn covers seemed to have been much read the tall military appearing occupant of a middle seat in the parlor car of the express to Colchester scanned again this passage And if you rove for perch with a minnow then it is best to be alive you sticking your hook through his back fin or a minnow with the hook in his upper lip and letting him swim up and down about mid water or a little lower and you still keeping him about that depth with a cork which ought to be a very little one and the way you are to fish for perch with a small frog Ah a a a It was a long drawn exclamation of anticipatory delight and into the eyes of the military looking traveler there appeared a soft and gentle light as though in fancy he could look off across sunlit meadows to a stream sparkling beneath a blue sky white studded with fleecy clouds where there was a soft carpet of green grass shaded by a noble oak under which he might lounge and listen to the wind rustling the newly born leaves Ah a a a Beg pardon sir but I What The military appearing man sat up with a jerk into sudden stiffness while the soft light died out of his eyes New York papers Don t want the New York papers any of them The man after a swift glance from his green covered book again let his eyes seek its pages The ghost of a smile flickered around his lips Chicago then The latest your hook being fastened through the skin of his leg toward the upper part of it and lastly I will give you Something livelier in the way of reading sir if you wish it broke in the voice of the newsboy who had stopped beside the parlor car chair of the military looking traveler interrupting the reading of the little green covered book I have a new detective story Look here If you interrupt me again when I m reading my Izaak Walton I ll have you put off the train Gad I will sir if I have to do it myself The military appearing traveler snapped the green book against the palm of one hand with a report like that of a pistol thereby causing an old lady asleep in a chair across the aisle to awaken with a start Are we in Have we arrived Is this Colchester she asked sitting up and looking about in startled surprise her bonnet very much askew The newsboy with an abashed air slid down the aisle Madam I sincerely beg your pardon said the tall man who had caused the commotion He arose his green book in one hand and bowed his apologies I regret exceedingly that I startled you But that insufferable young puppy had the extreme audacity to inflict himself on me when I was reading and I lost my temper I am sorry but I You didn t strike him did you asked the old lady reproachfully No madam Though such conduct would have been justified on my part I merely spoke to him It was this this book that I used rather roughly and which awakened you Then aren t we at Colchester yet No madam It is some little ride yet If you will allow me I shall be happy to let you know when we arrive And if you are without any one to help you off with your luggage as it is raining and likely to continue Oh thank you sir but Jabez will meet me I must have dozed off and when I heard that noise Which I regret exceedingly madam interposed the military appearing traveler with another bow The old lady again composed herself The tall man bowed again resumed his seat and tried to read but his feelings had been too much ruffled it was evident to allow a peaceful resumption of his former mood The idea The very idea he murmured speaking to the window against the glass of which the raindrops were now dashing impotently and as though angry at not being admitted to the warmth and light of the car For dusk had fallen and the electric lights were aglow in the Pullman making it a very cosy place in contrast to the damp and muddy country through which the train was rushing Gad what s the world coming to when a man can t read what he likes without every whippersnapper interrupting him with Shag I say Shag he went on raising his voice from a murmured whisper to a louder command Porter send my man here Where s that rascal Shag Yes sah Colonel I m right yeah Yeah I is Colonel and a negro with a picturesque fringe of white kinky hair shuffled from the porter s quarters where he had been enjoying a quiet chat with the black knight of the whisk broom What is you desire Colonel I want peace and quiet Shag That s what I want Twice I ve tried to read my book undisturbed and that insufferable train boy that rascal who probably doesn t know an ant fly from a piece of cheese has bothered me with books and papers He ought to know I ve vowed not to look at a paper for two weeks and as for books Colonel Robert Lee Ashley closed his volume which bore in gold letters on the front green cover the words Walton s Complete Angler and laughed silently the wrinkles of his face and around his steel blue eyes sending the frown scurrying for some unseen trench Shag asked the colonel still chuckling what do you think that nincompoop had the infernal audacity to offer me in the way of a book I ain t got no idea Colonel not th leastest in th world He offered me a detective story Shag Oh mah good Lord Colonel Not really Yes he did Shag A detective story Oh mah good Lord Shag which was all Colonel Ashley ever called his servant though the colored valet rejoiced in the prefixes of George Washington threw up his hands in horror and shook his head The colonel after a period of silent chuckling mirth opened his book again and read And after this manner you may catch a trout in a hot evening When as you walk by a brook and shall hear or see him leap at flies then if you get a grasshopper Gad that s the life softly voiced the colonel Then turning to the still waiting Shag he went on There s nobody in the wide world who can bring peace and quiet to an angry mind like my friend Izaak Walton is there Shag No sah Colonel they isn t Nobody Of course not Gad I m glad you agree with me Shag Yes sah Colonel Um Here you go and give that newsboy a quarter Tell him I didn t mean anything but never again must he interrupt me when he sees me with Walton in my hand Anything but that It s positively indecent Yes sah Colonel I done tell him that And it it s sacrilegious Shag Yes sah Colonel tis that Well tell him so and give him a half dollar Now don t disturb me again until we get to Colchester How s the weather Shag Well sah Colonel it s it s sorter moist Colonel Um Well it ll be better by to morrow I expect when we go fishing And be careful of my rods when you take the grips off If you so much as scratch the tip of even my oldest one I I ll well you know what I ll do to you Shag Yes sah I knows Colonel Very well Give that boy a dollar Maybe he never read Walton and that s why he s so ignorant Colonel Ashley settled back in his chair and with unfurrowed brow read on you shall see or hear him leap at flies then if you get a grasshopper put it on your hook with your line about two yards long standing behind a bush or tree where his hole is Once more the colonel was happy Shag sought out the discomfited newsboy and chuckling as had his master handed the lad a dollar Say what s this for questioned the lad in astonishment Colonel done say to give it to you fo hurtin yo feelin s He did Great Say does he want a book a paper Say I got a swell detective story The boy started out of the compartment Oh mah good Lord Fo th love of honey cakes don t gasped Shag grabbing him just in time Does yo know who the colonel is No but he s mighty white if he wants to buy a dollar s worth of books and papers I haven t sold much on this trip but if he But he don t want to boy Don t you understan Jes listen to me right now De colonel don t want nothin but Walton an his angle worms Who s Walton What road s he travel on He don t travel He s daid I reckon But he done writ a book on fishin poles an dat s all the colonel reads when he ain t workin much It s a book bout angle worms as neah as I kin make out You mean Izaak Walton s Complete Angler I guess said a man who passed by just then on his way to the smoking compartment and he smiled genially at Shag Dat s it yes sah I knowed it had suffin t do wif angle worms Well boy dat book s all de colonel ever reads when he s vacationin an dat s whut he s doin now jest vacationin When we start away dis mawnin he say to me the colonel did Now Shag I don t want t be boddered wif nuffin I don t want t read no papers I don t want t heah bout no battles murder an sudden deaths I jest wants peace an quiet an fish He done come up heah t go fishin laik he go t lots other places though he ain t been heah fo good many years An boy he specially tell me not t let him be boddered wif book agents I ain t a book agent objected the train boy I knows you ain t admitted Shag I knows yo ain t but yo sells books an dat s whut s de trouble Whut kind of a book did yo offer de colonel jest now A detective story And say it s a swell one let me tell you Oh mah good Lord ejaculated Shag Dat s de wustest ever and he doubled up with silent mirth Why what s the matter with that asked the boy I ve seen heaps of men read detective stories Judge Dolan he rides on my train a lot and he s always askin what I got new in detective stuff Um yep Well dat may be all right fo Judge Dolan went on Shag slowly recovering from his fit of chuckling but mah marster don t want none of dat kind of readin Why asked the boy Shag s answer was given in a peculiar manner He looked around carefully and saw that the strange man had moved on and they were alone Then leaning toward the newsboy and whispering the negro said My marster Colonel Brentnall dat ain t his real name but it s de one he goes by sometimes he don t care fo no detective stories cause he done make his livin an mine too at detectin He says he don t ever want t read em cause dey ain t at all like whut happens De colonel was one of de biggest private detectives in de United States boy He s sorter retired now but still he s chock full of crimes murder an stuff laik dat an dat s why he done sent yo away sorter rough laik You say he s a private detective asked the boy his eyes opening wide Dat s whut he is And his name is Colonel Brentnall Well honey dat ain t his real name He don t laik t use dat promiscuious laik cause so many folks bodder him If I was t tell yo his real name yo d open yo eyes wider yet But take it from me went on Shag he don t need no books t make excitin readin fo him He s been froo it fo yeahs Sufferin tadpoles murmured the boy And to think I was offering him a detective yarn Say no wonder he flew at me He didn t mean nothin said Shag still chuckling as he thought of the scene It s jest his way The train rumbled on through the early night and in his comfortable chair Colonel Ashley read his Walton the ingratiating humor of the dear old fisherman gradually dispelling all other thoughts Colonel Ashley at this stage of his career was almost an international figure Having served with distinction in the Spanish American war among his exploits being the capture of a number of spies in a sensational manner he had become the head of the police department in a large city in the East He had continued the work begun in the army a branch of the secret service and had built up the city s detective department in an almost marvelous manner he himself being one of its keenest sleuths Desiring more time to devote to the detection of crimes of other than ordinary interest and realizing that the routine of police work was too hampering for him the colonel had opened an office in New York where straightway he received from the government and private persons more work than he could well attend to Now that he was getting old he had some able assistants but most cases still received his own attention at some stage of their development This was characteristic of the colonel He was always going to retire in fact he said he had but somehow or other it was like a singer s farewell always postponed And now Shag don t forget what I told you he said to his attendant as the train drew into Colchester Don t you so much as scratch the varnish on the tip of one of my rods And if you let me hear a whisper of anything bordering on a case you and I part company do you hear I heahs yo Colonel and the negro saluted for the detective still clung to many of his military associations Then having kept his promise in seeing that the old lady was safely helped from the train Colonel Ashley followed his valet burdened with bags and rods The fishing rods Shag carried he must have managed to transport safely to the hotel the colonel was to occupy for a two weeks vacation and rest for the military detective was smiling and good natured when he took them from their cases and gently placed them on the bed Anything else Colonel asked Shag when he had laid out his master s clothes and was preparing to go to his own apartment in an annex to the hotel No I guess that s all Shag But what s your hurry You aren t usually in such haste to leave me even if you have laid out all my duds What s the matter Got some friends in town Oh no sah Colonel No indeedy tain t dat at all Well what is it Why are you in such haste to get away Um Ah Well I don t laiks fo t tell yo Colonel and Shag seemed uneasy You don t like to tell me Look here you black rascal don t try to hide anything from me do you hear You know me and Oh indeedy I does know yo Colonel Dat s jest why I don t wan t tell yo It it s bout one ob dem t ings What things Shag you rascal

taken my oath on it cried the excitable colonel Here I come to this place to have some quiet fishing in the suburbs to get a complete rest and yet not be too far from civilization and no sooner do I get off the train than there s a murder mystery thrust right under my nose Right under my nose By Gad I knew it Shag stood resting his weight first on one foot and then on the other his head bowed He was trying to keep from slipping from under his vest where he had hidden it a newspaper with glaring black headlines Shag looked timidly at his master Colonel Ashley paced up and down the room pausing now and then to listen to the dash of rain against the windows for the storm bearing out its promise of the morning had lasted all day changing from a drizzle to a downpour and from a downpour to a drizzle with dismal repetition The colonel glanced at Shag and then drawing from an inner pocket the little green book read Hunting is a game for princes and noble persons It hath been highly prized in all ages It was one of the qualifications The detective snapped the book shut and tossed it on the bed Shag he exploded Yes sah Colonel You ve often heard me talk of fishing and hunting haven t you Deed an I has Colonel many a time Yes sah Humph Yes Well detective work is a sort of hunt isn t it Shag Yes sah Colonel Dat s jest what it is Many an many a time I se done heah yo say yo s goin out t

where we done come t hab puffick rest an quiet an fishin just laik yo done said on de train Humph A murder mystery right here in town I thought I heard the newsboys shouting something about it at the station But I didn t listen Who s killed Shag Why Colonel sah it s a poor ole lady an Stop Shag Not another word How dare you try to get me interested in a case when I told you if you so much as breathed anything about one I d horsewhip you I told you that didn t I Deed an yo did Colonel The detective paced up and down the room He reached for the little green book Then as if in desperation he turned to the shrinking negro and went on You say there s a mystery about it Shag Yes sah Colonel Yes sah and he made a motion toward the paper that was slipping from under his vest Stop it cried the colonel I came here to fish and read Izaak Walton in the shade of a big tree along some quiet brook If you so much as bring a paper into this room I ll send you back to Virginia where you belong Shag Yes sah Colonel The military looking detective resumed his pacing of the room his hands behind his back clasping and unclasping nervously Shag he suddenly called Yes sah Colonel Is it much of a mystery I mean er anything but the usual blood and thunder stuff Why Colonel began the black man eagerly it s de beatenist mystery dat ever was all bout a murdered jewelry lady what s got her haid busted in with a big gold statue an a gold knife stab in her side an a watch shut up tight in her hand tickin an tickin an tickin laik it was her heart beatin an her cousin done find her in a pool of blood on de floor an de clocks all stopped an a rich young spendthrift comes in an claims de dagger an de detectives Shag fairly shouted his master Yes sah Colonel Out of the room this instant and don t you dare come back until I send for you Yes sah Colonel The old colored man turned slowly to the door His manner was dejected Evidently he had given serious offense Silently he turned the knob but before he had stepped over the threshhold he heard a voice calling softly Shag Yes sah Colonel Eh Shag before you go you er you might leave me that paper I see under your vest I may have occasion to to glance at it to see what to morrow s weather is going to be for fishing Yes sah Colonel And with a carefully concealed grin on his face Shag drew the black lettered paper from under his waistcoat and laid it on the bed beside the Complete Angler CHAPTER IV SPOTTY Well now observed Detective Thong and somehow or other his voice sounded really cheerful let s see where we re at mister Darcy Have you looked over the stock all you want to They were in a room in the rear of the jewelry store the city and county detectives the reporters and James Darcy with Policeman Mulligan on guard near the cut glass and silver gleaming in the showcases On guard near a dark red stain in the floor scarcely dry it was still soaking into the wood The body of the murdered woman had been taken away followed by a sigh of relief from James Darcy who try as he did could not keep his eyes from seeking it The stock is checked up as well as I can do it in a short time replied the jewelry worker who had spent some time going over the store under the watchful eyes of Carroll and Thong I m not sure anything is taken If there is as I said it can t be much But I ll go over everything more carefully checking up the books That will take a few days but I can do it while I m here arranging for the funeral Not here you can t do it broke in Carroll with a short laugh Not here There was startled amazement in Darcy s question No Why not Because you won t be here You d better come with us You ll have to in fact The captain ll want to have a talk with you and I guess the prosecutor the same How about it Jim and he looked over at Haliday from the Court House He was examining the side door leading to the alley Oh sure he ll have to be held as a witness anyhow was the easy answer and in the same breath he added Not a mark Not a scratch on the place It was an inside job all right Held I ll have to be held faltered Darcy Of course said Thong And while you re at it take a friend s advice and keep your mouth shut You mean anything I say might might be used against me Oh I wouldn t put it that way exactly That s moving picture stuff theater business you know We don t go in for that not me and Carroll But don t talk too much Of course you ll have to answer a lot of questions and the easier you do the better for you But wait until they re asked Maybe it s against my interests to say that but I ve sort of took a notion to you Now you d better get ready to leave You mean lock the place up Oh no somebody ll have to stay here Not me interrupted Mulligan I haven t had my breakfast I was jest comin in off dog watch when I happened to see what was goin on here the crowd an everythin I ain t goin to stay Well phone in then and get somebody advised Carroll testily Somebody s got to be here until we can look around more I ll stay for a while said Haliday I d like to look about a bit myself I ll probably have to get the case ready for the prosecutor Well let s be going then suggested Thong Shall I ring for the wagon His partner shook his head after a look at Darcy The trolley ll be all right for him he said in a whisper We can get out the back way and avoid the crowd for the street in front of the jewelry store was still thronged in spite of the ever increasing rain As for King he s asleep and I guess we can put him to bed here If we try to carry him out there ll be more of a push than there is now Let him sleep it off and he glanced at a huddled figure in a corner chair Who s asleep broke in the thick voice of the wastral Whash matter you fellers anyhow Man comes in get li l preshent for his wife wife sits up all night waitin she s titled to li l preshent Wheresh my gold knife Darcy I give it to you have grave Pearl s name wheresh my knife You can have it pretty soon promised Thong Look here Harry my boy You re pretty drunk for a fact but do you happen to know where you were and what you did last night and early this morning Try to think it may mean a lot to you and he spoke earnestly Where were you what did you do What I did He blinked his eyes rapidly to rid them of the water which poured forth in an effort to assuage their drink inflamed condition and regarded those about him with half drunken gravity What I did You want to know what what I did Yes Where were you and what did you do asked Carroll easily Hu Got drunk thash what I did Can t you see I m drunk yet but I don t care Ha Had one swell time thash what I did One whale of a good time It was some night a wet night believe me a wet night awful wet Never had so mush fun never We got ole Doc Harrison stewed to the gills hones we did stewed like like prunes apricots Ho Thash what we did Guess he wasn t the only one observed Carroll grimly Now look here King You re pretty drunk yet but maybe you can get this through your noodle There s been some nasty business and you may or may not know something about it though I don t believe you do for you re so pickled now that you must have been loading up ever since last week But you ve got to answer some questions when you re able and it s a question of holding you here or taking you with us How about it Look here snarled King and his voice rang out with sudden energy Who you talkin to Now take it easy Harry advised Thong We re talking to you of course Harry King seemed to begin the process of sobering up His eyes lost something of their bleary misunderstanding look and took on a dangerous glint The detectives knew him for a spendthrift who had been in more than one questionable escapade He had a violent temper drunk or sober once it was roused and it did not take much liquor to make him a veritable devil Though after his first wild burst he became maudlin and silly King came of a good family but his relatives had cast him off after his midnight marriage to an actress of questionable morals with whom it was not a first offense and he now lived after his own peculiar fashion on the income of an estate settled on him in his better days by an aunt Now and then he managed to get larger advances than the stipulated sum from a rascally lawyer who took a chance of reimbursing himself a hundred per cent when Harry King should come to the end of his rope a time which seemed not far off if the present were any indication He was to inherit the bulk of his fortune when he became thirty five years of age He was now thirty three but the pace he was going and keeping made his chances of living out the stated allotment seem meager I m talking to you Harry my boy went on the detective and I advise you for your own good to keep a civil tongue in your head If you don t you may get into trouble There s been a murder A murder King s voice was more certain now Yes You saw the body carried out or are you still so drunk you can t remember It was missus Darcy the lady who owned this jewelry store you know Now pull yourself together You ve got to come with us and explain a little about this knife of yours She was stabbed with that With my knife that paper cutter dagger I was giving as a present to to my wife King s voice was sobering more now That s the idea Harry But I brought that knife to Darcy to have him engrave it That may be It was used to cut the old lady though and laid back on Darcy s work table Come now brace up and tell us all you know about it Oh I I can brace up all right So the old lady s dead is she Killed stabbed Too bad Many s the trinket I ve bought of her for for well some of the girls you know and he winked suggestively at the detectives Old lady Darcy s dead Say look here boys he exclaimed with a sudden change of manner as something seemed to penetrate to his sodden brain you you don t for a minute think I did this do you and he sat up straight for the first time Never mind what we think said Carroll We re not paid for telling it like the reporters and he grinned at Daley of the Times We want to get at the facts Are you in condition to talk Not here interrupted Thong quickly with a glance at the newspaper men which they were quick to interpret Oh it s all right boys went on the detective We ll let you in for anything that s going as soon as we can you know that Sure agreed Daley But don t keep us waiting all day The presses are like animals they have to be fed you know First editions don t wait for gum shoe men even if they re of the first water And I ve got a city editor who has a temper like a bear with a sore nose in huckleberry time So loosen up as soon as you can They took King and Darcy to police headquarters in a taxicab which King with still half drunken gravity insisted on paying for Colonel Ashley or Colonel Brentnall as he had registered at the hotel having by means of a more or less adroit bit of camouflage obtained possession of the newspaper containing an account of the murder of missus Darcy and of the holding of her cousin and Harry King on suspicion tossed the journal on the bed beside his well worn copy of the Complete Angler Then to demonstrate his complete mastery over himself he picked up the book never so much as glancing at the black headlines and read I have found it to be a real truth that the very sitting by the river s side is not only the quietest and fittest place for contemplation but will invite the angler to it I m a fool exploded the colonel I came here to fish and first click of the reel I go nosing around on the trail of a murder when I vowed I wouldn t even dream of a case I won t either that s flat I ll get my rods in shape to go fishing to morrow It may clear Then Shag and I Slowly the book slipped from his hand It fell on the bed with a soft thud and a breeze from the partly opened window ruffled a page of the newspaper The colonel looking guiltily around the room walked nearer to the bed and then as stealthily as though committing a theft he picked up the Times Softly he exclaimed Gad what s the use A moment later pulling his chair beneath an electric light he began to read the account of the murder Pete Daley s story of the finding of the dead body of the owner of the jewelry store was a graphic bit of work He described how Darcy coming down in the gray dawn had discovered the woman lying stark and cold her head crushed and a stab wound in her side None of the details was lacking though the gruesomeness was skilfully covered with some well done descriptive writing The wounds seemed to have been inflicted at the same time one by the metal statue of a hunter found on the floor near the body the other by a dagger like paper cutter admitted to be owned by Harry King but which with the blade blood stained was found on the jewelry bench of her cousin James Darcy The solution of the murder mystery depended on the answers to two questions the reporter pointed out First which wound killed missus Darcy Second who inflicted either or both wounds There were ramifications from these beginnings such as the motive for the crime whether or not there had been a robbery and if so by whom committed Then to get to the more personal problem did either King or Darcy commit the murder and if so why Um mused the colonel reading the Times on the evening of the day the crime was discovered It may turn out to be a mystery after all in spite of the two men who are held Let s see now and he went on with his perusal of the paper The autopsy had been performed and doctor Warren had said either wound might have caused death for the skull was badly fractured and vital organs had been pierced by the dagger which the papers called it though it really was a paper cutter of foreign make King and Darcy were not as yet formally arrested being detained merely at police headquarters as witnesses though there was no question but that suspicion was cast on both Under the law a formal charge must be made against them within twenty four hours and unless this was done King s lawyer threatened to bring habeas corpus proceedings for his client Oh there ll be a charge made before then all right said Thong easily when the legal shyster had with threatening finger under the detective s nose made much of this point I m not saying it will be against your man mister Fussell but there ll be a charge made all right It is needless to say that both suspected men protested they knew nothing about the killing King was frank enough sober now to say he had been drunk all night spending the hours with boon companions in a notorious resort a statement which seemed capable enough of proof Darcy told over and over again how he had come downstairs to find his relative stretched on the floor of the shop and aside from that little restless period of the night he had heard no disturbance Sallie Page could tell nothing the maid was out of the city and none of the clerks knew more of what had happened than they were told Playing up Darcy s story Daley and some of the other reporters speculated on whether or not a burglar might have entered the store leaving no trace of his uncanny skill and in his wanderings about the place have entered Darcy s room He might even have attempted to chloroform the jewelry worker it was suggested and perhaps did slightly Then descending to the store the intruder might have started to loot the safe when he was disturbed by missus Darcy who may have come down to see what the unusual noise was Such at least was a theory and one several took stock in At any rate Darcy after having been aroused by what he knew not had gone to sleep again only to awaken to hurry down to do the repair work on the watch of the East Indian the watch that was found so uncannily ticking in the otherwise silent jewelry store clasped in the hand of the dead woman It was mentioned that Singa Phut was being kept under observation though no suspicion attached to him Darcy had at first nervously and then indignantly protested his innocence King continually doing the latter Naturally there followed even with the faint suspicions so far engendered the question as to what the possible object for the crime could have been presuming either man had been involved It was known that King was constantly in debt in spite of his allowance and the more substantial advances he received from time to time He had patronized the jewelry store and he admitted owing missus Darcy quite a large sum for a brooch he had purchased for his wife some time before It was of course possible that he had in his drunken state gone to the store to get the paper cutter which some peculiar kink or twist in his drink inflamed brain had caused him to remember at an odd time Or perhaps he had run short of money when playing cards and have gone to missus Darcy s store to borrow or see if he could not get something on which he might raise cash Harry King was known to have been gambling the night before the game lasting until nearly morning and at one stage when King was broke he had excused himself gone out into the night alone and had come back well supplied with funds Asked jokingly by his cronies where he had got the money he had said a lady gave it to him He resumed play only to lose and had staggered out into the gray dawn which was the last his companions had seen of him He next appeared at the jewelry store after the murder Sobered King s explanation was that a lady had really given him the money but who she was or why she gave him funds at two o clock in the morning he would not say He admitted calling at the jewelry store somewhere around eleven o clock at night for the purpose of seeing if the engraving on the paper cutter had been finished King was not so very drunk then he said He was just starting in The store was closed he said but he added a bit of testimony that caused Colonel Ashley and others to think a bit King said that though the front doors to the store were locked he knowing the place well had gone around to the side door in the alley thinking that might not yet be fastened He hoped he said to be able to get in and procure the present for his wife But this door too was locked though through the glass he could see a light in the rear room And he could hear voices which were raised louder than ordinary The voices King added were those of missus Darcy and her cousin James Darcy and it was evident that a quarrel was in progress Asked as to the nature of the dispute King had said he had heard mentioned several times the name Amy There was also something said about money and an electric lathe Naturally there was an inquiry as to who Amy was and what was meant by the electric lathe Darcy answered with seeming frankness that the Amy in question was Miss Mason daughter of Adrian Mason wealthy stockman of Pompey a village about ten miles from Colchester mister Mason had what was often referred to as a show place with blooded horses and cattle and he was quite a financial figure in Monroe county of which Colchester was the county seat Besides this Amy was well off in her own right her uncle having left her a half interest in a valuable mine James Darcy and Amy Mason were engaged to be married though this fact was known to but few and made quite a sensation when Darcy admitted it after his arrest He and Amy had known each other since childhood and when small had lived near each other mister Mason in spite of his wealth was a democratic man and though he knew and Amy also that she might have married wealth and position both were passed up to quote the stockman himself in favor of a real love match For that is what it was He s a man that s what James Darcy is Amy s father had said when some one hinted that he had neither wealth nor family of which to boast He s a man He s got all the family he needs What s a family good for anyhow after you re grown up As for money I ve got more than I need and Amy s got a little nest egg of her own Besides Darcy can earn his living which is a hanged sight more than some of these dancing lizards can do if they were put to it It developed that the words over Amy which had occurred just before the murder between James Darcy and his cousin had to do with the difference in the worldly prospects of the two young people missus Darcy had rather laughed at him James said for thinking of marrying a girl so much wealthier than he was What did you tell her asked Carroll I mean your cousin I told her I could support my wife decently well if not in such state as that to which she was accustomed in her father s house As for style neither Miss Mason nor I care for it And if things go right I may be able to bring her as much wealth as she has herself How do you mean if things go right asked the detective Well if I can perfect the electric lathe I am trying to patent was the answer Oh so that s what King heard about an electric lathe I suppose so It s no great secret I ve been working on it for some time but my cousin objected to my spending my time that way She thought I should devote it all to her interests even outside the shop I told her I had my own future to look to and we often had words about that Last night s quarrel wasn t the first though she was especially bitter over my work on the lathe I have been giving it more time than usual because it is nearly finished and I want to get it ready to show at a big Eastern jewelry convention And what was the talk about money Well missus Darcy owed me about a thousand dollars I had done some special work on making necklaces for her customers and she had promised if they were pleased to pay me extra for the exclusive designs I got up The customers were pleased and they paid her extra for the ornaments So I demanded that she keep her promise but she refused pleading that many other customers owed her and times were hard I needed that thousand dollars to help complete my lathe model and well we had words over that too Then do I understand summed up Carroll that the night missus Darcy was killed you had a quarrel with her over Miss Mason and about the money and because you spent too much time working on your patent lathe Well yes though I don t admit I spent too much time and I surely will claim she owed me that money As for Miss Mason I d prefer to have her name left out faltered the young jeweler We can t always have what we want said Thong dryly Was the quarrel specially bitter Not any more so than others I had to speak a little loud for my cousin was getting a trifle deaf And after the quarrel you went to bed Yes And you didn t see your cousin again until when and Carroll looked Darcy straight in the eyes Not until after she was dead Um I guess that s all now They let the young man go back to his room in police headquarters It was not a cell yet though it would seem likely to come to that for Thong observed to his partner as they went downstairs Well there s a motive all right Three if you like But none of em hardly strong enough for murder Oh I don t know I hear he has quite a temper different from Harry King s but enough especially if he got riled about the old lady talking against his girl You never can tell No that s so Left alone James Darcy threw himself into a chair and looked blankly at the dull painted wall This is fierce he murmured It will be a terrible blow to Amy I wonder I wonder if she ll have anything to do with me after this The shame of it the disgrace Oh Amy if I could only know and he reached out his hand as though to thrust them beyond the confines of the walls He bowed his head in his arms and was silent and motionless a long time Up in his hotel room Colonel Ashley read the story of the case as printed in the Times This does begin to get interesting he mused as he finished reading the account There are three possible motives in Darcy s case and one in King s And I ve known murder to be done on slighter provocation Darcy might have resented being called a fortune hunter which I suppose is what the old lady meant or he may have been stung to sudden passion by the holding back of the thousand dollars and the taunts about his lathe Most inventors are crazy anyhow As for King if he was drunk enough and wanted money or thought he could get some diamonds it might be it might be I wonder who his lady friend is He daren t tell I suppose on account of his wife I wonder Oh what am I bothering about it for anyhow I came here to rest and fish and I m going to I ve resigned from detective work There He tossed the paper behind the bed I ll not look at another issue Now let s see how my rods are I m going to get an early start in the morning if this infernal rain lets up Blast that Shag He s jammed a ferrule and with blazing eyes the colonel looked at one of the joints of his choicest rod A brass connection had been bent That s a shame It ll never work that way never I ve got to go out and see if I can t get it mended Wonder if there s a decent sporting goods store in this part of town I ll go out and have a look He made himself ready taking the two parts of the fishing rod with him Inquiry at the hotel desk supplied him with the information as to the location of the store and the detective was soon out in the wet streets breathing in deep of the damp air for it was fresh and that was what the colonel liked Somehow or other the address of the jewelry store clung to his mind and almost unconsciously he found himself heading in that direction Well I am a fool he murmured as he passed the place now ghostly with its one light in front of the safe The police had taken charge pending the arrival of a relative of missus Darcy s Inside the cut glass and silver gleamed as of old but on the floor sunk deep in the grain of the wood now was the spot of blood fit to keep company with the red rubies in the locked safe Quite a place murmured the colonel as he passed on toward the sporting goods store Quite a place Oh hang it I must get it out of my mind In spite of his rather exacting demands regarding a ferrule for his rod he found what he wanted and feeling quite satisfied now as he noted that the weather showed some slight signs of clearing the colonel started back for his hotel walking slowly for it was not yet late Just how it happened not even Colonel Ashley naturally the most interested person could tell afterward But as the detective was crossing a crowded street a big auto truck swung around a corner and he found himself directly in its path as he stepped off the curb Active as he always kept himself the old detective sprang back out of the way But fate in the person of a small boy had just a little while before dropped a banana skin on the streets And the colonel stepped squarely on this peeling as he tried to retreat There was a sudden sliding an endeavor to retain his footing and then Colonel Ashley fell prostrate his fishing rod pieces spinning from his fingers Down he went and the truck thundered straight at him It was almost upon him and the big solid front tires were about to crush him in spite of the frantic efforts of the driver to swerve his machine to one side when a slim figure dashed from the crowd on the sidewalk and with an indistinguishable cry seized the colonel by the shoulders fairly dragging him with a desperate burst of strength from the very path of death There were gasps of alarm and sighs of relief The driver of the truck swore audibly but it was more a prayer than an oath The colonel grimy and muddy was set on his feet by his rescuer and several men gathered about The colonel was a bit dazed but not so much so that he could not hear several murmur He saved his life all right Recovering his breath and the control of his nerves at about the same time the detective his voice trembling in spite of himself turned to the man who had dragged him from almost under the big wheels and said Sir you did save my life You saved me from a horrible death and saying so doesn t begin to thank you or tell you what I mean If you ll have the goodness sir to call a taxi for me and come with me to my hotel I can then The colonel came to a halting and sudden pause as he saw the face of the slim little man who had saved him a face covered with freckles which were splotched over the cheeks the turned up nose and reaching back to the wide set ears Spotty Spotty Morgan gasped the detective as he recognized a New York gunman who was supposed to have more than one killing to his credit or debit according as you happen to reckon Spotty Morgan You you here gasped the detective The rescuer who had been grinning cheerfully went white under his copper freckles My gawd It s you Colonel Further words were stopped by the detective s hand placed softly quickly and so dexterously as hardly to be seen by those in the crowd over the mouth of the speaker No names here whispered the colonel in the big ear of the man who had saved him from death The slim little man gave a wiggle like an eel and would have darted away through the crowd but there was a vice like grip on his shoulder that he knew but too well Spotty my name s Brentnall for the present said the colonel with a grim smile And you d better come with me How about it Spotty Morgan hesitated a moment nodded silently and then arm in arm with the man whom he had pulled from the path of the big truck went down the street the mist and rain swallowing them up CHAPTER V AMY S APPEAL Tinkling glasses formed a friendly rampart between Colonel Ashley and Spotty Morgan Spotty looked narrowly and shrewdly at the detective I didn t expect to see you here remarked the gunman speaking out of the side of his mouth with scarcely a motion of his lips a habit acquired through long practice in preventing prison keepers from finding out that he was disobeying the rules regarding silence Not for a minute did I expect to run across you here Colonel As Not that name Spotty if you please and the fisherman detective smiled in easy fashion You know my little habits in that regard I m known here as Brentnall and if it s all the same to you just use that As for you if Spotty Oh that suits me as well as any other I can change whenever I like Spotty raised a glass to his lips and with a murmured here s how let the contents slide down his always parched throat That s so Spotty Well I didn t expect to see you here I give you my word When did you leave New York Well I come away Hold on interrupted the colonel Don t answer I shouldn t have asked I forgot you saved my life just now Gad it isn t the first time I ve nearly passed over but not in that way and he reached for his glass to conceal the shudder that passed over him as he thought of the rumbling wheels of the thundering truck Well Colonel I Never mind Spotty Perhaps the less you talk the better off you ll be Does anybody in town know you re here Well my picture Yes it is probably down at headquarters But they re too busy to look for it now But they may later So far you haven t been recognized then Only by you and it d take a pretty clever guy No compliments Spotty We ve gotten over that You disguised yourself very well but the freckles show through Yes damn em heartily exploded the gunman I can t cover em up I ve tried everything but I guess I ll have to go togged up like a colored man to fool the other bulls As for you Colonel There you go again Cut it out This is business Yes good business for you but bad for me I didn t think you d get after me so soon Colonel I m not after you Spotty The detective spoke quietly but the effect on the man sitting across the table from him in one of the less conspicuous cafes in Colchester had the effect of a shout Not after me You ain t and Spotty drew away from the array of glasses and bottles so suddenly that he overturned a tumbler with its tinkling chunk of ice Not after me Colonel No I came here for a quiet bit of fishing and I just stumbled on this case against my will I m not even working on it and I m not going to Nobody knows I m in town except my man Shag and you I know I can depend on Shag and as for you I m with you till the cows come to roost Colonel I m strong fer you I kin forget I ever saw you That s good I thought you d be that way So as no one knows I m in town the colonel knew nothing of what Shag had said to the newsboy I can keep under cover and have my fishing as I like it quiet I don t intend any one shall know I m here either Now Spotty I m a plain spoken man when there s occasion for it and this is one of those times I guess You saved my life just now I know that Of course I realize I might just have been badly hurt and perhaps have lingered on in a hospital for some years but that would be worse than death I consider that you saved my life I couldn t have moved out of the way of that truck any more than I could have flown I realize it more and more You did me the biggest service one man can do another and I m not going to forget it Spotty No I guess remembering is your long suit Colonel Well that s all in a day s work I didn t forget you Spotty Now as I said you saved my life I believe in turning the tables and though I can t do for you what you did for me maybe I can help in a way You kin gamble on that Colonel Listen to me Spotty and the detective leaned forward and spoke in a low tense voice Just now as I say I m not in this case Not being a public official I m not bound to use what knowledge or suspicions I have regarding this matter and I m not particularly interested as yet So I m going to give you a chance just as you gave me mine now It isn t exactly the same for maybe you wouldn t lose your life You ve been devilishly lucky and gotten through more narrow places than I d ever give you credit for So it may seem that I m not quite squaring the account but it s all I can do now I m going to give you your chance I m not going to ask you any questions You know what you know and I know what I know Now Spotty streak it out of town as fast as a train can take you and don t come back Spotty Morgan made little wet rings on the table with his empty glass A waiter hovering near by caught the glint of his eye and brought the liquor Then Spotty after a libation spoke Colonel he said slowly most of what you has been spielin is like the lawyer guys git off in court I don t quite tumble but I take it you mean you re goin t let me go That s it Spotty I m going to let you go this time No double crossin You know me better than that I ll give you twenty four hours to get out of town After that I may happen to know more than I know now and it would be my duty whether I m officially on the case or not to arrest you But now you re free It s your life and liberty for mine maybe not quite an even exchange since you d have more than even chances if it came to a trial I suppose But it s the best I can do I m giving you this chance I d be a dirty dog if I didn t But remember this Spotty I give you only one chance just as you gave me just as you took one and saved me If I see you again and this thing hangs over you I may have to pull you up All right Colonel That s a square deal But don t worry You won t see me if I see you first I didn t dream you d be after me so soon for the job I only done last night I d oughter cleared out but I was waitin for a pal an Oh well it was just like you to come around early Man don t you understand I m not after you I didn t for an instant think you had a hand in it until just now And I m not admitting even yet that you did have I haven t done a tap of work on the case and I m not going to My advise to you is to get out of town before I may get into this thing against my will Skip Spotty It s the only way I can pay my debt to you The colonel made as though to hold out his hand to the freckle faced man opposite him and then changed the motion of his arm and picked up his glass Skip Spotty he murmured again All right Colonel I will I know when the goin s good So long And thanks Spotty still talking through the corner of his mouth gave a quick glance around the room and slid out of a side door like an eel disappearing into the rain and mist For some little time the colonel sat before the glasses in which the cracked ice was rapidly melting He too made little rings of water on the table I wonder he mused I wonder if I did right His hand sought his pocket and came out empty I guess I must have left it on the bed he murmured But I can remember it Then as though reading from the little green book he recited But if the old salmon gets to the sea and he recovers his strength and comes next summer to the same river if it be possible Spotty is a veritable salmon mused the colonel even if he is speckled like a trout I wonder if he gets into the sea of New York if I ll ever be able to land him Well he gave me my life and I just had to give him a chance for his It was all I could do Now to fish and forget everything It was a fair morning in April with the sun just right with the wind in the west when the fish bite best and Colonel Robert Lee Ashley with the faithful Shag to carry his rods creel and a lunch basket sallied forth from his hotel for a day beside a no very distant stream the virtues of which he had heard were most alluring as regarded trout Shag exclaimed the colonel when they were tramping through a field near the river having reached that vantage point by a most prosaic trolley car this is a beautiful day It suah am sah And I m going to catch some fine fish I suah does hope so Colonel All right then Now don t say another word until I speak to you We ll be there pretty soon and if there s one thing more than another that I hate it s to have some one talking when I m fishing Yes sah Colonel Um Well see that you mind Selecting with care a fly from his numerous collection and hoping the appetites of the fish would incline them to consider it favorably that morning Colonel Ashley proceeded to make his casts standing not far from a bent gnarled and twisted elm tree that overhung the bank of the stream where the current had cut into the soil making a deep eddy in which a lazy trout might choose to lie in wait for some choice morsel Lightly as a falling feather the fisherman let his fly come to rest on the sun lit water and hardly had it sent the first few faint ripples circling toward shore than there was a shrill song of the reel and the rod became a bent bow By the bones of Sir Izaak cried the colonel I ve hooked one Shag De Lord be praised So yo has Colonel cried the negro Shut up ordered the colonel who was beginning to play his fish Did I tell you to speak But Shag only laughed He knew his master After ten minutes of skilful work during which time the trout nearly got away by shooting under a submerged log like an undersea boat diving beneath a battle cruiser the colonel landed his fish dropping it panting on the green grass Then he looked up at Shag and remarked Didn t I tell you this was a perfectly beautiful day Yo suah did Colonel was the chuckling answer Yo suah did And so much at peace with himself and all the world was Colonel Robert Lee Ashley just then that when the crackling of the underbrush behind him a moment later gave notice that some one was approaching there was even a smile on his face though usually he could not bear to be intruded upon when fishing Rather idly the colonel having mercifully killed his fish by a blow on top of the head and slipped it into the grass lined creel looked up to see approaching a young lady and a tall and somewhat lanky boy There was some thing vaguely familiar about the boy though the fisherman did not tax his mind with remembering then where or when he had seen him before There he is went the words of the boy as he and the young woman came in sight of the colonel and Shag but it was at the detective the lad pointed There he is The girl rushed impulsively forward and as she held out her hands in a voiceless appeal there was worry and anguish depicted on her face Are you Colonel Brentnall she asked The colonel was sufficiently familiar with his alias not to betray surprise when it was used I am he said and the peaceful joyous look that had come into his eyes when he had landed his fish gave way to a hard and professional stare Oh Colonel Brentnall I ve come to ask you to help me help him You will won t you Don t say you won t The girl s face her blue eyes the outstretched hands the very poise of her lithe young body voiced the appeal My dear young lady began the colonel But she interrupted with You re the detective aren t you Well er I Say rather a detective for there are many and I am only one But you are the one from New York I am though I don t know how you guessed it I am not here professionally though in fact I ve practically retired and I would much prefer But you wouldn t refuse to help any one who needed it would you You wouldn t I m sure and the girl smiled through the tears in her blue eyes Oh of course as a matter of humanity I would not refuse to help any one But professionally well really I m not here in my detective role I really can not consider anything at this time I don t want to seem harsh or impolite but I can t Not even for double your usual fee Listen I am prepared to pay well for anything you can do for me and him My father is well off I have money in my own right I d spend the last dollar of that And dad said when I told him where I was going Dad said he d do the same We both believe Jimmie is innocent and we want to prove it to everybody as soon as we can That s why I came right on to see you I couldn t wait Oh perhaps I did wrong coming this way I m sorry if I ve spoiled your fishing But this is such such a big thing it means so much to him to me I I She faltered looking from Shag to the colonel and then to the sympathetic colored man again for on his face was a look of pity How did you know I was here asked Colonel Ashley I went to your hotel The clerk told me you had come to this stream It s the only good one for trout around here besides the one on my father s farm Has your father a trout stream and the eyes of the colonel took on a kindly gleam He has and it s well stocked But please won t you help me You are the only one who can I m not sure of that my dear young lady And really I hardly understand what it s all about You say the hotel clerk told you I was here I can understand that for I asked him the best way to reach this place But how did you know I was a detective and stopping at the Adams House He told me She pointed to the lanky youth The colonel and Shag turned their eyes on him Shag gave a start of surprise The colonel began to leaf over the brain tablets of his memory system He was beginning to place the lad Mah good land of massy ejaculated the negro It s de train newsboy whut yo give a dollar to las night Colonel The one who wanted to sell me a detective story I m him Colonel Brentnall answered the lad a smile of triumph lighting up his face Your man told me who you was and I heard you tell the taxi man where to drive you I didn t think anything more about it until I read about the murder The murder exclaimed the colonel Somehow that seemed to follow him as a Nemesis Yes old missus Darcy the jewelry store lady went on the boy This young lady and he nodded toward his companion when I told her Perhaps you had better let me explain Tom broke in the girl You see it s this way she went on addressing the colonel This boy is Tom Tracy He sells papers on the express He was once a jockey for my father but he got hurt stiff arm and we had to get him something else to do Dad always looks out for his boys and so Tom went on the road I had to do something that had motion in it Tom explained in an aside Yes it was as near to horseback riding as he could come said the girl and she smiled though the grief did not leave her blue eyes Well as he has told you he heard who you were Colonel from your man Then when he read about the murder and found how how close home it came to me he hurried out to our place and said I should engage you to help He s the biggest detective in New York broke in Tom And that s what we need a big New York detective But what s it all about asked the colonel This is talking in riddles though I begin to see a little I beg your pardon said the girl I should have told you who I am My name is Amy Mason and Ah You are engaged to be married to James Darcy who is er detained as a er as a witness in the murder of his cousin I am and she seemed to glory in it As soon as I heard what had happened to him I wanted to help They would not let me see Jimmie at police headquarters but I sent word that dad and I were going to work for him every minute That must have cheered him I hope it did But I want to do more than that I want to help him I want to get the best detective in the country to work on the case and prove that Jimmie didn t do this this terrible thing of which he is accused He isn t exactly accused yet as I understand it Miss Mason Oh well it s just as bad He is suspected Why Jimmie wouldn t have caused missus Darcy a moment of pain to say nothing of striking her killing her Oh it s horrible horrible and she covered her face with her hands I don t quite understand began the colonel why you came to me or how I told her it was the only thing to do broke in the newsboy Soon as I read about Carroll and Thong being on the case I knew it would take a fly one to put anything over on them I tried on the train to sell you a detective book not knowing who you was You treated me white and when I heard Miss Mason was in trouble or her friend was I said to myself right away that you was the one to fix things I went out to her farm last night and she was all broke up It was a terrible shock to me when I heard Jimmie was under arrest said the girl I didn t know what to do Tom here proposed coming to see you and when dad heard who you were though we knew nothing of you he said the same thing He told me I could have all the money I wanted and I have some of my own if his isn t enough It isn t always a question of money began the colonel gently I know broke in Amy But if I add the inducement of all the trout fishing You are strongly tempting me my dear young lady But finish your story Well there isn t much more to tell Tom suggested that I come to see you and ask you to take mister Darcy s case to prove that he had no hand in the murder for I m sure he did not Tom stayed at our house at Pompey all night I wanted to come to your hotel at once but the storm got too bad so I waited until this morning and then we motored in We found you had gone fishing and we followed you here It was perhaps not just the thing to do But I was so anxious I want to tell Jimmie that something is being done for him You will help us won t you and again she held out her hands appealingly I don t know anything about police or detectives she went on but I m sure there must be some way of proving that my that Jimmie had no hand in this Some terrible thief a burglar must have killed missus Darcy Oh Colonel Brentnall you will help us won t you She stood there a beautiful and pathetic picture The wind sighed through the trees and the murmur of the rippling water filled the air Please she whispered Her hands seemed to waver Her body swayed Shag you black rascal cried the colonel The lady s going to faint Catch her Yes sah Colonel No Stand back I ll attend to her myself I ve given up detective work but And a moment later Amy Mason sank limply into the colonel s arms CHAPTER VI GRAFTON S SEARCH The funeral of missus Darcy had been held attended as might be supposed by a large throng of the merely curious as well as by some of her distant kinsfolk for she had few near ones One of the relatives was summoned to take charge of the store and her other business affairs for a formal charge of murder having been made against him James Darcy was not permitted to attend the final services nor have anything more to do with the jewelry establishment Harry King now painfully sober was likewise held in jail bail being fixed because of his uncertain character at such a high figure that he could not secure it The police had been busy the prosecutor s detectives also but so far the arrest of Darcy and King had been the only ones made Singa Phut whose watch was found clasped in the dead woman s hand had been closely questioned but had established a perfect alibi And the testimony as to this came not from persons of his own nationality but from business men and others whose words could not be doubted So in the opinion of the authorities he was not worth considering further He admitted having left his watch at the shop to be repaired some days before the murder and had not called at the store since except on the morning of the crime and some time after its discovery to get his timepiece which of course he was not then allowed to take Darcy had been formally charged with the crime of murder by the police captain in whose precinct the happening occurred and no bail being permissible in murder cases he must perforce remain locked up until his indictment and trial He was transferred from the witness room of police headquarters the day of the funeral to the less pleasant jail and put in a cell as were the other unfortunates of that institution Jay Kenneth Darcy s lawyer a young member of the bar but enthusiastic and a hard worker had made a formal entry of a plea of not guilty for his client when the latter had been arraigned before the upper court and had asked for a speedy trial And so after the first few days of wonder and surmise and of speculation as to whether Darcy or King might have committed the crime or perhaps some desperate burglar the Darcy case was crowded off the front page of the newspapers to give way to items of more or less local interest in Colchester Up and down the narrow cell paced James Darcy His head was bowed but at times he raised it to look out through the barred door All his eyes encountered though was the white washed wall opposite him a bare white and glaring wall that made his eyes burn a wall that seemed to shut out hope itself as if it were not enough that it had been at the very bottom of Pandora s box Up and down down and up now pausing to take his hands from their strained position clasped behind his back that they might grasp the cold bars of his cell door slim white hands that had set many a gleaming jewel in burnished gold or cold glittering platinum that it might grace the person of some sweet woman And now those white fingers grasped cold steel and a keeper passing up and down on his half hourly rounds wondered grimly if they had been stained with the blood of missus Darcy But though the wall blocked his vision Darcy saw through and beyond it He saw the glittering showcases in the store with their arrays of cut glass and silver He saw the gleaming jewels in the safe He saw too the stained and keen paper knife which the drunken King had swaggered in to claim that gray morning He saw the red spot on the floor the spot which even now in spite of many scrubbings was visible to the men and women who now that the store was opened for business again walked in to select some piece of gold or silver some jewel for their own adornment or that of another And the gray haired woman whose pride it had been to display her beautiful wares to her friends and others was all alone in a grave far up on the hill a hill which looked down on Colchester which looked down on the very store itself All of this James Darcy saw and more There was a brisker step along the flagged corridor in front of the cells of murderers row Half a dozen men and one woman against whom such a charge had been made Darcy among them looked up with an interest they had not shown before Did it mean a visitor for any of them Did it mean their lawyer was coming to bid them cheer up or to tell them it looked black for their chances The step was that of the keeper of the outer gate the larger and more massively barred gate which gave entrance to the anteroom where on visiting days even those charged with the highest degree of crime were permitted to see their friends relatives or counsel Some one to see you Darcy called the keeper There was the clang of the lock mechanism and the door swung open Darcy s eyes brightened those of the others in the same tier of cells with him which for the moment had lighted up grew dull again My lawyer asked Darcy Yes And there s a lady with him A lady Yes Come on Darcy caught sight of Amy before she saw him for he approached from behind a line of other prisoners exercising in the space before their cells She was with Kenneth Amy exclaimed Darcy as he was allowed to step out into the anteroom closely followed by a keeper while a detective from the prosecutor s office stood near Amy and his eyes flowed Jimmie boy To the eternal credit of the keeper and the detective be it said that at this moment they found something of great interest in the calendar that hung on the opposite wall while Kenneth talked earnestly with the warden And the prisoners beyond the barred door were too busy with their exercise to look around Jimmie boy Amy You you don t Of course I don t Didn t I tell you so in my letter Yes but Now that isn t the way to talk especially when I have come to bring you good news Good news You mean your father Oh it isn t about dad I told you he was as firm a believer in you as I am that he said he d go the limit if you know what that means to get you free Jimmie boy when dad likes a person he likes him I hope his daughter does the same Don t you know Jimmie boy The warden the detective the keeper and the lawyer all now seemed interested in that prosaic calendar Amy had had but little chance to speak to Darcy since his arrest In police headquarters he was kept in seclusion except as to his lawyer and events had followed one another so rapidly that there had been no other opportunity until now though the girl had sent him a hasty note in which she said she knew he was innocent and that everything possible was being done for him And now Jimmie for the good news I have engaged the best detective in this country for you and she beckoned to the lawyer to come forward The best detective Yes You need one as well as a lawyer They re going to work together aren t you mister Kenneth Indeed a detective can help us best at this stage of the game I think mister Darcy was the lawyer s answer I can look after the court proceedings when it comes time for them but what we want most is evidence tending to show that some one else and not you committed this crime As most assuredly was the case and for the first time in days Darcy s voice had its old ring and vigor in it Of course Jimmie boy murmured Amy Now let me tell you all about it They say I can t stay very long so I ll have to talk fast and you must listen mostly Now what do you say to Colonel Ashley and Amy looked triumphantly at her lover Colonel Ashley Yes As the detective who is going to help prove you innocent by discovering the real ugh I hate to say it murderer Why Colonel Ashley is one of the greatest detectives in the United States at least he used to be He must be pretty old now I know he is but not too old to take hold Now when he comes But Amy my dear You can t get him Why he s not only one of the highest priced detectives in the country but he s retired I ve read and I doubt if he d take a case He s going to take your case Jimmie boy and Amy smiled But how how I think we ll have to give Miss Mason credit for a whole lot in this matter broke in Kenneth She surprised me when she told me And I want to say that when the colonel gets going we ll have you out of here in short order mister Darcy But I don t understand That s what I came to tell you about Jimmie boy Now just keep quiet and listen Thereupon Amy went on to relate all that had happened when she sought out the fisherman at the trout brook how she had been cared for by him and Shag after her faint and how after some persuasion the great detective had agreed to take up the matter of seeking out the real murderer of missus Darcy He came here under a different name Amy continued for he did not want to be bothered with work But Tom he s the little jockey dad got a place for as train boy met him on the express and learned that the colonel was the great detective Then Tom came and told me when he read of your of your Oh say arrest Amy I m getting hardened to it by now Well then your arrest I hate the word Tom came and told me and said we must get Colonel Brentnall at once That was the name he used but now he has consented to take your case he s Colonel Ashley again And what am I to do Amy Just what he tells you nothing more or less Tell him everything from the beginning to the end All about your quarrel with missus Darcy I read in the papers you had one Was that so Yes and I am sorry to say it was partly about you I don t mind Jimmie boy I know it couldn t have been very bad It wasn t She well she sneered at you for thinking of marrying me a poor man and As if money counted Jimmie boy cried the girl fondly I know But it angered me I admit However nothing more came of that And as for her finding fault with me about my electric lathe and about the money she owed me well that was a sort of periodic disagreement Tell the colonel all about it I will And are you sure your father Dad s with me in this with me and you He d have come to see you himself to day but I said I wanted to see you first He ll be along soon So you see Jimmie boy things aren t so bad as they seem though I hate it that you should be in this horrible place It is horrible Amy But now that I know you you haven t given me up Don t dare say such a thing Jimmie boy and the girl s eyes sparkled with a new light Well it won t be so horrible from now on And is the colonel really going to take my case Really and truly I told him he had to if he wanted to fish in dad s trout stream and she laughed a strange sound in that gloomy place Then they talked about many things James Darcy had read much of Colonel Ashley s achievements in detective work and the very magic of the name was enough to give a prisoner courage Soon it was time to leave after Kenneth had conferred briefly with his client The prisoner went back to his little cell with a happier look on his face than when he had left it As for Colonel Ashley after he had revived Amy from her faint at the stream he had told Shag to take apart the fishing rod For Shag I guess I won t be needing it for a week or so said the old detective and there was a mingling of two emotions in his voice Uh ah murmured Shag as carefully he put away the delicate rod and reel It s either fishin or detectin wif de colonel dat s whut it suah am Fishin or detectin De colonel ain t one dat kin carry watermelons on bof shoulders Returning from his fishing trip with the one lone specimen Colonel Ashley having escorted Amy Mason to her automobile went back to the hotel with Shag I might have known how it would be Shag he remarked almost mournfully I might have known I d run into something when I came here for rest Dat s right Colonel Yo suah might But who does yo s pect did dish yeah killin It s too early yet to tell Shag and you know I don t make any predictions I want to get a few more facts This the colonel proceeded to do First having had himself accredited as working in Darcy s behalf by being introduced by the accused man s lawyer the detective paid a visit to the jewelry store The place was in charge of Thomas Kettridge a half uncle to missus Darcy The place had been opened for business again after the funeral and customers came in carefully avoiding the place where a dark stain could be seen in the floor a stain made all the more conspicuous because of the light colored boards about it The colonel made a careful examination of the premises and had described to him the exact position of the body being told all that went on that tragic morning It was after this and following some busy hours spent in various parts of the city that the defective sent to one of his trusted men in New York this telegram Spotty Morgan s vacation is over Have him spend a few days with you until I can invite him to my country place I hate to do it after what he did for me mused the colonel with a sigh But business is business from now on I m officially in the case and I wasn t before Having sent the somewhat cryptic message the old detective sat in his room and took from his pocket a little green book Well old friend I guess I m not going to have much use for you from now on he remarked dolefully He glanced to where his rods and flies were gathering dust Nor you either he went on Now for a last glimpse He opened the book and read And now I shall tell you that the fishing with a natural fly is excellent and affords much pleasure It won t do ejaculated the colonel as he closed the book and threw it aside One matter puzzled the colonel as well as the other detectives There was no sign of the jewelry store having been entered from the outside so that if a stranger had come in he must have done so when the doors were unlocked or made a false key or else he had forced a passage so skilfully as to leave not a sign Of course this was possible and it added to the inference of some that a burglar used to such work had entered the place and being detected at work by missus Darcy had killed her However there was not so much as a cuff button missing as far as could be learned after the contents of the store had been checked up though of course an intruder might have been frightened off before he had taken anything Many of Darcy s friends could not help but admit that appearances were against him He and his cousin had quarreled somewhat bitterly over money and about his refusal to give up work on his electric lathe There was also King s testimony about words over Amy though Darcy contended that this talk was nothing more than his relative had indulged in before regarding the unsuitableness of the match Darcy admitted resenting his cousin s imputation All this Colonel Ashley had taken into consideration before he sent the telegram And having done that and having had a talk with Darcy at the jail as well as a consultation with the lawyer having visited Harry King and seen Singa Phut the detective paid another visit to the jewelry shop And what can I do for you to day Colonel asked mister Kettridge who by this time had the business running smoothly again Have you gotten any further into the mystery Not as far as I would like to get I m going to browse about here a bit if you have no objection Not at all Make yourself at home I will First I d like to see that statue the one of the hunter with which it is supposed missus Darcy was struck Oh that is at the prosecutor s office that and Harry King s unfortunate paper knife So they are I had forgotten Well I ll look about a bit then Don t pay any attention to me I ll go and come as I please And so he went seemingly rather idly about the jewelry store looking and listening It was not until the third day of his surveillance during which passage of time he had waited anxiously for a message from New York without getting it that the colonel felt his patience was about to be rewarded The detective was a fisherman in more ways than one Trade had been rather brisk in the shop possibly because of gruesome curiosity when one afternoon a man entered who seemed to know several in the place Yet he did not talk with them beyond a mere passing of the time of day but went about nervously from showcase to counter and repeated the journey When mister Kettridge asked him at what he desired to look he replied there was nothing in particular that he had in mind a gift but as yet had decided on nothing Look about as you please was the courteous invitation he received and the man availed himself of it Of medium build yet with the appearance of having lived more in the open than does the average man his face had yet a strange pallor not in keeping with his robust frame And his manner was certainly nervous Now what mused the colonel to himself is he fishing for That day there was more than the usual number of people in the store many of them undoubtedly curiosity seekers who came into price certain articles ostensibly but who really wanted to stare at the place where the bloodstains had been scrubbed away And at this spot the robust man stared longer than did some of the others the colonel thought Did he hope that some spirit of the poor murdered woman might still be lingering there to whisper to him what he sought to learn Who is that man asked Colonel Ashley of mister Kettridge who had often come to the shop during the holiday seasons to help missus Darcy Oh that s mister Grafton mister Grafton Who is he Aaron Grafton one of Colchester s best and wealthiest citizens He owns the Emporium That big department store Yes He has built it up from a small establishment I have known him a number of years and he knew missus Darcy quite well He often has purchased diamonds here though he is not married and I don t know that he is engaged rather late in life too for him to be considering that Oh well you never can tell and the colonel smiled So that is Aaron Grafton he mused Well mister Grafton in spite of the well known reputation you bear I think you will stand a little watching I must not neglect the smallest clew in a case like this Yes decidedly I think you will bear watching For at that moment the merchant after another round of the store seeking for something it seemed he could not find turned and hurried out a much troubled look on his face Colonel Ashley followed CHAPTER VII THE COLONEL IS SURPRISED This said Colonel Ashley to himself as he glided rapidly along the street is very much like old times very much 
6311-63718-0001	train-other-500	I never expected to do any shadowing again What s that Walton says about man proposing and Providence disposing Or was it Walton I must look it up Meanwhile Continuing his musing
6311-63718-0002	train-other-500	and with a satisfied smile on his face a smile that might indicate that the colonel was not so very much averse to giving over his fishing for the time being to take up his profession once more he followed Aaron Grafton as the merchant left the jewelry store
none	none	 I wonder 
6311-63718-0003	train-other-500	mused the colonel what his object was in coming to the Darcy place and nosing around as he did There must have been some object A man such as he is doesn t do things like that for fun And it wasn t mere curiosity either
6311-63718-0004	train-other-500	If it was he d have been at the place before when the evidences of the crime were there to be stared at by those who care for such things And that Aaron Grafton hasn t been there since I was forced into this thing I m positive For I was forced into it
6311-63718-0005	train-other-500	grumbled the old detective I just couldn t resist the pleading of her eyes
none	none	 It isn t the first time a man has made a fool of himself over a woman and it won t be the last But maybe I ll make fools of some of these folks instead of being made a fool of myself Fooled out of my fishing though By gad that s what I have been 
6311-63718-0006	train-other-500	But no matter I must see what friend Aaron is up to and what his little game is
none	none	 Of course he may have been at the store the day of the murder 
6311-63718-0007	train-other-500	before I arrived I must ask Darcy about that Poor lad he s in tough luck just when he ought to be thinking of getting married Well I ll do what I can
6311-63718-0008	train-other-500	There were few tricks known to modern detectives of which Colonel Ashley was not master among them being the ability to disguise himself not by clumsy beards and false moustaches though he used them at times
6311-63718-0009	train-other-500	but by a few simple alterations to his face and carriage Of course costume played its part when needed but the time had not yet come for that
6311-63718-0010	train-other-500	He was now following Grafton without the latter being aware of it no very difficult matter in a city the size of Colchester and on one of its main streets I think I want to know a little more about him mused the colonel
none	none	 I d like to have a talk with him and see how he acts But I won t chance that yet I ll play possum for a while 
6311-63718-0011	train-other-500	Having followed his man to the latter s store and even inside it where he made a trifling purchase and having seen mister Grafton enter his private office the detective paid a visit to Darcy in the jail How is she Colonel
6311-63718-0012	train-other-500	were the first words of the prisoner when they were in the warden s office with a detective from the prosecutor s office seated a few chairs away It was only under such arrangements that visitors were allowed to see the jewelry worker How is Amy
none	none	 Why she s very well the last I saw of her 
6311-63718-0013	train-other-500	But I came to talk about something else I suppose so This horrible affair But she still believes in me doesn t she he asked eagerly
none	none	 As much so as I do my boy Thank God for that I don t know what I d do if she went back on me I wouldn t want to live Tush Nonsense Don t get sentimental I can t help it Colonel But as long as Amy thinks I didn t do this horrible thing and God knows I didn t and as long as you believe in me why I can stand it 
6311-63718-0014	train-other-500	Maybe it won t be for long
none	none	 Well there s no use buoying you up with false hopes Darcy You ll probably be here all summer 
6311-63718-0015	train-other-500	I shan t mind if I m proved innocent at last I hope we can manage that all right Then you do believe in me Colonel Of course I do Otherwise I wouldn t take up your case
none	none	 Now don t talk too much I want to ask you a few questions 
6311-63718-0016	train-other-500	Answer them and as briefly as possible I ll get you out of here as soon as I can If I hadn t been as slow as a carp I might have the right man here now in your place
none	none	 What do you mean Colonel 
6311-63718-0017	train-other-500	Eh What s that Did I say anything and the detective seemed roused from a reverie for he had spoken his last remarks in a low voice You spoke about a carp the right man Oh I
none	none	 I was just thinking of something in Walton Never mind me It s a bad habit I ve been acquiring lately of thinking aloud 
6311-63718-0018	train-other-500	Now to business and the colonel drew some papers from his pocket Darcy looked at his new friend in some surprise Certainly the colonel had spoken as though he might at one time have had a chance to get the right man Did that mean the real murderer
6311-63718-0019	train-other-500	Darcy shook his head His nerves were beginning to go back on him he feared Do you know Aaron Grafton asked the colonel Oh yes replied Darcy Every one in town knows him as one of the prominent merchants Was he at the store the day of the
6311-63718-0020	train-other-500	the day missus Darcy was killed I don t remember So many things happened there were so many in the place As I think back though I don t remember seeing him
6311-63718-0021	train-other-500	Very good Did he ever do any business with you I mean buy anything in the store Why yes I think very possibly he might
none	none	 Most every one of prominence in Colchester at one time or another has made purchases in our store some more some less No particular purchase made by Grafton stands out in my mind however 
6311-63718-0022	train-other-500	How about having his watch repaired I d remember I think if I had fixed his watch I m sure I didn t He has a fine one for I ve seen him stop in front of our window and compare his time with our chronometer I see Now another matter
6311-63718-0023	train-other-500	Can you in any way account for the fact that so many of the clocks in the store clocks that as I understand it ordinarily go for many days stopped at different hours the night of the killing Can you explain that Somewhat to the surprise of the colonel Darcy was silent for a moment
6311-63718-0024	train-other-500	Then the young man slowly answered No No I can t explain it I don t know what did it Well then I ll have to fish on that alone I guess I thought you knowing a lot about clock works might have some explanation
6311-63718-0025	train-other-500	You know most of the timepieces were stopped all of them in fact except the watch in your cousin s hand Yes I remarked that at the time That watch was going Yes so you told me you thought it was her heart beating I wish oh
6311-63718-0026	train-other-500	how I wish it had been exclaimed Darcy in tones of despair
none	none	 If it had been I wouldn t be here 
6311-63718-0027	train-other-500	But it s too late to think of that now Do you happen to know what became of that watch the one in her hand It belonged to an East Indian you said Yes to Singa Phut
6311-63718-0028	train-other-500	I was to make one little adjustment in it for him and he was to come in early to get it It wasn t much The hair spring I think had become caught up and it ran very fast
none	none	 I planned to do it the night before but the light was too poor So I made up my mind to get up early and attend to it 
6311-63718-0029	train-other-500	But I never got the chance No I don t recall what happened to that watch I suppose the detectives have it
none	none	 The prosecutor did take it but Singa Phut has it now 
6311-63718-0030	train-other-500	He has cried Darcy Yes he called at the court house and begged that it be given to him Said it was an ancient timepiece which he had owned for many years and as it could have no connection with the crime they let him take it Oh
6311-63718-0031	train-other-500	well I suppose that was all right No Singa Phut didn t have a thing to do with the killing I m positive of that And his alibi is perfect said the colonel Well I guess you ve told me all I want to know
6311-63718-0032	train-other-500	You haven t any reason to suspect any one have you Darcy Not a soul God knows I wouldn t want to name any one either much as I d like to get out Of here myself missus Darcy had no enemies
6311-63718-0033	train-other-500	Not a one in the world that I know of She was a friendly woman Of course that was good business policy No she had no enemies Most people liked her So I ve heard Well we ll get at the truth somehow Now brace up
none	none	 I m trying to Colonel Well try harder When I go to see Miss Mason You are going to see Amy cried the prisoner eagerly Yes But if I have to tell her you looked as though you had lost every last friend you had in the world It s all right Colonel Tell her you saw me 
6311-63718-0034	train-other-500	laughing and Darcy did manage to utter what might pass for a laugh It was a good attempt
none	none	 Good That s better 
6311-63718-0035	train-other-500	though there s room for improvement said the detective Now I ll leave you I have lots to do I m sorry Colonel to put you to all this trouble Pooh Now I m in it there s no trouble that s too much I ll get about the same fun out of this as I would if I fished
6311-63718-0036	train-other-500	and I ll fish with greater enjoyment later on when I ve cleared you I hope you do Colonel And if there s anything I can do Thanks but Miss Mason has already arranged to have me whip her father s trout stream when this case is over
none	none	 and that s reward enough for me Now sir one last word to you 
6311-63718-0037	train-other-500	and the colonel assumed the military appearance that so well befitted him Stop worrying I ll try Colonel Don t try do it One question Well one only What is it Do you think mister Grafton
6311-63718-0038	train-other-500	The detective smiled and shook his finger at Darcy You just let me do the thinking he advised as he turned to go out Colonel Ashley spent two busy days most of his time being given over to investigating Aaron Grafton
6311-63718-0039	train-other-500	And the more he saw of that gentleman the more the detective became convinced that the merchant knew something of the crime
6311-63718-0040	train-other-500	I wouldn t admit even to myself mused the colonel that he had a hand in it or that he was an accessory before or after But he certainly knows something about it and enough to make him worry That s what Aaron Grafton is doing worrying
6311-63718-0041	train-other-500	And he s worrying about something that ought to be in the jewelry shop and isn t Now what is it This very evidently was something for Colonel Ashley to discover and with all his skill he set himself to this task
6311-63718-0042	train-other-500	For the time being he dropped several other ends tangled ends of the skein he hoped to unravel and devoted his time to Grafton And at the end of two days the detective learned that the merchant was going to make a hurried trip to New York
6311-63718-0043	train-other-500	a trip not directly connected with his store for those trips were made at other times of the year Well if he goes to New York I go too said the colonel grimly And he went on the same train with Aaron Grafton though unknown to the latter
6311-63718-0044	train-other-500	It was a skilful bit of shadowing the detective did on the journey to the metropolis so skilful that though the merchant plainly showed by his nervousness that he thought he might have been followed he did not seemingly suspect the quiet man seated not far from him
6311-63718-0045	train-other-500	reading a little green book The colonel had adopted a simple but effective disguise In New York which was reached early in the morning after a night journey the colonel again took up the trail keeping near his man
6311-63718-0046	train-other-500	Follow that taxi the colonel ordered the driver of his machine as it rolled out of the Pennsylvania station just a few lengths behind the one in which Grafton rode
6311-63718-0047	train-other-500	The following was well done and a little later the two machines drew up in front of the big office building in which Colonel Ashley had his headquarters Whew
none	none	 whispered the follower of Izaak Walton I wonder if he came here to consult my agency All doubts were dissolved a moment later when keeping somewhat in the background the detective heard the merchant ask the elevator starter on which floor were the offices of Colonel Ashley s detective agency 
6311-63718-0048	train-other-500	He does want to see me excitedly thought the colonel What in the world for This is getting interesting I ve got to do a little fine work now He must never suspect at least for a while that I have been in Colchester
6311-63718-0049	train-other-500	Next to the elevator in which Aaron Grafton rode up was another Tom you re an express for the time being whispered the colonel to the operator There s a man headed for my offices and I must get in ahead of him Here s a dollar I get you Colonel
6311-63718-0050	train-other-500	Shoot And the car shot up with speed enough to cause the colonel to gasp used as he was to rapid motion
none	none	 He had just time to slide into his quarters by a rear and private door to make certain changes in his appearance and be calmly sitting at his desk smoking a cigar when his clerk brought in the card of Aaron Grafton Tell him to come in said the colonel more and more surprised at the turn affairs were taking I ll see this man myself he continued speaking to the man into whose hands he had put the general direction of the agency Say to mister Grafton he said turning to the clerk that Colonel Ashley will see him in a moment CHAPTER VIII 
6311-63719-0000	train-other-500	THE DIAMOND CROSS Colonel Ashley There was a formal questioning note in the merchant s voice That is my name yes sir Er mister
none	none	 Grafton and as though to refresh his memory the colonel glanced at the card on his desk 
6311-63719-0001	train-other-500	You are a private detective Yes mister Grafton was evidently sparring for time He seemed uneasy he looked uneasy and it required no very astute mind to know that he was uneasy out of his element
none	none	 For all the world like a gasping fish on the bank was the simile the colonel used 
6311-63719-0002	train-other-500	I have a case I wish you would take up for me went on the merchant It is somewhat peculiar Most cases that come to us are and the colonel smiled And it is delicate I could say that of nearly every one also
6311-63719-0003	train-other-500	So that I may rely on your silence and er discretion Sir The colonel fairly bristled I beg your pardon I should not have asked that But I am all upset over this matter
6311-63719-0004	train-other-500	Then sir let me ease your mind by stating that whatever you tell me will be in strict confidence as far as lies in my power to so observe it I can not compound a felony so if you have in mind the disclosure of anything that would incriminate you Incriminate me Yes or
6311-63719-0005	train-other-500	involve you in any way If you have anything like that in mind please don t tell me about it I should feel obliged to make use of my knowledge
none	none	 But if it is a matter in which you wish my advice then I certainly do need advice Colonel 
6311-63719-0006	train-other-500	I have often heard you spoken of and I have read of more than one of your cases So when I got in this well I may as well call it trouble I at once thought of you I am fortunate I believe in seeing Colonel Ashley himself who I understood had retired or
none	none	 perhaps is about to retire 
6311-63719-0007	train-other-500	I came here prepared to pay any reasonable amount and the merchant drew out his wallet The colonel held up a protesting hand Please don t not yet he said I can not accept a retaining fee until I have heard more of your case
6311-63719-0008	train-other-500	It may be that I can not serve you Give me some inkling of what you want I hope you are not in serious trouble It is serious for me Then I hope I can help you Please be as frank as you think best
6311-63719-0009	train-other-500	The franker you are the fewer questions I shall have to ask Go on Well then I want to find a certain valuable diamond cross A diamond cross Yes I don t know just what it is worth but I believe a small fortune
6311-63719-0010	train-other-500	And was it stolen from you No Though I do own a store where jewelry is sold we don t carry an expensive line This cross belonged to a friend of mine
none	none	 She had it on when we were out walking together and well it became damaged and I asked her to let me take it to have it repaired 
6311-63719-0011	train-other-500	Nothing very complicated or troublesome in that I suppose the cross was stolen from you while it was temporarily in your possession and you don t like to let your friend know for fear she may suspect you Such things have happened
6311-63719-0012	train-other-500	Did you ever read de Maupassant s Diamond Necklace I never did I d advise you to Also Walton
none	none	 Is he a jeweler Lord no But I beg your pardon Let us keep to the subject 
6311-63719-0013	train-other-500	So you don t dare tell your friend the diamond cross is gone Oh yes she knows it Then why the worry except about getting it back Well there are complications
none	none	 You see her husband Oh ho 
6311-63719-0014	train-other-500	There was a world of meaning in that exclamation Aaron Grafton turned a deep red and bit his lips
none	none	 Colonel Ashley saw his annoyance Look here exclaimed the old detective I really shouldn t have said that But 
6311-63719-0015	train-other-500	we detectives are used to all sorts of complications and more than once they have to do with women Often enough there is nothing more serious than a little indiscretion but I can see where outsiders might make trouble particularly husbands
6311-63719-0016	train-other-500	I take it then that you and the lady were out together without her husband knowing it I hope he doesn t know of it for though on my honor there was nothing wrong in our being together it might be hard to make him believe that
6311-63719-0017	train-other-500	I quite agree with you particularly if he were jealous as many husbands are So you want me to try to get this diamond cross belonging to the married lady back for you without her husband knowing anything about it That s it
6311-63719-0018	train-other-500	Where were you when you were robbed of it I wasn t robbed of it I never said I was Oh I beg your pardon I must have inferred that Please go on and if you don t mind my asking you kindly get to the point
none	none	 I beg your pardon Perhaps I am beating about the bush Well I ll be as frank as I can Do you want me to give names 
6311-63719-0019	train-other-500	It would be better since I already know yours I shall keep them in strict confidence however now that I am fairly well assured there is no ulterior motive in your visit to me Proceed Well then
6311-63719-0020	train-other-500	the diamond cross which is worth I don t know how many thousand dollars belongs to missus Cynthia Larch the wife of Langford Larch who keeps a large hotel in Colchester I know the place Go on
none	none	 interrupted Colonel Ashley I have stopped there on fishing trips he added 
6311-63719-0021	train-other-500	as his caller looked a bit surprised Oh I didn t know that Well this was missus Larch s cross It is a family heirloom I believe though many suppose her husband gave it to her for a wedding present
none	none	 That is not so however I know Cynthia had the cross before she was married 
6311-63719-0022	train-other-500	You call her Cynthia I have known her since we were both children I see Pray go on In fact we were sweethearts continued Grafton and were engaged But the match was broken off by her father
none	none	 I was only a struggling clerk then and never dreamed I would get on as I have 
6311-63719-0023	train-other-500	Nor did she I fancy though she was willing to take me as I was But her folks made trouble They brought such pressure to bear on her that she gave in and married Larch who was and is wealthy but whose social position was beneath hers
6311-63719-0024	train-other-500	Don t think I am telling you this out of mere jealousy Aaron Grafton went on and his manner was earnest I loved her deeply and sincerely I do yet but
none	none	 in a way that is perfectly right I have not told her so but He was silent a moment 
6311-63719-0025	train-other-500	I went away after she threw me over he resumed
none	none	 I couldn t stand it to be near her and see her 
6311-63719-0026	train-other-500	going out with him But I came back Though the old wound still hurt I tried not to let her see We became friends again
none	none	 in fact we had never ceased to be friends 
6311-63719-0027	train-other-500	Perhaps I have acted foolishly but of late I have seen her quite often I began to feel that her married life was not happy I took pains to enquire and learned that it was not
6311-63719-0028	train-other-500	I tried to make her a little happier by talking to her Once or twice she met me and we walked together in the woods The colonel looked sharply at his caller Oh for God s sake don t put any wrong construction on it
6311-63719-0029	train-other-500	I d give my very life to make her happy and do you think I d I don t doubt you for a moment sir Thank you said mister Grafton
none	none	 It is good to know that there is still some truth and honor in the world and that a man and woman can be friends though the circumstances seem peculiar 
6311-63719-0030	train-other-500	He paused a moment to overcome his emotion and resumed
none	none	 Well Cynthia and I are friends good friends 
6311-63719-0031	train-other-500	It was to talk over what course was best for her to pursue under certain circumstances that she and I walked out together We went in secret for there are gossiping and wagging tongues in Colchester as elsewhere and if I
6311-63719-0032	train-other-500	the leading merchant in the town was seen to be alone with pretty Cynthia Larch whose husband was a friend of judges and politicians who frequent his hotel there would be talk little short of scandal I quite agree with you So you walked in secret Yes
6311-63719-0033	train-other-500	And it was while we were out together that the cross she was wearing became unfastened and fell I most clumsily stepped on it greatly marring the setting She was distressed of course but I said I would take it to a jeweler s and have it repaired without any one being the wiser
6311-63719-0034	train-other-500	She agreed that was best So I took it To missus Darcy s place and she was found murdered broke in the old detective quickly Aaron Grafton started from his chair How in the name of Heaven did you know that he cried
6311-63719-0035	train-other-500	I thought that not a soul but I knew it I did not even tell Cynthia The explanation is simple said the colonel I will be almost as frank with you as you have been with me I know more about you than you think Wait a moment
6311-63719-0036	train-other-500	The colonel stepped into a closet He made a few rapid changes in his clothing and took off a tiny bit of eyebrow which had been added to his own a short time before
6311-63719-0037	train-other-500	Then he confronted the merchant The man I saw in the jewelry store gasped Grafton I remember now seeing you there the day I went to look for the diamond cross And didn t find it said the detective
6311-63719-0038	train-other-500	I wondered what so perturbed you but now I know At first I did think you might know something of the murder God forbid said the merchant earnestly and reverently Amen echoed the colonel
none	none	 You have told such a straightforward story that I can not doubt you 
6311-63719-0039	train-other-500	That is why I revealed myself to you But you must keep my secret if I am to help you I am known in Colchester as Colonel Brentnall having registered at the hotel under that name I will keep that name for the present
6311-63719-0040	train-other-500	I followed you here in fact I only entered this office a minute or two ahead of you So it was to find the diamond cross you visited the store of the murdered woman Yes
none	none	 When I had damaged the cross by stepping on it I thought my old friend missus Darcy would be the best one to keep my secret 
6311-63719-0041	train-other-500	I took the cross to her the night before she was killed and she promised to have her cousin fix it without telling him whose it was and get it back to me secretly in a day or so I thought Cynthia could
6311-63719-0042	train-other-500	then wear it again without her husband knowing it had ever been out of her possession But the murder changed all my plans
none	none	 As soon as I could I went to the shop to look for the cross I thought perhaps it might have been put in one of the showcases or laid on the shelf perhaps forgotten 
6311-63719-0043	train-other-500	Really I was so distressed I didn t know what to think I did not want to tell any one what I was looking for so I went about quietly But I could not find it Then I was obliged to ask Darcy about it secretly of course and without hinting as to the ownership
none	none	 But he had never seen it 
6311-63719-0044	train-other-500	He said missus Darcy had not given it to him nor asked him to repair it Nor was it in the shop as far as he knew
none	none	 and he went over all the stock to furnish a list to the police so they could tell whether or not there had been a robbery 
6311-63719-0045	train-other-500	And there was none None unless you call the taking of the diamond cross a theft For that alone is missing And I d give half my fortune to get it back
6311-63719-0046	train-other-500	Cynthia s husband may ask about it at any moment and what excuse can she give
none	none	 It is rather a ticklish matter 
6311-63719-0047	train-other-500	agreed the detective Well I ll see what I can do First I thought you wanted me to work on the murder case But as I am already engaged on that to try to clear Darcy I can as well include the diamond cross mystery also
6311-63719-0048	train-other-500	I wonder if they have any connection I don t see how they can have missus Darcy may merely have put the cross away secretly and it may take a careful search of the place to find it Maybe so I ll have to nose around a bit There came a knock on the office door Come
6311-63719-0049	train-other-500	called out the colonel His clerk handed him a telegram Tearing it open the detective read a message from one of his agents in a distant western city It said Spotty Morgan arrested here to day
none	none	 Big diamond cross found on him Do you want him Do I want him fairly yelled the colonel I should say I did Here get me Blake on the long distance This is no time for a wire I ve got to telephone 
6311-63719-0050	train-other-500	And he hurried to a private booth in a back office leaving Grafton to himself After he had telephoned Colonel Ashley sat in silence in the booth musing Now I wonder he said to himself if Grafton is telling me the truth
6311-63719-0051	train-other-500	Almost any one would believe his story it sounds straight enough and yet I can t take any chances I guess I mustn t lose sight of you Aaron Grafton
6311-63719-0052	train-other-500	And perhaps Larch isn t so bad a chap as you d have me believe Trust a disgruntled lover for saying the worst about the other chap Yes I can t afford to take any chances
none	none	 You may know a bit more about this murder than you re telling me even considering the latest from my friend Spotty Yes you may be playing a double game mister Aaron Grafton CHAPTER IX INDICTED Well Spotty I ve got to hand it to you Certainly you did put one over on me Not intentional Colonel So help me not intentional Well maybe not but I ve got to hand it to you If I didn t know that slip of mine in front of the truck was pure accident I d say you staged it just to make a good get away I couldn t do that Colonel I don t know Spotty You re a clever kid But I couldn t do that I was on the level in saving you You ve got to give me credit for that pleaded the gunman I know you were Spotty And that s why I gave you a chance to get away But I never thought it was for a job like this murder And it wasn t Colonel it wasn t So help me I never laid eyes on the old lady dead or alive Murder I should say not Then how did you get that diamond cross Answer me Colonel Ashley with a dramatic gesture pointed to the glittering ornament that lay on the table between him and the New York crook The stones glittered in the electric lights of police headquarters for it was there in the distant city that this talk took place Confirming over the long distance telephone the news given in his agent s telegram Colonel Ashley without having revealed to Grafton what new development had occurred had made a quick trip to Lango where Spotty in response to a quiet but general alarm sent out had been arrested A diamond cross had been found in his possession and was bent and flattened crushed by some heavy foot though all the stones were intact Spotty admitted that the ornament might be the very one wanted but he absolutely refused to tell how he had come by it He was most emphatic however in denying that he had taken it from missus Darcy or that he had even seen her or been to her store I m a bad man Colonel you know that and maybe if I was to go to the chair or the rope according to where I was caught I wouldn t be getting any more than was comin to me But so help me I never croaked that old lady Then how did you get that cross I won t tell you I ll make you Spotty and there was a dangerous glint in the eyes of the colonel You can t defied the crook There ain t a man livin that can Go on with your third degree if you want to he sneered But for every blow you strike for every hour you keep me awake when I m dead for sleep you ll be sorry Colonel You ll be sorry when you think of what might have happened back there in Colchester Spotty you re right faltered the colonel I almost wish you hadn t saved me I ve got to do my duty I ve got to break you if need be Spotty to get at the truth I want to know who killed missus Darcy and where you got that cross I want to know and by gad I m going to know Not from me Colonel I never saw the old lady dead or alive and I never knew until just now when you told me that she d ever had this cross Who gave it to you Colonel did you ever know me to split on a pal unless he split first No Spotty I never did Well then you stand a fine chance in getting me to do it now Go to it if you like I m through spielin and the crook turned away with an air of indifference The colonel knew that Spotty never would tell until he wanted to but it did not deter him He went at Spotty What happened in the quiet room near the police headquarter cells need not form part of this record Enough to say that when they let Spotty go staggering back to his dungeon a wreck of a man physically and mentally for the time being he had not told And the glittering stones in the crushed cross were not more silent than he in his misery deserved perhaps but none the less misery And when the colonel rather upset himself by what he had been forced to go through started back for Colchester he took with him the memory of Spotty s rather sneering face and the echo of his words Well Colonel I didn t tell And he had not The diamond cross still kept its mystery Colonel Ashley fumed fretted and fidgeted until he was on the verge of a sleepless night on his way back in the train Then he bethought himself of his little green book and he read You are to know then that there is a night as well as a day fishing for a trout and that in the night the best trout come out of their holes Ah ha mused the colonel I think I shall have to do a little night fishing So saying having read a little farther in his Izaak Walton he went peacefully to his berth and awoke calmer and himself again But if the colonel felt refreshed on reaching Colchester it was not because he felt that he was in a fair way to solve the problem or rather the many problems connected with the Darcy murder It s worse tangled than before mused the old detective I wonder if Grafton No it couldn t be But I must have a talk with his friend Cynthia Ticklish business when a man goes out walking with a married woman and steps on her cross There are complications and complications I wonder when I ll begin to unravel some of them For reasons of his own the colonel said nothing to the police or county authorities in Colchester about the arrest of Spotty nor did he mention that nor the finding of the diamond cross to Darcy or Grafton He wanted to be sure of his ground before he told of this end of the affair I wish I knew what to make of Grafton mused the colonel His share in it if share he had is getting more complicated Can he and Spotty be up to some trick between them and did the gunman get away with the cross It wouldn t be the first time Spotty had hired out his services to a man who wanted something desperate done Now in this case Grafton may have wanted something from missus Darcy she wasn t willing to do In that case The colonel shook his head I guess he half whispered that Shag was right This is going to be a mighty complicated case Talk about a diamond cross there may be a double cross in it on the part of Grafton I must watch you a bit closer my friend The colonel considered that he was working to clear Darcy and he wanted to do it in his own way He was willing perforce that for the time the young man be considered guilty He could not help the young man by making these few disclosures now The prisoner would not be released because Spotty or any one else was suspected nor would he be admitted to bail In any case he must remain in jail The Grand Jury was setting considering the evidence against the prisoner and against others accused of various crimes And I suppose they ll indite Darcy mused the colonel It means only another step however a step I have already counted on It won t help or hinder the solving of the mystery Hang Spotty anyhow Why couldn t he keep out of this He surely has tangled it worse than ever I wonder if he s telling the truth when he says he didn t go near the place It was Spotty or one of his kind who got in and out without leaving a trace It took Spotty s skill But I don t know I must have another look around the jewelry store A day or so after his return from the West the colonel made a close examination of the shop Just what he was looking for he hardly knew but he was quite surprised when he discovered connected with the main lighting wires of the store other wires which ran to various places in the shelves and the show windows where many of the clocks stood I wonder if that s a new kind of burglar alarm thought the colonel If it is it s the first time I ve ever seen one hooked up to the electric light circuit A bad thing in case of a short circuit A person might get a shock that would knock him down and Something seemed to give the colonel a new idea He made a hurried examination of the wires and then left the store to be seen a little later at the establishment of an electrician where he stayed some time It was late that afternoon when the papers in extra editions announced the indictment of James Darcy for the murder of his cousin When Colonel Ashley returned to his hotel from the electrician s he found Amy Mason waiting for him Oh Colonel isn t this dreadful she exclaimed holding out a paper It s so so Tut tut my dear young lady this is nothing It is only a little shoot on the main stem Don t let it distress you It was to be expected I know But it sounds so dreadful Before he was only suspected even though formally charged Now it seems as if he were found guilty Far from it The only evidence against him just as it has been all along is circumstantial They have yet to prove anything and I don t believe they can Cheer up I ll get him off yet Are you sure Colonel and her eyes were bright with unshed tears Sure Why of course I am And yet the colonel had to force himself a bit to make that sound natural Perhaps it was because he had said it so often and was tired Or did it have anything to do with the strange wires that led to the work table of James Darcy CHAPTER X THE DEATH WATCH Doctor Warren the county physician stopping in at police headquarters as he often did on returning from his round of private visits to see if there were any official calls for him encountered Detective Carroll Hello Doc was the genial greeting for Doctor Warren was more than a physician He was a politician and politics and the police were no more divorced in Colchester than elsewhere Seen that colonel guy to day asked Carroll The colonel guy The doctor s voice showed his puzzlement Yes the chap that s working with Kenneth on the Darcy case Seen him No I haven t He was here looking for you a little while ago Seemed quite anxious about meeting you Here he is now Say if he lets out anything we can use against Darcy you know legitimate stuff pass it on to me and Thong will you You know we ve got to go on the stand and between you and me our case ain t any too strong That s right I ll let you know what I hear and the two ended their half whispered talk as Colonel Ashley entered police headquarters It was his third visit to headquarters that day in search of Doctor Warren and he would state the object of his seeking to none other Now he smiled at the man he had been looking for They had met previously Ah good afternoon Doctor Warren I ve been looking for you was the colonel s greeting If you re not busy sir I d like just a few minutes of your time officially of course Always ready for duty Colonel I guess you military men know that we doctors are in a sort of class with yourselves when it comes to that You re right Now I won t be much more than a minute and what I want to ask you I can propound right here as well as anywhere You know I m working to save Darcy So I ve heard Well you examined missus Darcy soon after she was found dead You may or you may not have formed an opinion as to who killed her but I judge you are positive as to how she was killed I mean the nature of the wound There were two wounds you know a fracture of the skull just back of the right ear and a stab wound in the left side which punctured the heart Either would have caused death Can you tell which killed her I should say the stab wound but I can not be positive You understand Colonel that I am to go on the stand for the prosecution and tell all I know about this case Oh yes I realize that of course You are practically a witness against Darcy And I don t for one moment wish you to think that I am trying to get advance information to use in his favor This is simply in the matter of justice the ends of which I know you wish to serve as I do myself So if I ask anything improper please stop me But since you will testify about these wounds and since you have already pretty well described them to the newspaper reporters it can do no harm to repeat the details to me None in the least Colonel Then you feel sure the stab wound killed her Reasonably so Of course as I said either blow could have caused death but blows on the head even when the skull is badly fractured as in this case do not invariably cause death instantly In fact the victim usually lingers for several hours in an unconscious state Not so however in the case of a stab wound in or near the heart That is almost always fatal within a short space of time a minute or two So while it is possible that missus Darcy was first stunned by a blow on the head which eventually would have killed her I think death almost at once followed the stab wound Could both have been delivered by the same person Of course First the blow on the head followed by the stab wound And there were no other injuries on the body None except minor bruises caused by the fall to the floor But they were superficial Nothing else No um let me see no I think not Are you sure doctor Warren The colonel s voice had a strange ring in it Why yes I am sure I was about to say that there was a slight abrasion in the palm of the left hand a sort of scratch or puncture as though from a pin but as she was in the jewelry business and as I understand it often made slight repairs herself to brooches and pins brought in this could easily be accounted for A slight abrasion in the left hand you say Yes But I don t attach any importance to that It was so slight that I and my assistant only gave it a passing glance It hardly penetrated the skin I see In the left hand This is the hand in which the ticking watch was found was it not I believe so The watch belonging to an Indian named Singa Phut By the way what became of him the doctor asked of Detective Carroll who had strolled out of the detectives private room and was listening to the conversation Oh that gink He made a big howl about getting back his watch and as he had a perfectly good alibi and we could fasten nothing on him we give it back to him and told him to beat it He did I guess No he is still in town said Colonel Ashley I passed his place a while ago He has a pair of beautiful Benares candlesticks in the form of hooded cobra snakes that I want to get Singa Phut is still in town Does that answer all your questions Colonel inquired doctor Warren I ll tell you all I can in reason but if Thank you You ve told me all I cared to know I have some theories I want to work on and I m not sure how they ll turn out I s pose you think Darcy didn t do this job cut in Carroll rather sneeringly I m positive he didn t sir and the colonel drew himself up and looked uncompromisingly at the headquarters detective If I thought he had done it I would not be associated with his case You re going to have a sweet job proving he didn t do it laughed the officer Maybe assented the colonel unruffled Who else could have croaked her pursued Carroll Here he goes and has a quarrel with the old lady just before he goes to bed He s sore at her because he thinks she s keeping back part of his coin Then he s sore because she made some cracks about his girl that s enough to get any man riled I don t blame Darcy for going off his nut But he shouldn t have croaked the old lady He done it all right and we got the goods on him You ll see Well it s your business of course yours and that of the prosecutor to prove him guilty said the colonel And you can t quarrel with me if I try to prove him innocent Sure not Colonel Every man s got to earn his bread and butter somehow Only I hate to see you kid yourself along believing this guy didn t do the job He done it I tell you Maybe half assented the colonel Thank you doctor Warren We shall meet again and with a military salute the colonel went out of police headquarters As he descended the steps he silently mused I wonder what Carroll and Thong would say if they knew about the diamond cross and heard that Spotty Morgan had it I guess they would change some of their theories then Which reminds me that I have more irons in the fire than I suspected I must not lose sight of Cynthia She will be getting anxious about her diamonds and I would like to see what she says when she hears the truth Though Colonel Ashley had given up all hopes of having a use for his beloved fishing rods and flies at least on this trip to Colchester he did not give up his perusal of Walton s book It was one evening while sitting in his room at the hotel idly turning over the pages hardly able to concentrate his mind on what he read for much thinking of the diamond cross mystery that his eye chanced on page one hundred seventy where he saw the passage There be also three or four other little fish that I had almost forgot that are all without scales The book dropped from the detective s hand Gad he exclaimed That s what I ve been forgetting the little fish I must get after some of them They may turn the scale in our favor Little fish That s it Small fry when you can t get big ones I wonder There was a knock at the door and Shag entered bowing and saluting military style at the same time Scuse me Colonel sah he began but does yo want t heah any news Any news Shag What sort Come speak up you rascal Well sah Colonel yo done tell me when we come heah not t trouble yo wif any detective news but Oh that was before I got mixed up in this Darcy case Shag The prohibition is off so to speak If you have any news No sah Colonel tisn t

Scott Shag You don t mean to tell me he s killed do you No sah Colonel Dat mister Phut ain t killed It s his partner He s got a funny name too Heah I done brought yo a paper and Shag pulled out an extra from under his vest where he had carefully kept it concealed until he had made sure of his master s frame of mind The colonel scanned the front page with its black type eagerly Surely enough there had been a murder Shere Ali Singa Phut s partner had been found lying on the floor of the little curiosity shop with his head crushed in And in the dead man s hand was a ticking watch read the colonel For a moment he stared at the words Then a light seemed to come over his face He crushed the paper in his hand and then spread it out to read again the startling news while he murmured The watch of death CHAPTER XI NO ALIMONY Shag exclaimed the colonel Yes sah We re going fishing tomorrow Is we Colonel Den I s pects yo ll want t git Get everything ready yes We ll go again to that place where Miss Mason found me There s as good fish in that stream as any I didn t catch and I want to try my luck Yes sah Colonel But scuse me didn t yo figger on doin some detectin an give up fishin and Shag with the freedom of an old servant stood looking at his master as if not quite understanding the new twist the affairs had taken That s all right Shag You do as I tell you I m going off fishing I may not catch anything I may not want to after I get there But for a quiet place to think give me a fishing excursion every time And I ve got to do some tall thinking now Get ready Shag Yes sah Colonel And having put himself in a fair way as he hoped to solve some of the problems connected with the Darcy case Colonel Ashley went down to police headquarters to learn more facts in connection with the murder of the East Indian Carroll and Thong were there and if they did not exactly welcome the colonel as a kindred spirit they at least accorded him the respect due a fellow craftsman in the peculiar line where talent may be found most unexpectedly And Carroll and Thong who with other headquarters men now knew the colonel s identity were not above learning a trick or two even if they had to take them from the book of their rival For they recognized that the colonel would be against them and the prosecutor s detectives when it came to the trial of James Darcy Well boys what s this I hear about another murder asked Colonel Ashley when he had passed over some of his cigars the flavor of which the two headquarters men had been longing to taste again Some Dago had his head busted in remarked Thong It isn t our case so we don t know much about it No Who has it Pinkus and Donovan haven t they Carroll Yep Carroll was too much engaged in watching the blue smoke curl lazily upward from his cigar just then to say more Like to talk with em about it went on Thong in friendlier tones If they re here yes I think they just came in said Thong bringing his feet down with a bang from the table on which he had had them elevated Are you going to work on that case Colonel Oh no I was just interested as Singa Phut was one concerned in missus Darcy s murder But he hadn t any more to do with it Colonel than that cat and Carroll pointed to the headquarters cat which was sleeping near a radiator for the day had turned cold and steam was on in the place Perhaps not admitted Colonel Ashley But there are some peculiar coincidences and if you don t mind I d like to see what I can find out about them Go as far as you like Colonel returned Thong needlessly generous We ve got our man and that s all we want The other isn t our case Oh Donovan he called as he saw a fellow sleuth passing through an outer room Here s some one to see you and the presentation was quickly and informally made The two men had seen each other before but had not spoken Glad to know you Colonel Ashley said Donovan I ve read a lot about you You re on the Darcy case they tell me In a way yes I m working in the interests of the young man But I hear you have another murder Yes but it s so plain there s no interest in it for you All we want to do Pinkus and me is to lay our hands on the Dago that done it and got away We ll get him too before many days He s the kind of a feller that can t hide very well unless he goes and kills himself and he may do that How did it happen And is there any truth in the newspaper story about the same watch that was found in missus Darcy s hand being found in the hand of the dead man Yes that part s true enough but that s all there is to it It s just one of them coincidences like Singa Phut got back his watch after the prosecutor decided he didn t need it for evidence There wasn t nothing that Singa had to do with the Darcy case anyhow and he seemed awful anxious to get back that watch So it was turned over to him But did he really kill his partner Surest thing you know Busted his head in with a heavy candlestick one of a pair I ve got em here look and opening a closet where he temporarily kept his collection of evidence Donovan took out a pair of heavy bronze candlesticks in the form of hooded cobras That s the one that did the business said the headquarters detective showing one candlestick with something dark and unpleasant on the heavier end Gad exclaimed the colonel The very pair I was going to buy What You buy cried Donovan Look here Colonel do you know anything about this and the detective s professional instincts got the upper hand of his friendliness Not the least in the world not as much as you do was the cool answer I happened to see those candlesticks in the window of Singa Phut s shop the other day and I made up my mind to buy them when I had a chance Now I m afraid I won t But how did it happen Oh well there isn t much of a story to it and Donovan s voice showed his disappointment Phut I don t know whether that s his first or his last name anyhow he had a partner named Shere Ali No one knows much about Ali for he came here just recently Anyhow he and Phut didn t get along very well it seems Neighbors often heard em scrappin a lot and this afternoon they went at it again hot and heavy Then things quieted down and nobody heard anything more Toward dark a man went in to buy a lamp He found the place without a light in it stumbled over something on the floor and there was Ali s body with the head busted in and this heavy candlestick near it He raised the howl right off and Pinkus and I got there as soon as we could Of course Phut was gone But we ll get him Then you think he did it Sure he did Who else And the watch was in Ali s hand Sure Held so tight we could hardly get it out In fact it was so tight that he s cut his palm grabbin hold of it Maybe the fight was about who owned the watch for the Dagos talked in their foreign lingo and none of the neighbors could tell what they were sayin I see And the watch Have you it Yes it s here Going yet too Hear it tick and Donovan held open the door of his closet From the place in which hung odd coats caps and other garments and from the shelf on which was a collection of gruesome weapons came an insistent ticking That s the watch announced the headquarters detective reaching in for it Going yet see and he held it out to Colonel Ashley Somewhat to the surprise of Donovan the military detective accepted the timepiece on his open palm and so gingerly that it caused Donovan to remark You re not as squeamish as all that are you Just because it was in a dead man s hand and in a woman s Oh not at all was the quick answer But as a matter of fact these East Indians are often carriers of bubonic plague you know and it s very contagious Of course neither Shere Ali nor Singa Phut may have had the germs about them but I am a bit squeamish when it comes to contagious diseases of that nature and I wouldn t like to scratch myself on that watch Scratch yourself on a watch and Donovan s voice was plainly skeptical Yes It may have some rough edges on it And I ve read enough about germs to know the danger I d advise you to be careful Ha laughed Donovan shortly I should worry about that The watch don t figure in the case except maybe they quarreled over who owned it Colonel Ashley said nothing He was carefully examining the watch which he still held in the palm of the hand holding it as carefully as though indeed it might be laden with germs the least touch of which against a tiny scratch might produce death Quite a curiosity said the colonel at length If you don t mind I should like to examine this a bit You can t take it away said Donovan I may need it as evidence when we get mister Phut or whatever the Dago s name is Oh no I wouldn t think of taking it away I ll look at it here It seems to be a very old timepiece one of the first made smaller than the old Nuremberg eggs I fancy Quite an interesting study watches Donovan Ever take it up and as the colonel questioned he was looking at the Indian timepiece under a magnifying glass he took from his pocket Who Me study watches I should say not It keeps me busy enough here without that Yes went on the colonel musingly This is an old timer The first watches you know Donovan were really small clocks and some were so much like clocks that the folks who carried them had to hang them to their belts instead of carrying them in their pockets That was away back in the fifteenth century Before the Big Wind in Ireland suggested Thong with a nod at his Irish compatriot Slightly laughed the colonel But all joking aside this is quite a wonderful piece of work I shouldn t be surprised but what it dated back to the time of Queen Elizabeth though it has been repaired and remodeled since then to make it more up to date Probably new works put in Queen Elizabeth was very fond of watches and clocks and her friends knowing that used to present her with beautiful specimens Some of the watches of her day were made in the form of crosses purses little books and even skulls Pity this one wasn t made that way like a skull mused Carroll seeing it s been in on two deaths here and no one knows how many somewhere else That s right agreed the colonel as he continued to move his magnifying glass over the surface of the still ticking watch And a close observer might have observed that he did not touch his bare fingers to the timepiece but poked it about and touched it here and there with the end of a leadpencil Very interesting observed the colonel as he passed the watch back to Donovan still using only the flat open palm of his hand on which to rest it Very interesting And Donovan take a friend s advice and don t be too free with that watch Too free with it asked the surprised detective Yes Don t scratch yourself on it whatever you do Why not Not that I m likely to for I never heard of being scratched by a watch but why not Simply because this watch But at that moment the doorman of police headquarters stuck his head in Scotland Yard as the patrolmen designated the inner sanctum where the detectives had their rooms and called Donovan Hello answered the sleuth Some one out here to see you All right be there in a second Excuse me he murmured to the colonel Be back in a minute But it was in less time than that that he came returning on the run and his face showed excitement What s up asked Carroll Singa Phut was the panting answer Friend of mine just tipped me off where I can get him See you later and making sure that his blackjack and revolver were in his pockets Donovan hurried out followed by the colonel whose hand had loosely closed over the ticking watch which unseen went out with him Later that night Singa Phut a silent shrinking and somewhat pathetic figure slept in a cell at police headquarters Donovan on the information brought in by a stool pigeon had made the arrest and was jubilant thereat Colonel Ashley with Shag at the proper distance in the background and with Jay Kenneth as his invited guest was sitting on the bank of a little stream fishing or at any rate he was somewhat idly using a rod and line to aid him in his thoughts Following his visit to police headquarters and his return to the hotel he had called Kenneth on the telephone and arranged to spend a quiet day with him in the fields near the stream I want to talk over Darcy s case with you the colonel had said And the two had talked had thought had talked again and now were silent for a time What are the chances of getting him off legally if we go at it from a negative standpoint asked the colonel I mean mister Kenneth if we call upon the prosecution to make out their best case which they can do only by circumstantial evidence and then put our man on the stand to deny everything to have him tell about the noise in the night about the curious sensation he experienced about the possibility of chloroform call witnesses as to his good character and so on what are the chances Rather a hypothetical question Colonel but I should say it might be a fifty fifty proposition At best he would get off with a Scotch verdict of not proven but he doesn t want that nor do I And you I don t want it either But I want to know just where we stand Now I know We ve got to prove James Darcy innocent by establishing the fact that some one else killed his cousin Exactly And can it be done It can and I m going to do it But I need to do a little more smoking out first Now I want to think If you ll excuse me I ll pretend I m fishing and I may catch something In fact I have a feeling that I ll land my fish And perhaps you have some other problems that may be clarified by a dallying along this stream Ah there s nothing like the philosophy of my friend Izaak Walton I d recommend him to you instead of Blackstone Thanks laughed Kenneth I am not altogether unfamiliar with the Complete Angler And you are right I have a little problem on my hands What is it Perhaps I can help you The old adage of two heads you know Yes It still holds good Well the question I am trying to solve is why did she say No alimony No alimony repeated the colonel puzzled Yes Just that As you may have guessed it s a divorce case I have just finished and so quietly that it hasn t become public property yet When it does it will create a sensation No alimony eh I suppose the lady there is a lady in it of course questioned the colonel Of course as is usual in a divorce case And there s no reason you shouldn t know It s missus Larch wife of Langford Larch the wealthy hotel owner She has just been granted on my application before the vice chancellor a separation from her husband but she refused to accept alimony and for the life of me with all Larch s wealth I can t see why That s my problem Colonel CHAPTER XII THE ODD COIN Colonel Ashley fished for a time in silence broken only by the gentle snores of Shag farther back in the field and by the murmur of the water The old colored man wrapped in a warm coat for it was not summer yet seemed to be enjoying his siesta when with a suddenness that was startling in that solitude the military detective uttered a cry of I ve got it What called Kenneth The solution to my problem No My fish chuckled the colonel as he skilfully played the luckless trout now struggling to get loose from the hook And when the fish was landed panting on the grass and Shag had been roused from his slumber to slip the now limp fish into the creel Colonel Ashley gave a sigh of relief and remarked I think I see it now The reason she asked no alimony inquired Kenneth No I wasn t thinking of that But I have been gathering up some loose ends and I think I know where to tie them together However don t think I m not interested in your case I ve fished enough for to day Not that ordinarily I m satisfied with one but I m not working the rod now I am as Shag calls it detectin and I just came out here to clarify my thoughts Having done that I m at your service if I can help Well I don t know that you can As I said the facts of the separation of the Larchs will soon be heralded all over the city for the final papers were filed to day and the reporters will be sure to see them So there is no harm in my telling you about it It s a plain and sordid story enough with the exception of her refusal of alimony and that I can t understand Do you care to hear about it Certainly my dear Kenneth It has no connection with the Darcy murder and so I didn t mention it to you before Go on It isn t generally known went on the lawyer that the hotel keeper s wife has left him She went away a short time ago and came to me and told me her story It was one of what at first might be called refined cruelty on her husband s part degenerating gradually into that of the baser sort You don t mean that Larch struck her that there was physical abuse do you asked the colonel That s what he did He seems to have been decent for a while after their marriage which marriage was a mistake from the first I can see that now I used to know Cynthia when she was a girl she was the daughter of Lodan Ratchford and her mother had peculiar and to my mind wrong ideas of social position and money Well poor Cynthia is paying the penalty now She was really forced into this marriage which to say the least must have been distasteful to her But I don t suppose more than two or three know that The colonel did not disclose the fact that it was no news to him Aaron Grafton s statement was being unexpectedly confirmed He remembered that Cynthia and Grafton had once been in love with each other Well when Cynthia came to me in my capacity as lawyer as well as old friend I could hardly believe what she told me about her husband went on Kenneth She said he had struck her more than once and she could stand it no longer She wanted to apply for a divorce but when I showed her that this would bring about much publicity and necessitate taking testimony on both sides with possibly a long dragged out case she agreed merely to ask for a separation now on the accusation of cruel and inhuman treatment On those grounds I went before the vice chancellor prepared to prove my case by competent witnesses But they were not needed Why not Because Larch made no defense He let the case go by default for which I was glad as it saved Cynthia from telling her story in open court Larch by refusing to appear practically admitted the charges against him and did not oppose the separation Then came the matter of alimony or rather I should call it separate maintenance as it is not alimony until a divorce is granted and that has not yet been done though we may apply for that later I was prepared to ask the vice chancellor for a pretty stiff annual sum for my client for I know Larch is rich when to my surprise she would not permit it She said if she left him it was for good and all and that she wanted none of his bounty She had some means of her own she declared and would work rather than accept a cent from him So I had to let her have her way and we did not ask the court for money though I had no such squeamish feelings when it came to my counsel fee I got that out of Larch rather than his wife Did he pay it No but he will or I ll sue him and get judgment Oh he ll pay all right He ll be so tickled to get out of paying his wife a monthly sum that he ll settle with me But I can t understand her attitude any more than I can the change that came over him For I really think he loved Cynthia once She was a beautiful girl and is still a handsome woman though trouble has left its mark on her Well it s a queer world anyhow Isn t it agreed the colonel And it takes all sorts of persons to make it up I m sorry I can t offer any explanation as to why your client wouldn t accept money when she had a perfect right to it However as you won your case I suppose it doesn t so much matter Not a great deal Still I would like to know There will be a sensation when this comes out And there was when Daley of the Times scooped the other reporters and sprang his sensational story of the separation of the Larchs the case having been heard in camera by the vice chancellor The murder of missus Darcy had some time ago been shifted off the front page though it would get back there when the young jeweler was tried As for the killing of Shere Ali that occasioned only passing interest the murdered man not being well known But the separation of mister and missus Larch was different The finely appointed hotel kept by Larch called the Homestead from the name of an old inn of Colonial days which it replaced was known for miles around It had a double reputation so to speak Though it had a grill in which nightly there gathered such of the sports of Colchester as cared for that form of entertainment the Homestead also catered to gatherings of a more refined nature Grave and even reverend conventions assembled in its ballroom and politicians of the upper if not better class were frequently seen in its dining room or cafe Being convenient to the courthouse nearly all the judges and lawyers took lunch there The place was also the scene of more or less important political dinners of the state at which matters in no slight degree affecting national policies were often whipped into shape Larch himself was a peculiar character In a smaller place he would have been called a saloon keeper Going a little higher up the scale in population he might have been designated as a hotel proprietor But in Colchester which was rather unique among cities he was looked up to as one of the substantial citizens of the place for he owned the Homestead where Washington when it was a wayside inn had stopped one night at least such was the rumor and families socially prominent some of whose members had very strong views on prohibition did not hesitate to attend balls given at the hotel And it was this man rich it was said handsome certainly that Cynthia Ratchford had married There had been other lovers whom she might have wedded it was rumored and more than one had remarked Why did she take him To this was the answer whispered Money And in a way it was true The family of Cynthia Larch at least her mother was socially ambitious and she saw that if her daughter became the wife of Langford Larch his wealth combined with her own family connections would give her a chance not only to shine in the way she desired but to eclipse some satellites who had outshone her in the social firmament She also saw an opportunity of paying old debts and reaping some revenges All of this she had done in a measure After the marriage which was a brilliant and gay one if not happy the Larch hotel it could hardly be called a home became the scene of many festive occasions A number of entertainments were given remarkable for the brilliant and effective dresses of the women the multiplicity and richness of the food and the variety of the wines Langford Larch could not himself be called a drinking man Occasionally as almost perforce he had to he drank a little wine But he was never noticeably drunk Nor was that side of his business ever accentuated Gradually there had come about little whispers that Cynthia Larch had made a mistake in her marriage There was little that was tangible mere gossip a hint that she would have been happier with some one else though he had not so much money as had Larch The rumors floated about a bit seemed to sink and then started off at full steam just before the news of the separation became public Then it was said of Larch that soon after the echoes of the wedding chimes had died away he had begun to treat his wife with refined cruelty that hidden away from the public underneath his habitual manner there was the rawness of the brute But for a time the entertainments were kept up and Cynthia lovelier than ever presided at her husband s table graced it with her presence and laughed and smiled at the men and women who came to partake of their lavish hospitality But it was noticed that the older and more conservative families were less often represented and when they were it was by some of the younger members whose reputations were already smirched or who had not yet acquired any and were willing to take a chance And also old friends of missus Larch observed that the smile did not long linger on her face And that behind the laughter in her eyes was the shadow of a skeleton at the feast Then came the legal separation and the parting missus Larch resuming her maiden name it was announced had gone to a quiet place to rest To her few intimates it was known that Cynthia had gone to the little village of Pompey where her father owned a small summer home As for Larch he met the various questions fired at him by his friends and others at the Homestead as well as he was able It was all due to a misunderstanding he said That was before the whole story of his cruel treatment of his wife became known For the papers of her testimony had been sealed and it was only by a sharp trick on the part of Daley that he got access to them Incidentally the vice chancelor was furious when it became known that the documents had been inspected by a reporter but then it was too late The story spread over half the front page of the Times and it was noted that the evening the paper came out a dinner which was to have been given by the Lawyers Club at the Homestead was unexpectedly postponed It wouldn t do you know after that story came out for me and the vice chancellor who sat in the case as well as other judges and members of the bar to be seen there Kenneth explained to the colonel Slowly and gradually but none the less surely a change came over the Homestead The gathering of congenial spirits who knew they would be undisturbed by a roistering element grew less frequent in the grill and Tudor rooms And it was whispered about Larch is lushing Meanwhile Colonel Ashley was a very busy man and to no one did he tell very much about his activities He saw Darcy frequently at the jail and to that young man s pleadings that something be done always returned the answer Don t worry It will come out all right But Amy and the disgrace She doesn t consider herself disgraced and you shouldn t The best of police headquarters or prosecutor s detectives make mistakes I m going to rectify them But it will take time Do you know who killed my cousin I think I do Then for the love of I can t tell you yet Darcy All in good time I ve got to be sure of my ground before I make too many moves Oh I know it s hard for you to stay here and hard to have the stigma attached to your name It s hard for Miss Mason too although she s bearing up like a major Gad sir that s what she s doing You ve got a friend in her of whom you may be proud And her father too he s with you from the drop of the flag he told me Quite a racing man he is a gentleman and a fine judge not only of whisky which is good in its place but of horses and men too Darcy you ve got good friends I know it Colonel and I count you among the best Thanks Then prove it by not asking me to play my hand before I have all the cards I want All in good time I m working several ends and they all must be fitted together like the old jigsaw puzzle before I can act Besides anything I could say now wouldn t set you free You can t get out before a trial or before I can produce some one on whom I can actually fasten the murder And I can t do that yet You aren t the only suspect though There s Harry King still locked up No he isn t Colonel He isn t cried the old detective and there was surprise in his voice No He was bailed out to day I thought you knew it I didn t I m glad you told me though So King got bail Who put it up It was high Larch The hotel keeper So I understand They took Harry away a while ago I wish I had been in his shoes I m glad you re not I don t imagine for a moment that fool King had a hand in this affair In fact I know he didn t But his are pretty uncertain shoes to be in just the same Now cheer up This setting him free on bail has given me a new angle to work on So cheer up and I ll do the best I can for you Any message you want to send to Miss Mason Only that I Darcy hesitated and grew red I guess I understand said the colonel with a laugh I ll tell her The colonel spent that evening in the grill room of the Homestead Though it was not the same as it had been and though patronage of the better sort had fallen off considerably it was still a jolly enough sort of place of its character to be in A number of men about town as they liked to be called were in and Colonel Ashley was sipping his julep when there entered mister Kettridge the relative of missus Darcy whose jewelry shop he was managing pending a settlement of her estate Good evening Colonel he called genially Will you join me in a Welsh rabbit Thank you no I m afraid my digestion isn t quite up to that as I ve had to cut out my fishing of late But what do you say to a julep Delighted I m sure and they sat down at one of the half enclosed tables in the grill and ordered food and drink They had become friends since the colonel s first visit to the store and the friendship had grown as they found they had congenial tastes The evening passed pleasantly for them They talked of much including the murder and the colonel was more than pleased to find that the jeweler had no very strong suspicion against young Darcy I ve known him from a boy said mister Kettridge and though he has his faults a crime such as this would be almost impossible to him no matter what motive such as the dispute over money or his sweetheart He may be guilty but I doubt it My idea exactly returned the colonel Now as to certain matters in the store on the morning of the murder The stopped clocks for instance Have you any theory Came at that instant fairly bursting into the quiet grill room some jolly good fellows to take them at their own valuation There were three of them the center figure being that of Harry King and he was very much intoxicated Hello Harry Where have you been some one called King regarded his questioner gravely as though deeply pondering over the matter It was often characteristic of him that though he became very much intoxicated yet at times under such conditions Harry King s language approached the cultured rather than degenerated into the common talk of the ordinary drunk That is not always but sometimes It happened to be so now I beg your pardon he said in the cultured tones he knew so well how to use yet of which he made so little use of late I said where have you been remarked the other We ve missed you I have been spending a week end in the country King remarked with biting sarcasm Found I was getting a bit stale in my golf don t you know there was a momentary pause while he regained the use of his treacherous tongue then he went on I caught myself foozling a few putts and I concluded I needed to work back up to form There was a laugh at this for scarcely one in the gilded grill but knew where King had been and whither he was going But the laugh was instantly hushed at the look that flashed from his eyes toward those who had indulged in the mirth King had a nasty temper that grew worse with his indulgence in drink and it was clear that he had been indulging and intended to continue I said I was golfing he went on exceedingly distinctly though with an effort And now Cat and he nodded patronizingly to the white aproned and respectful bartender will you be kind enough to see what my friends will be pleased to order that they may pour out a libation to let us say Polonius Why Polonius some one asked Because dear friend replied King softly he somewhat resembles a certain person here who talks too much but who is not so wise as he thinks And now he raised his glass to all the gods that on Olympus dwell And they drank with him Nodding and smiling at his friends who thronged about him standing under the gay lights which reflected from costly oil paintings Harry King plunged his hand into his pocket to pay the bill a check for which the bartender had thrust toward him Gad but he s got a wad somebody whispered as King pulled forth a great roll of bills together with a number of gold and silver coins There was a rattle of coins on the mahogany bar as King sought to disentangle a single bill from the wadded up currency in his pocket Some coins fell to the floor and rolled in the direction of the table whereat sat the colonel and mister Kettridge The latter with a pitying smile on his face leaned over to pick them up As he did so and brought a piece of money up into the light a curious look came over his face He stared at the coin What is it asked Colonel Ashley noting the unusual look It s it s an odd coin an old Roman one that missus Darcy had in her private collection kept in the jewelry store safe was the whispered answer I went over them the other day and noticed some were missing though I saw them all when I paid a visit to her just a short time before she was killed Was this odd coin in her collection asked the colonel as he looked at the piece which Kettridge handed him It was of considerable value to a collector That was hers went on the jeweler It must have been taken from her safe for she had refused many offers to sell it And now Now Harry King has it exclaimed Colonel Ashley I think this will bear looking into CHAPTER XIII SINGA PHUT mister Kettridge his eyes big with unconcealed wonder as he looked at the odd coin was eager to accost Harry King at once and demand to know whence the roysterer had obtained it In fact the jeweler half arose from his chair to approach the three swaggering men in the cafe section of the grill when Colonel Ashley laid a restraining hand on the shoulder of his new friend It won t do now he said gently Why not I ve got to find out how he came by that coin It s a rare and valuable one I tell you It s worth all of a thousand dollars to a collector Lots of them would be glad to pay more Its catalogue price is a thousand And now this drunken fool has it He must Colonel don t you see what this means Yes mister Kettridge I can very easily see what it might mean But King is in no condition now to approach on such a subject There is a saying that when the wine is in the wit is out and it is generally held by some detectives that then is the proper time to approach a subject for information that would otherwise be withheld But King is in a sarcastic mood now and sufficiently able to take care of himself to be very suspicious if we began to question him even under the guise of friendship I suppose so agreed the jeweler and yet Oh I wish I hadn t got into this suddenly exclaimed Colonel Ashley with almost a despairing gesture I started out for some quiet fishing which I very much needed for I am getting too old for this sort of thing I ought never to have undertaken it I m almost resolved to give it up I believe I will he said suddenly slapping his hand on the table at the sound of which a waiter hurried up No nothing now went on the colonel waving the man away Yes I ll give this case up he went on with a sigh In the morning I ll get Shag to lay out my rods and we ll go fishing I was foolish to let myself be dragged into this It would have been all right five years ago But now well I m through that s all mister Kettridge regarded his companion with amazement But what can we do without you he asked Oh I ll send you one of my best men was the answer I ll wire for Kedge You can rely on him He s solved more cases like this than I can remember Yes I ll send for Kedge This is no place for me I m too old Too old Colonel Yes too old And I ve grown too fond of fishing Yes I ll let Kedge finish this up And yet The detective seemed to muse for a moment Then he went on half murmuring to himself No hang it all Kedge has that bank case to look after Anyhow I don t believe he d figure this out right Oh well I suppose there s no help for it I ve got to keep on now that I ve started But it s my last case Positively my last case and once more he banged his hand down on the table Again the waiter glided up He looked at the colonel expectantly and the latter stared at him uncomprehendingly for a moment Oh yes went on the detective You may bring me er just a small glass of claret a very small one mister Kettridge gave his order and then looked relieved The colonel had seemed very much in earnest Do you suppose asked the jeweler that Harry King could have had anything to do with this case Of course it s possible but even so we can easily make sure of him and arrest him when we want him To approach him now would only be to defeat your own plan that is if you have one I confess this startles me I don t know what to make of it and there s no use pretending that I do After all detective work is the outcome of common sense plus a sort of special intuition and knowledge I have gotten to a certain point and now some of my theories are shattered That is they would be if I had been foolish enough to have formed arbitrary theories that could not be changed As it is that s just what I have not done I am still open to argument and conviction and this coin which you say belonged to missus Darcy a few days before her death and which now makes its appearance in the hands of a drunken man who has been under suspicion makes cause for question But my dear mister Kettridge let us be reasonable King will not run away and in his present condition he is likely to pick a quarrel with you if you mention the murder to him Consider also that it may be he came into possession of this coin honestly How He may have received it in change here He s spent enough money in the place I suppose But if he got it here Great Scott you don t suppose that Larch I don t suppose anything yet least of all regarding Larch But consider This is a public place A hundred persons yes two or three hundred come in here every day spend money and receive change Now this coin though to you and me it shows itself at once to be of great antiquity might easily be passed in a hurry or to one who had not the full possession of his senses as a silver half dollar which it somewhat resembles In fact I think I can persuade King that it was a half dollar he dropped And somewhat to the surprise of mister Kettridge the colonel who had been watching King as the latter sought on the floor for his fallen coins walked up to the wastral and handed him a fifty cent piece You dropped that I believe said Colonel Ashley genially enough Thanks old top Perhaps I did Have a drink No thank you With a friendly wave of his hand to the colonel King slipped the half dollar into his pocket with other loose change and turned to the glass that awaited him You see said the colonel to mister Kettridge He doesn t know he had it he doesn t know he lost it he doesn t know you have it Keep it I beg of you We may need it But suppose King goes away He won t I ll take care of that I ll telegraph for one of my best men I have a little more than I can look after personally What do you intend to do Have King kept in sight There are some others in this city I need to shadow You don t mean Singa Phut No he s in custody Besides I ve Well I guess I won t say what conclusion I ve come to regarding him I might have to change it He is an interesting study I haven t yet found a motive for his killing of his partner if he did it Who else could There might be many Just as there might be many ways to account for King s having possession of this coin He may have come by it in a way that is easily explained and if we inferentially accused him there would be trouble I suppose so Well Colonel Ashley I ll leave the case in your hands God knows for the sake of the family name I d like to see Darcy cleared I don t believe he did it Here you keep this coin for the detective had offered it to his companion You may need it Yes I may And so it is worth a thousand dollars mused the colonel Just about the sum Darcy claimed from his cousin I wonder Oh but what s the use of wondering I must make certain and he put the old Roman coin safely away in his wallet The colonel and his friend finished their modest meal and their more modest potations of no very strong liquids and went out leaving Harry King and his companions to make a night of it Larch whose face was unusually flushed was endeavoring to bring the young men to a less boisterous state for he realized that his better class of patrons did not like this sort of thing But King was in jubilant mood He had been released under heavy bail it is true when the hotel keeper gave a pledge for the appearance of the young man when he was wanted Harry was only held as a witness so far but an important one and because of his known characteristic of suddenly disappearing at times a heavy bond had been required Why Larch had gone on this bond did not make itself clear to Colonel Ashley and he set that down in his little red note book as one of the matters needing to be cleared up And so wondering much the colonel and mister Kettridge the former with the rare coin went out into the cool and star lit night leaving behind them the sounds of good fellowship of that particular brand in the Homestead One of the first places the colonel visited the next day was the jewelry shop Matters there had nearly assumed their normal aspect Trade was about the same under the skilful management of mister Kettridge and the cut glass and silver gleamed and glistened in the showcases as though the former owner of it all had not been cruelly slain Show you her collection of coins Certainly agreed mister Kettridge when the colonel told what he wanted As I said I saw them and particularly the one we picked up last night in her safe a week or so before she was killed I was on for a visit And I know that a week previous to that she had refused a thousand dollars for this particular one These coins were one of her hobbies and he brought from the safe the collection which was of considerable value to a numismatist There seem to be others besides the Roman coin gone said the jeweler for I now miss many I used to see in her case But of course she may have sold them I do remember the one King had though and I m sure she never sold that It was taken close to the time she was killed Colonel Ashley taking advantage of the time when the store was closed for the night minutely examined the safe but could find no evidence of its having been tampered with For what started out to be a simple murder case mused the old detective as he went back to his hotel that night this one bids fair to become quite complicated An impulse it was hardly more than that and yet it had to do with the matter in hand sent the detective to police headquarters I think I ll ask Donovan what Singa Phut said when he was arrested and charged with murdering his partner said the colonel to himself There s an end I haven t developed very much And I would like to ask that East Indian something about that queer watch Donovan was at headquarters it being his night on and he welcomed the detective as some one with whom he might hold converse Have a talk with Singa Phut Why sure if it will do you any good said the headquarters man when the colonel had made known his desire I was going to the jail on another matter anyhow and I might as well kill two birds as one They ll let you see him if I m with you Otherwise you d have to get an order from the prosecutor s office Come along It was raining when they reached the jail and the colonel as he heard the patter of drops thought of the night he had first come to Colchester There ought to be good fishing after this rain said the colonel with a regretful sigh as he thought of his rods and flies Fishin exclaimed Donovan Say that s something I haven t done since I was a kid I used to like it though Well here we are Looks like a party What d you s pose the warden s all lit up for Certainly the gloomy jail was more brightly lighted than usual at night for the prisoners were locked in their cells and all illumination save the keepers lights put out at nine o clock We want to see that Dago you know Singa Phut said Donovan as he nodded to the deputy warden who answered their ring at the steel side door Humph Little too late was the answer Too late What d you mean He s gone That s it On bail No it couldn t be with a murder charge expostulated Donovan He can t be out You re kiddin He s croaked answered the deputy warden We found him dead in his cell half an hour ago CHAPTER XIV THE HIDDEN WIRES Donovan looked at the deputy as if about to dispute the statement The detective even opened his lips to speak but no sound came through them Donovan sat down in a chair Do you mean he asked passing his hand over his face as though to brush away unseen cobwebs Do you mean that he s dead Sure was the answer Croaked I told you Deader n a burned out cigarette Well observed Donovan dispassionately that s the limit I agree with you said the colonel and there was a curious look on his face Though if you mean it s the end I beg to differ It s only the beginning How d it happen asked Donovan sharply We don t know was the answer The Dago was all right to day except he seemed a little glummer than usual He didn t eat any supper though but that s nothing Lots of times the birds in here get off their feed and the deputy warden made a comprehensive gesture He was locked up with the rest to night and we got sort of quiet and comfortable here and I was having a game of pinochle with Tom Doyle when one of our boarders in murderers row lets out a howl Course I went to see what it was and there was the Dago croaked What did it asked Donovan We don t know Doc Warren s in now giving him the once over Did he have any visitors to day asked the colonel Yes a fellow like himself Indian I reckon But we didn t let him further than the corridor It wasn t visiting day for the fellows in his row so the Dago left a package and went away What was in the package the colonel questioned further Oh just some cigarettes Singa Phut didn t like the kind we keep and he had to have his own fancy kind He s had em before so we knew they was all right Was that all Every blessed thing that was in the package So we let him have the cigarettes That was about four o clock He was dead at eight Here comes the doctor now Maybe he can tell you something Doctor Warren rubbing his hands to get rid of the lint from the warden s towel came along settling himself into his coat which he had removed the better to examine the body of the East Indian Well Donovan said the county physician your friend saved you the trouble of convicting him Yep But I d a had him all right I d a sent him to the chair without any trouble But what ailed him Doc I can t say yet Looks like a case of heart disease I ll hold an autopsy in the morning He s dead all right I thought maybe some of the other prisoners might have got in and croaked him commented the headquarters detective Riley was saying some one let out a yell That was Schmidt fellow that killed his wife interposed the deputy warden He s in the cell next to where the Dago was Schmidt said he heard the foreigner breathing awful funny It was his last breath all right He was dead when I got in Doc Yes they go quick that way Are you sure it was heart disease doctor Warren asked the colonel No not at all I just mentioned that as most probable He didn t look strong I can t tell for a certainty until to morrow Pardon me doctor Warren for presuming on what is particularly your own ground but did you look to see if any of the cigarettes were left in his cell I didn t notice If you want to take a look come on back And I don t in the least mind any suggestions from you Colonel I m too much interested in your work In fact I d be glad to have you help in this investigation if you think there s anything crooked Oh not at all Suicide is of course the most natural suspicion in a case like this and it isn t hard to conceal enough opium in a cigarette to kill a dozen men Blazes I never thought of that ejaculated the deputy Come on and he led the way back to the cell Singa Phut s body had been removed to another part of the jail But the cell was as it had been when the final summons came to the East Indian There were the few poor possessions he had been allowed to have with him simple and apparently safe enough And scattered on the floor were some of the cigarettes made from strong Latakia tobacco the peculiar odor of which was even yet noticeable in the corners of the cell He smoked some of em all right observed the deputy Let s have a look suggested the colonel If we had a better light in here it might help I ll bring one of the two hundred watt bulbs we use down in the office said the warden who had joined the little group There was an electric light socket in each cell recently installed as the result of the agitation of a prison reform committee The low powered bulb was taken out and the glaring nitrogen gas one substituted It made the cell very bright and by the glare the colonel gathered up a number of the cigarettes Some had been smoked down to a mere stub others had not been lighted and two or three were broken in half neither end showing signs of either having been scorched by a match or wet by the lips of Singa Phut Queer he d waste em that way observed Donovan Usually they can t get enough to smoke He didn t exactly waste them said the colonel grimly as he looked at the divided but otherwise perfect cigarettes in his hand What do you call it then demanded the headquarters detective Well I think he was looking for something in the cigarettes and he found it What do you mean asked doctor Warren Wait Maybe I can show you Colonel Ashley carefully gathered up all the cigarettes in the cell a number of them being perfect With them and the black butts as well as the broken paper tubes he moved over to the small table in the cell and spread them out Donovan reached under the colonel s arm and broke open one of the whole cigarettes I don t see he began For the love of Mike look at this he suddenly exclaimed There s a needle in this dope stick And if you value your life don t touch it cried the colonel That s what I was looking for Don t so much as scratch yourself the hundredth part of an inch or Well you saw Singa Phut he ended grimly Poisoned needle Colonel asked doctor Warren as he shoved the cigarette Donovan had broken toward the middle of the table That s what I suspect If we had a cat now or a rat Easy enough to get a rat interposed the warden There s always some of the beasts in the traps we set about We catch em alive I don t like poison Here Riley go and see if you can find a rat in one of the traps What you going to do Colonel Try it on him If you have one yes You get my idea I guess Some one of Singa Phut s Indian friends knowing he would rather go out this way than pay the penalty of his crime brought in a package of his favorite cigarettes In two three or in perhaps more of the dope sticks as my friend Donovan calls them he shoved a fine needle the tip of which was dipped in some swift subtle Indian poison the secret of which these two alone perhaps knew With the cigarettes in his possession it was easy enough for Singa Phut to smoke some and extract a needle from another It was probably marked in some secret way More than one needle was sent to guard against failure But the first one must have worked I d like to find it I ll have the cell swept for you promised the warden as his deputy went off to look for a rat A keeper was summoned with a broom and brushed out the cell It did not take long for it was very clean Most of the debris was cigarette ash and scraps of paper and tobacco And it was in this debris carefully poked over with a lead pencil that a needle was found Colonel Ashley using extreme care laid the two together after an examination of the other unbroken cigarettes had disclosed the fact that none of them concealed anything I got one Warden A beaut came Riley s voice from down the corridor and he came in with a wire cage containing a large rat which cowered in one corner of his cell even as Singa Phut had shrunk into his when the end came How you going to get at him Colonel asked the warden They re nasty to handle One of em nipped my dog fierce when I gave him a chance at killing it a day or so ago I m not going to let it out If I had a stick or something that I could fasten the needle on I could work a sort of javelin remarked the colonel I ll get you one offered Riley much interested in the coming experiment Donovan too looked on in startled wonder A long slender stick was brought and using great care with his rubber gloves on that he used in autopsies Doctor Warren fastened the needle to the wand Then Colonel Ashley thrust the improvised spear through the wires of the cage and lightly punctured the rat which gave a protesting squeak It didn t hurt him much observed the colonel and if I have guessed right his death will be painless How soon asked Donovan I can t say but it ought not be very long The kind of poison they use is calculated to work swiftly In the glaring light from the nitrogen bulb they stood in the cell of the dead man gathered about the cage of the rat a prison within a prison After the first start caused by the needle prick the rodent again shrank back into its corner For perhaps ten minutes it remained thus and then it began to exhibit signs of uneasiness It stood up on its haunches and began to bite at the wires of the cage It squeaked more as though uneasy than in pain In another minute it began to run around the tin floor of its prison and then it suddenly stopped in its tracks fell over in a lump and was still Well I ll be began Donovan and then with a look at the colonel he substituted This gets me It sure does It evidently went right to the heart just as in Singa Phut s case observed the colonel grimly You were right said Doctor Warren it was poison He probably jabbed himself with the point of the needle and whatever was smeared on it did the rest I shall be interested in making the autopsy You will probably find very little trace of the poison said the colonel The kind they use is designed to disappear almost as soon as it becomes effective Still you may discover something But Doctor Warren did not Aside from a little scratch near the prisoner s heart where he had evidently dug the needle deep into his skin there was no sign that death was other than by natural causes The poison had gone directly into the blood as does the venom of a snake and had brought death in the same way In fact it was the opinion of Colonel Ashley that some form of snake poison was used though what it was no one could say And so passed out and beyond Singa Phut and the charge of murder having been quashed by a higher tribunal than that of the county court the matter was soon forgotten The colonel s theory that some fellow countryman had supplied the East Indian means of escaping the electric chair was generally accepted And that Singa Phut was guilty of having killed his partner in a sudden fit of passion following one of their frequent quarrels was also believed by those who cared to exercise any thought in the matter But what gets me though said the colonel is where does Singa Phut fit in with the watch in missus Darcy s hand That watch Ah there s a link I haven t had time to examine as I d like to I must see to it The colonel fell into a reverie His eyes went to the closet where he had put away his fishing rods Oh friend Izaak he murmured How basely I have deserted you But I m coming back Yes I ll stop this detective work I ll wire for Kedge to night to come on and take up the case He can do it as well as I I ll get Kedge He started for the telephone to dictate a telegram And then as he chanced to look out of the window a different expression came into his face Down on the sidewalk he saw Amy Mason walking slowly along The girl s pretty face was drawn and careworn Evidently the anxiety over Darcy was beginning to tell on her The old detective shook his head slowly Oh I suppose I can t back out now he sighed I ve gone too far It would look like quitting and I never was a quitter He straightened up to his soldierly height Besides he went on Kedge would only mix matters up now He wouldn t know what to do even if I told him Kedge is all right for some things but Oh well I ll keep on with the case This was the day following the discovery of the suicide of the East Indian in his cell and any intentions Colonel Ashley may have had of subjecting to a close examination the queer watch had to be postponed He had ventured to keep it after Donovan had shown it to him ready to make some plausible excuse if it was called for but the arrest of the East Indian and the preparation of the case for trial in connection with the prosecutor s office evidently made Donovan forget for the time being that the watch was not among other criminal relics in his closet As a matter of fact Colonel Ashley had had it in his possession since that night Donovan went out with his friend the stool pigeon And now carrying out a plan he had made the colonel one bright May morning put the odd timepiece in his pocket and started for the Darcy jewelry store intending to have Kettridge look at the mechanism and other parts of the watch But when the detective reached the establishment he saw to his surprise a great crowd gathered out in front a crowd that needed the services of several policemen to keep it from stopping traffic in the roadway Hello More trouble at the place mused the colonel quickening his steps I wonder what s up this time He inquired casually from those on the outskirts of the throng and received enough information to justify the getting out of several extra newspapers Burglar tried to blow up the safe and got blowed up himself Hold up man shot three of the girls behind the diamond counter and then killed himself Naw Somebody tried to set fire to the place Aw only one of the girls fainted that s all These opinions came mostly from boys or young men No one seemed to know exactly what had happened The colonel spied Mulligan the officer who had been the first official on the scene at the murder of missus Darcy and nodded in friendly fashion The bluecoat escorted the colonel through the crowd into the store I guess you ll be interested said Mulligan Yes thank you What is it I didn t hear all the particulars But Miss Brill the young lady clerk received an electrical shock from some wires hidden under the metal edge of one of the showcases so mister Kettridge says and she was knocked down Killed No but her head struck on the edge of a case and she s badly cut I sent for the ambulance It happened when the store was crowded and made a bit of excitement I should think it would Hidden electric wires and the colonel thought of a certain discovery he had made CHAPTER XV A DOG With the help of the police and when the stricken though not dangerously injured girl had been taken away in the ambulance the crowd was dispersed It was then Colonel Ashley had a chance to speak to mister Kettridge What s all this I hear asked the detective I don t know and the manager smiled wearily If you heard all of the rumors I did they would include everything from an I W W plot to a combined attack by New York gunmen But what was it Well one of our clerks Miss Brill was waiting on a customer at one of the silver showcases They are arranged with electric lights inside that may be switched on when needed She turned on the current to illuminate the inside of the case so that her customer might make a selection to have spread out on top when in some manner Miss Brill received a severe electrical shock She was thrown backward to the floor and her head struck a projecting corner of one of the rear showcases She was badly cut but the hospital doctor said there was no fracture Did she get shocked from the wires that run into the interior of the case asked the detective No and that s the queer part of it said the manager She was shocked while leaning against the silvered metal edge of the glass case and on examination I find some hidden electrical wires there wires that must in some way have become crossed on the lighting circuit I didn t know the wires were there I did said the colonel quietly You did Yes when I tested them with an instrument I secured from an electrician here in town the wires were dead There was not the slightest current in them Either they have been changed lately or some sudden jar or misplacement brought them in contact with a live circuit What were the wires for asked mister Kettridge That s what I ve been wanting to find out Originally I think they were for some system of burglar alarm installed by missus Darcy But now those wires run to the work bench that was used by James Darcy To his work bench The manager was obviously startled Yes But don t jump at conclusions You know he was working on an electric lathe he hoped to patent Those wires may be merely part of his equipment Yes and they may wait a minute suddenly exclaimed the manager I wonder From his private office into which he had ushered the colonel he looked down the store It was almost deserted now save for a few customers and the clerks It s the same place murmured the manager What is asked the detective Miss Brill was shocked and fell at the very spot where the dead body of missus Darcy was found said mister Kettridge in a low intense voice Except for the fact that she fell behind the showcase and missus Darcy in front of it the place is the same With a muttered exclamation the colonel got to his feet and also looked out from the private office You re right he admitted I wonder if that is a coincidence or something else I must go to see Darcy The prisoner was measurably startled when the detective told him the latest development at the jewelry store Those were never my wires in the showcase cried the young man I knew some were there for we did have an antiquated burglar alarm system when I first came to work for my cousin I had another one put in and I supposed they had ripped out the old wires But the wires I used for my lathe experiments had no connection with those I m sure What is your theory I have so many I don t know at which one to begin admitted Colonel Ashley But I was wondering if it was possible that the showcase wires which when I tested them were dead could have in some manner become charged and have given missus Darcy a shock that might have sent her reeling to the floor toppling the heavy statue over on her head and so killing her By accident do you mean asked Darcy his face lighting up with hope Yes This young lady received a severe blow on her head by her fall and your cousin You forget the stab wound Colonel No I didn t exactly forget it I was wondering how we could account for that if we accepted the shock theory I guess we can t I m still up against it I ve struck a snag maybe a stone wall Darcy Do you do you think you can get over it Colonel By gad sir I will That s all there is to it I will The silence of the colonel s room was broken by a peculiar scratching at the door interrupting his perusal of this passage I told you angling is an art either by practice or long observation or both But take this for a rule Come in invited the colonel thinking it might be Shag who sometimes for the lesser disturbance of his master s thoughts or reading thus announced himself But there entered no black and smiling Shag nor one of the hotel employees but a little dog which wagged its tail both in greeting to the colonel seated before a gas log in his room and also as a sort of applause for the dog itself because it had succeeded in pushing open the door which was left ajar but which nevertheless was rather stiff on the hinges And Chet the dog in question was rather proud of his achievement Thus his wagged tail had a double meaning so to speak Ah Chet you ve come in for another talk have you asked the colonel as he leaned over to pat the dog s head More wagging of the tail to indicate pleasure satisfaction and whatever else dogs thus express Glad to see you went on the colonel as though talking to a human and with more gyrations of the tail which constituted Chet s side of the talk with the colonel the little creature sought a warm spot near the gas log stretched out and sighed long in contentment Chet was the pet of a man a permanent resident of the hotel who had the suite next Colonel Ashley s and early in his stay at the hostelry the detective had made friends with the little animal which when mister Bland its own master was out often came in to visit the fisherman just as he had done now The colonel was thoroughly enjoying himself for he had put aside in the perusal of Walton all thoughts of the murder and its many complications when there came another interruption This time it was a ring of his room telephone There s a gentleman downstairs asking for you came the word in response to his answer to the summons Who is it Says I m to tell you he s mister Young Oh yes Jack Young send him up The colonel closed the book with a sigh of regret No use trying to read Izaak now he murmured It would be a sacrilege I ll have to wait a bit Wonder what Jack wants Ah come in he called as a discreet knock sounded on the half opened door Trouble Not yet Colonel though there may be Do you want me to follow King out of town Of course Wherever he goes Stick to him like a leech and the detective indicated a chair to his visitor Jack Young was one of the Ashley Agency s most trusted lieutenants I sent for you to have you shadow King said the detective in a low voice seeing to it that the door was closed because I think we can get something out of him Not a confession surely exclaimed Young Well if he gets drunk enough yes But not the kind of confession that would be any use to us What a man babbles when the wine is in and the wit is out wouldn t be much use in a court of law But if you can get him to tell anything about where he got that queer coin the one that used to be in missus Darcy s collection so much to the good But be foxy about it Jack I will What I came to see about is whether you want me to follow him out of town He s been cutting a pretty wide swath since he got out on bail and he s been having some pretty sporty times And you ve been with him is that it To the best of my ability yes admitted Jack as he patted Chet when the dog that evidently had met him before slid over to have his ears pulled I have great faith in your ability Jack The point is to stick to King You managed to make friends with him That wasn t hard But I ll need a little money if I m to keep up his pace That s why I came to you Perfectly right Jack Mason so thoroughly believes in the innocence of Darcy and he sticks by his daughter s engagement so well that he d supply twice as much cash as was necessary to sift this to the bottom So here s some to enable you to keep up to King s pace Of course it s none of my business Colonel but I d like to know a little bit about how the wind blows Do you really suspect him of the murder Jack I don t know was the frank answer as Chet went back to his place by the gas log His having that odd coin was what put me on his trail again and I sent for you to shadow him as I had too many other irons in the fire And you ve done well I guess there isn t much that Harry has done since that night about a week ago when I saw him in the Homestead that you don t know about I guess not Colonel But with it all I m not much nearer than I was at first How about Spotty He won t say a word You tried the third degree on him of course I er I did and I didn t the colonel answered lamely You see you can t go too far with a man when he has saved your life But he may know all about it Possibly How about young Darcy The colonel did not answer at once It was not until he had gone to a closet and taken from it a package which he placed on a tabarette on which near him rested a box of cigars that he spoke Then he said If I could find out why Singa Phut used this watch I d be in a better position to answer and from the package the detective took the timepiece which he had kept after Donovan had given it to him to examine You mean you re not sure about Darcy Well I thought I was At first I had my doubts Then when I had looked over the ground and talked with Miss Mason and him I was willing to take up his case just because I believed he had nothing to do with the murder The colonel who had taken the watch from some tissue paper in which it was wrapped laid it down on the low stool and turned his attention to his visitor Chet with a whine and stretch indicating that he was warmed and rested and would not object to a little play walked slowly over toward the colonel But went on the detective since the finding of the electric wires running to Darcy s desk Jack I tell you what it is You helped me out wonderfully on that robbery of the Chatham bank when the cashier ran some wires to the time lock and had it open five hours ahead of time I wish you d come and have a look at those wires with me Maybe you could give me a hint that would clear up some of the doubt I have regarding Darcy All right Colonel I ll come But I think I d better follow King now He s got a date with Larch the hotel keeper and there may be something in it Oh go by all means The wires will keep Here I ll give you an idea about how they run and the colonel drew a sort of diagram of the jewelry store indicating the showcase where the hidden wires had been found explaining to his man the effect on the young woman clerk who had been shocked Jack Young studied the diagram carefully and shook his head The colonel meanwhile sat back and waited Chet was worrying the tissue paper in which the Indian s watch was wrapped Well Colonel I ll tell you what it is said Jack after a series of questions I d have to see the place to get at any right idea of it Not to cast any aspersions on your ability as an artist I can t just make out how the wires run from this sketch and he smiled after having studied the drawings for perhaps ten minutes Don t blame you a bit laughed the colonel I never was much on pencil work But now you follow Harry King If you need more money come to me he added as he handed over a roll of bills And then we ll have to go at those wires I m not so sure The colonel s remarks were interrupted by peculiar actions on the part of Chet The little animal appeared to have gotten something into his mouth which bothered him He was whining and pawing at his jaws Look at the dog Colonel exclaimed Jack Look Gad he s got hold of the Indian s watch cried the detective He s been worrying it as he would a bone and he s got it in his mouth and can t get it out Easy there don t touch it came the sharp command as Jack Young took a step forward evidently with the intention of helping the distressed animal What s the matter Colonel asked Jack You don t want to see the dog suffer do you No but there he s got it out himself With an effort the dog had pawed from his mouth the watch which being rather large and of peculiar shape had for some time been stuck in his jaws It rolled out on the floor and the colonel stooped to pick it up But Jack noticed that his chief used a wad of the tissue paper with which to handle the timepiece which was no longer ticking What s the matter fraid of soiling your hands asked Jack with a laugh Well yes in a way Look at the dog s mouth It s bleeding cried Jack pointing I was afraid it would be said the colonel quietly Don t go near him Jack for unless I m much mistaken The two men gazed at the dog The little animal suddenly looked up at them in a peculiar manner It whined and its body was shaken as with a cold shiver A little blood was running down the lips which were now foam flecked The dog s going mad cried Jack Look out Colonel or You needn t be afraid was the calm answer as the other turned toward the door He ll never hurt any one Ah I thought so And as the colonel spoke Chet gave a shudder fell over on his side and with a long sigh lay very still CHAPTER XVI THE COLONEL WONDERS What did that Colonel What devilish thing did that and with a trembling finger Jack Young pointed to the body of the dead dog on the floor of the detective s room What killed the poor brute Unless I m very much mistaken this did was the answer in a low voice and the colonel with the watch still wrapped carefully in the wad of tissue paper placed it on the table That ticker killed the dog Nonsense He didn t swallow it He had it in his mouth but he got it out That couldn t have killed him I think it did though Jack just as it killed Shere Ali and just as Do you mean that s what killed missus Darcy that watch I don t know yet Jack But how could it How could The visitor ceased his questions to watch the colonel who had gone to a closet and taken out a pair of rubber gloves Putting them on he took the watch from its tissue paper wrappings and then holding it under the gleaming light on his table he gave a twist to the case pressed on a certain point in the rim with the end of his lead pencil and a tiny needle shot out into view Look said the colonel to Jack Young Good Lord An infernal machine in a watch Not exactly an infernal machine but a poisoned needle which only required pressure on the rim of the case to shoot it out into the hand or whatever part of a person or animal was near it Poor Chet gnawing the watch which he was playing with worrying it as he would a bone must have bitten on the right place The needle shot out pierced his tongue or lips and the deadly poison did the rest But Colonel this this is the watch missus Darcy had in her hand when she was found dead Yes was the cool response And its the same one Shere Ali had in his hand when he was found dead Yes But both of them had their heads smashed in Yes Jack But Great Scott Colonel the watch can t do that as well as poison to death It s out of the question Of course it is I didn t claim the watch did anything like that I don t even claim the poison needle watch killed missus Darcy or Shere Ali But that it did kill Chet I m certain I believe you re right there Colonel Ashley Poor little dog and Jack who loved animals looked at the limp body I know I m right Jack If I had seen in time that he had the watch I d have tried to get it away from him But maybe it will turn out for the best In the interests of justice Do you think this will help in solving the mystery It may But I thought you said the poison needle watch might not have killed missus Darcy I m not saying anything Jack It might and might not But the blow on her head the stab wound in her side Both could have been inflicted after the poison watch killed her if it did Mind you Jack I m making no statements I am only suggesting possibilities But Great Scott Colonel Shere Ali was killed in the same way He had the ticking watch in his hand and his head was smashed in Yes And of course he may have been struck on his head after he died from the poisoned watch Exactly And this watch Darcy had in his possession to repair just before missus Darcy was found dead and she had it in her hand and say Colonel where are we at and Jack Young looked hopelessly at his chief I don t know was the measured answer I wish I did There is only one thing we can be sure of and that is no matter what part Darcy had in the murder if he had any by means of this watch in the case of missus Darcy he had none in Shere Ali s case for Darcy was locked up when that tragedy occurred That s so Colonel And yet Oh well what s the use of speculating What are you going to do next I don t know I wish There came another knock on the door and a voice asked Is Chet in here Colonel I generally find him with you when he isn t in my room and mister Bland entered through the opened door and from the figures of the detective and his helper the eyes of Chet s owner went to that of the motionless dog Chet s master sensed something wrong for with a cry of his pet s name he hurried toward the stretched out animal Don t exclaimed the colonel reaching out a restraining hand The dog has been poisoned and with a poison so deadly that even some of the foam from his lips in a tiny scratch might cause your death Don t touch him with bare hands Poisoned Colonel Chet poisoned Sorrowfully enough Colonel Ashley told how it had happened showing the poisoned watch but not disclosing the fact that it was the one which had figured in the deaths of missus Darcy and Shere Ali And as nothing had yet been made public to the effect that the watch which had had a part in both cases was more than an ordinary timepiece mister Bland did not connect it with these two deaths Colonel Ashley let it be understood that the watch was a curiosity having to do with some case he was investigating And if I had even dreamed that your dog would take it off the stool to worry it as he might a bone I d never have let him in here said the detective I can t tell you how sorry I am mister Bland for I loved Chet almost as much as you did I know I know And he liked you Poor little dog Poor little dog Tenderly they bore him out the colonel insisting that no one touch him with ungloved hands and a little later Chet was quietly buried But what are you going to do about that watch and all that it means asked Jack Young later when he was about to depart to take up the shadowing of Harry King I m going to see how it s made and try to learn whether or not Darcy was aware of its deadly nature If he was The colonel did not finish Well I ll get on my way said Jack after a pause I ll keep in touch with you in case you need me And don t lose sight of Harry King was the parting admonition Something just as unexpected as this may turn up in his case and the colonel motioned to the watch Left to himself the detective looked at the timepiece on his table now silent in its tissue wrapping The needle which under the magnifying glass was shown to be hollow probably drawing the poison from some receptacle inside the case had slipped back out of sight when the pressure was removed from the rim The watch of death mused the colonel I must see how you are made inside and I think I d better have a professional perform an autopsy on you I ll send for Kettridge He knows all about watches though I question if he ever saw one like this The colonel was about to use his telephone when it rang and answering it he was told that another visitor wished to see him Who is it he asked the clerk downstairs mister Aaron Grafton Send him up Grafton was plainly nervous as he entered the room and the colonel had he not been a man of experience might have allowed this nervousness to influence his judgment and bring into too much prominence the first suspicions the detective had felt regarding this man Ah mister Grafton you wish to see me Only for a moment Colonel Ashley I don t like to call on you thus openly for it might give rise to all sorts of questions but Oh don t let that worry you I m a detective and known as such now And you as the owner of a large department store where shop lifting and other crimes may be committed any day are often in need of the services of detectives I should say I am but Well don t worry If any one knows of your coming to me they will imagine you wish to consult me about something connected with your store So don t let that influence you But has anything else happened Yes answered mister Grafton there has What asked the colonel Well I ve come to say that I don t think I ll need your services any more Not need them No And I wish to pay you and thank you I m ever so much obliged to you for what you have done But I haven t done anything yet I haven t Oh I see You are not satisfied with my work on your behalf Well I can t say I blame you for really I haven t had time to give it as much consideration as I d like Still that couldn t be helped and Oh don t misunderstand me Colonel Ashley I am not at all dissatisfied and mister Grafton held up a protesting hand The truth is I ll not need your services in helping me to recover the diamond cross for missus Larch or Miss Ratchford as she calls herself since the separation You can drop that case Colonel Drop it Yes the diamond cross has been recovered I just had a letter from Cyn from Miss Ratchford saying she has the cross She has the missing diamond cross fairly cried the detective Yes Where did she get it Could Spotty The colonel whispered the last name to himself and then stopped short I don t know I just had a telegram from her and I am going to see her now to learn the particulars went on Aaron Grafton She is in Pompey you know where she used to live as a girl and where I Well I m going to see her I came to tell you the diamond cross mystery is solved and if you will let me know what I owe you I ll send you a check Oh that part will be all right mister Grafton But I don t understand Nor do I flung back Aaron Grafton over his shoulder as he left the colonel s room rather hastily I ll tell you as soon as I ve seen Miss Ratchford Good bye and he was gone For a moment the colonel remained motionless in the middle of the room Then a queer look came over his face as he murmured Now I wonder whether he s telling the truth or lying Is the diamond cross in her possession or did Grafton say that so I d drop the case and leave him out of it I wonder And by the same token of wondering I think I d better not let you get too far away from me mister Grafton You will bear a little closer watching CHAPTER XVII A JOLLY GOOD FELLOW Well remarked Colonel Ashley briskly to himself there are two or three things I ve got to do and do them right away Which shall I tackle first I wonder if it won t be best to have Kettridge come here and perform the autopsy on that watch and he looked toward the closet where he had placed the one that had belonged to Singa Phut If I can look inside that and see whether or not the mechanism is so obvious that Darcy must have stumbled on it when he started to repair it if he did then well that complicates matters Yes I think I must see Kettridge Once more the colonel started toward his room telephone intending to summon the jeweler who was living over the store in missus Darcy s rooms The colonel paused at the instrument recalling that as he had been about to use it before there had come in a call for him the call announcing the department store keeper But this time the instrument was mute and the colonel had soon asked central for the telephone in the apartments now occupied by mister Kettridge There was a period of waiting I am ringing Marcy five thousand four hundred twenty six announced the pleasant voice of the girl in the central office Thank you responded the detective Another period of waiting and again the announcement of the girl though the colonel had not manifested any impatience Very well he responded There may be no one at home It was evident a little later that at least no one intended to answer the telephone and the colonel hung up he receiver Well Kettridge can wait he murmured as he carefully put away the watch thinking with a sigh of regret of poor little Chet The dog was a friendly animal and had made many friends in the hotel And so Miss Ratchford to use her maiden name has the diamond cross back again mused the colonel But how in the world could she get it when Spotty had it and the police that are holding him have that and he s resisting extradition Say I wish I could go fishing and the colonel shook his head in dogged impatience at the tangle into which the affair had snarled itself Spotty must have robbed the jewelry store in spite of what he says about it mused the Colonel But if he did and got the cross even if he didn t kill missus Darcy how in the world could he get the cross back to her when the police took it away from him and when the last I saw of it it was in the police headquarters safe This certainly gets me Oh Shag is that you called the colonel as he heard some one moving out in the hall near his door Yes sah Colonel You stay here until I come back I m going out and I don t know what time I ll be in Be careful to get straight any messages that come in over the wire and if Jack Young calls up get the phone number of the place where he is so I can call him Yes sah Colonel And Shag Yes sah Colonel Hand me that little green book I may have to be up all night and I want something to read that will keep me awake and the colonel slipped into his coat pocket the green volume He was taking his fishing by a sort of correspondence school method it will be observed The detective busied himself about his apartment getting ready to go out and from a suitcase which was closed with a complicated lock he took a number of articles which he stowed away in various pockets of his garments Is yo gwine be out all night Colonel asked Shag I can t say I m going to do a bit of shadow work and it may take me until sunrise But you stay right here Yes sah Colonel I will And now we ll see mister Aaron Grafton said the detective to himself as he prepared to leave whether you re telling the truth or not I think my one best bet is to follow you when you go to see Miss Cynthia But before the colonel could leave the room there sounded the insistent ringing of his telephone bell I wonder if that can be Kettridge he mused And yet he wouldn t know that I had called him Answer it Shag he directed It may be some one I don t care to talk to now Don t say I m here until you find out who it is Yes sah Colonel The colored servant unhooked the receiver and listened a moment Then carefully covering the mouthpiece with his hand he announced It s mister Young Colonel Is it Good Hold him I ll talk with him Quickly crossing the room the detective spoke rapidly into the instrument Hello Jack This is the colonel Yes what is it He is That s unusual for him Guess he s going down and out by the wrong route Yes I ll come right away You follow King and I ll take the trail after Larch So he s boasting that Well all sorts of things may happen now Yes I m on my way now You follow King The detective remained motionless for a few seconds after he had slipped the receiver into its hook Then he said to Shag Do you know where I ought to be now The colored man paused a moment before replying Then he played a safety shot by answering No sah Colonel I jest doesn t zactly Well I ought to be getting ready to go fishing I m sick of this whole business I m going to quit I never ought to have gone into it I m too old I told em that but they wouldn t believe me Too old to go fishin sah Colonel No sah You ll never be dat Never Oh I don t mean fishing Shag I mean I never ought to have been mixed up with this affair this detective business I m going to quit now Shag Yes sah Colonel Get me Kedge on the long distance mister Kedge in N York sah Yes I m going to turn this over to him It s getting on my nerves I want to go fishing I ll let him work out the rest of the problems Get Kedge on the wire Yes sah Colonel The colored man went to the instrument but before he had engaged the attention of central his master called Oh Shag Yes sah Colonel Wait a minute I suppose Kedge is very busy now Well yes sah I s pects so He had dat ar animal case Oh you mean mister Campbell s Yes sah Dat s it I knowed it was a camel or a elephant Yes I suppose he s busy on that So don t bother him Anyhow it would take him as long to get here pick up the loose ends and start out right as it would take me to finish Mo so Colonel voiced Shag A whole lot mo Oh well hang it all That s the way it is I never can get a little vacation But now I m in this game I suppose I might as well stick Never mind that call Shag I ll finish this Yes sah Colonel A fact which the wise Shag had known all along For it s always good weather When good fellows get together Over and over again the not unmusical strains welled out from one of the private rooms opening off the grill of the Homestead At times Larch stopped at the entrance smiling good naturedly but with rather a cynical look on his clean chiseled but cruel face More than once his eyes sought those of Harry King and the latter nodded and smiled He was spending money freely but was keeping himself well in hand though a waiter was at his side more often than at the side of any of the others How long has this been going on Jack asked the colonel who reached the hotel soon after his talk with Shag All the afternoon I guess and it looks as if it would be all night So it does I wish I d never gotten into this mess but I can t get out now Kedge would be sure to spoil it after I ve started things moving What especially did you want to tell me Well King is in there in his usual state dignified of course but how long he ll stay that way I can t tell It s Larch that puzzles me Yes it isn t usual for him to make such a congenial companion of himself with his customers But he s very different since his wife separated from him He doesn t hold himself so highly And it s telling on his business What do you mean I mean that a number of his best friends are leaving him The way it used to be was that the Homestead was patronized by a good class of people and organizations some that even were opposed to the liquor trade They knew they could have it or not have it as they pleased But now Larch is catering more and more to parties that wouldn t come here if there wasn t something strong to drink and that s driving the other sort away Yes I ve noticed that of late And that isn t all went on Young Larch is going to come a cropper if I m any judge What do you mean Again the Colonel seemed puzzled I mean he s going to smash financially He s been making some poor investments of late as well as gambling heavily and his money can t last forever He had a lot but most of it is gone I hadn t heard that Well it s true He was well off when he married That s the reason he got such a pretty wife I hear Her folks were ambitious for her Well she did shine for a while for the Homestead was not an ordinary hotel It was more of a Colchester institution But it s fast becoming something else now Larch is being pressed for cash and that may be one reason why he s so thick with Harry King King s got cash if it can only be gotten at I overheard Larch sounding him as to the chances of raising a big sum And what did King say He agreed to try to get it for Larch That s all I gathered then But I heard them talking of something else What Larch dropped a hint that he and his wife might be reconciled The deuce you say That s right Colonel I heard him telling King about it Larch is going to pay his wife a visit going to call on her at her father s place in Pompey And he s going to take her out a present I believe that s the usual thing after a quarrel Possibly admitted the colonel Oh I wish I d never mixed up in this I m sorry for young Darcy and I believe Oh well what s the use of talking now I m in it and I must see it through So Larch is going to visit his wife Yes He s either sent her a present or is going to I couldn t quite catch which What sort of present Jack A diamond cross What and the colonel had suddenly to modulate his voice or he would have attracted more attention that he cared to A diamond cross Are you sure about that Young Sure Why not I don t see anything queer there He might buy her a diamond cross as a sort of forgiveness gift Same idea Harry King had you know but a little higher class that s all You know Colonel these things are about alike The man on Water Street gets drunk and brings his wife home a quart of oysters as a peace offering The man on the boulevard does the same thing and patches up the break with a pearl pendant It s all the same only different Yes I suppose so I didn t know you were a philosopher Jack I m not It s just common sense But a diamond cross And if Larch is losing money Oh well he may have held out some or maybe the diamond cross isn t so elaborate You know they take a lot of little diamonds now set em in a cluster and make em look as good as a solitaire Anyhow Larch has been boasting to King that there s to be a diamond cross present And there s another angle to it What s that Jack Well there s been some talk between Larch and King about some big diamonds that have been sold of late I couldn t catch whether King had sold them or Larch Anyhow they brought quite a sum of money Maybe they were stolen from the jewelry stock Not unless missus Darcy had some of which James Darcy knew nothing Well I saw Larch at one time and Harry King at another have one of those white tissue paper packages that jewelers keep diamonds in I didn t get a glimpse at the stones themselves I had to be a bit cautious you know and even now I think they re suspicious of me here If it wasn t that King drinks so much though he manages to walk and talk straight I believe he d try to pump me Anyhow I thought I d better let you know what I d heard Jack I m glad you did So Larch has sent or is going to send his wife a diamond cross Well then Grafton might be right about that after all Gad this thing is getting mixed up Now Jack A waiter who knew the colonel from the fact that the latter was a striking figure and had been in the Homestead more than once approached the private room occupied by the detective and Jack Young and announced Excuse me Colonel but you are wanted at the telephone All right Where is it You can come right in here and have the call transferred from our central and the man opened the door of a small booth The Homestead was honeycombed with private rooms booths and telephones Yes this is Colonel Ashley announced the detective into the instrument when his identity had been questioned Who are you Oh Shag Yes Shag what is it What s that at the jewelry store you say Well will this never end Yes I ll go there at once What is it asked Jack as the colonel hung up the receiver Why Kettridge telephoned to my room and Shag took the message and repeated it to me Sallie Page the old servant of missus Darcy has just been killed by an electric shock in the jewelry store CHAPTER XVIII AMY S TEST However it was not quite as bad as that though Sallie Page had received a severe shock and had been near to death 
4015-63729-0000	train-other-500	Prompt action on the part of the physician on the hospital ambulance had started her feeble heart which had been affected by the current of electricity to beating
4015-63729-0001	train-other-500	This among other things Colonel Ashley learned when he hastened to the jewelry store from the Homestead leaving at the latter place his trusty lieutenant Jack Young to look after both Larch and Harry King
4015-63729-0002	train-other-500	neither of whom seemed likely to leave the place very soon Tell me more about it said the colonel when he was sitting with mister Kettridge in the dimly lighted jewelry shop after Sallie had been taken to the hospital What shocked her
4015-63729-0003	train-other-500	The same electric wires on the showcase that shocked Miss Brill the other day The electricians had been told to remove them but had not yet done so But I thought those wires were dead cut after the other accident mister Kettridge
4015-63729-0004	train-other-500	So they were But they can be supplied with current from another source it seems and I was the innocent cause of doing it You How By throwing over a switch on the work bench where James Darcy used to busy himself
4015-63729-0005	train-other-500	An electric switch on Darcy s work bench Yes come and see for yourself I ve sent for the electrician to come and rip out everything I ll have the place all wired over It was a makeshift job to begin with
4015-63729-0006	train-other-500	and since Darcy complicated the wires with some that he hoped to run his electric lathe with there is no telling when one may get a shock How did it happen asked the colonel as the jeweler led the way to that part of the store where Darcy had the repair bench
4015-63729-0007	train-other-500	behind the watch showcase It was now close to midnight and the excitement over the accident to Sallie which had occurred after the closing hour for the store had subsided not as much of a crowd having gathered at that time of the evening
4015-63729-0008	train-other-500	as would have done earlier Well it happened this way explained Kettridge We re going to have a special sale of a medium priced line of goods to morrow I was getting ready for it after the clerks had gone setting out the display and the like
4015-63729-0009	train-other-500	when I found I needed help It wasn t much just the little odds and ends that a woman can do better than a man when it comes to making things look fancy I might have telephoned for Miss Brill
4015-63729-0010	train-other-500	but I didn t like to bring her back as she d worked hard all day Then I thought of Sallie Page It s true she s deaf but she has been in the family so to speak a long while and she knows the shop and the goods pretty well
4015-63729-0011	train-other-500	She s quick if she is old so I got her down about nine o clock and we started in Then exactly how it happened I don t know I was puttering around the work table where Darcy used to do his jewel setting and his repair work
4015-63729-0012	train-other-500	and Sallie was over near the showcase I wanted more light on a certain piece of jewelry I had in my hand and I thoughtlessly threw over a switch I saw on Darcy s table It was a switch I hadn t noticed before
4015-63729-0013	train-other-500	in fact I accidentally uncovered it by moving a collection of his tools I hadn t previously disturbed No sooner had I closed the circuit than I heard a scream from Sallie and saw her fall backwards I had given her a shock without knowing it
4015-63729-0014	train-other-500	That was queer murmured the colonel Let me have a look at that switch And while you re about it I ll look too said another voice in the dimly lighted store and as the two turned in startled surprise
4015-63729-0015	train-other-500	they saw Detective Carroll smiling at them I heard there was another accident up here he went on still smiling so I came to have a look
none	none	 The side door was open and I walked in Guess you didn t hear me These rubber heels don t make much noise They don t indeed when you walk on them and not on the soles observed the colonel grimly The question is what do you want to see 
4015-63729-0016	train-other-500	The electric switch on Darcy s table was the answer I couldn t help hearing what you said mister Kettridge said Carroll and I don t know as I would have tried not to if I could This is important I rather guess it makes it look a bit bad for your friend Colonel Ashley
4015-63729-0017	train-other-500	and there was a sneer in the words Well I don t know was the cool response The wires as I understand it are to run an electric lathe and they might easily have become crossed
none	none	 Oh yes of course admitted Carroll And then again they might have been crossed on purpose It s a new stunt electrically shocking an old lady before you bang her over the head or stab her 
4015-63729-0018	train-other-500	but it s a good one I ll have a look at that switch I thought maybe I might find something interesting here when I heard about the shock to the old servant and I didn t miss my guess
4015-63729-0019	train-other-500	There was nothing for the colonel or mister Kettridge to say or do and they remained passive while Carroll took his time looking about Then he telephoned for Haliday of the prosecutor s office and also for the chief electrician of the police signal system
4015-63729-0020	train-other-500	and all three spent some time looking at the wires and testing them What do you think about it asked mister Kettridge of the colonel when the store was again dim and quiet What do I think I don t know I m going to have a talk with Darcy in the morning
none	none	 and if I find he s been deceiving me 
4015-63729-0021	train-other-500	Well I ll drop his case that s all If Darcy simulated surprise when the next morning at the jail
none	none	 told by the colonel of what had happened to Sallie Page 
4015-63729-0022	train-other-500	the prisoner was a consummate actor the detective thought Colonel Ashley Darcy exclaimed I never knew that my lathe wires crossed or connected with any circuit that might shock a person It is true I had the wires run in secretly
4015-63729-0023	train-other-500	as I didn t want my cousin to know about them She didn t favor my experiments on the electrical lathe
none	none	 and I had to keep quiet about it But I never strung those wires to shock her 
4015-63729-0024	train-other-500	and of course you can easily imagine I never could plan to injure Sallie Page that way or the young lady who was knocked down the other day
none	none	 Well Darcy you may be telling the truth and again you may not and the colonel s voice was as noncommittal as possible 
4015-63729-0025	train-other-500	But I am bound to point out to you that the prosecution will make the most of this and that it looks bad for you I know it does Colonel But I had no more to do with my cousin s death than Carroll or you
4015-63729-0026	train-other-500	Nor have I the least suspicion who did kill her My God what object would I have and he turned and paced up and down Well I ll do the best I can said the colonel But I must say it looks black
4015-63729-0027	train-other-500	Then you never knew your wires might by the closing of the switch on your table shock some one standing near the show case I never dreamed of it The wires must have been changed since I used them That will be looked into
4015-63729-0028	train-other-500	And the stopping of the clocks Could your apparatus have done that Never It is true a strong electrical current might
none	none	 under certain circumstances stop clocks as well as start them 
4015-63729-0029	train-other-500	But it would not stop all the clocks in the store or all that were going at different hours Perhaps not Well I must see what I can do
none	none	 Carroll and Thong with the prosecutor s men will use this for all it is worth We must combat it somehow 
4015-63729-0030	train-other-500	Please find a way Colonel I was so hopeful and now The young man could not go on for a moment because of his emotion Amy Miss Mason how does she take this he faltered
4015-63729-0031	train-other-500	She doesn t know it yet I believe
none	none	 It didn t get in this morning s papers 
4015-63729-0032	train-other-500	but it will be in this afternoon s I wish you could see her and explain I I can t stand it to have her lose faith in me I ll see what I can do
none	none	 I ll put the best face on it I can for her And you yourself Colonel 
4015-63729-0033	train-other-500	You you don t believe me guilty because of this new development do you If I did I wouldn t still be handling your case mister Darcy was the answer But I don t say that there isn t something to explain I am now giving you the benefit of the doubt
4015-63729-0034	train-other-500	Then maybe Amy will do the same It was not many hours before the colonel knew this point The first edition afternoon papers had not long been out when the detective who had gone to his hotel after an early morning visit to the jail
4015-63729-0035	train-other-500	was telephoned to by Miss Mason
none	none	 I happened to be in town shopping she said and the agitation was plainly audible in her voice 
4015-63729-0036	train-other-500	when I saw this terrible thing about mister Darcy s wires and poor Sallie Is she in any danger Colonel I believe not That s good May I come to see you I have something important to ask you Yes or I will come to see you Miss Mason
4015-63729-0037	train-other-500	No I had rather come to your hotel if you will meet me in the ladies parlor It will be secluded enough at this time And a little later Amy and the colonel were talking The girl s haggard look told plainly of her distress
4015-63729-0038	train-other-500	Tell me frankly she begged doesn t this make it look a little worse for mister Darcy Yes Miss Mason it does I had best be frank with you The prosecutor is bound to show that the presence of the wires
4015-63729-0039	train-other-500	controlled by a switch from mister Darcy s table were so arranged that he might shock his cousin or any one who put his hands on the showcase And they will undoubtedly argue that he planned this to make her insensible for his own purposes
none	none	 whether it was that he did it in a fit of passion to kill her for his fancied troubles 
4015-63729-0040	train-other-500	or to cover up a robbery I am only making it thus bald that you may know and face the worst I appreciate that and I thank you Then it does look bad for him It does And how does he bear up under it
4015-63729-0041	train-other-500	Very well His chief anxiety is regarding you I realize this is a test of friendship Miss Mason A test of both the loyalty of yourself and your father and
none	none	 Oh you needn t worry about dad 
4015-63729-0042	train-other-500	He ll stick by Jimmie through thick and thin for he says he knows he s innocent And yourself How does your loyalty meet the test Amy Mason drew herself up a splendid figure of beautiful womanhood
4015-63729-0043	train-other-500	She flashed a look at the detective that made him stand to his full military height and bearing
none	none	 and then she said Do you think I m going to let dad beat me Oh no Colonel Ashley So Amy Mason met the test CHAPTER XIX WORD FROM SPOTTY Well remarked Jack Young as he critically observed the smoke from his cigar curling upward toward the ceiling in the colonel s hotel room we have our work cut out for us all right I should say so agreed mister Kettridge who sat before a little table on top of which were strewed parts of a watch mister Kettridge had a jeweler s magnifying glass stuck in one eye and it gave him a most grotesque appearance as he glanced from the wheels springs and levers spread out in front of him over to Colonel Ashley There is only one thing to do gentlemen observed the detective who had one finger keeping a certain place in a certain green book And that is Make an arrest at once exclaimed Young He may get away from us if we don t drunk as he is No there s time enough for that objected the colonel What I was going to say is that we must take one thing at a time Otherwise we ll get into a tangle I think we re in one now said Young For the life of me I can t figure out who did the killing and the only reason I said we ought to arrest Harry King is because there s some game on between him and Larch and those diamonds King is trying to dispose of may be part of some of those missus Darcy had and about which she never said anything If King took them he may have killed the old lady and he ought to be locked up and take his chance with Darcy If he did it yes admitted the colonel But I haven t said he did I haven t said Larch did it I just don t know Certainly King and Larch have been pretty thick of late and Larch s bailing Harry out showed there was more than mere friendliness in it And as you say Jack if King or Larch sold some loose diamonds it looks as though there was something wrong But we don t want to make a mistake If we don t do something pretty soon they ll so fasten this crime on Jimmie Darcy that you ll never be able to get him out of the tangle said mister Kettridge as he poked a pair of pliers among the parts of the watch Carroll and Thong now that they know about the electrical wires think they have all the evidence they need and the prosecutor agrees with them I guess Still we may be able to combat that observed the colonel Now let me understand you about this watch mister Kettridge You don t believe Darcy ever put that poison needle arrangement in it No I don t That mechanism was built into the watch after it was originally made I m sure But even so it was done a number of years ago I can tell that by the type of small screws used They don t make that kind in this country Darcy never could have got possession of any to say nothing of some of the other parts used Following some days of strenuous work after Amy Mason had expressed her belief in her lover s innocence in spite of the finding of the electric wires and had urged the detective to use every endeavor to clear Darcy the colonel had summoned mister Kettridge to hold a sort of autopsy over the Indian watch which was still in possession of the old detective With the suicide of the East Indian the case had been dropped by Donovan and the authorities they taking it for granted that Singa Phut had killed Shere Ali and then ended his own life by help from outside in getting poison So if Donovan thought anything about the watch he said nothing Then you think Darcy is cleared of any connection with the poison watch asked the colonel I think so yes answered the jeweler As a matter of fact I don t believe Jimmie did any repair work on it at all Singa Phut brought it in to have it fixed it is true but Jimmie was a great chap for promising work and then not having it ready on time I ve known him to do that more than once and he lost missus Darcy customers that way He probably promised Singa Phut to have the watch ready for him and then either in working on his pet invention the electric lathe or because of his quarrel with his cousin forgot about the East Indian s watch He may as he says have gotten up early to redeem his promise to repair it But he never did asked the colonel It bears no evidence of it and the jeweler focused his glass on the dismembered timepiece Do you think he knew the deadly nature of the watch went on the detective It is doubtful This watch is of peculiar construction As I have showed you the poison needle could only be made to protrude when the watch reached a certain time which time could be set in advance as an alarm clock is set I think this is what happened though I may be wrong Singa Phut for purposes of his own had this poisoned watch in his possession He of course knew just what it would do and how to set it so that if a person at a certain hour took it into his or her hands and exerted any pressure on the rim the needle would shoot out and puncture the flesh The poison on the point then caused death And very speedy death added the colonel Witness what happened to poor little Chet The watch was wound up I wound it myself as a matter of fact though I did not dream that the time mechanism had anything to do with the poisoned needle Then the dog playing with it as he would with a bone bit on the rim just at the time when the needle was set to operate It shot out punctured his lip and Chet died Did you know it was a poisoned watch asked Jack Young I had guessed that after what happened and that is why I warned Donovan to be careful But as I said I thought it was like a sword cane or a spring dagger that only pressure on a certain part was needed to force out the needle with its death carrying smear of some subtle Indian poison I never dreamed it was like an alarm clock Well it was said mister Kettridge I can easily see all the parts now that I have taken it apart and the time setting arrangement is very compact simple and effective You were careful not to scratch yourself on the needle asked the colonel quickly Oh yes indeed I took that out first But do you think Colonel in spite of what I have said about Jimmie not knowing how this watch operated and presumably not having done any work on it do you think he can have planned to kill missus Darcy with it Hardly And yet it is possible that missus Darcy may have been killed by the watch Killed by it how gasped Jack Young I thought she was stabbed and her skull fractured She had both those injuries it is true But what is to have prevented her from having been punctured by the watch just before she received those hurts I mean in this way went on the colonel We will assume that Singa Phut finding some trifling thing the matter with his devilish watch brought it to the Darcy shop where he was fairly well known Darcy promised to fix the timepiece but neglected or forgot to do it leaving it on his table Then remembering it early in the morning perhaps feeling guilty at having spent part of the night working on his electric lathe he got up to do as he had promised and Finds his cousin dead interrupted mister Kettridge So he says added Jack Young significantly Well we won t go into that observed the colonel I was going to make another point Leaving Darcy out of it and assuming that he had left the watch on his table intending to get up in the morning and fix it what is to have prevented missus Darcy from coming down to her store say before midnight after Darcy left her She saw the watch on the table and picking it up may have wound it This set in motion the death dealing mechanism and her hand may have been punctured with the poison But even then put in Young as he puffed out another cloud of smoke if the poison from the watch killed her why would any one strike her on the head and stab her That may have occurred just after her hand was punctured by the needle of the watch said the detective and before the poison had time to work It is not instantaneous But who would have struck or stabbed her after that asked mister Kettridge I mean of course leaving Jimmie out for I don t believe he did it Could not Singa Phut have done it asked Colonel Ashley quietly Singa Phut cried both his auditors Yes Suppose after he had left the watch to be repaired with young Darcy the East Indian happened to think that he had not warned against winding it up which a jeweler would be most apt to do after making repairs Singa Phut had no reason for wishing harm to Darcy He may have come to the store late at night intending to warn him to be careful Well assuming that what next asked Jack Young Well Singa coming say at eleven o clock to the jewelry store finds missus Darcy there She has picked up the watch she must have done that for it was in her hand Singa sees it and fearful of what might happen he rushes in and tries to take it away from her She thinking him a thief resists and he fearful that he will be caught and arrested as a robber struggles to get the watch and to make his escape Now remember that he is of excitable nature that he is a foreigner fearful of our laws and that he knows the deadly nature of the poison in the watch Could not he have both struck missus Darcy with the hunter statue and stabbed her in trying to get away from her That would account for the killing But there would have been an alarm the struggle would have made a noise objected Jack Young Yes but there are not many people passing the store around midnight Every one in the place had gone to bed the sleeping rooms are quite a distance from the shop Then too very little noise may have been made I remember in the Peal case two strong and vigorous men battled at midnight one killing the other in a store on a main street in a big city But trolley cars and autos going past drowned all sounds of the fight It may have been so in this case Are you going to offer that to the jury to clear Darcy asked mister Kettridge I may have to was the colonel s answer How does it sound to you gentlemen Very plausible admitted Jack Young But what about the electric wires on Darcy s table They are a problem I admit However though Carroll thinks he can prove they were arranged deliberately to shock any one who at the proper moment might touch the showcase yet I think we can prove that an accidental crossing of perfectly harmless wires to Darcy s lathe with the city s electric light circuit may have caused the two accidents That is a point I have yet to consider But we have settled something regarding the watch anyhow Now Jack I want to talk to you about Harry King He needs to be talked about was the response I don t say he had anything to do with the murder especially not after what you have said about Singa Phut But Harry King needs watching I agree with you You say he and Larch have been looking at a packet of diamonds Yes diamonds wrapped in those little squares of white paper that jewelers use Looks like they d been robbing a gem store You don t know of any diamonds missing from missus Darcy s stock do you asked the colonel of mister Kettridge mister Young and I talked of this before but didn t settle it No But then she may have had a private stock of which Darcy nor I knew nothing It is a point worth looking into I agree with you So stick to Harry Jack my boy He won t require much sticking to at present He and Larch are both so well pickled that they ll easily keep until morning Well watch them after that Maybe you d better put up at the Homestead I will though I guess it won t be the Homestead long Why not Well Larch is going to lose it I hear It s mortgaged up to the roof and he can t meet his payments The old place has gone to the bow wows since he started drinking gambling speculating and since his wife left him All the decent crowd stopped coming Yes I suppose so agreed the colonel Well keep watch of Harry King He may provide us with a clew that will make it possible to prove Darcy innocent more directly than by the inference of Singa Phut And do you think Singa Phut killed his partner with the watch also Colonel asked Jack No I imagine they quarreled over the possession of the watch and Shere Ali perhaps forgetting the deadly nature of it or knowing the time mechanism was set not to go off for some hours grabbed it away from Singa Then came a quarrel and the killing with the candlestick However I don t want to speculate too far afield We have certain matters settled at any rate Yes and I ll get back to the Homestead and watch King observed Jack Young with a laugh And I must get back to the shop said mister Kettridge I have some work to do Shall I leave the watch apart this way Colonel Yes I may need it to show to the jury Leave it as it is but put it under glass and the needle away carefully We may have to kill a rat in court as we did in Singa Phut s cell I think we are coming on mused Colonel Ashley when his two visitors had gone I am entitled to a bit of recreation and opening his book he read Thus you having found and fitted for the place and depth thereof then go home and prepare your ground bait which is next to the fruit of your labors to be regarded I wonder mused the colonel If my ground bait is all prepared Am I right or wrong If I could see the diamond cross that Grafton says Larch sent back to his wife if I knew where he got it The telephone rang Yes what is it A telegram for you Colonel Send it up Tearing open the envelope Colonel Ashley read Spotty Morgan has confessed everything and agrees to extradition Shall we send him on Send him on I should say so cried the colonel to himself as he made a grab for the telephone to dictate a message telling the police of Sango the Western city to hold Spotty Morgan until he could come for him And so Spotty has confessed Well that let s me out even if he did save my life But it was a close call CHAPTER XX IN THE SHADOWS Colonel Ashley after a night s sleep was about to prepare for the trip when he thought of Darcy in jail I ve got to send him word he reasoned No I ll let his sweetheart take it to him It will be all the sweeter Here Shag he called Yes sah Colonel Whut is it Get me an auto Shag any kind of car will do I want to take a run out to Pompey where Miss Mason lives I won t trust the telephone and I ll have time enough before I leave for the West Get an auto Yes sah Colonel and Shag hurried down to the hotel office It was while getting into the machine that a message was handed the colonel Hastily he tore the note open It was from James Darcy and read Have just been informed they are going to put me on trial to morrow for the murder of missus Darcy I don t know what this unexpected move on the part of the prosecutor means but I would like to see you Whew whistled the colonel I never counted on this Maybe the prosecution has something up their sleeve they re waiting to spring They re trying to get ahead of me Well by gad sir they shan t I ll beat em yet This trip West will have to wait Shag you keep this auto here I m going into the hotel to telephone Yes sah Colonel Getting Kenneth on the wire the detective ascertained that the message from Darcy was correct the trial was to go on unexpectedly I may be able to get a postponement said the lawyer but it would not be safe to count on it We had better prepare our defense Are you all ready Colonel Not quite I ve got to get a certain man back here from the West but I can send for him I ll not go myself it s too risky See what you can do about getting a postponement It will be so much better if we can I was going to tell Miss Mason to go and give some good news to Darcy but maybe I d better wait now Can you produce the real murderer Colonel Ashley I can mister Kenneth Don t let that worry you When I want him I can lay my hands on the real murderer He can t get away We ll have our little surprise too Good That will make Darcy feel better I think I ll go to see him All right And if you want to arrange for Miss Mason to visit him I think it would be a good thing He may never go to trial and then again he might and as you never can count on legal tangles all the sentiment you can work up in his favor will be so much gained You might let a discreet reporter know about Miss Mason s going to the jail I will Colonel and thanks for the tip But James Darcy did not go to trial the next day Up to the last minute it looked as though he would and he was even brought down from jail to the courtroom where a great crowd had assembled in anticipation of the opening of the now celebrated case But when the judge took his place on the bench and the criers had proclaimed silence there was a whispered conference among the prosecutor and his detectives in which Carroll and Thong took part Then the judge was consulted and Darcy s lawyer was called to the bench He was observed to be protesting against something and finally the prosecutor went back to his seat at the table opposite the one where Darcy sat with his counsel Have you any cases to move this morning mister Prosecutor asked the court in formal tones May it please your Honor began mister Bardon I had hoped to move the case of the State against James Darcy indicted for murder but at the last minute I find that one of my important witnesses is unable to be in attendance and under those circumstances I am compelled to ask for an adjournment of two weeks I regret as regards the counsel on the other side having to do this as he assures me he is ready and anxious to go to trial but it is unavoidable and I promise this that if the witness referred to is not here two weeks from to day I will go on with the case anyhow Have you anything to say mister Kenneth asked the judge of Darcy s lawyer Only that I regret the delay as much as does the prosecutor and that we will be ready any time I should prefer to go on with the trial now but I realize that the matter is out my hands The case then stands adjourned for two weeks announced the court and the officer arising announced The case of the State against James Darcy postponed for two weeks and all witnesses for the prosecution and for the defence will then appear without further notice There was a hum of disappointment and most of the crowd filed out when the prosecutor moved a case of assault and battery Darcy with a look at Amy Mason which she returned with one of assurance and confidence was taken back to jail Colonel Ashley read Let your bait be as big a red worm as you can find Spotty is certainly red mused the fisherman He was sitting after the adjournment in his hotel room Red and freckled As for bait Musingly he closed the little green book and watched the smoke curl lazily from his cigar Several days went by The colonel was seated in his hotel room his finger between the leaves of a little green book smoking and reading The telephone rang sharply Hello Oh it s you is it Basset So you got back with Spotty did you Good No trouble on the trip Fine All right I ll wait here for you No the trial went off for two weeks You re in plenty of time I ll expect you soon Good bye An hour later the man he had sent West to bring on Spotty Morgan entered his room This man a detective from the colonel s office had been instructed by wire to go to a certain city and there without the formality of requisition papers which Spotty more or less generously waived bring on the prisoner Well what does he say Basset asked the colonel when he had provided his man with a cigar What does he say and the voice was eager Oh he says he did it all right And there s the cross and Basset tossed on the table beside the colonel a battered cross of gold in which sparkled many stones with the limpid fire of hidden rainbows Did he give any particulars Oh yes he come across with the whole story What made him hold back on me then He might have known I d find out Why didn t he confess to me Basset Well I guess it s just as he says he didn t want to split on a pal But when his pal went back on him What do you mean his pal went back on him asked the colonel and there was uneasiness in his voice And while you re about it Basset don t handle that cross so carelessly It s worth several thousand dollars a small fortune maybe and some of the stones may be loose They might fall out That wouldn t hurt Colonel I reckon maybe I did lose one or two on the way back careless like You lost some of those diamonds The colonel s voice was sharp Diamonds Diamonds nothin Them s paste Colonel That s what made Spotty sore His pal done him dirt and that s why he split The whole cross is made of phoney diamonds paste Paste diamonds Spotty s pal fooled him What do you mean gasped the colonel his apprehension growing Isn t this the diamond cross that missus Larch owned And yet if this is here how could her husband send it to her And Spotty Basset what does it all mean Well Colonel I don t know whose cross this is but whoever lost it didn t lose much It s worth about ten dollars I guess and say if ever there was a sore crook it s Spotty He says when he and Blue Ike planned to rob Grafton s store they thought there was some real jewelry there Rob Grafton s store cried the colonel Didn t Spotty confess to stealing this diamond cross from missus Darcy and killing her because she wouldn t let him get away with it Colonel this is the first I ve come on the case and all I know is I was sent on to bring Spotty back I wasn t told he was charged with murder He wasn t exactly charged with it but Well go on what did he confess to Just robbery that s all and he didn t get much He and Blue Ike cracked a crib here one night From what Spotty says they got in Aaron Grafton s department store opened the safe the way Ike always does by listening to the tumblers in the lock and took out some jewelry There wasn t much they picked the wrong safe I guess but anyhow they took this cross Had a fight over it too and it got stepped on or banged up in some way Spotty says Then they heard a noise and skipped Spotty kept the cross and thought he d have enough salted down when he sold it to live easy for a while He and Ike met out West and tried to sell the diamond cross to a fence and got pinched as suspicious characters by the bulls who were making their regular round of the pawnshops Ike squealed on Spotty for another job after they give him the third degree and when Spotty heard of that it made him sore as it would anybody Then when the two bulls who pinched Spotty and Ike tested the diamonds in the cross and found they was phoney as they might have guessed coming from a department store Spotty was fit to be tied he was so wild So he up and confessed Said he knew you wanted him for the job and was sorry he made so much trouble To send word to you that he d come on and stand trial But stars and stripes I didn t want him for this little robbery job cried the colonel I didn t even know he did it I was after him for the murder of missus Darcy where I thought he got the diamond cross And to think the jewels are paste and the colonel looked at them sparkling in the electric light as bravely as though they were worth a fortune instead of being what a poor shop girl might wear to a bricklayer s ball Well that s all I know about it said Basset Spotty wanted me to tell you he d confessed and he s dead sore on Blue Ike For several seconds the colonel said nothing and then he shook his head as a dog might on emerging from deep water and remarked Well I ve got to take another tack I guess Tell Spotty I ll arrange to have him bailed It ll be easy on a mere theft charge But how in thunder am I going to get Darcy off if I haven t any one to offer The tinkle of the telephone bell interrupted the colonel s half aloud musing Hello he said into the transmitter Oh that you Jack Well what s up now For a moment the colonel listened intently many emotions flashing across his face Basset toyed idly with the jeweled cross which sparkled as bravely as the real stones might have done Yes yes said the colonel impatiently Go on Jack And in a few more seconds the colonel added All right I ll get right after him Out toward Pompey you say All right I ll shadow him By the way Basset is here He brought on Spotty Morgan Come on over to my room and have a talk with him He ll tell you the yarn It ll surprise you I haven t time I m going to get right out and the receiver went on the hook with a bang Anything I can do Colonel asked Basset I m sorry to have to disappoint you about this cross but Oh that was my own fault for taking too much for granted I should have asked Grafton more questions and gotten a description of missus Larch s ornament He never said anything to me about being robbed Maybe he didn t count this it not being worth much and Basset flipped the sparkling cross half way across the table Maybe not and yet But if the colonel had any thoughts regarding Aaron Grafton he kept them to himself as he made ready to go out Know when you ll be back asked Basset No I can t say Make yourself at home here I ll tell em at the desk Shag will be over presently One of you stay here so I can telephone in if I have to You d better plan to stay all night if I don t get back Want to say where you re going I suppose I d better I m going to Pompey Out where you said missus Larch is staying Yes only she doesn t call herself that now I understand She s taken her maiden name again since the separation Yes I m going to Pompey and it may be night when I get there I ll have to do any shadowing among the shadows I guess as I ve often cast for trout But dark or light I think I ll bring home the right fish this time And so as the early shadows of the late afternoon were slanting over Colchester the old detective boarded a train keeping in view a well dressed freshly shaven individual who for all his slickness and sleekness seemed to have about him the air of a tiger His hands in new gloves slowly clasped and unclasped as though he would have liked to twine the fingers about the soft throat of a victim Yes murmured the colonel as he sank into his seat I think I ll bring home the big fish this time CHAPTER XXI SWIRLING WATERS At the little station of Pompey the colonel saw his man leave the train For the wily fisherman to slip from the car on the other side of the track and get behind a tool shanty was the work of but a moment and as the train pulled out and puffed on its way the detective peering around the corner of the shed which housed a handcar and other tools of the section hands had a glimpse of his fish as he facetiously termed him standing rather irresolutely on the station platform Now for the next move murmured the colonel It was not long in being played The man went inside the station but the detective did not come from his post of observation The depot was so small that any one leaving it even on the side away from the tracks would be seen as soon as he had passed beyond the shadows But the man evidently had no intention of going away He came out again on the front platform accompanied by a boy one seemingly who ran errands and delivered telegrams when any came to disturb the peaceful solitude of Pompey I must see that note murmured Colonel Ashley as he saw one handed to the boy If he goes in the direction I think he will I ll get it too I think I know the lady to whom it is addressed The boy talked with the man a little nodded his head as if understanding and then started off up the tracks toward a path that led across a field and toward a cluster of village houses Just as I thought the colonel whispered to himself Keeping the tool house between himself and the man now nervously pacing the platform the colonel walked rapidly away from the station in the direction taken by the boy The boy s legs were short and vigorous the colonel s long and no less muscular and thanks to his devotion to Walton which had taken him tramping many miles over hilly trails as well as across level meadows the old detective was soon able to overtake the lad and at a point impossible of observation from the station I say called the colonel The boy stopped and looked back questioningly Did you tell him where the best fishing was asked the colonel Fishing Who The gentleman who gave you that note Is it possible he didn t mention fishing Naw He didn t say nothin about it He just give me this letter and Very likely he forgot about the fishing part and the detective smiled grimly Let me see it just a moment Without hesitation the boy handed it over Thought was hardly more rapid than the colonel s perusal of the missive and as he gave it back to the boy he remarked It s all right I didn t make any mistake Now hurry and you needn t come back to the station right away But he told me to bring him an answer Oh did he Well then I ll wait for you in the village and you can let me see it first Then I ll know all about the fishing and I can be on hand with my friend Trot along Sonny I ll meet you in the village when you get the answer to the note Then I ll know just where to go fishing How is it around here Are there any good streams Are there Say I ve caught some of the biggest chubb Ah I thought I wasn t mistaken in thinking you a pupil in the school of Izaak Walton Isaac Walton Huh That ain t our teacher s name No I suppose not and the colonel smiled Well hurry along Sonny and here s an extra quarter for you I ll follow you and you can let me see the answer before you go back to my friend It would be too bad if he and I went fishing in separate places I want to be with him Where s your hooks and line asked the boy Oh I have them in my pocket the hooks and line and the colonel grimly tapped a pocket wherein something clicked metallicly You can cut a pole in the woods said the boy I ve done it lots of times Of course agreed the colonel smiling The boy sped away over the fields The detective followed more slowly until he reached the collection of houses and there he strolled along inspecting the different dwellings as though attracted by the quaint old village street It was not long before the boy returned an envelope held conspicuously in his hand He smiled as he caught sight of the colonel The shadows were lengthening It s too late for fishing now observed the boy as unwittingly he handed over the missive That is unless you re going to set night lines I may have to do that the detective agreed But it won t be quite dark yet for some time He glanced quickly at the envelope It bore no address on its plain white surface and under pretence of turning so as to take advantage of the last golden glow in the west the colonel quickly read the letter As he did so a look almost of fright came over his face I wonder if she ll keep her word he murmured I wonder He slipped the letter quickly into another plain envelope one of a miscellaneous collection of papers in his pocket and returned it to the boy retaining the covering he had been obliged to tear open for it had been sealed There you are he said And you needn t say anything to my friend about the fishing I want to surprise him Just don t say anything about me And here s half a dollar Sonny Could I hire you to take me to that brook you spoke of where you say there are such big fish Sure you could the boy answered eagerly as he pocketed the money I know a lot about fishing All right I may call on you Trot along now and remember don t say anything This is to be a surprise Sure I know and with a precocious wink the lad passed on into the ever lengthening shadows I think observed the colonel to himself as he watched the boy making his way back toward the station that I ll make a little change in the old saying and follow the woman instead of looking for her since I know where she is already Back then to the peaceful little village went the fisherman and reaching the house where the boy had left the note taking therefrom its answer Colonel Ashley waited with all the patience that might characterize a waiting beside some fishing stream But his patience was not tried long for presently a veiled woman emerged from the house She walked away rapidly the detective following unseen She is going to meet him just as she promised in the note though it must be galling to her pride murmured the old detective I wonder if she really believes he ll keep his word or can keep it Well I ll be there at the finish and I think this will be the finish he went on grimly as he thrust his hand into his side pocket where the hooks jingled with grim music As the woman walked on she turned now and then and looked back along the fast darkening streets For a moment the colonel was suspicious I wonder if she has seen me he murmured He gave a quick backward glance and started as he saw another figure not far behind him Can it be exclaimed the colonel No it s Aaron Grafton he proceeded with an air of relief He must have been at her house and she has asked him to follow her to make sure no harm is done A bit foolish of him under the circumstances But when a man s in love The colonel shrugged his shoulders and chuckled grimly However I must take care that he does not see me Slipping behind a tree the colonel effected a change in hats for he always wore a soft one and carried several collapsible ones Then buttoning his coat rather askew about him to give a careless air to his attire the colonel normally was one of the neatest men living he crossed to the other side of the street and then became the shadower of two instead of one for Aaron Grafton had passed on without apparently noticing him The woman was still in sight and before she reached the station the man who had sent the note came out and met her on the driveway The colonel looked back and saw mister Grafton dodging behind a tree He doesn t want to be seen either he mused Relying on his simple but effective disguise the colonel made bold to walk within hearing distance of the man and woman the latter having come to a stiff halt when she saw the man advancing to meet her We can t talk here said the dispatcher of the note Will you walk a little way with me His tones had the cutting coldness of steel and there was a sort of restrained cruelty in his every action I suppose it would not be wise to be seen talking to you here was the woman s low reply And believe me I have no desire to be seen with you again ever It was only your promise in the note that brought me here Are you prepared to keep it if I walk a way with you I am This is no more pleasant for me than for you but it must be done Come He did not offer to touch her nor did he turn his head more than half way in speaking to her He seemed to be controlling himself by an effort and she seemed to shrink away Again she looked back down the fast darkening street as though to make sure there was a way of escape some one near on whom she could rely Don t worry I ll be there when you have your little talk whispered the colonel to himself Suppose we walk up on The Heights suggested the man We will not be disturbed and Up there she gasped Why not he asked as they walked on and the colonel affecting a slowness in gait heard the words Just because you used to walk there in your in other days he substituted quickly is no reason why you shouldn t now is it Only memories Her voice was very low Memories Bah The words were as though he spewed them from his mouth like a bitter taste Come on and his tones were rough The woman looked at him a moment with eyes that seemed to burn through her veil and then followed The colonel passed on ahead slouched across the street once more and lagged behind so that he might follow The couple turned toward the outskirts of the village where on a hill known locally as The Heights there was a grove of trees Below the hill at one place cutting deep into it and making a precipitous cliff was a little river At the point where the stream had bitten into the hill it had washed for itself a defile the bottom rock covered so that the waters swirled over it in foam The Heights was the favorite trysting place of lovers and many were the pleasant spots there With evening coming on it was almost sure to be deserted though later if there was a moon murmuring voices would mingle with the eclipse of the swirling waters in the gully below Yes it s a quiet place for a talk mused the colonel The man and woman passed on Behind them came the shadower and behind him Aaron Grafton Up The Heights walked the leading pair seemingly unaware of the presence of any one but themselves Into the shadows they strolled still stiff and uncompromising both of them At last the woman halting near the edge of the cliff beyond which the woods were thicker faced the man This is far enough she said and she turned so that the fast fading light of the west was on her veiled face She did not raise the mesh Yes this is far enough I suppose said the man and there was a sneer in his tones Too far perhaps But I did not come here to discuss anything with you but the matter you spoke of in your note cut in the woman Did you bring my diamonds as you promised Yes I have them His voice was as cold as hers Then give them to me and let me go I don t know why I consented to meet you except that you said you would give them only to me personally And I don t even for that know why I came here I Possibly in memory of other days the man sneered Never she answered bitterly Oh never that Well as you choose he went on with a slight shrug of the shoulders But I have a few things I want to say to you and I didn t want the whole village babbling about it Too many know me here so I kept out of sight as much as I could Say what you have to say and quickly Give me my diamonds to which I have a right and let me go That is all I ask of you I m afraid it can t be done so quickly as all that and the man laughed cuttingly In the first place I want you to sign a paper I have it with me also a fountain pen I ve a flashlight to let you read what you sign in case it gets too dark Do you mean a receipt for the diamonds Not exactly Cynthia I Miss Ratchford if you please she exclaimed Miss Ratchford to you always after this Oh very well Now look here I m done with soft words and foolishness He took a sudden step nearer her and she shrank back Colonel Ashley who had worked himself to a position where hidden behind a screen of bushes he could see and hear watched closely Foolishness the woman questioned Yes foolishness You know the trouble I m in I ve got to have money You can get it for me I Yes And by the eternal you ve got to Do you think I m going to ruin just because you couldn t stand a little rough treatment now and then Why better women than you would be glad to come back to me I ll take you back Take me back Oh my God Cut out that hysterical stuff he ordered I m desperate I ve got to have money I can raise it on a note if you ll sign it and put up those bonds for security and by He caught her wrist in a grip that made her wince with pain as he swung her around to face him I ve got to have your signature and the bonds he exclaimed in voice tense with suppressed passion The bonds she exclaimed You know what almost became of them I let you raise money on them once and almost lost them Now you dare ask me for them again I do and I m going to enforce my demands I ve got to have money I darn t sell your diamonds at least I don t want to I d rather you d have them and he seemed to weaken as if with romance when it came to this sentiment As for the bonds You ll never touch them she cried bitterly Isn t it enough that you have ruined my life Now you must Oh stop the theatrical business he sneered Pity you didn t go on the stage Now look here This is your last chance I ll give you your diamonds if you ll sign this paper so I can get out of the tangle I m in You ve got to sign It s your last chance If you don t by all the She tore herself away from him and turned to flee but he was too quick for her and was about to encircle her in his arms when she shrank back and gave a despairing cry Don t don t touch me This seemed to madden the man for he sprang toward her fury and threat in every gesture Aaron Aaron He s going to kill me screamed Cynthia Thought was not quicker than the leaping forward of Colonel Ashley Out from the shadows he sprang to whirl back the man who with blazing eyes and murderous hate written on his face confronted Cynthia Ratchford What what s this snarled the man struggling to retain his balance What s this Who the devil are you to come between me and my Don t dare profane that name warned the woman I I Oh Aaron where are you It was very dark now under the trees Ha So that s who he is Your old lover Grafton Well I ll soon finish him I ll make him wish he hadn t come between us with his protecting ways and his diamond cross that he goes so secretly to have mended Bah A pretty lover Take that you sneaking fool There was a sliver of flame in the darkness and mingled with the report came a cry of anguish and a woman s scream as a heavy stick in the hands of Colonel Ashley broke the hand that held the revolver A little thud among the bushes told where the weapon had fallen its bullet cutting the tree branches overhead Oh who who are you gasped the woman as the colonel stepped between her and the man he had maimed I thought mister Grafton was I think that is he coming now said the old detective quietly as the sound of some one running up the path was borne to their strained senses Look here snarled the man with the broken wrist as he clasped it with his other hand aren t you he started back as a last flicker of the waning light fell across the colonel s face Who in the name of all the devils in hades are you he cried What right have you The right of the law was the quiet answer The colonel s hand slipped into his pocket where something metallic clicked The right of the law Langford Larch I arrest you for the murder of missus Amelia Darcy It was so still for a moment that the rustle of a bird s wings in the tree overhead sounded like the rushing of wind Colonel Ashley drawing something from his pocket took a step nearer the maimed man As he did so Larch laughed wildly Ah so that s the game is it he cried You have betrayed me Cynthia you she devil You put up this little game with your lover Grafton did you Well you Langford I never Bah Well I ll fool you all Arrest me for murdering the old woman will you Like hell you will He stepped back a pace Colonel Ashley following Keep back cried Larch If you touch me I m not afraid of you Yes I did kill her I didn t mean to but I did The game s up I can see that But you ll never get me to the chair I ll fool you all I m not afraid to die Before the colonel or Aaron Grafton who just then burst through the bushes fringing the path could make a move to prevent him Langford Larch with a cry like that of a stricken beast threw himself over the edge of the rocky precipice and his body went crashing down a hundred feet into the swirling waters below CHAPTER XXII HIS LAST CASE Slowly the bruised and cut lips moved Faintly came from the maimed throat a hoarse whisper I did it I know this is the end I ll confess everything Before his death which followed soon after he had been taken from the swirling waters Langford Larch made a complete confession telling how he had killed missus Darcy Swiftly went the news to the jail and later to the courthouse whence after a conference between the grave judge and a somewhat disappointed though perhaps gladly so prosecutor of the pleas James Darcy walked forth a free man honorably discharged from the custody of the court the indictment against him for murder quashed Amy Mason was the first to greet her lover when he stepped away from the bench of the judge before which he stood to hear himself cleared of the charge Oh Jimmie boy I m so glad and her eyes beamed And so am I Amy If you knew what I have gone through As if I didn t know Jimmie boy The colonel told me some of it Did he Isn t he a trump Where is he now Oh dad carried him off for some long delayed fishing answered Amy as she and James Darcy left the courtroom before a throng that could not be restrained from cheering despite the cries of Silence on the part of the constable But how did he know that Larch killed her asked Darcy as he and Amy rode away in her car amid the cheers of the throng outside the county building By the process of elimination so he told dad He never for an instant really believed you guilty Jimmie boy even after the discovery of the electric wires though he let those two detectives think he did And what about Singa Phut and Harry King Oh they were only incidents so Colonel Ashley says went on the happy girl as the automobile rolled along Even that funny Spotty was eliminated as our dear old fisherman calls it when he explained about the diamond cross And as for mister Grafton though he was mixed up in the jewel part of the mystery he was only acting to help Miss Ratchford as she wants to be called Poor girl she s had a hard time too I hope she finds as much happiness as As who asked Darcy as Amy hesitated As I have came the gentle answer as Amy gazed with shining eyes at the man beside her Langford Larch told everything in the brief time left him between his fatal leap and the passing of his soul to a higher judgment than that of the county courts Some time before the events leading to the separation a meeting between his wife and Grafton had been witnessed by one of Larch s hotel employees who told of it magnifying its importance Larch s jealous disposition was inflamed and there was a stormy scene between him and his wife He knocked her down and that was the end as far as she was concerned She told him she would leave him She admitted that she still cared for Grafton but denied any intimacy with him Then came the legal separation Before this however Larch had missed his wife s diamond cross and charged her with having disposed of it During their final interview she told the truth of how it had been stepped on and that Grafton had taken it to be repaired It was then that Larch saw his opportunity for getting possession of the valuable stones for his debts were pressing and though it was suspected by few he needed a large sum in cash One night partly intoxicated which was unusual for him and perhaps on this occasion done in desperation Larch called at the jewelry store missus Darcy happened to come downstairs as he arrived and knowing him well admitted him though the store had long been closed In one hand she held the Indian watch perhaps picked up idly from the repair table In the other hand was the diamond cross This ornament Larch instantly demanded but missus Darcy refused to give it up not only on account of his condition but because she did not consider that he had any claim to it knowing that it had been his wife s before their marriage Larch was insistent in his demands and tried to take the diamond cross from missus Darcy She resisted him in the dimly lighted and deserted store and he caught up the paper cutter dagger and threatened her She backed away from him toward the open safe intending it would seem to put the valuable ornament in there and lock it up when Larch struck at her As he did so he knocked down the heavy statue of the hunter It struck her on the head inflicting what would have proved a mortal blow even without the knife thrust As the statue fell Larch leaned forward to grasp it he said but he slipped and the knife in his hand entered her side and she fell on it driving it deeper in Larch declared he never meant to kill or even seriously hurt missus Darcy But he did kill her Seeing her lying as he then thought only perhaps seriously wounded Larch taking the diamond cross staggered around the jewelry shop and then fled panic stricken went to the Homestead and drank himself into a stupor Incidentally Larch s confession cleared up other matters and shifted certain responsibilities from various persons The Indian watch though impregnated with poison had nothing to do with the death of missus Darcy though she might have been slightly scratched by the hidden needle And the money Harry King went out and got the night of the murder was given him as he boasted at the time by a woman He refused to name her but she was named later when King s wife filed a petition for a divorce not her first by the way Well Colonel remarked mister Mason as together they strolled toward a trout stream several days after the clearing up of the diamond cross mystery I m glad to know you had the same faith in young Darcy that I had Oh yes there couldn t be any other way out Jimmie boy as your Amy calls him bless her heart was a bit careless but that was all Some of his wires that he rigged up for his electric lathe secretly did get tangled with the heavily charged conductors of the lighting system though he didn t know that It may be they were responsible for the shocks given I didn t go into that deeply And Darcy didn t repair Singa Phut s watch when he said he would It was in getting up early to do this and have the timepiece ready when promised that he discovered his relative s dead body Where did Harry King get that odd coin which made it look bad in his case for a while asked mister Mason Larch gave it to him unsuspectingly enough it seems When Larch went into missus Darcy s store she had the tray of rare coins out of the safe She may have been going to put them away with the Indian watch and the diamond cross but she had no chance And after Larch had killed her seeing the money he picked up a handful as he needed some change In a way the discovery of the odd coin helped in solving the mystery for I kept my helper Jack Young at the Homestead after that and it was hearing King and Larch talking about the diamond cross that gave me just the clew I wanted Larch had taken out the valuable diamonds from the ornament and had disposed of them in spite of what he said to his wife just before his death to get some much needed money He really did send her the crushed gold setting promising in the letter he dispatched to her by the boy I intercepted to restore the diamonds to her if she would meet him This she consented to do As it happened Aaron Grafton was calling on her at the time trying to find some means of helping her for there is the old time love between them And it was at her suggestion that he followed her when I was shadowing Larch Evidently Grafton didn t at that time know it was only the crushed and diamondless cross that Larch had sent back And after he died and confessed we found a paper of imitation diamonds in his pocket that Larch had ready to use in deceiving his wife if she had agreed to sign the papers he wanted her to so he could bolster up his failing business Well he s out of the way now and I hear the hotel has been sold Yes mister Mason And it will be so I hear once more the oldtime and respectable resort it once was As for Miss Ratchford she has gone to friends in California and there I understand mister Grafton will shortly follow They are to be married in about a year mister Grafton is going to sell out his business He told me he would not press the charge against Spotty for stealing the imitation diamond cross So Spotty will soon be at liberty again I m glad of that He s a sport in his own way Yes agreed the colonel One point puzzles me went on mister Mason and that is why Cynthia I call her that for I ve known her for years why she didn t make Larch support her after the separation She could have had a regular divorce and big alimony that is if he could have paid Maybe that s it he couldn t Anyhow she seems not to have wanted to accept any of his money after he had spoiled her life It was a foolish marriage though at the time it may have seemed advantageous to her or her mother After the murder or let us call it killing for Larch with his last breath protested he never meant it after that which Cynthia seems to have guessed she was even more strong in her determination not to take any of his money She was prepared too in case Jimmie had been found guilty to make a statement implicating her husband though under the law she could not be compelled to testify against him in a murder trial Well I m glad it s all over Colonel said mister Mason with a sigh of relief There are two happy ones if ever there were any and he motioned to Amy and Darcy walking slowly across the meadow in the golden glow of the setting sun Yes I m glad I had a hand in helping them The young people turning saw the two men and Amy waved her hand Slowly she and her lover approached What luck Colonel she asked gaily The very best You didn t exaggerate when you spoke of your trout stream I m glad you like it Jimmie and I were just talking about you I wondered why my ears burned and the old detective laughed Colonel Ashley put in Darcy there s just one thing I can t seem to clear up in all this business What s that Well what made all the clocks stop at different times I thought I knew something of the jewelry business but this puzzles me Just because it s so simple laughed the detective Larch stopped those of the clocks that didn t run down and stop themselves He figured out crazily enough in his fear and drunken frenzy that if no clocks or watches were going no one would know exactly what time the killing took place So after missus Darcy was dead he hurried about the store with no one in the wet and deserted street to watch him and stopping the timepieces moved the hands of many of them to suit his fancy But he forgot the ticking watch It was simple murmured Darcy No wonder I didn t think of it Have you so simple a theory regarding the queer state I was in that night I mean awakening and going to sleep again after feeling something brush my face Not unless Larch tried to chloroform you after he had killed missus Darcy and was afraid you might come down and discover what had happened answered the detective That will remain a mystery but its solution is not important Not as long as you have cleared Jimmie boy laughed Amy and yet there was a look of sadness on her face for it had been an ordeal for all of them Oh well he d have been cleared anyhow if the worst had come to the worst said the colonel However now that it s all over I can give proper attention to my fishing And I murmured James Darcy can But a soft hand over his lips prevented further utterance Lightly as a feather the colonel flicked a fly over the quiet pool where the waters swirled in a lazy eddy There was a splash in the sun a shrill song of the reel and a fish leaped high in the air trying to shake the barb from its mouth No you don t laughed the old detective I ve hooked you this time As you hooked Langford Larch murmured Jack Young who sat on the bank in the shade while the colonel fished and Shag was setting out lunch under the trees This is my last case exclaimed the detective as he slipped his prize into the grass lined creel Positively my last I never would have gone on with this even after I started except for the pleading of Miss Mason But I m through No more detective cases for me I ve retired Jack looked at the trim and upright figure and keen handsome face neither of which showed the old colonel s age Then the younger detective glanced at Shag winked an eye and murmured Through until the next time eh Shag Yo done said it exclaimed the colored man with a grin Now sah Colonel lunch am served END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE DIAMOND CROSS MYSTERY This file should be named sixteen thousand one hundred
