several autumn Saturdays there had been severe outbreaks of cavalry in the Schofield neighbourhood The sabres were of wood the steeds were imaginary and both were employed in a game called bonded pris ner by its inventors Masters Penrod Schofield and Samuel Williams The pastime was not intricate When two enemies met they fenced spectacularly until the person of one or the other was touched by the opposing weapon then when the ensuing claims of foul play had been disallowed and the subsequent argument settled the combatant touched was considered to be a prisoner until such time as he might be touched by the hilt of a sword belonging to one of his own party which effected his release and restored to him the full enjoyment of hostile activity Pending such rescue however he was obliged to accompany the forces of his captor whithersoever their strategical necessities led them which included many strange places For the game was exciting and at its highest pitch would sweep out of an alley into a stable out of that stable and into a yard out of that yard and into a house and through that house with the sound and effect upon furniture of trampling herds In fact this very similarity must have been in the mind of the distressed coloured woman in missus Williams s kitchen when she declared that she might jes as well try to cook right spang in the middle o the stock yards All up and down the neighbourhood the campaigns were waged accompanied by the martial clashing of wood upon wood and by many clamorous arguments You re a pris ner Roddy Bitts I am not You are too I touched you Where I d like to know On the sleeve You did not I never felt it I guess I d a felt it wouldn t I What if you didn t I touched you and you re bonded I leave it to Sam Williams Yah Course you would He s on your side I leave it to Herman No you won t If you can t show any SENSE about it we ll do it over and I guess you ll see whether you feel it or not There NOW I guess you Aw squash Strangely enough the undoubted champion proved to be the youngest and darkest of all the combatants one Verman coloured brother to Herman and substantially under the size to which his nine years entitled him Verman was unfortunately tongue tied but he was valiant beyond all others and in spite of every handicap he became at once the chief support of his own party and the despair of the opposition On the third Saturday this opposition had been worn down by the successive captures of Maurice Levy and Georgie Bassett until it consisted of only Sam Williams and Penrod Hence it behooved these two to be wary lest they be wiped out altogether and Sam was dismayed indeed upon cautiously scouting round a corner of his own stable to find himself face to face with the valorous and skilful Verman who was acting as an outpost or picket of the enemy Verman immediately fell upon Sam horse and foot and Sam would have fled but dared not for fear he might be touched from the rear Therefore he defended himself as best he could and there followed a lusty whacking in the course of which Verman s hat a relic and too large fell from his head touching Sam s weapon in falling There panted Sam desisting immediately That counts You re bonded Verman Aim meewer Verman protested Interpreting this as Ain t neither Sam invented a law to suit the occasion Yes you are that s the rule Verman I touched your hat with my sword and your hat s just the same as you Imm mop Verman insisted Yes it is said Sam already warmly convinced by his own statement that he was in the right Listen here If I hit you on the shoe it would be the same as hitting YOU wouldn t it I guess it d count if I hit you on the shoe wouldn t it Well a hat s just the same as shoes Honest that s the rule Verman and you re a pris ner Now in the arguing part of the game Verman s impediment cooperated with a native amiability to render him far less effective than in the actual combat He chuckled and ceded the point Aw wi he said and cheerfully followed his captor to a hidden place among some bushes in the front yard where Penrod lurked Looky what I got Sam said importantly pushing his captive into this retreat NOW I guess you won t say I m not so much use any more Squat down Verman so s they can t see you if they re huntin for us That s one o the rules honest You got to squat when we tell you to Verman was agreeable He squatted and then began to laugh uproariously Stop that noise Penrod commanded You want to betray us What you laughin at Ep mack im mimmup Verman giggled What s he mean Sam asked Penrod was more familiar with Verman s utterance and he interpreted He says they ll get him back in a minute No they won t I d just like to see Yes they will too Penrod said They ll get him back for the main and simple reason we can t stay here all day can we And they d find us anyhow if we tried to There s so many of em against just us two they can run in and touch him soon as they get up to us and then HE LL be after us again and Listen here Sam interrupted Why can t we put some REAL bonds on him We could put bonds on his wrists and around his legs we could put em all over him easy as nothin Then we could gag him No we can t said Penrod We can t for the main and simple reason we haven t got any rope or anything to make the bonds with have we I wish we had some o that stuff they give sick people THEN I bet they wouldn t get him back so soon Sick people Sam repeated not comprehending It makes em go to sleep no matter what you do to em Penrod explained That s the main and simple reason they can t wake up and you can cut off their ole legs or their arms or anything you want to Hoy exclaimed Verman in a serious tone His laughter ceased instantly and he began to utter a protest sufficiently intelligible You needn t worry Penrod said gloomily We haven t got any o that stuff so we can t do it Well we got to do sumpthing Sam said His comrade agreed and there was a thoughtful silence but presently Penrod s countenance brightened I know he exclaimed I know what we ll do with him Why I thought of it just as EASY I can most always think of things like that for the main and simple reason well I thought of it just as soon Well what is it Sam demanded crossly Penrod s reiteration of his new found phrase for the main and simple reason had been growing more and more irksome to his friend all day though Sam was not definitely aware that the phrase was the cause of his annoyance WHAT are we goin to do with him you know so much Penrod rose and peered over the tops of the bushes shading his eyes with his hand a gesture that was unnecessary but had a good appearance He looked all round about him in this manner finally vouchsafing a report to the impatient Sam No enemies in sight just for the main and simple reason I expect they re all in the alley and in Georgie Bassett s backyard I bet they re not Sam said scornfully his irritation much increased How do YOU know so much about it Just for the main and simple reason Penrod replied with dignified finality And at that Sam felt a powerful impulse to do violence upon the person of his comrade in arms The emotion that prompted this impulse was so primitive and straightforward that it almost resulted in action but Sam had a vague sense that he must control it as long as he could Bugs he said Penrod was sensitive and this cold word hurt him However he was under the domination of his strategic idea and he subordinated private grievance to the common weal Get up he commanded You get up too Verman You got to it s the rule Now here I ll SHOW you what we re goin to do Stoop over and both o you do just exackly like I do You watch ME because this biz nuss has got to be done RIGHT Sam muttered something he was becoming more insurgent every moment but he obeyed Likewise Verman rose to his feet ducked his head between his shoulders and trotted out to the sidewalk at Sam s heels both following Penrod and assuming a stooping position in imitation of him Verman was delighted with this phase of the game and also he was profoundly amused by Penrod s pomposity Something dim and deep within him perceived it to be cause for such merriment that he had ado to master himself and was forced to bottle and cork his laughter with both hands They proved insufficient sputterings burst forth between his fingers You stop that Penrod said looking back darkly upon the prisoner Verman endeavoured to oblige though giggles continued to leak from him at intervals and the three boys stole along the fence in single file proceeding in this fashion until they reached Penrod s own front gate Here the leader ascertained by a reconnaissance as far as the corner that the hostile forces were still looking for them in another direction He returned in a stealthy but important manner to his disgruntled follower and the hilarious captive Well said Sam impatiently I guess I m not goin to stand around here all day I guess You got anything you want to do why n t you go on and DO it Penrod s brow was already contorted to present the appearance of detached and lofty concentration a histrionic failure since it did not deceive the audience He raised a hushing hand SH he murmured I got to think Bugs the impolite mister Williams said again Verman bent double squealing and sputtering indeed he was ultimately forced to sit upon the ground so exhausting was the mirth to which he now gave way Penrod s composure was somewhat affected and he showed annoyance Oh I guess you won t laugh quite so much about minute from now ole Mister Verman he said severely You get up from there and do like I tell you Well why n t you TELL him why he won t laugh so much then Sam demanded as Verman rose Why n t you do sumpthing and quit talkin so much about it Penrod haughtily led the way into the yard You follow me he said and I guess you ll learn a little sense Then abandoning his hauteur for an air of mystery equally irritating to Sam he stole up the steps of the porch and after a moment s manipulation of the knob of the big front door contrived to operate the fastenings and pushed the door open Come on he whispered beckoning And the three boys mounted the stairs to the floor above in silence save for a belated giggle on the part of Verman which was restrained upon a terrible gesture from Penrod Verman buried his mouth as deeply as possible in a ragged sleeve and confined his demonstrations to a heaving of the stomach and diaphragm Penrod led the way into the dainty room of his nineteen year old sister Margaret and closed the door There he said in a low and husky voice I expect you ll see what I m goin to do now Well what the skeptical Sam asked If we stay here very long your mother ll come and send us downstairs What s the good of WAIT can t you Penrod wailed in a whisper My goodness And going to an inner door he threw it open disclosing a clothes closet hung with pretty garments of many kinds while upon its floor were two rows of shoes and slippers of great variety and charm A significant thing is to be remarked concerning the door of this somewhat intimate treasury there was no knob or latch upon the inner side so that when the door was closed it could be opened only from the outside There said Penrod You get in there Verman and I ll bet they won t get to touch you back out o bein our pris ner very soon NOW Oh I guess not Pshaw said Sam Is that all you were goin to do Why your mother ll come and make him get out the first No she won t She and Margaret have gone to my aunt s in the country and aren t goin to be back till dark And even if he made a lot o noise it s kind of hard to hear anything from in there anyway when the door s shut Besides he s got to keep quiet that s the rule Verman You re a pris ner and it s the rule you can t holler or nothin You unnerstand that Verman Aw wi said Verman Then go on in there Hurry The obedient Verman marched into the closet and sat down among the shoes and slippers where he presented an interesting effect of contrast He was still subject to hilarity though endeavouring to suppress it by means of a patent leather slipper when Penrod closed the door There said Penrod leading the way from the room I guess NOW you see Sam said nothing and they came out to the open air and reached their retreat in the Williams yard again without his having acknowledged Penrod s service to their mutual cause I thought of that just as easy Penrod remarked probably prompted to this odious bit of complacency by Sam s withholding the praise that might naturally have been expected And he was moved to add I guess it d of been a pretty long while if we d had to wait for you to think of something as good as that Sam Why would it Sam asked Why would it of been such a long while Oh Penrod responded airily just for the main and simple reason Sam could bear it no longer Oh hush up he shouted Penrod was stung Do you mean ME he demanded Yes I do the goaded Sam replied Did you tell ME to hush up Yes I did I guess you don t know who you re talkin to Penrod said ominously I guess I just better show you who you re talkin to like that I guess you need a little sumpthing for the main and simple Sam uttered an uncontrollable howl and sprang upon Penrod catching him round the waist Simultaneously with this impact the wooden swords spun through the air and were presently trodden underfoot as the two boys wrestled to and fro Penrod was not altogether surprised by the onset of his friend He had been aware of Sam s increasing irritation though neither boy could have clearly stated its cause and that very irritation produced a corresponding emotion in the bosom of the irritator Mentally Penrod was quite ready for the conflict nay he welcomed it though for the first few moments Sam had the physical advantage However it is proper that a neat distinction be drawn here This was a conflict but neither technically nor in the intention of the contestants was it a fight Penrod and Sam were both in a state of high exasperation and there was great bitterness but no blows fell and no tears They strained they wrenched they twisted and they panted and muttered Oh no you don t Oh I guess I do Oh you will will you You ll see what you get in about a minute I guess you ll learn some sense this time Streaks and blotches began to appear upon the two faces where colour had been heightened by the ardent application of a cloth sleeve or shoulder while ankles and insteps were scraped and toes were trampled Turf and shrubberies suffered also as the struggle went on until finally the wrestlers pitched headlong into a young lilac bush and came to earth together among its crushed and sprawling branches OOCH and WUF were the two exclamations which marked this episode and then with no further comment the struggle was energetically continued upon a horizontal plane Now Penrod was on top now Sam they rolled they squirmed they suffered And this contest endured It went on and on and it was impossible to imagine its coming to a definite termination It went on so long that to both the participants it seemed to be a permanent thing a condition that had always existed and that must always exist perpetually And thus they were discovered by a foray of the hostile party headed by Roddy Bitts and Herman older brother to Verman and followed by the bonded prisoners Maurice Levy and Georgie Bassett These and others caught sight of the writhing figures and charged down upon them with loud cries of triumph Pris ner Pris ner Bonded pris ner shrieked Roddy Bitts and touched Penrod and Sam each in turn with his sabre Then seeing that they paid no attention and that they were at his mercy he recalled the fact that several times during earlier stages of the game both of them had been unnecessarily vigorous in touching his own rather plump person Therefore the opportunity being excellent he raised his weapon again and repeating the words bonded pris ner as ample explanation of his deed brought into play the full strength of his good right arm He used the flat of the sabre WHACK WHACK Roddy was perfectly impartial It was a cold blooded performance and even more effective than he anticipated For one thing it ended the civil war instantly Sam and Penrod leaped to their feet shrieking and bloodthirsty while Maurice Levy capered with joy Herman was so overcome that he rolled upon the ground and Georgie Bassett remarked virtuously It serves them right for fighting But Roddy Bitts foresaw that something not within the rules of the game was about to happen Here You keep away from me he quavered retreating I was just takin you pris ners I guess I had a right to TOUCH you didn t I Alas Neither Sam nor Penrod was able to see the matter in that light They had retrieved their own weapons and they advanced upon Roddy with a purposefulness that seemed horrible to him Here You keep away from me he said in great alarm I m goin home He did go home but only subsequently What took place before his departure had the singular solidity and completeness of systematic violence also it bore the moral beauty of all actions that lead to peace and friendship for when it was over and the final vocalizations of Roderick Magsworth Bitts Junior were growing faint with increasing distance Sam and Penrod had forgotten their differences and felt well disposed toward each other once more All their animosity was exhausted and they were in a glow of good feeling though probably they were not conscious of any direct gratitude to Roddy whose thoughtful opportunism was really the cause of this happy result CHAPTER II THE BONDED PRISONER After such rigorous events every one comprehended that the game of bonded prisoner was over and there was no suggestion that it should or might be resumed The fashion of its conclusion had been so consummately enjoyed by all parties with the natural exception of Roddy Bitts that a renewal would have been tame hence the various minds of the company turned to other matters and became restless Georgie Bassett withdrew first remembering that if he expected to be as wonderful as usual to morrow in Sunday school it was time to prepare himself though this was not included in the statement he made alleging the cause of his departure Being detained bodily and pressed for explanation he desperately said that he had to go home to tease the cook which had the rakehelly air he thought would insure his release but was not considered plausible However he was finally allowed to go and as first hints of evening were already cooling and darkening the air the party broke up its members setting forth whistling toward their several homes though Penrod lingered with Sam Herman was the last to go from them Well I got git at stove wood f suppuh he said rising and stretching himself I got git at lil soap box wagon an go on ovuh wheres at new house buil in on Secon Street pick up few shingles an blocks layin roun He went through the yard toward the alley and at the alley gate remembering something he paused and called to them The lot was a deep one and they were too far away to catch his meaning Sam shouted Can t HEAR you and Herman replied but still unintelligibly then upon Sam s repetition of Can t HEAR you Herman waved his arm in farewell implying that the matter was of little significance and vanished But if they had understood him Penrod and Sam might have considered his inquiry of instant importance for Herman s last shout was to ask if either of them had noticed where Verman went Verman and Verman s whereabouts were at this hour of no more concern to Sam and Penrod than was the other side of the moon That unfortunate bonded prisoner had been long since utterly effaced from their fields of consciousness and the dark secret of their Bastille troubled them not for the main and simple reason that they had forgotten it They drifted indoors and found Sam s mother s white cat drowsing on a desk in the library the which coincidence obviously inspired the experiment of ascertaining how successfully ink could be used in making a clean white cat look like a coach dog There was neither malice nor mischief in their idea simply a problem presented itself to the biological and artistic questionings beginning to stir within them They did not mean to do the cat the slightest injury or to cause her any pain They were above teasing cats and they merely detained this one and made her feel a little wet at considerable cost to themselves from both the ink and the cat However at the conclusion of their efforts it was thought safer to drop the cat out of the window before anybody came and after some hasty work with blotters the desk was moved to cover certain sections of the rug and the two boys repaired to the bathroom for hot water and soap They knew they had done nothing wrong but they felt easier when the only traces remaining upon them were the less prominent ones upon their garments These precautions taken it was time for them to make their appearance at Penrod s house for dinner for it had been arranged upon petition earlier in the day that Sam should be his friend s guest for the evening meal Clean to the elbows and with light hearts they set forth They marched whistling though not producing a distinctly musical effect since neither had any particular air in mind and they found nothing wrong with the world they had not a care Arrived at their adjacent destination they found Miss Margaret Schofield just entering the front door Hurry boys she said Mamma came home long before I did and I m sure dinner is waiting Run on out to the dining room and tell them I ll be right down And as they obeyed she mounted the stairs humming a little tune and unfastening the clasp of the long light blue military cape she wore She went to her own quiet room lit the gas removed her hat and placed it and the cape upon the bed after which she gave her hair a push subsequent to her scrutiny of a mirror then turning out the light she went as far as the door Being an orderly girl she returned to the bed and took the cape and the hat to her clothes closet She opened the door of this sanctuary and in the dark hung her cape upon a hook and placed her hat upon the shelf Then she closed the door again having noted nothing unusual though she had an impression that the place needed airing She descended to the dinner table The other members of the family were already occupied with the meal and the visitor was replying politely in his non masticatory intervals to inquiries concerning the health of his relatives So sweet and assured was the condition of Sam and Penrod that Margaret s arrival from her room meant nothing to them Their memories were not stirred and they continued eating their expressions brightly placid But from out of doors there came the sound of a calling and questing voice at first in the distance then growing louder coming nearer Oh Ver er man O o o oh Ver er ma a an It was the voice of Herman OO O O O OH VER ER ER MA A A AN And then two boys sat stricken at that cheerful table and ceased to eat Recollection awoke with a bang Oh my Sam gasped What s the matter mister Schofield said Swallow something the wrong way Sam Ye es sir OO O O O OH VER ER ER MA A A AN And now the voice was near the windows of the dining room Penrod very pale pushed back his chair and jumped up What s the matter with YOU his father demanded Sit down It s Herman that coloured boy lives in the alley Penrod said hoarsely I expect I think Well what s the matter I think his little brother s maybe got lost and Sam and I better go help look You ll do nothing of the kind mister Schofield said sharply Sit down and eat your dinner In a palsy the miserable boy resumed his seat He and Sam exchanged a single dumb glance then the eyes of both swung fearfully to Margaret Her appearance was one of sprightly content and from a certain point of view nothing could have been more alarming If she had opened her closet door without discovering Verman that must have been because Verman was dead and Margaret had failed to notice the body Such were the thoughts of Penrod and Sam But she might not have opened the closet door And whether she had or not Verman must still be there alive or dead for if he had escaped he would have gone home and their ears would not be ringing with the sinister and melancholy cry that now came from the distance Oo o oh Ver er ma an Verman in his seclusion did not hear that appeal from his brother there were too many walls between them But he was becoming impatient for release though all in all he had not found the confinement intolerable or even very irksome His character was philosophic his imagination calm no bugaboos came to trouble him When the boys closed the door upon him he made himself comfortable upon the floor and for a time thoughtfully chewed a patent leather slipper that had come under his hand He found the patent leather not unpleasant to his palate though he swallowed only a portion of what he detached not being hungry at that time The soul fabric of Verman was of a fortunate weave he was not a seeker and questioner When it happened to him that he was at rest in a shady corner he did not even think about a place in the sun Verman took life as it came Naturally he fell asleep And toward the conclusion of his slumbers he had this singular adventure a lady set her foot down within less than half an inch of his nose and neither of them knew it Verman slept on without being wakened by either the closing or the opening of the door What did rouse him was something ample and soft falling upon him Margaret s cape which slid from the hook after she had gone Enveloped in its folds Verman sat up corkscrewing his knuckles into the corners of his eyes Slowly he became aware of two important vacuums one in time and one in his stomach Hours had vanished strangely into nowhere the game of bonded prisoner was something cloudy and remote of the long long ago and although Verman knew where he was he had partially forgotten how he came there He perceived however that something had gone wrong for he was certain that he ought not to be where he found himself WHITE FOLKS HOUSE The fact that Verman could not have pronounced these words rendered them no less clear in his mind they began to stir his apprehension and nothing becomes more rapidly tumultuous than apprehension once it is stirred That he might possibly obtain release by making a noise was too daring a thought and not even conceived much less entertained by the little and humble Verman For with the bewildering gap of his slumber between him and previous events he did not place the responsibility for his being in White Folks House upon the white folks who had put him there His state of mind was that of the stable puppy who knows he MUST not be found in the parlour Not thrice in his life had Verman been within the doors of White Folks House and above all things he felt that it was in some undefined way vital to him to get out of White Folks House unobserved and unknown It was in his very blood to be sure of that Further than this point the processes of Verman s mind become mysterious to the observer It appears however that he had a definite though somewhat primitive conception of the usefulness of disguise and he must have begun his preparations before he heard footsteps in the room outside his closed door These footsteps were Margaret s Just as mister Schofield s coffee was brought and just after Penrod had been baffled in another attempt to leave the table Margaret rose and patted her father impertinently upon the head You can t bully ME that way she said I got home too late to dress and I m going to a dance Scuse And she began her dancing on the spot pirouetting herself swiftly out of the room and was immediately heard running up the stairs Penrod mister Schofield shouted Sit down How many times am I going to tell you What IS the matter with you to night I GOT to go Penrod gasped I got to tell Margaret sumpthing What have you got to tell her It s it s sumpthing I forgot to tell her Well it will keep till she comes downstairs mister Schofield said grimly You sit down till this meal is finished Penrod was becoming frantic I got to tell her it s sumpthing Sam s mother told me to tell her he babbled Didn t she Sam You heard her tell me to tell her didn t you Sam Sam offered prompt corroboration Yes sir she did She said for us both to tell her I better go too I guess because she said He was interrupted Startlingly upon their ears rang shriek on shriek missus Schofield recognizing Margaret s voice likewise shrieked and mister Schofield uttered various sounds but Penrod and Sam were incapable of doing anything vocally All rushed from the table Margaret continued to shriek and it is not to be denied that there was some cause for her agitation When she opened the closet door her light blue military cape instead of hanging on the hook where she had left it came out into the room in a manner that she afterward described as a kind of horrible creep but faster than a creep Nothing was to be seen except the creeping cape she said but of course she could tell there was some awful thing inside of it It was too large to be a cat and too small to be a boy it was too large to be Duke Penrod s little old dog and besides Duke wouldn t act like that It crept rapidly out into the upper hall and then as she recovered the use of her voice and began to scream the animated cape abandoned its creeping for a quicker gait a weird heaving flop she defined it The Thing then decided upon a third style of locomotion evidently for when Sam and Penrod reached the front hall a few steps in advance of mister and missus Schofield it was rolling grandly down the stairs mister Schofield had only a hurried glimpse of it as it reached the bottom close by the front door Grab that thing he shouted dashing forward Stop it Hit it It was at this moment that Sam Williams displayed the presence of mind that was his most eminent characteristic Sam s wonderful instinct for the right action almost never failed him in a crisis and it did not fail him now Leaping to the door at the very instant when the rolling cape touched it Sam flung the door open and the cape rolled on With incredible rapidity and intelligence it rolled indeed out into the night Penrod jumped after it and the next second reappeared in the doorway holding the cape He shook out its folds breathing hard but acquiring confidence In fact he was able to look up in his father s face and say with bright ingenuousness It was just laying there Do you know what I think Well it couldn t have acted that way itself I think there must have been sumpthing kind of inside of it mister Schofield shook his head slowly in marvelling admiration Brilliant oh brilliant he murmured while missus Schofield ran to support the enfeebled form of Margaret at the top of the stairs In the library after Margaret s departure to her dance mister and missus Schofield were still discussing the visitation Penrod having accompanied his homeward bound guest as far as the front gate No you re wrong missus Schofield said upholding a theory earlier developed by Margaret that the animated behaviour of the cape could be satisfactorily explained on no other ground than the supernatural You see the boys saying they couldn t remember what missus Williams wanted them to tell Margaret and that probably she hadn t told them anything to tell her because most likely they d misunderstood something she said well of course all that does sound mixed up and peculiar but they sound that way about half the time anyhow No it couldn t possibly have had a thing to do with it They were right there at the table with us all the time and they came straight to the table the minute they entered the house Before that they d been over at Sam s all afternoon So it COULDN T have been the boys missus Schofield paused to ruminate with a little air of pride then added Margaret has often thought oh long before this that she was a medium I mean if she would let her self So it wasn t anything the boys did mister Schofield grunted I ll admit this much he said I ll admit it wasn t anything we ll ever get out of em And the remarks of Sam and Penrod taking leave of each other one on each side of the gate appeared to corroborate mister Schofield s opinion Well g night Penrod Sam said It was a pretty good Saturday wasn t it Fine said Penrod casually G night Sam CHAPTER III THE MILITARIST PENROD SCHOFIELD having been kept in for the unjust period of twenty minutes after school emerged to a deserted street That is the street was deserted so far as Penrod was concerned Here and there people were to be seen upon the sidewalks but they were adults and they and the shade trees had about the same quality of significance in Penrod s consciousness Usually he saw grown people in the mass which is to say they were virtually invisible to him though exceptions must be taken in favour of policemen firemen street car conductors motormen and all other men in any sort of uniform or regalia But this afternoon none of these met the roving eye and Penrod set out upon his homeward way wholly dependent upon his own resources To one of Penrod s inner texture a mere unadorned walk from one point to another was intolerable and he had not gone a block without achieving some slight remedy for the tameness of life An electric light pole at the corner invested with powers of observation might have been surprised to find itself suddenly enacting a role of dubious honour in improvised melodrama Penrod approaching gave the pole a look of sharp suspicion then one of conviction slapped it lightly and contemptuously with his open hand passed on a few paces but turned abruptly and pointing his right forefinger uttered the symbolic word Bing The plot was somewhat indefinite yet nothing is more certain than that the electric light pole had first attempted something against him then growing bitter when slapped and stealing after him to take him treacherously in the back had got itself shot through and through by one too old in such warfare to be caught off his guard Leaving the body to lie where it was he placed the smoking pistol in a holster at his saddlebow he had decided that he was mounted and proceeded up the street At intervals he indulged himself in other encounters reining in at first suspicion of ambush with a muttered Whoa Charlie or Whoa Mike or even Whoa Washington for preoccupation with the enemy outweighed attention to the details of theatrical consistency though the steed s varying names were at least harmoniously masculine since a boy in these creative moments never rides a mare And having brought Charlie or Mike or Washington to a standstill Penrod would draw the sure weapon from its holster and Bing Bing Bing let them have it It is not to be understood that this was a noisy performance or even an obvious one It attracted no attention from any pedestrian and it was to be perceived only that a boy was proceeding up the street at a somewhat irregular gait Three or four years earlier when Penrod was seven or eight he would have shouted Bing at the top of his voice he would have galloped openly all the world might have seen that he bestrode a charger But a change had come upon him with advancing years Although the grown people in sight were indeed to him as walking trees his dramas were accomplished principally by suggestion and symbol His Whoas and Bings were delivered in a husky whisper and his equestrianism was established by action mostly of the mind the accompanying artistry of the feet being unintelligible to the passerby And yet though he concealed from observation the stirring little scenes he thus enacted a love of realism was increasing within him Early childhood is not fastidious about the accessories of its drama a cane is vividly a gun which may instantly as vividly become a horse but at Penrod s time of life the lath sword is no longer satisfactory Indeed he now had a vague sense that weapons of wood were unworthy to the point of being contemptible and ridiculous and he employed them only when he was alone and unseen For months a yearning had grown more and more poignant in his vitals and this yearning was symbolized by one of his most profound secrets In the inner pocket of his jacket he carried a bit of wood whittled into the distant likeness of a pistol but not even Sam Williams had seen it The wooden pistol never knew the light of day save when Penrod was in solitude and yet it never left his side except at night when it was placed under his pillow Still it did not satisfy it was but the token of his yearning and his dream With all his might and main Penrod longed for one thing beyond all others He wanted a Real Pistol That was natural Pictures of real pistols being used to magnificently romantic effect were upon almost all the billboards in town the year round and as for the movie shows they could not have lived an hour unpistoled In the drug store where Penrod bought his candy and soda when he was in funds he would linger to turn the pages of periodicals whose illustrations were fascinatingly pistolic Some of the magazines upon the very library table at home were sprinkled with pictures of people usually in evening clothes pointing pistols at other people Nay the Library Board of the town had emitted a Selected List of Fifteen Books for Boys and Penrod had read fourteen of them with pleasure but as the fifteenth contained no weapons in the earlier chapters and held forth little prospect of any shooting at all he abandoned it halfway and read the most sanguinary of the other fourteen over again So the daily food of his imagination being gun what wonder that he thirsted for the Real He passed from the sidewalk into his own yard with a subdued Bing inflicted upon the stolid person of a gatepost and entering the house through the kitchen ceased to bing for a time However driven back from the fore part of the house by a dismal sound of callers he returned to the kitchen and sat down Della he said to the cook do you know what I d do if you was a crook and I had my ottomatic with me Della was industrious and preoccupied If I was a cook she repeated ignorantly and with no cordiality Well I AM a cook I m a cookin right now Either g wan in the house where y b long or git out in th yard Penrod chose the latter and betook himself slowly to the back fence where he was greeted in a boisterous manner by his wistful little old dog Duke returning from some affair of his own in the alley Get down said Penrod coldly and bestowed a spiritless Bing upon him At this moment a shout was heard from the alley Yay Penrod and the sandy head of comrade Sam Williams appeared above the fence Come on over said Penrod As Sam obediently climbed the fence the little old dog Duke moved slowly away but presently glancing back over his shoulder and seeing the two boys standing together he broke into a trot and disappeared round a corner of the house He was a dog of long and enlightening experience and he made it clear that the conjunction of Penrod and Sam portended events which from his point of view might be unfortunate Duke had a forgiving disposition but he also possessed a melancholy wisdom In the company of either Penrod or Sam alone affection often caused him to linger albeit with a little pessimism but when he saw them together he invariably withdrew in as unobtrusive a manner as haste would allow What you doin Sam asked Nothin What you I ll show you if you ll come over to our house said Sam who was wearing an important and secretive expression What for Penrod showed little interest Well I said I d show you if you came on over didn t I But you haven t got anything I haven t got said Penrod indifferently I know everything that s in your yard and in your stable and there isn t a thing I didn t say it was in the yard or in the stable did I Well there ain t anything in your house returned Penrod frankly that I d walk two feet to look at not a thing Oh no Sam assumed mockery Oh no you wouldn t You know what it is don t you Yes you do Penrod s curiosity stirred somewhat Well all right he said I got nothin to do I just as soon go What is it You wait and see said Sam as they climbed the fence I bet YOUR ole eyes ll open pretty far in about a minute or so I bet they don t It takes a good deal to get me excited unless it s sumpthing mighty You ll see Sam promised He opened an alley gate and stepped into his own yard in a manner signalling caution though the exploit thus far certainly required none and Penrod began to be impressed and hopeful They entered the house silently encountering no one and Sam led the way upstairs tiptoeing implying unusual and increasing peril Turning in the upper hall they went into Sam s father s bedroom and Sam closed the door with a caution so genuine that already Penrod s eyes began to fulfil his host s prediction Adventures in another boy s house are trying to the nerves and another boy s father s bedroom when invaded has a violated sanctity that is almost appalling Penrod felt that something was about to happen something much more important than he had anticipated Sam tiptoed across the room to a chest of drawers and kneeling carefully pulled out the lowest drawer until the surface of its contents mister Williams winter underwear lay exposed Then he fumbled beneath the garments and drew forth a large object displaying it triumphantly to the satisfactorily dumfounded Penrod It was a blue steel Colt s revolver of the heaviest pattern made in the Seventies mister Williams had inherited it from Sam s grandfather a small man a deacon and dyspeptic and it was larger and more horrible than any revolver either of the boys had ever seen in any picture moving or stationary Moreover greenish bullets of great size were to be seen in the chambers of the cylinder suggesting massacre rather than mere murder This revolver was Real and it was Loaded CHAPTER IV BINGISM Both boys lived breathlessly through a magnificent moment Leave me have it gasped Penrod Leave me have hold of it You wait a minute Sam protested in a whisper I want to show you how I do No you let me show you how I do Penrod insisted and they scuffled for possession Look out Sam whispered warningly It might go off Then you better leave me have it And Penrod victorious and flushed stepped back the weapon in his grasp Here he said this is the way I do You be a crook and suppose you got a dagger and I I don t want any dagger Sam protested advancing I want that revolaver It s my father s revolaver ain t it Well WAIT a minute can t you I got a right to show you the way I DO first haven t I Penrod began an improvisation on the spot Say I m comin along after dark like this look Sam And say you try to make a jump at me I won t Sam declined this role impatiently I guess it ain t YOUR father s revolaver is it Well it may be your father s but it ain t yours Penrod argued becoming logical It ain t either r of us revolaver so I got as much right You haven t either It s my fath WATCH can t you just a minute Penrod urged vehemently I m not goin to keep it am I You can have it when I get through can t you Here s how I do I m comin along after dark just walkin along this way like this look Sam Penrod suiting the action to the word walked to the other end of the room swinging the revolver at his side with affected carelessness I m just walkin along like this and first I don t see you continued the actor Then I kind of get a notion sumpthing wrong s liable to happen so I No He interrupted himself abruptly No that isn t it You wouldn t notice that I had my good ole revolaver with me You wouldn t think I had one because it d be under my coat like this and you wouldn t see it Penrod stuck the muzzle of the pistol into the waistband of his knickerbockers at the left side and buttoning his jacket sustained the weapon in concealment by pressure of his elbow So you think I haven t got any you think I m just a man comin along and so you Sam advanced Well you ve had your turn he said Now it s mine I m goin to show you how I WATCH me can t you Penrod wailed I haven t showed you how I do have I My goodness Can t you watch me a minute I HAVE been You said yourself it d be my turn soon as you My goodness Let me have a CHANCE can t you Penrod retreated to the wall turning his right side toward Sam and keeping the revolver still protected under his coat I got to have my turn first haven t I Well yours is over long ago It isn t either I Anyway said Sam decidedly clutching him by the right shoulder and endeavouring to reach his left side anyway I m goin to have it now You said I could have my turn out Penrod carried away by indignation raised his voice I did not Sam likewise lost to caution asserted his denial loudly You did too You said I never said anything You said Quit that Boys missus Williams Sam s mother opened the door of the room and stood upon the threshold The scuffling of Sam and Penrod ceased instantly and they stood hushed and stricken while fear fell upon them Boys you weren t quarrelling were you Ma am said Sam Were you quarrelling with Penrod No ma am answered Sam in a small voice It sounded like it What was the matter Both boys returned her curious glance with meekness They were summoning their faculties which were needed Indeed these are the crises which prepare a boy for the business difficulties of his later life Penrod with the huge weapon beneath his jacket insecurely supported by an elbow and by a waistband which he instantly began to distrust experienced distressful sensations similar to those of the owner of too heavily insured property carrying a gasoline can under his overcoat and detained for conversation by a policeman And if in the coming years it was to be Penrod s lot to find himself in that precise situation no doubt he would be the better prepared for it on account of this present afternoon s experience under the scalding eye of missus Williams It should be added that missus Williams s eye was awful to the imagination only It was a gentle eye and but mildly curious having no remote suspicion of the dreadful truth for Sam had backed upon the chest of drawers and closed the damnatory open one with the calves of his legs Sam not bearing the fatal evidence upon his person was in a better state than Penrod though when boys fall into the stillness now assumed by these two it should be understood that they are suffering Penrod in fact was the prey to apprehension so keen that the actual pit of his stomach was cold Being the actual custodian of the crime he understood that his case was several degrees more serious than that of Sam who in the event of detection would be convicted as only an accessory It was a lesson and Penrod already repented his selfishness in not allowing Sam to show how he did first You re sure you weren t quarrelling Sam said missus Williams No ma am we were just talking Still she seemed dimly uneasy and her eye swung to Penrod What were you and Sam talking about Penrod Ma am What were you talking about Penrod gulped invisibly Well he murmured it wasn t much Different things What things Oh just sumpthing Different things I m glad you weren t quarrelling said missus Williams reassured by this reply which though somewhat baffling was thoroughly familiar to her ear Now if you ll come downstairs I ll give you each one cookie and no more so your appetites won t be spoiled for your dinners She stood evidently expecting them to precede her To linger might renew vague suspicion causing it to become more definite and boys preserve themselves from moment to moment not often attempting to secure the future Consequently the apprehensive Sam and the unfortunate Penrod with the monstrous implement bulking against his ribs walked out of the room and down the stairs their countenances indicating an interior condition of solemnity And a curious shade of behaviour might have here interested a criminologist Penrod endeavoured to keep as close to Sam as possible like a lonely person seeking company while on the other hand Sam kept moving away from Penrod seeming to desire an appearance of aloofness Go into the library boys said missus Williams as the three reached the foot of the stairs I ll bring you your cookies Papa s in there Under her eye the two entered the library to find mister Williams reading his evening paper He looked up pleasantly but it seemed to Penrod that he had an ominous and penetrating expression What have you been up to you boys inquired this enemy Nothing said Sam Different things What like Oh just different things mister Williams nodded then his glance rested casually upon Penrod What s the matter with your arm Penrod Penrod became paler and Sam withdrew from him almost conspicuously Sir I said What s the matter with your arm Which one Penrod quavered Your left You seem to be holding it at an unnatural position Have you hurt it Penrod swallowed Yes sir A boy bit me I mean a dog a dog bit me mister Williams murmured sympathetically That s too bad Where did he bite you On the right on the elbow Good gracious Perhaps you ought to have it cauterized Sir Did you have a doctor look at it No sir My mother put some stuff from the drug store on it Oh I see Probably it s all right then Yes sir Penrod drew breath more freely and accepted the warm cookie missus Williams brought him He ate it without relish You can have only one apiece she said It s too near dinner time You needn t beg for any more because you can t have em They were good about that they were in no frame of digestion for cookies Was it your own dog that bit you mister Williams inquired Sir No sir It wasn t Duke Penrod missus Williams exclaimed When did it happen I don t remember just when he answered feebly I guess it was day before yesterday Gracious How did it He he just came up and bit me Why that s terrible It might be dangerous for other children said missus Williams with a solicitous glance at Sam Don t you know whom he belongs to No m It was just a dog You poor boy Your mother must have been dreadfully frightened when you came home and she saw She was interrupted by the entrance of a middle aged coloured woman Miz Williams she began and then as she caught sight of Penrod she addressed him directly You ma telefoam if you here send you home right away cause they waitin dinner on you Run along then said missus Williams patting the visitor lightly upon his shoulder and she accompanied him to the front door Tell your mother I m so sorry about your getting bitten and you must take good care of it Penrod Yes m Penrod lingered helplessly outside the doorway looking at Sam who stood partially obscured in the hall behind missus Williams Penrod s eyes with veiled anguish conveyed a pleading for help as well as a horror of the position in which he found himself Sam however pale and determined seemed to have assumed a stony attitude of detachment as if it were well understood between them that his own comparative innocence was established and that whatever catastrophe ensued Penrod had brought it on and must bear the brunt of it alone Well you d better run along since they re waiting for you at home said missus Williams closing the door Good night Penrod Ten minutes later Penrod took his place at his own dinner table somewhat breathless but with an expression of perfect composure Can t you EVER come home without being telephoned for demanded his father Yes sir And Penrod added reproachfully placing the blame upon members of mister Schofield s own class Sam s mother and father kept me or I d been home long ago They would keep on talkin and I guess I had to be POLITE didn t I His left arm was as free as his right there was no dreadful bulk beneath his jacket and at Penrod s age the future is too far away to be worried about the difference between temporary security and permanent security is left for grown people To Penrod security was security and before his dinner was half eaten his spirit had become fairly serene Nevertheless when he entered the empty carriage house of the stable on his return from school the next afternoon his expression was not altogether without apprehension and he stood in the doorway looking well about him before he lifted a loosened plank in the flooring and took from beneath it the grand old weapon of the Williams family Not did his eye lighten with any pleasurable excitement as he sat himself down in a shadowy corner and began some sketchy experiments with the mechanism The allure of first sight was gone In mister Williams bedchamber with Sam clamouring for possession it had seemed to Penrod that nothing in the world was so desirable as to have that revolver in his own hands it was his dream come true But for reasons not definitely known to him the charm had departed he turned the cylinder gingerly almost with distaste and slowly there stole over him a feeling that there was something repellent and threatening in the heavy blue steel Thus does the long dreamed Real misbehave not only for Penrod More out of a sense of duty to bingism in general than for any other reason he pointed the revolver at the lawn mower and gloomily murmured Bing Simultaneously a low and cautious voice sounded from the yard outside Yay Penrod and Sam Williams darkened the doorway his eye falling instantly upon the weapon in his friend s hand Sam seemed relieved to see it You didn t get caught with it did you he said hastily Penrod shook his head rising I guess not I guess I got SOME brains around me he added inspired by Sam s presence to assume a slight swagger They d have to get up pretty early to find any good ole revolaver once I got MY hands on it I guess we can keep it all right Sam said confidentially Because this morning papa was putting on his winter underclothes and he found it wasn t there and they looked all over and everywhere and he was pretty mad and said he knew it was those cheap plumbers stole it that mamma got instead of the regular plumbers he always used to have and he said there wasn t any chance ever gettin it back because you couldn t tell which one took it and they d all swear it wasn t them So it looks like we could keep it for our revolaver Penrod don t it I ll give you half of it Penrod affected some enthusiasm Sam we ll keep it out here in the stable Yes and we ll go huntin with it We ll do lots of things with it But Sam made no effort to take it and neither boy seemed to feel yesterday s necessity to show the other how he did Wait till next Fourth o July Sam continued Oh oh Look out This incited a genuine spark from Penrod Fourth o July I guess she ll be a little better than any firecrackers Just a little Bing Bing Bing she ll be goin Bing Bing Bing The suggestion of noise stirred his comrade I ll bet she ll go off louder n that time the gas works blew up I wouldn t be afraid to shoot her off ANY time I bet you would said Penrod You aren t used to revolavers the way I You aren t either Sam exclaimed promptly I wouldn t be any more afraid to shoot her off than you would You would too I would not Well let s see you then you talk so much And Penrod handed the weapon scornfully to Sam who at once became less self assertive I d shoot her off in a minute Sam said only it might break sumpthing if it hit it Hold her up in the air then It can t hurt the roof can it Sam with a desperate expression lifted the revolver at arm s length Both boys turned away their heads and Penrod put his fingers in his ears but nothing happened What s the matter he demanded Why don t you go on if you re goin to Sam lowered his arm I guess I didn t have her cocked he said apologetically whereupon Penrod loudly jeered Tryin to shoot a revolaver and didn t know enough to cock her If I didn t know any more about revolavers than that I d There Sam exclaimed managing to draw back the hammer until two chilling clicks warranted his opinion that the pistol was now ready to perform its office I guess she ll do all right to suit you THIS time Well whyn t you go ahead then you know so much And as Sam raised his arm Penrod again turned away his head and placed his forefingers in his ears A pause followed Why n t you go ahead Penrod after waiting in keen suspense turned to behold his friend standing with his right arm above his head his left hand over his left ear and both eyes closed I can t pull the trigger said Sam indistinctly his face convulsed as in sympathy with the great muscular efforts of other parts of his body She won t pull She won t Penrod remarked with scorn I ll bet I could pull her Sam promptly opened his eyes and handed the weapon to Penrod All right he said with surprising and unusual mildness You try her then Inwardly discomfited to a disagreeable extent Penrod attempted to talk his own misgivings out of countenance Poor ittle baby he said swinging the pistol at his side with a fair pretense of careless ease Ain t even strong enough to pull a trigger Poor ittle baby Well if you can t even do that much you better watch me while I Well said Sam reasonably why don t you go on and do it then Well I AM goin to ain t I Well then why don t you Oh I ll do it fast enough to suit YOU I guess Penrod retorted swinging the big revolver up a little higher than his shoulder and pointing it in the direction of the double doors which opened upon the alley You better run Sam he jeered You ll be pretty scared when I shoot her off I guess Well why don t you SEE if I will I bet you re afraid yourself Oh I am am I said Penrod in a reckless voice and his finger touched the trigger It seemed to him that his finger no more than touched it perhaps he had been reassured by Sam s assertion that the trigger was difficult His intentions must remain in doubt and probably Penrod himself was not certain of them but one thing comes to the surface as entirely definite that trigger was not so hard to pull as Sam said it was BANG WH A A ACK A shattering report split the air of the stable and there was an orifice of remarkable diameter in the alley door With these phenomena three yells expressing excitement of different kinds were almost simultaneous two from within the stable and the third from a point in the alley about eleven inches lower than the orifice just constructed in the planking of the door This third point roughly speaking was the open mouth of a gayly dressed young coloured man whose attention as he strolled had been thus violently distracted from some mental computations he was making in numbers including particularly those symbols at ecstasy or woe as the case might be seven and eleven His eye at once perceived the orifice on a line enervatingly little above the top of his head and although he had not supposed himself so well known in this neighbourhood he was aware that he did here and there possess acquaintances of whom some such uncomplimentary action might be expected as natural and characteristic His immediate procedure was to prostrate himself flat upon the ground against the stable doors In so doing his shoulders came brusquely in contact with one of them which happened to be unfastened and it swung open revealing to his gaze two stark white white boys one of them holding an enormous pistol and both staring at him in stupor of ultimate horror For to the glassy eyes of Penrod and Sam the stratagem of the young coloured man thus dropping to earth disclosed with awful certainty a slaughtered body This dreadful thing raised itself upon its elbows and looked at them and there followed a motionless moment a tableau of brief duration for both boys turned and would have fled shrieking but the body spoke At s a nice business it said reproachfully Nice business Tryin blow a man s head off Penrod was unable to speak but Sam managed to summon the tremulous semblance of a voice Where where did it hit you he gasped Nemmine anything bout where it HIT me the young coloured man returned dusting his breast and knees as he rose I want to know what kine o white boys you think you is man can t walk long street thout you blowin his head off He entered the stable and with an indignation surely justified took the pistol from the limp cold hand of Penrod Whose gun you playin with Where you git at gun It s ours quavered Sam It belongs to us Then you pa ought to be rested said the young coloured man Lettin boys play with gun He examined the revolver with an interest in which there began to appear symptoms of a pleasurable appreciation My goo ness Gun like iss blow a team o steers thew a brick house LOOK at at gun With his right hand he twirled it in a manner most dexterous and surprising then suddenly he became severe You white boy listen me he said Ef I went an did what I OUGHT to did I d march straight out iss stable git a policeman an tell him rest you an take you off to jail At s what you need blowin man s head off Listen me I m goin take iss gun an th ow her away where you can t do no mo harm with her I m goin take her way off in the woods an th ow her away where can t nobody fine her an go blowin man s head off with her At s what I m goin do And placing the revolver inside his coat as inconspicuously as possible he proceeded to the open door and into the alley where he turned for a final word I let you off iss one time he said but listen me you listen white boy you bet not tell you pa I ain goin tell him an YOU ain goin tell him He want know where gun gone you tell him you los her He disappeared rapidly Sam Williams swallowing continuously presently walked to the alley door and remarked in a weak voice I m sick at my stummick He paused then added more decidedly I m goin home I guess I ve stood about enough around here for one day And bestowing a last glance upon his friend who was now sitting dumbly upon the floor in the exact spot where he had stood to fire the dreadful shot Sam moved slowly away The early shades of autumn evening were falling when Penrod emerged from the stable and a better light might have disclosed to a shrewd eye some indications that here was a boy who had been extremely if temporarily ill He went to the cistern and after a cautious glance round the reassuring horizon lifted the iron cover Then he took from the inner pocket of his jacket an object which he dropped listlessly into the water it was a bit of wood whittled to the likeness of a pistol And though his lips moved not nor any sound issued from his vocal organs yet were words formed They were so deep in the person of Penrod they came almost from the slowly convalescing profundities of his stomach These words concerned firearms and they were Wish I d never seen one Never want to see one again Of course Penrod had no way of knowing that as regards bingism in general several of the most distinguished old gentlemen in Europe were at that very moment in exactly the same state of mind CHAPTER V THE IN OR IN Georgie Bassett was a boy set apart Not only that Georgie knew that he was a boy set apart He would think about it for ten or twenty minutes at a time and he could not look at himself in a mirror and remain wholly without emotion What that emotion was he would have been unable to put into words but it helped him to understand that there was a certain noble something about him that other boys did not possess Georgie s mother had been the first to discover that Georgie was a boy set apart In fact Georgie did not know it until one day when he happened to overhear his mother telling two of his aunts about it True he had always understood that he was the best boy in town and he intended to be a minister when he grew up but he had never before comprehended the full extent of his sanctity and from that fraught moment onward he had an almost theatrical sense of his set apartness Penrod Schofield and Sam Williams and the other boys of the neighbourhood all were conscious that there was something different and spiritual about Georgie and though this consciousness of theirs may have been a little obscure it was none the less actual That is to say they knew that Georgie Bassett was a boy set apart but they did not know that they knew it Georgie s air and manner at all times demonstrated to them that the thing was so and moreover their mothers absorbed appreciation of Georgie s wonderfulness from the very fount of it for missus Bassett s conversation was of little else Thus the radiance of his character became the topic of envious parental comment during moments of strained patience in many homes so that altogether the most remarkable fact to be stated of Georgie Bassett is that he escaped the consequences as long as he did Strange as it may seem no actual violence was done him except upon the incidental occasion of a tar fight into which he was drawn by an obvious eccentricity on the part of destiny Naturally he was not popular with his comrades in all games he was pushed aside and disregarded being invariably the tail ender in every pastime in which leaders chose sides his counsels were slighted as worse than weightless and all his opinions instantly hooted Still considering the circumstances fairly and thoughtfully it is difficult to deny that his boy companions showed creditable moderation in their treatment of him That is they were moderate up to a certain date and even then they did not directly attack him there was nothing cold blooded about it at all The thing was forced upon them and though they all felt pleased and uplifted while it was happening they did not understand precisely why Nothing could more clearly prove their innocence of heart than this very ignorance and yet none of the grown people who later felt themselves concerned in the matter was able to look at it in that light Now here was a characteristic working of those reactions that produce what is sometimes called the injustice of life because the grown people were responsible for the whole affair and were really the guilty parties It was from grown people that Georgie Bassett learned he was a boy set apart and the effect upon him was what alienated his friends Then these alienated friends were brought by odious comparisons on the part of grown people to a condition of mind wherein they suffered dumb annoyance like a low fever whenever they heard Georgie s name mentioned while association with his actual person became every day more and more irritating And yet having laid this fuse and having kept it constantly glowing the grown people expected nothing to happen to Georgie The catastrophe befell as a consequence of Sam Williams deciding to have a shack in his backyard Sam had somehow obtained a vasty piano box and a quantity of lumber and summoning Penrod Schofield and the coloured brethren Herman and Verman he expounded to them his building plans and offered them shares and benefits in the institution he proposed to found Acceptance was enthusiastic straightway the assembly became a union of carpenters all of one mind and ten days saw the shack not completed but comprehensible Anybody could tell by that time that it was intended for a shack There was a door on leather hinges it drooped perhaps but it was a door There was a window not a glass one but at least it could be looked out of as Sam said There was a chimney made of stovepipe though that was merely decorative because the cooking was done out of doors in an underground furnace that the boys excavated There were pictures pasted on the interior walls and hanging from a nail there was a crayon portrait of Sam s grandfather which he had brought down from the attic quietly though as he said it wasn t any use on earth up there There were two lame chairs from Penrod s attic and along one wall ran a low and feeble structure intended to serve as a bench or divan This would come in handy Sam said if any of the party had to lay down or anything and at a pinch such as a meeting of the association it would serve to seat all the members in a row For coincidentally with the development of the shack the builders became something more than partners Later no one could remember who first suggested the founding of a secret order or society as a measure of exclusiveness and to keep the shack sacred to members only but it was an idea that presently began to be more absorbing and satisfactory than even the shack itself The outward manifestations of it might have been observed in the increased solemnity and preoccupation of the Caucasian members and in a few ceremonial observances exposed to the public eye As an instance of these latter missus Williams happening to glance from a rearward window about four o clock one afternoon found her attention arrested by what seemed to be a flag raising before the door of the shack Sam and Herman and Verman stood in attitudes of rigid attention shoulder to shoulder while Penrod Schofield facing them was apparently delivering some sort of exhortation which he read from a scribbled sheet of foolscap Concluding this he lifted from the ground a long and somewhat warped clothes prop from one end of which hung a whitish flag or pennon bearing an inscription Sam and Herman and Verman lifted their right hands while Penrod placed the other end of the clothes prop in a hole in the ground with the pennon fluttering high above the shack He then raised his own right hand and the four boys repeated something in concert It was inaudible to missus Williams but she was able to make out the inscription upon the pennon It consisted of the peculiar phrase In Or In done in black paint upon a muslin ground and consequently seeming to be in need of a blotter It recurred to her mind later that evening when she happened to find herself alone with Sam in the library and in merest idle curiosity she asked Sam what does In Or In mean Sam bending over an arithmetic uncreased his brow till it became of a blank and marble smoothness Ma am What are those words on your flag Sam gave her a long cold mystic look rose to his feet and left the room with emphasis and dignity For a moment she was puzzled But Sam s older brother was this year completing his education at a university and missus Williams was not altogether ignorant of the obligations of secrecy imposed upon some brotherhoods so she was able to comprehend Sam s silent withdrawal and instead of summoning him back for further questions she waited until he was out of hearing and then began to laugh Sam s action was in obedience to one of the rules adopted at his own suggestion as a law of the order Penrod advocated it warmly From Margaret he had heard accounts of her friends in college and thus had learned much that ought to be done On the other hand Herman subscribed to it with reluctance expressing a decided opinion that if he and Verman were questioned upon the matter at home and adopted the line of conduct required by the new rule it would be well for them to depart not only from the room in which the questioning took place but from the house and hurriedly at that An STAY away he concluded Verman being tongue tied not without advantage in this case and surely an ideal qualification for membership was not so apprehensive He voted with Sam and Penrod carrying the day New rules were adopted at every meeting though it cannot be said that all of them were practicable for in addition to the information possessed by Sam and Penrod Herman and Verman had many ideas of their own founded upon remarks overheard at home Both their parents belonged to secret orders their father to the Innapenent Nevolent Lodge so stated by Herman and their mother to the Order of White Doves From these and other sources Penrod found no difficulty in compiling material for what came to be known as the rixual and it was the rixual he was reading to the members when missus Williams happened to observe the ceremonial raising of the emblem of the order The rixual contained the oath a key to the secret language or code devised by Penrod for use in uncertain emergencies and passwords for admission to the shack also instructions for recognizing a brother member in the dark and a rather alarming sketch of the things to be done during the initiation of a candidate This last was employed for the benefit of Master Roderick Magsworth Bitts Junior on the Saturday following the flag raising He presented himself in Sam s yard not for initiation indeed having no previous knowledge of the Society of the In Or In but for general purposes of sport and pastime At first sight of the shack he expressed anticipations of pleasure adding some suggestions for improving the architectural effect Being prevented however from entering and even from standing in the vicinity of the sacred building he plaintively demanded an explanation whereupon he was commanded to withdraw to the front yard for a time and the members held meeting in the shack Roddy was elected and consented to undergo the initiation He was not the only new member that day A short time after Roddy had been taken into the shack for the reading of the rixual and other ceremonies little Maurice Levy entered the Williams gate and strolled round to the backyard looking for Sam He was surprised and delighted to behold the promising shack and like Roddy entertained fair hopes for the future The door of the shack was closed a board covered the window but a murmur of voices came from within Maurice stole close and listened Through a crack he could see the flicker of a candle flame and he heard the voice of Penrod Schofield Roddy Bitts do you solemnly swear Well all right said the voice of Roddy somewhat breathless How many fingers you see before your eyes Can t see any Roddy returned How could I with this thing over my eyes and laying down on my stummick anyway Then the time has come Penrod announced in solemn tones The time has come Whack Evidently a broad and flat implement was thereupon applied to Roddy OW complained the candidate No noise said Penrod sternly and added Roddy Bitts must now say the oath Say exackly what I say Roddy and if you don t well you better because you ll see Now say I solemnly swear I solemnly swear Roddy said To keep the secrets To keep the secrets Roddy repeated To keep the secrets in infadelaty and violate and sanctuary What Roddy naturally inquired Whack OW cried Roddy That s no fair You got to say just what I say Penrod was heard informing him That s the rixual and anyway even if you do get it right Verman s got to hit you every now and then because that s part of the rixual too Now go on and say it I solemnly swear to keep the secrets in infadelaty and violate and sanctuary I solemnly swear Roddy began But Maurice Levy was tired of being no party to such fascinating proceedings and he began to hammer upon the door Sam Sam Williams he shouted Lemme in there I know lots about nishiatin Lemme in The door was flung open revealing Roddy Bitts blindfolded and bound lying face down upon the floor of the shack but Maurice had only a fugitive glimpse of this pathetic figure before he too was recumbent Four boys flung themselves indignantly upon him and bore him to earth Hi he squealed What you doin Haven t you got any SENSE And from within the shack Roddy added his own protest Let me up can t you he cried I got to see what s goin on out there haven t I I guess I m not goin to lay here all DAY What you think I m made of You hush up Penrod commanded This is a nice biznuss he continued deeply aggrieved What kind of a nishiation do you expect this is anyhow Well here s Maurice Levy gone and seen part of the secrets said Sam in a voice of equal plaintiveness Yes and I bet he was listenin out here too Lemme up begged Maurice half stifled I didn t do any harm to your old secrets did I Anyways I just as soon be nishiated myself I ain t afraid So if you nishiate me what difference will it make if I did hear a little Struck with this idea which seemed reasonable Penrod obtained silence from every one except Roddy and it was decided to allow Maurice to rise and retire to the front yard The brother members then withdrew within the shack elected Maurice to the fellowship and completed the initiation of mister Bitts After that Maurice was summoned and underwent the ordeal with fortitude though the newest brother still tingling with his own experiences helped to make certain parts of the rixual unprecedentedly severe Once endowed with full membership Maurice and Roddy accepted the obligations and privileges of the order with enthusiasm Both interested themselves immediately in improvements for the shack and made excursions to their homes to obtain materials Roddy returned with a pair of lensless mother of pearl opera glasses a contribution that led to the creation of a new office called the warner It was his duty to climb upon the back fence once every fifteen minutes and search the horizon for intruders or anybody that hasn t got any biznuss around here This post proved so popular at first that it was found necessary to provide for rotation in office and to shorten the interval from fifteen minutes to an indefinite but much briefer period determined principally by argument between the incumbent and his successor And Maurice Levy contributed a device so pleasant and so necessary to the prevention of interruption during meetings that Penrod and Sam wondered why they had not thought of it themselves long before It consisted of about twenty five feet of garden hose in fair condition One end of it was introduced into the shack through a knothole and the other was secured by wire round the faucet of hydrant in the stable Thus if members of the order were assailed by thirst during an important session or in the course of an initiation it would not be necessary for them all to leave the shack One could go instead and when he had turned on the water at the hydrant the members in the shack could drink without leaving their places It was discovered also that the section of hose could be used as a speaking tube and though it did prove necessary to explain by shouting outside the tube what one had said into it still there was a general feeling that it provided another means of secrecy and an additional safeguard against intrusion It is true that during the half hour immediately following the installation of this convenience there was a little violence among the brothers concerning a question of policy Sam Roddy and Verman Verman especially wished to use the tube to talk through and Maurice Penrod and Herman wished to use it to drink through As a consequence of the success of the latter party the shack became too damp for habitation until another day and several members as they went home at dusk might easily have been mistaken for survivors of some marine catastrophe Still not every shack is equipped with running water and exuberance befitted the occasion Everybody agreed that the afternoon had been one of the most successful and important in many weeks The Order of the In Or In was doing splendidly and yet every brother felt in his heart that there was one thing that could spoil it Against that fatality all were united to protect themselves the shack the rixual the opera glasses and the water and speaking tube Sam spoke not only for himself but for the entire order when he declared in speeding the last parting guest Well we got to stick to one thing or we might as well quit GEORGIE BASSETT better not come pokin around No SIR said Penrod CHAPTER VI GEORGIE BECOMES A MEMBER But Georgie did It is difficult to imagine how cause and effect could be more closely and patently related Inevitably Georgie did come poking around How was he to refrain when daily up and down the neighbourhood the brothers strutted with mystic and important airs when they whispered together and uttered words of strange import in his presence Thus did they defeat their own object They desired to keep Georgie at a distance yet they could not refrain from posing before him They wished to impress upon him the fact that he was an outsider and they but succeeded in rousing his desire to be an insider a desire that soon became a determination For few were the days until he not only knew of the shack but had actually paid it a visit That was upon a morning when the other boys were in school Georgie having found himself indisposed until about ten o clock when he was able to take nourishment and subsequently to interest himself in this rather private errand He climbed the Williams alley fence and having made a modest investigation of the exterior of the shack which was padlocked retired without having disturbed anything except his own peace of mind His curiosity merely piqued before now became ravenous and painful It was not allayed by the mystic manners of the members or by the unnecessary emphasis they laid upon their coldness toward himself and when a committee informed him darkly that there were secret orders to prevent his coming within a hundred and sixteen feet such was Penrod s arbitrary language of the Williams yard in any direction Georgie could bear it no longer but entered his own house and in burning words laid the case before a woman higher up Here the responsibility for things is directly traceable to grown people Within that hour missus Bassett sat in missus Williams s library to address her hostess upon the subject of Georgie s grievance Of course it isn t Sam s fault she said concluding her interpretation of the affair Georgie likes Sam and didn t blame him at all No we both felt that Sam would always be a polite nice boy Georgie used those very words but Penrod seems to have a VERY bad influence Georgie felt that Sam would WANT him to come and play in the shack if Penrod didn t make Sam do everything HE wants What hurt Georgie most is that it s SAM S shack and he felt for another boy to come and tell him that he mustn t even go NEAR it well of course it was very trying And he s very much hurt with little Maurice Levy too He said that he was sure that even Penrod would be glad to have him for a member of their little club if it weren t for Maurice and I think he spoke of Roddy Bitts too The fact that the two remaining members were coloured was omitted from this discourse which leads to the deduction that Georgie had not mentioned it Georgie said all the other boys liked him very much missus Bassett continued and that he felt it his duty to join the club because most of them were so anxious to have him and he is sure he would have a good influence over them He really did speak of it in quite a touching way missus Williams Of course we mothers mustn t brag of our sons too much but Georgie REALLY isn t like other boys He is so sensitive you can t think how this little affair has hurt him and I felt that it might even make him ill You see I HAD to respect his reason for wanting to join the club And if I AM his mother she gave a deprecating little laugh I must say that it seems noble to want to join not really for his own sake but for the good that he felt his influence would have over the other boys Don t you think so missus Williams missus Williams said that she did indeed And the result of this interview was another which took place between Sam and his father that evening for missus Williams after talking to Sam herself felt that the matter needed a man to deal with it The man did it man fashion You either invite Georgie Bassett to play in the shack all he wants to the man said or the shack comes down But Take your choice I m not going to have neighbourhood quarrels over such But Papa That s enough You said yourself you haven t anything against Georgie I said You said you didn t like him but you couldn t tell why You couldn t state a single instance of bad behaviour against him You couldn t mention anything he ever did which wasn t what a gentleman should have done It s no use I tell you Either you invite Georgie to play in the shack as much as he likes next Saturday or the shack comes down But PAPA I m not going to talk any more about it If you want the shack pulled down and hauled away you and your friends continue to tantalize this inoffensive little boy the way you have been If you want to keep it be polite and invite him in But That s ALL I said Sam was crushed Next day he communicated the bitter substance of the edict to the other members and gloom became unanimous So serious an aspect did the affair present that it was felt necessary to call a special meeting of the order after school The entire membership was in attendance the door was closed the window covered with a board and the candle lighted Then all of the brothers except one began to express their sorrowful apprehensions The whole thing was spoiled they agreed if Georgie Bassett had to be taken in On the other hand if they didn t take him in there wouldn t be anything left The one brother who failed to express any opinion was little Verman He was otherwise occupied Verman had been the official paddler during the initiations of Roddy Bitts and Maurice Levy his work had been conscientious and it seemed to be taken by consent that he was to continue in office An old shingle from the woodshed roof had been used for the exercise of his function in the cases of Roddy and Maurice but this afternoon he had brought with him a new one that he had picked up somewhere It was broader and thicker than the old one and during the melancholy prophecies of his fellows he whittled the lesser end of it to the likeness of a handle Thus engaged he bore no appearance of despondency on the contrary his eyes shining brightly in the candlelight indicated that eager thoughts possessed him while from time to time the sound of a chuckle issued from his simple African throat Gradually the other brothers began to notice his preoccupation and one by one they fell silent regarding him thoughtfully Slowly the darkness of their countenances lifted a little something happier and brighter began to glimmer from each boyish face All eyes remained fascinated upon Verman Well anyway said Penrod in a tone that was almost cheerful this is only Tuesday We got pretty near all week to fix up the nishiation for Saturday And Saturday brought sunshine to make the occasion more tolerable for both the candidate and the society missus Williams going to the window to watch Sam when he left the house after lunch marked with pleasure that his look and manner were sprightly as he skipped down the walk to the front gate There he paused and yodelled for a time An answering yodel came presently Penrod Schofield appeared and by his side walked Georgie Bassett Georgie was always neat but missus Williams noticed that he exhibited unusual gloss and polish to day As for his expression it was a shade too complacent under the circumstances though for that matter perfect tact avoids an air of triumph under any circumstances missus Williams was pleased to observe that Sam and Penrod betrayed no resentment whatever they seemed to have accepted defeat in a good spirit and to be inclined to make the best of Georgie Indeed they appeared to be genuinely excited about him it was evident that their cordiality was eager and wholehearted The three boys conferred for a few moments then Sam disappeared round the house and returned waving his hand and nodding Upon that Penrod took Georgie s left arm Sam took his right and the three marched off to the backyard in a companionable way that made missus Williams feel it had been an excellent thing to interfere a little in Georgie s interest Experiencing the benevolent warmth that comes of assisting in a good action she ascended to an apartment upstairs and for a couple of hours employed herself with needle and thread in sartorial repairs on behalf of her husband and Sam Then she was interrupted by the advent of a coloured serving maid Miz Williams I reckon the house goin fall down this pessimist said arriving out of breath That s iety o Mist Sam s suttenly tryin to pull the roof down on ow haids The roof missus Williams inquired mildly They aren t in the attic are they No m they in the celluh but they REACHIN fer the roof I nev did hear no sech a rumpus an squawkin an squawlin an fallin an whoopin an whackin an bangin They troop down by the outside celluh do n en bang they bus loose an been goin on ev since wuss n Bedlun Ef they anything down celluh ain broke by this time it cain be only jes the foundashum an I bet THAT ain goin stan much longer I d gone down an stop em but I m fraid to Hones Miz Williams I m fraid o my life go down there all that Bedlun goin on I thought I come see what you say missus Williams laughed We have to stand a little noise in the house sometimes Fanny when there are boys They re just playing and a lot of noise is usually a pretty safe sign Yes m Fanny said It s yo house Miz Williams not mine You want em tear it down I m willin She departed and missus Williams continued to sew The days were growing short and at five o clock she was obliged to put the work aside as her eyes did not permit her to continue it by artificial light Descending to the lower floor she found the house silent and when she opened the front door to see if the evening paper had come she beheld Sam Penrod and Maurice Levy standing near the gate engaged in quiet conversation Penrod and Maurice departed while she was looking for the paper and Sam came thoughtfully up the walk Well Sam she said it wasn t such a bad thing after all to show a little politeness to Georgie Bassett was it Sam gave her a non committal look expression of every kind had been wiped from his countenance He presented a blank surface No m he said meekly Everything was just a little pleasanter because you d been friendly wasn t it Yes m Has Georgie gone home Yes m I hear you made enough noise in the cellar Did Georgie have a good time Ma am Did Georgie Bassett have a good time Well Sam now had the air of a person trying to remember details with absolute accuracy well he didn t say he did and he didn t say he didn t Didn t he thank the boys No m Didn t he even thank you No m Why that s queer she said He s always so polite He SEEMED to be having a good time didn t he Sam Ma am Didn t Georgie seem to be enjoying himself This question apparently so simple was not answered with promptness Sam looked at his mother in a puzzled way and then he found it necessary to rub each of his shins in turn with the palm of his right hand I stumbled he said apologetically I stumbled on the cellar steps Did you hurt yourself she asked quickly No m but I guess maybe I better rub some arnica I ll get it she said Come up to your father s bathroom Sam Does it hurt much No m he answered truthfully it hardly hurts at all And having followed her to the bathroom he insisted with unusual gentleness that he be left to apply the arnica to the alleged injuries himself He was so persuasive that she yielded and descended to the library where she found her husband once more at home after his day s work Well he said Did Georgie show up and were they decent to him Oh yes it s all right Sam and Penrod were good as gold I saw them being actually cordial to him That s well mister Williams said settling into a chair with his paper I was a little apprehensive but I suppose I was mistaken I walked home and just now as I passed missus Bassett s I saw Doctor Venny s car in front and that barber from the corner shop on Second Street was going in the door I couldn t think what a widow would need a barber and a doctor for especially at the same time I couldn t think what Georgie d need such a combination for either and then I got afraid that maybe missus Williams laughed Oh no it hasn t anything to do with his having been over here I m sure they were very nice to him Well I m glad of that Yes indeed missus Williams began when Fanny appeared summoning her to the telephone It is pathetically true that missus Williams went to the telephone humming a little song She was detained at the instrument not more than five minutes then she made a plunging return into the library a blanched and stricken woman She made strange sinister gestures at her husband He sprang up miserably prophetic missus Bassett Go to the telephone missus Williams said hoarsely She wants to talk to you too She CAN T talk much she s hysterical She says they lured Georgie into the cellar and had him beaten by negroes That s not all mister Williams was already on his way You find Sam he commanded over his shoulder missus Williams stepped into the front hall Sam she called addressing the upper reaches of the stairway Sam Not even echo answered SAM A faint clearing of somebody s throat was heard behind her a sound so modest and unobtrusive it was no more than just audible and turning the mother beheld her son sitting upon the floor in the shadow of the stairs and gazing meditatively at the hatrack His manner indicated that he wished to produce the impression that he had been sitting there in this somewhat unusual place and occupation for a considerable time but without overhearing anything that went on in the library so close by Sam she cried what have you DONE Well I guess my legs are all right he said gently I got the arnica on so probably they won t hurt any m Stand up she said Ma am March into the library Sam marched slow time In fact no funeral march has been composed in a time so slow as to suit this march of Sam s One might have suspected that he was in a state of apprehension mister Williams entered at one door as his son crossed the threshold of the other and this encounter was a piteous sight After one glance at his father s face Sam turned desperately as if to flee outright But missus Williams stood in the doorway behind him You come here And the father s voice was as terrible as his face WHAT DID YOU DO TO GEORGIE BASSETT Nothin Sam gulped nothin at all What We just we just nishiated him mister Williams turned abruptly walked to the fireplace and there turned again facing the wretched Sam That s all you did Yes sir Georgie Bassett s mother has just told me over the telephone mister Williams said deliberately that you and Penrod Schofield and Roderick Bitts and Maurice Levy LURED GEORGIE INTO THE CELLAR AND HAD HIM BEATEN BY NEGROES At this Sam was able to hold up his head a little and to summon a rather feeble indignation It ain t so he declared We didn t any such thing lower him into the cellar We weren t goin NEAR the cellar with him We never THOUGHT of goin down cellar He went down there himself first So I suppose he was running away from you poor thing Trying to escape from you wasn t he He wasn t Sam said doggedly We weren t chasin him or anything at all Then why did he go in the cellar Well he didn t exactly GO in the cellar Sam said reluctantly Well how did he GET in the cellar then He he fell in said Sam HOW did he fall in Well the door was open and well he kept walkin around there and we hollered at him to keep away but just then he kind of well the first I noticed was I couldn t SEE him and so we went and looked down the steps and he was sitting down there on the bottom step and kind of shouting and See here mister Williams interrupted You re going to make a clean breast of this whole affair and take the consequences You re going to tell it and tell it ALL Do you understand that Yes sir Then you tell me how Georgie Bassett fell down the cellar steps and tell me quick He he was blindfolded Aha NOW we re getting at it You begin at the beginning and tell me just what you did to him from the time he got here Understand Yes sir Go on then Well I m goin to Sam protested We never hurt him at all He wasn t even hurt when he fell down cellar There s a lot of mud down there because the cellar door leaks and Sam mister Williams s tone was deadly Did you hear me tell you to begin at the beginning Sam made a great effort and was able to obey Well we had everything ready for the nishiation before lunch he said We wanted it all to be nice because you said we had to have him papa and after lunch Penrod went to guard him that s a new part in the rixual and he brought him over and we took him out to the shack and blindfolded him and well he got kind of mad because we wanted him to lay down on his stummick and be tied up and he said he wouldn t because the floor was a little bit wet in there and he could feel it sort of squashy under his shoes and he said his mother didn t want him ever to get dirty and he just wouldn t do it and we all kept telling him he had to or else how could there be any nishiation and he kept gettin madder and said he wanted to have the nishiation outdoors where it wasn t wet and he wasn t goin to lay down on his stummick anyway Sam paused for wind then got under way again Well some of the boys were tryin to get him to lay down on his stummick and he kind of fell up against the door and it came open and he ran out in the yard He was tryin to get the blindfold off his eyes but he couldn t because it was a towel in a pretty hard knot and he went tearin all around the backyard and we didn t chase him or anything All we did was just watch him and that s when he fell in the cellar Well it didn t hurt him any It didn t hurt him at all but he was muddier than what he would of been if he d just had sense enough to lay down in the shack Well so we thought long as he was down in the cellar anyway we might as well have the rest of the nishiation down there So we brought the things down and and nishiated him and that s all That s every bit we did to him Yes mister Williams said sardonically I see What were the details of the initiation Sir I want to know what else you did to him What was the initiation It s it s secret Sam murmured piteously Not any longer I assure you The society is a thing of the past and you ll find your friend Penrod s parents agree with me in that missus Bassett had already telephoned them when she called us up You go on with your story Sam sighed deeply and yet it may have been a consolation to know that his present misery was not altogether without its counterpart Through the falling dusk his spirit may have crossed the intervening distance to catch a glimpse of his friend suffering simultaneously and standing within the same peril And if Sam s spirit did thus behold Penrod in jeopardy it was a true vision Go on mister Williams said Well there wasn t any fire in the furnace because it s too warm yet and we weren t goin to do anything d HURT him so we put him in there In the FURNACE It was cold Sam protested There hadn t been any fire there since last spring Course we told him there was fire in it We HAD to do that he continued earnestly because that was part of the nishiation We only kept him in it a little while and kind of hammered on the outside a little and then we took him out and got him to lay down on his stummick because he was all muddy anyway where he fell down the cellar and how could it matter to anybody that had any sense at all Well then we had the rixual and and why the teeny little paddlin he got wouldn t hurt a flea It was that little coloured boy lives in the alley did it he isn t anyways near HALF Georgie s size but Georgie got mad and said he didn t want any ole nigger to paddle him That s what he said and it was his own foolishness because Verman won t let ANYBODY call him nigger and if Georgie was goin to call him that he ought to had sense enough not to do it when he was layin down that way and Verman all ready to be the paddler And he needn t of been so mad at the rest of us either because it took us about twenty minutes to get the paddle away from Verman after that and we had to lock Verman up in the laundry room and not let him out till it was all over Well and then things were kind of spoiled anyway so we didn t do but just a little more and that s all Go on What was the just a little more Well we got him to swaller a little teeny bit of asafidity that Penrod used to have to wear in a bag around his neck It wasn t enough to even make a person sneeze it wasn t much more n a half a spoonful it wasn t hardly a QUARTER of a spoonf Ha said mister Williams That accounts for the doctor What else Well we we had some paint left over from our flag and we put just a little teeny bit of it on his hair and Ha said mister Williams That accounts for the barber What else That s all Sam said swallowing Then he got mad and went home mister Williams walked to the door and sternly motioned to the culprit to precede him through it But just before the pair passed from her sight missus Williams gave way to an uncontrollable impulse Sam she asked what does In Or In stand for The unfortunate boy had begun to sniffle It it means Innapenent Order of Infadelaty he moaned and plodded onward to his doom Not his alone at that very moment Master Roderick Magsworth Bitts Junior was suffering also consequent upon telephoning on the part of missus Bassett though Roderick s punishment was administered less on the ground of Georgie s troubles and more on that of Roddy s having affiliated with an order consisting so largely of Herman and Verman As for Maurice Levy he was no whit less unhappy He fared as ill Simultaneously two ex members of the In Or In were finding their lot fortunate Something had prompted them to linger in the alley in the vicinity of the shack and it was to this fated edifice that mister Williams with demoniac justice brought Sam for the deed he had in mind Herman and Verman listened awe stricken to what went on within the shack Then before it was over they crept away and down the alley toward their own home This was directly across the alley from the Schofields stable and they were horrified at the sounds that issued from the interior of the stable store room It was the saint Bartholomew s Eve of that neighbourhood Man man said Herman shaking his head Glad I ain no white boy Verman seemed gloomily to assent CHAPTER VII WHITEY Penrod and Sam made a gloomy discovery one morning in mid October All the week had seen amiable breezes and fair skies until Saturday when about breakfast time the dome of heaven filled solidly with gray vapour and began to drip The boys discovery was that there is no justice about the weather They sat in the carriage house of the Schofields empty stable the doors upon the alley were open and Sam and Penrod stared torpidly at the thin but implacable drizzle that was the more irritating because there was barely enough of it to interfere with a number of things they had planned to do Yes this is NICE Sam said in a tone of plaintive sarcasm This is a PERTY way to do He was alluding to the personal spitefulness of the elements I d like to know what s the sense of it ole sun pourin down every day in the week when nobody needs it then cloud up and rain all Saturday My father said it s goin to be a three days rain Well nobody with any sense cares if it rains Sunday and Monday Penrod said I wouldn t care if it rained every Sunday as long I lived but I just like to know what s the reason it had to go and rain to day Got all the days o the week to choose from and goes and picks on Saturday That s a fine biz nuss Well in vacation Sam began but at a sound from a source invisible to him he paused What s that he said somewhat startled It was a curious sound loud and hollow and unhuman yet it seemed to be a cough Both boys rose and Penrod asked uneasily Where d that noise come from It s in the alley said Sam Perhaps if the day had been bright both of them would have stepped immediately to the alley doors to investigate but their actual procedure was to move a little distance in the opposite direction The strange cough sounded again SAY Penrod quavered What IS that Then both boys uttered smothered exclamations and jumped for the long gaunt head that appeared in the doorway was entirely unexpected It was the cavernous and melancholy head of an incredibly thin old whitish horse This head waggled slowly from side to side the nostrils vibrated the mouth opened and the hollow cough sounded again Recovering themselves Penrod and Sam underwent the customary human reaction from alarm to indignation What you want you ole horse you Penrod shouted Don t you come coughin around ME And Sam seizing a stick hurled it at the intruder Get out o here he roared The aged horse nervously withdrew his head turned tail and made a rickety flight up the alley while Sam and Penrod perfectly obedient to inherited impulse ran out into the drizzle and uproariously pursued They were but automatons of instinct meaning no evil Certainly they did not know the singular and pathetic history of the old horse who wandered into the alley and ventured to look through the open door This horse about twice the age of either Penrod or Sam had lived to find himself in a unique position He was nude possessing neither harness nor halter all he had was a name Whitey and he would have answered to it by a slight change of expression if any one had thus properly addressed him So forlorn was Whitey s case he was actually an independent horse he had not even an owner For two days and a half he had been his own master Previous to that period he had been the property of one Abalene Morris a person of colour who would have explained himself as engaged in the hauling business On the contrary the hauling business was an insignificant side line with mister Morris for he had long ago given himself as utterly as fortune permitted to the talent that early in youth he had recognized as the greatest of all those surging in his bosom In his waking thoughts and in his dreams in health and in sickness Abalene Morris was the dashing and emotional practitioner of an art probably more than Roman in antiquity Abalene was a crap shooter The hauling business was a disguise A concentration of events had brought it about that at one and the same time Abalene after a dazzling run of the dice found the hauling business an actual danger to the preservation of his liberty He won seventeen dollars and sixty cents and within the hour found himself in trouble with an officer of the Humane Society on account of an altercation with Whitey Abalene had been offered four dollars for Whitey some ten days earlier wherefore he at once drove to the shop of the junk dealer who had made the offer and announced his acquiescence in the sacrifice No suh the junk dealer said with emphasis I awready done got me a good mule fer my deliv ry hoss n at ole Whitey hoss ain wuff no fo dollah nohow I uz a fool when I talk bout th owin money roun that a way I know what YOU up to Abalene Man come by here li l bit ago tole me all bout white man try to rest you ovah on the avvynoo Yessuh he say white man goin to git you yit an th ow you in jail count o Whitey White man tryin to fine out who you IS He say nemmine he ll know Whitey ag in even if he don know you He say he ketch you by the hoss so you come roun tryin fix me up with Whitey so white man grab me th ow ME in at jail G on way f um hyuh you Abalene You cain sell an you cain give Whitey to no cullud man n is town You go an drowned at ole hoss cause you sutny goin to jail if you git ketched drivin him The substance of this advice seemed good to Abalene especially as the seventeen dollars and sixty cents in his pocket lent sweet colours to life out of jail at this time At dusk he led Whitey to a broad common at the edge of town and spoke to him finally G on bout you biz nis said Abalene you ain MY hoss Don look roun at me cause I ain t got no quaintance wif you I m a man o money an I got my own frien s I m a lookin fer bigger cities hoss You got you biz nis an I got mine Mista Hoss good night Whitey found a little frosted grass upon the common and remained there all night In the morning he sought the shed where Abalene had kept him but that was across the large and busy town and Whitey was hopelessly lost He had but one eye a feeble one and his legs were not to be depended upon but he managed to cover a great deal of ground to have many painful little adventures and to get monstrously hungry and thirsty before he happened to look in upon Penrod and Sam When the two boys chased him up the alley they had no intention to cause pain they had no intention at all They were no more cruel than Duke Penrod s little old dog who followed his own instincts and making his appearance hastily through a hole in the back fence joined the pursuit with sound and fury A boy will nearly always run after anything that is running and his first impulse is to throw a stone at it This is a survival of primeval man who must take every chance to get his dinner So when Penrod and Sam drove the hapless Whitey up the alley they were really responding to an impulse thousands and thousands of years old an impulse founded upon the primordial observation that whatever runs is likely to prove edible Penrod and Sam were not bad they were never that They were something that was not their fault they were historic At the next corner Whitey turned to the right into the cross street thence turning to the right again and still warmly pursued he zigzagged down a main thoroughfare until he reached another cross street which ran alongside the Schofields yard and brought him to the foot of the alley he had left behind in his flight He entered the alley and there his dim eye fell upon the open door he had previously investigated No memory of it remained but the place had a look associated in his mind with hay and as Sam and Penrod turned the corner of the alley in panting yet still vociferous pursuit Whitey stumbled up the inclined platform before the open doors staggered thunderously across the carriage house and through another open door into a stall an apartment vacant since the occupancy of mister Schofield s last horse now several years deceased CHAPTER VIII SALVAGE 
3744-178590-0000	train-other-500	The two boys shrieked with excitement as they beheld the coincidence of this strange return They burst into the stable making almost as much noise as Duke who had become frantic at the invasion Sam laid hands upon a rake You get out o there you ole horse you he bellowed

3744-178590-0003	train-other-500	was so impressed that he prostrated himself in silence and then unobtrusively withdrew from the stable Penrod ran to the alley doors and closed them My gracious Sam protested What you goin to do
3744-178590-0004	train-other-500	I m goin to keep this horse said Penrod whose face showed the strain of a great idea What FOR For the reward

3744-178590-0005	train-other-500	My gracious he said I never thought o that How how much do you think we ll get Penrod Sam s thus admitting himself to a full partnership in the enterprise met no objection from Penrod
3744-178590-0006	train-other-500	who was absorbed in the contemplation of Whitey Well he said judicially we might get more and we might get less Sam rose and joined his friend in the doorway opening upon the two stalls Whitey had preempted the nearer

3744-178590-0008	train-other-500	He recognized it as a symbol of the non committal attitude that makes people looked up to

3744-178590-0010	train-other-500	Well said Penrod we might get more and we might get less This time however he felt the need of adding something He put a question in an indulgent tone as though he were inquiring
3744-178590-0011	train-other-500	not to add to his own information but to discover the extent of Sam s How much do you think horses are worth anyway I don t know Sam said frankly and unconsciously he added They might be more and they might be less Well
3744-178590-0012	train-other-500	when our ole horse died Penrod said Papa said he wouldn t taken five hunderd dollars for him That s how much HORSES are worth My gracious Sam exclaimed Then he had a practical afterthought But maybe he was a better horse than this n
3744-178590-0013	train-other-500	What colour was he He was bay Looky here Sam and now Penrod s manner changed from the superior to the eager you look what kind of horses they have in a circus and you bet a circus has the BEST horses don t it
3744-178590-0014	train-other-500	Well what kind of horses do they have in a circus They have some black and white ones but the best they have are white all over Well what kind of a horse is this we got here He s perty near white right now and I bet if we washed him off and got him fixed up nice he WOULD be white
3744-178590-0015	train-other-500	Well a bay horse is worth five hunderd dollars because that s what Papa said
none	none	 and this horse Sam interrupted rather timidly He he s awful bony Penrod You don t guess they d make any 
3744-178590-0016	train-other-500	Penrod laughed contemptuously Bony All he needs is a little food and he ll fill right up and look good as ever You don t know much about horses Sam I expect Why OUR ole horse Do you expect he s hungry now asked Sam staring at Whitey
3744-178590-0017	train-other-500	Let s try him said Penrod Horses like hay and oats the best but they ll eat most anything I guess they will
none	none	 He s tryin to eat that manger up right now 
3744-178590-0018	train-other-500	and I bet it ain t good for him Come on said Penrod closing the door that gave entrance to the stalls We got to get this horse some drinkin water and some good food They tried Whitey s appetite first with an autumnal branch that they wrenched from a hardy maple in the yard
3744-178590-0019	train-other-500	They had seen horses nibble leaves and they expected Whitey to nibble the leaves of this branch but his ravenous condition did not allow him time for cool discriminations Sam poked the branch at him from the passageway and Whitey after one backward movement of alarm seized it venomously
3744-178590-0020	train-other-500	Here You stop that Sam shouted You stop that you ole horse you What s the matter called Penrod from the hydrant where he was filling a bucket What s he doin now Doin He s eatin the wood part too
none	none	 He s chewin up sticks as big as baseball bats He s crazy 
3744-178590-0021	train-other-500	Penrod rushed to see this sight and stood aghast Take it away from him Sam he commanded sharply Go on take it away from him yourself was the prompt retort of his comrade You had no biz nuss to give it to him said Penrod
3744-178590-0022	train-other-500	Anybody with any sense ought to know it d make him sick What d you want to go and give it to him for Well you didn t say not to Well what if I didn t I never said I did did I You go on in that stall and take it away from him
3744-178590-0023	train-other-500	YES I will Sam returned bitterly Then as Whitey had dragged the remains of the branch from the manger to the floor of the stall Sam scrambled to the top of the manger and looked over There ain t much left to TAKE away He s swallered it all except some splinters
3744-178590-0024	train-other-500	Better give him the water to try and wash it down with And as Penrod complied My gracious look at that horse DRINK They gave Whitey four buckets of water
none	none	 and then debated the question of nourishment 
3744-178590-0025	train-other-500	Obviously this horse could not be trusted with branches and after getting their knees black and their backs sodden they gave up trying to pull enough grass to sustain him Then Penrod remembered that horses like apples both cooking apples and eating apples
3744-178590-0026	train-other-500	and Sam mentioned the fact that every autumn his father received a barrel of cooking apples from a cousin who owned a farm That barrel was in the Williams cellar now and the cellar was providentially supplied with outside doors so that it could be visited without going through the house
3744-178590-0027	train-other-500	Sam and Penrod set forth for the cellar They returned to the stable bulging
none	none	 and after a discussion of Whitey s digestion 
3744-178590-0028	train-other-500	Sam claiming that eating the core and seeds as Whitey did would grow trees in his inside they went back to the cellar for supplies again and again They made six trips carrying each time a capacity cargo of apples and still Whitey ate in a famished manner
3744-178590-0029	train-other-500	They were afraid to take more apples from the barrel which began to show conspicuously the result of their raids wherefore Penrod made an unostentatious visit to the cellar of his own house From the inside he opened a window and passed vegetables out to Sam
3744-178590-0030	train-other-500	who placed them in a bucket and carried them hurriedly to the stable while Penrod returned in a casual manner through the house Of his sang froid under a great strain it is sufficient to relate that in the kitchen he said suddenly to Della the cook Oh look behind you
3744-178590-0031	train-other-500	and by the time Della discovered that there was nothing unusual behind her Penrod was gone and a loaf of bread from the kitchen table was gone with him Whitey now ate nine turnips two heads of lettuce one cabbage eleven raw potatoes and the loaf of bread
3744-178590-0032	train-other-500	He ate the loaf of bread last and he was a long time about it so the boys came to a not unreasonable conclusion Well sir I guess we got him filled up at last said Penrod I bet he wouldn t eat a saucer of ice cream now if we d give it to him He looks better to me
3744-178590-0033	train-other-500	said Sam staring critically at Whitey I think he s kind of begun to fill out some I expect he must like us Penrod we been doin a good deal for this horse Well we got to keep it up Penrod insisted rather pompously
3744-178590-0034	train-other-500	Long as I got charge o this horse he s goin to get good treatment What we better do now Penrod Penrod took on the outward signs of deep thought Well there s plenty to DO all right I got to think
3744-178590-0035	train-other-500	Sam made several suggestions which Penrod maintaining his air of preoccupation dismissed with mere gestures
none	none	 Oh I know Sam cried finally We ought to wash him so s he ll look whiter n what he does now 
3744-178590-0036	train-other-500	We can turn the hose on him across the manger No not yet Penrod said It s too soon after his meal You ought to know that yourself
none	none	 What we got to do is to make up a bed for him if he wants to lay down or anything Make up a what for him 
3744-178590-0037	train-other-500	Sam echoed dumfounded What you talkin about How can Sawdust Penrod said That s the way the horse we used to have used to have it We ll make this horse s bed in the other stall and then he can go in there and lay down whenever he wants to How we goin to do it
3744-178590-0038	train-other-500	Look Sam there s the hole into the sawdust box All you got to do is walk in there with the shovel stick the shovel in the hole till it gets full of sawdust and then sprinkle it around on the empty stall All I got to do Sam cried
3744-178590-0039	train-other-500	What are you goin to do I m goin to be right here Penrod answered reassuringly He won t kick or anything
none	none	 and it isn t goin to take you half a second to slip around behind him to the other stall 
3744-178590-0040	train-other-500	What makes you think he won t kick Well I KNOW he won t and besides you could hit him with the shovel if he tried to
none	none	 Anyhow I ll be right here won t I 
3744-178590-0041	train-other-500	I don t care where you are Sam said earnestly
none	none	 What difference would that make if he ki Why you were goin right in the stall Penrod reminded him 
3744-178590-0042	train-other-500	When he first came in you were goin to take the rake and I don t care if I was Sam declared I was excited then Well you can get excited now can t you his friend urged You can just as easy get He was interrupted by a shout from Sam
none	none	 who was keeping his eye upon Whitey throughout the discussion Look Looky there And undoubtedly renewing his excitement 
3744-178590-0043	train-other-500	Sam pointed at the long gaunt head beyond the manger It was disappearing from view Look Sam shouted He s layin down Well then said Penrod I guess he s goin to take a nap If he wants to lay down without waitin for us to get the sawdust fixed for him
3744-178590-0044	train-other-500	that s his lookout not ours On the contrary Sam perceived a favourable opportunity for action I just as soon go and make his bed up while he s layin down he volunteered You climb up on the manger and watch him Penrod
3744-178590-0045	train-other-500	and I ll sneak in the other stall and fix it all up nice for him so s he can go in there any time when he wakes up and lay down again or anything and if he starts to get up you holler and I ll jump out over the other manger
3744-178590-0046	train-other-500	Accordingly Penrod established himself in a position to observe the recumbent figure Whitey s breathing was rather laboured but regular and as Sam remarked he looked better even in his slumber
3744-178590-0047	train-other-500	It is not to be doubted that although Whitey was suffering from a light attack of colic his feelings were in the main those of contentment After trouble he was solaced after exposure he was sheltered after hunger and thirst he was fed and watered
3744-178590-0048	train-other-500	He slept The noon whistles blew before Sam s task was finished but by the time he departed for lunch there was made a bed of such quality
none	none	 that Whitey must needs have been a born fault finder if he complained of it 
3744-178590-0049	train-other-500	The friends parted each urging the other to be prompt in returning
none	none	 but Penrod got into threatening difficulties as soon as he entered the house CHAPTER IX REWARD OF MERIT Penrod said his mother what did you do with that loaf of bread Della says you took from the table Ma am WHAT loaf o bread I believe I can t let you go outdoors this afternoon missus Schofield said severely If you were hungry you know perfectly well all you had to do was to But I wasn t hungry I You can explain later missus Schofield said You ll have all afternoon Penrod s heart grew cold I CAN T stay in he protested I ve asked Sam Williams to come over I ll telephone missus Williams Mamma Penrod s voice became agonized I HAD to give that bread to a to a poor ole man He was starving and so were his children and his wife They were all just STARVING and they couldn t wait while I took time to come and ask you Mamma I got to GO outdoors this afternoon I GOT to Sam s She relented In the carriage house half an hour later Penrod gave an account of the episode Where d we been I d just like to know he concluded if I hadn t got out here this afternoon Well I guess I could managed him all right Sam said I was in the passageway a minute ago takin a look at him He s standin up again I expect he wants more to eat Well we got to fix about that said Penrod But what I mean if I d had to stay in the house where would we been about the most important thing in the whole biz nuss What you talkin about Well why can t you wait till I tell you Penrod s tone had become peevish For that matter so had Sam s they were developing one of the little differences or quarrels that composed the very texture of their friendship Well why don t you tell me then Well how can I Penrod demanded You keep talkin every minute I m not talkin NOW am I Sam protested You can tell me NOW can t you I m not talk You are too Penrod shouted You talk all the time You He was interrupted by Whitey s peculiar cough Both boys jumped and forgot their argument He means he wants some more to eat I bet said Sam Well if he does he s got to wait Penrod declared We got to get the most important thing of all fixed up first What s that Penrod The reward said Penrod mildly That s what I was tryin to tell you about Sam if you d ever give me half a chance Well I DID give you a chance I kept TELLIN you to tell me but You never You kept sayin They renewed this discussion protracting it indefinitely but as each persisted in clinging to his own interpretation of the facts the question still remains unsettled It was abandoned or rather it merged into another during the later stages of the debate this other being concerned with which of the debaters had the least sense Each made the plain statement that if he were more deficient than his opponent in that regard self destruction would be his only refuge Each declared that he would rather die than be talked to death and then as the two approached a point bluntly recriminative Whitey coughed again whereupon they were miraculously silent and went into the passageway in a perfectly amiable manner I got to have a good look at him for once Penrod said as he stared frowningly at Whitey We got to fix up about that reward I want to take a good ole look at him myself Sam said After supplying Whitey with another bucket of water they returned to the carriage house and seated themselves thoughtfully In truth they were something a shade more than thoughtful the adventure to which they had committed themselves was beginning to be a little overpowering If Whitey had been a dog a goat a fowl or even a stray calf they would have felt equal to him but now that the earlier glow of their wild daring had disappeared vague apprehensions stirred Their good look at Whitey had not reassured them he seemed large Gothic and unusual Whisperings within them began to urge that for boys to undertake an enterprise connected with so huge an animal as an actual horse was perilous Beneath the surface of their musings dim but ominous prophecies moved both boys began to have the feeling that somehow this affair was going to get beyond them and that they would be in heavy trouble before it was over they knew not why They knew why no more than they knew why they felt it imperative to keep the fact of Whitey s presence in the stable a secret from their respective families but they did begin to realize that keeping a secret of that size was going to be attended with some difficulty In brief their sensations were becoming comparable to those of the man who stole a house Nevertheless after a short period given to unspoken misgivings they returned to the subject of the reward The money value of bay horses as compared to white was again discussed and each announced his certainty that nothing less than a good ole hunderd dollars would be offered for the return of Whitey But immediately after so speaking they fell into another silence due to sinking feelings They had spoken loudly and confidently and yet they knew somehow that such things were not to be According to their knowledge it was perfectly reasonable to suppose that they would receive this fortune but they frightened themselves in speaking of it They knew that they COULD not have a hundred dollars for their own An oppression as from something awful and criminal descended upon them at intervals Presently however they were warmed to a little cheerfulness again by Penrod s suggestion that they should put a notice in the paper Neither of them had the slightest idea how to get it there but such details as that were beyond the horizon they occupied themselves with the question of what their advertisement ought to say Finding that they differed irreconcilably Penrod went to his cache in the sawdust box and brought two pencils and a supply of paper He gave one of the pencils and several sheets to Sam then both boys bent themselves in silence to the labour of practical composition Penrod produced the briefer paragraph See Fig I Sam s was more ample See Fig II Transcribed from handwritten illustration for Project Gutenberg FIG I Reward White horse in Schofields ally finders got him in Schofields stable and will let him taken away by by crossed out pay

Sam nor Penrod showed any interest in what the other had written but both felt that something praiseworthy had been accomplished Penrod exhaled a sigh as of relief and in a manner he had observed his father use sometimes he said Thank goodness THAT S off my mind anyway What we goin do next Penrod Sam asked deferentially the borrowed manner having some effect upon him I don t know what YOU RE goin to do Penrod returned picking up the old cigarbox that had contained the paper and pencils I M goin to put mine in here so s it ll come in handy when I haf to get at it Well I guess I ll keep mine there too Sam said Thereupon he deposited his scribbled slip beside Penrod s in the cigarbox and the box was solemnly returned to the secret place whence it had been taken There THAT S tended to Sam said and unconsciously imitating his friend s imitation he gave forth audibly a breath of satisfaction and relief Both boys felt that the financial side of their great affair had been conscientiously looked to that the question of the reward was settled and that everything was proceeding in a businesslike manner Therefore they were able to turn their attention to another matter This was the question of Whitey s next meal After their exploits of the morning and the consequent imperilment of Penrod they decided that nothing more was to be done in apples vegetables or bread it was evident that Whitey must be fed from the bosom of nature We couldn t pull enough o that frostbit ole grass in the yard to feed him Penrod said gloomily We could work a week and not get enough to make him swaller more n about twice All we got this morning he blew most of it away He d try to scoop it in toward his teeth with his lip and then he d haf to kind of blow out his breath and after that all the grass that d be left was just some wet pieces stickin to the outsides of his face Well and you know how he acted about that maple branch We can t trust him with branches Sam jumped up I know he cried There s lots of leaves left on the branches We can give them to him I just said I don t mean the branches Sam explained We ll leave the branches on the trees but just pull the leaves off the branches and put em in the bucket and feed em to him out of the bucket Penrod thought this plan worth trying and for three quarters of an hour the two boys were busy with the lower branches of various trees in the yard Thus they managed to supply Whitey with a fair quantity of wet leaves which he ate in a perfunctory way displaying little of his earlier enthusiasm And the work of his purveyors might have been more tedious if it had been less damp for a boy is seldom bored by anything that involves his staying out in the rain without protection The drizzle had thickened the leaves were heavy with water and at every jerk the branches sent fat drops over the two collectors They attained a noteworthy state of sogginess Finally they were brought to the attention of the authorities indoors and Della appeared upon the back porch Musther Penrod she called y r mamma says ye ll c m in the house this minute an change y r shoes an stockin s an everythun else ye got on D ye hear me Penrod taken by surprise and unpleasantly alarmed darted away from the tree he was depleting and ran for the stable You tell her I m dry as toast he shouted over his shoulder Della withdrew wearing the air of a person gratuitously insulted and a moment later she issued from the kitchen carrying an umbrella She opened it and walked resolutely to the stable She says I m to bring ye in the house said Della an I m goin to bring ye Sam had joined Penrod in the carriage house and with the beginnings of an unnamed terror the two beheld this grim advance But they did not stay for its culmination Without a word to each other they hurriedly tiptoed up the stairs to the gloomy loft and there they paused listening They heard Della s steps upon the carriage house floor Ah there s plenty places t hide in they heard her say but I ll show ye She tole me to bring ye and I m She was interrupted by a peculiar sound loud chilling dismal and unmistakably not of human origin The boys knew it for Whitey s cough but Della had not their experience A smothered shriek reached their ears there was a scurrying noise and then with horror they heard Della s footsteps in the passageway that ran by Whitey s manger Immediately there came a louder shriek and even in the anguish of knowing their secret discovered they were shocked to hear distinctly the words O Lard in hivvin in the well known voice of Della She shrieked again and they heard the rush of her footfalls across the carriage house floor Wild words came from the outer air and the kitchen door slammed violently It was all over She had gone to tell Penrod and Sam plunged down the stairs and out of the stable They climbed the back fence and fled up the alley They turned into Sam s yard and without consultation headed for the cellar doors nor paused till they found themselves in the farthest darkest and gloomiest recess of the cellar There perspiring stricken with fear they sank down upon the earthen floor with their moist backs against the stone wall Thus with boys The vague apprehensions that had been creeping upon Penrod and Sam all afternoon had become monstrous the unknown was before them How great their crime would turn out to be now that it was in the hands of grown people they did not know but since it concerned a horse it would undoubtedly be considered of terrible dimensions Their plans for a reward and all the things that had seemed both innocent and practical in the morning now staggered their minds as manifestations of criminal folly A new and terrible light seemed to play upon the day s exploits they had chased a horse belonging to strangers and it would be said that they deliberately drove him into the stable and there concealed him They had in truth virtually stolen him and they had stolen food for him The waning light through the small window above them warned Penrod that his inroads upon the vegetables in his own cellar must soon be discovered Della that Nemesis would seek them in order to prepare them for dinner and she would find them not But she would recall his excursion to the cellar for she had seen him when he came up and also the truth would be known concerning the loaf of bread Altogether Penrod felt that his case was worse than Sam s until Sam offered a suggestion that roused such horrible possibilities concerning the principal item of their offense that all thought of the smaller indictments disappeared Listen Penrod Sam quavered What what if that what if that ole horse maybe b longed to a policeman Sam s imagination was not of the comforting kind What d they do to us Penrod if it turned out he was some policeman s horse Penrod was able only to shake his head He did not reply in words but both boys thenceforth considered it almost inevitable that Whitey had belonged to a policeman and in their sense of so ultimate a disaster they ceased for a time to brood upon what their parents would probably do to them The penalty for stealing a policeman s horse would be only a step short of capital they were sure They would not be hanged but vague looming sketches of something called the penitentiary began to flicker before them It grew darker in the cellar so that finally they could not see each other I guess they re huntin for us by now Sam said huskily I don t I don t like it much down here Penrod Penrod s hoarse whisper came from the profound gloom Well who ever said you did Well Sam paused then he said plaintively I wish we d never SEEN that dern ole horse It was every bit his fault said Penrod We didn t do anything If he hadn t come stickin his ole head in our stable it d never happened at all Ole fool He rose I m goin to get out of here I guess I ve stood about enough for one day Where where you goin Penrod You aren t goin HOME are you No I m not What you take me for You think I m crazy Well where CAN we go How far Penrod s desperation actually would have led him is doubtful but he made this statement I don t know where YOU RE goin but I M goin to walk straight out in the country till I come to a farmhouse and say my name s George and live there I ll do it too Sam whispered eagerly I ll say my name s Henry Well we better get started said the executive Penrod We got to get away from here anyway But when they came to ascend the steps leading to the outside doors they found that those doors had been closed and locked for the night It s no use Sam lamented and we can t bust em cause I tried to once before Fanny always locks em about five o clock I forgot We got to go up the stairway and try to sneak out through the house They tiptoed back and up the inner stairs They paused at the top then breathlessly stepped out into a hall that was entirely dark Sam touched Penrod s sleeve in warning and bent to listen at a door Immediately that door opened revealing the bright library where sat Penrod s mother and Sam s father It was Sam s mother who had opened the door Come into the library boys she said missus Schofield is just telling us about it And as the two comrades moved dumbly into the lighted room Penrod s mother rose and taking him by the shoulder urged him close to the fire You stand there and try to dry off a little while I finish telling mister and missus Williams about you and Sam she said You d better make Sam keep near the fire too missus Williams because they both got wringing wet Think of their running off just when most people would have wanted to stay Well I ll go on with the story then Della told me all about it and what the cook next door said SHE D seen how they d been trying to pull grass and leaves for the poor old thing all day and all about the apples they carried from YOUR cellar and getting wet and working in the rain as hard as they could and they d given him a loaf of bread Shame on you Penrod She paused to laugh but there was a little moisture about her eyes even before she laughed And they d fed him on potatoes and lettuce and cabbage and turnips out of OUR cellar And I wish you d see the sawdust bed they made for him Well when I d telephoned and the Humane Society man got there he said it was the most touching thing he ever knew It seems he KNEW this horse and had been looking for him He said ninety nine boys out of a hundred would have chased the poor old thing away and he was going to see to it that this case didn t go unnoticed because the local branch of the society gives little silver medals for special acts like this And the last thing he said was that he was sure Penrod and Sam each would be awarded one at the meeting of the society next Thursday night On the following Saturday a yodel sounded from the sunny sidewalk in front of the Schofields house and Penrod issuing forth beheld the familiar figure of Samuel Williams waiting Upon Sam s breast there glittered a round bit of silver suspended by a white ribbon from a bar of the same metal Upon the breast of Penrod was a decoration precisely similar Lo Penrod said Sam What are you goin to do Nothin I got mine on said Sam I have too said Penrod I wouldn t take a hunderd dollars for mine I wouldn t take two hunderd for mine said Sam Each glanced pleasantly at the other s medal They faced each other without shame Neither had the slightest sense of hypocrisy in himself or in his comrade On the contrary Penrod s eyes went from Sam s medal back to his own thence they wandered with perhaps a little disappointment to the lifeless street and to the empty yards and spectatorless windows of the neighbourhood Then he looked southward toward the busy heart of the town where multitudes were Let s go down and see what time it is by the court house clock said Penrod CHAPTER X CONSCIENCE missus Schofield had been away for three days visiting her sister in Dayton Illinois and on the train coming back she fell into a reverie Little dramas of memory were reenacted in her pensive mind and through all of them moved the figure of Penrod as a principal figure or star These little dramas did not present Penrod as he really was much less did they glow with the uncertain but glamorous light in which Penrod saw himself No missus Schofield had indulged herself in absence from her family merely for her own pleasure and now that she was homeward bound her conscience was asserting itself the fact that she had enjoyed her visit began to take on the aspect of a crime She had heard from her family only once during the three days the message All well don t worry enjoy yourself telegraphed by mister Schofield and she had followed his suggestions to a reasonable extent Of course she had worried but only at times wherefore she now suffered more and more poignant pangs of shame because she had not worried constantly Naturally the figure of Penrod in her railway reverie was that of an invalid She recalled all the illnesses of his babyhood and all those of his boyhood She reconstructed scene after scene with the hero always prostrate and the family physician opening the black case of phials She emphatically renewed her recollection of accidental misfortunes to the body of Penrod Schofield omitting neither the considerable nor the inconsiderable forgetting no strain sprain cut bruise or dislocation of which she had knowledge And running this film in a sequence unrelieved by brighter interludes she produced a biographical picture of such consistent and unremittent gloom that Penrod s past appeared to justify disturbing thoughts about his present and future She became less and less at ease reproaching herself for having gone away wondering how she had brought herself to do such a crazy thing for it seemed to her that the members of her family were almost helpless without her guidance they were apt to do anything anything at all or to catch anything The more she thought about her having left these irresponsible harebrains unprotected and undirected for three days the less she was able to account for her action It seemed to her that she must have been a little flighty but shaking her head grimly she decided that flightiness was not a good excuse And she made up her mind that if upon her arrival she found poor little neglected Penrod and Margaret and mister Schofield spared to her safe and sound she would make up to them especially to Penrod for all her lack of care in the past and for this present wild folly of spending three whole days and nights with her sister far away in Dayton Illinois Consequently when missus Schofield descended from that train she wore the hurried but determined expression that was always the effect upon her of a guilty conscience You re SURE Penrod is well now she repeated after mister Schofield had seated himself at her side in a vehicle known to its driver as a deepoe hack Well NOW he said He s been well all the time I ve told you twice that he s all right Men can t always see She shook her head impatiently I haven t been a bit sure he was well lately I don t think he s been really well for two or three months How has he seemed to day In fair health mister Schofield replied thoughtfully Della called me up at the office to tell me that one of the telephone men had come into the house to say that if that durn boy didn t quit climbing their poles they d have him arrested They said he That s it missus Schofield interrupted quickly He s nervous It s some nervous trouble makes him act like that He s not like himself at all Sometimes mister Schofield said I wish he weren t When he s himself missus Schofield went on anxiously he s very quiet and good he doesn t go climbing telegraph poles and reckless things like that And I noticed before I went away that he was growing twitchy and seemed to be getting the habit of making unpleasant little noises in his throat Don t fret about that her husband said He was trying to learn Sam Williams s imitation of a bullfrog s croak I used to do that myself when I was a boy Gl glump gallump No I can t do it now But nearly all boys feel obliged to learn it You re entirely mistaken Henry she returned a little sharply That isn t the way he goes in his throat Penrod is getting to be a VERY nervous boy and he makes noises because he can t help it He works part of his face too sometimes so much that I ve been afraid it would interfere with his looks Interfere with his what For the moment mister Schofield seemed to be dazed When he s himself she returned crisply he s quite a handsome boy He is Handsomer than the average anyhow missus Schofield said firmly No wonder you don t see it when we ve let his system get all run down like this Good heavens the mystified mister Schofield murmured Penrod s system hasn t been running down it s just the same as it always was He s absolutely all right Indeed he is not she said severely We ve got to take better care of him than we have been Why how could I know what I m talking about she interrupted Penrod is anything but a strong boy and it s all our fault We haven t been watchful enough of his health that s what s the matter with him and makes him so nervous Thus she continued and as she talked on mister Schofield began by imperceptible processes to adopt her views As for missus Schofield herself these views became substantial by becoming vocal This is to say with all deference that as soon as she heard herself stating them she was convinced that they accurately represented facts And the determined look in her eyes deepened when the deepoe hack turned the familiar corner and she saw Penrod running to the gate followed by Duke Never had Penrod been so glad to greet his mother Never was he more boisterous in the expression of happiness of that kind And the tokens of his appetite at dinner a little later were extraordinary mister Schofield began to feel reassured in spite of himself but missus Schofield shook her head Don t you see It s abnormal she said in a low decisive voice That night Penrod awoke from a sweet conscienceless slumber or rather he was awakened A wrappered form lurked over him in the gloom Uff ow he muttered and turned his face from the dim light that shone through the doorway He sighed and sought the depths of sleep again Penrod his mother said softly and while he resisted feebly she turned him over to face her Gawn lea me lone he muttered Then as a little sphere touched his lips he jerked his head away startled Whassat missus Schofield replied in tones honeysweet and coaxing It s just a nice little pill Penrod Doe waw ny he protested keeping his eyes shut clinging to the sleep from which he was being riven Be a good boy Penrod she whispered Here s a glass of nice cool water to swallow it down with Come dear it s going to do you lots of good And again the little pill was placed suggestively against his lips but his head jerked backward and his hand struck out in blind instinctive self defense I ll BUST that ole pill he muttered still with closed eyes Lemme get my han s on it an I will Penrod PLEASE go on away mamma I will just as soon as you take this little pill I DID No dear I did Penrod insisted plaintively You made me take it just before I went to bed Oh yes THAT one But dearie missus Schofield explained I got to thinking about it after I went to bed and I decided you d better have another I don t WANT another Yes dearie Please go way and let me sleep Not till you ve taken the little pill dear Oh GOLLY Groaning he propped himself upon an elbow and allowed the pill to pass between his lips He would have allowed anything whatever to pass between them if that passing permitted his return to slumber Then detaining the pill in his mouth he swallowed half a glass of water and again was recumbent G night Mamma Good night dearie Sleep well Yes m After her departure Penrod drowsily enjoyed the sugar coating of the pill but this was indeed a brief pleasure A bitterness that was like a pang suddenly made itself known to his sense of taste and he realized that he had dallied too confidingly with the product of a manufacturing chemist who should have been indicted for criminal economy The medicinal portion of the little pill struck the wall with a faint tap then dropped noiselessly to the floor and after a time Penrod slept Some hours later he began to dream he dreamed that his feet and legs were becoming uncomfortable as a result of Sam Williams s activities with a red hot poker You QUIT that he said aloud and awoke indignantly Again a dark wrappered figure hovered over the bed It s only a hot water bag dear missus Schofield said still labouring under the covers with an extended arm You mustn t hunch yourself up that way Penrod Put your feet down on it And as he continued to hunch himself she moved the bag in the direction of his withdrawal Ow murder he exclaimed convulsively What you tryin to do Scald me to death Penrod My goodness Mamma he wailed can t you let me sleep a MINUTE It s very bad for you to let your feet get cold dear They WEREN T cold I don t want any ole hot wat Penrod she said firmly you must put your feet against the bag It isn t too hot Oh isn t it he retorted I don t s pose you d care if I burned my feet right off Mamma won t you please pul LEEZE let me get some sleep Not till you She was interrupted by a groan that seemed to come from an abyss All right I ll do it Let em burn then Thus spake the desperate Penrod and missus Schofield was able to ascertain that one heel had been placed in light contact with the bag No both feet Penrod With a tragic shiver he obeyed THAT S right dear Now keep them that way It s good for you Good night G night The door closed softly behind her and the body of Penrod from the hips upward rose invisibly in the complete darkness of the bedchamber A moment later the hot water bag reached the floor in as noiseless a manner as that previously adopted by the remains of the little pill and Penrod once more bespread his soul with poppies This time he slept until the breakfast bell rang He was late to school and at once found himself in difficulties Government demanded an explanation of the tardiness but Penrod made no reply of any kind Taciturnity is seldom more strikingly out of place than under such circumstances and the penalties imposed took account not only of Penrod s tardiness but of his supposititious defiance of authority in declining to speak The truth was that Penrod did not know why he was tardy and with mind still lethargic found it impossible to think of an excuse his continuing silence being due merely to the persistence of his efforts to invent one Thus were his meek searchings misinterpreted and the unloved hours of improvement in science and the arts made odious They ll SEE he whispered sorely to himself as he bent low over his desk a little later Some day he would show em The picture in his mind was of a vast vague assembly of people headed by Miss Spence and the superior pupils who were never tardy and these multitudes representing persecution and government in general were all cringing before a Penrod Schofield who rode a grim black horse up and down their miserable ranks and gave curt orders Make em step back there he commanded his myrmidons savagely Fix it so s your horses ll step on their feet if they don t do what I say Then from his shining saddle he watched the throngs slinking away I guess they know who I am NOW CHAPTER XI THE TONIC These broodings helped a little but it was a severe morning and on his way home at noon he did not recover heart enough to practice the bullfrog s croak the craft that Sam Williams had lately mastered to inspiring perfection This sonorous accomplishment Penrod had determined to make his own At once guttural and resonant impudent yet plaintive with a barbaric twang like the plucked string of a Congo war fiddle the sound had fascinated him It is made in the throat by processes utterly impossible to describe in human words and no alphabet as yet produced by civilized man affords the symbols to vocalize it to the ear of imagination Gunk is the poor makeshift that must be employed to indicate it Penrod uttered one half hearted Gunk as he turned in at his own gate However this stimulated him and he paused to practice Gunk he croaked Gunk gunk gunk gunk missus Schofield leaned out of an open window upstairs Don t do that Penrod she said anxiously Please don t do that Why not Penrod asked and feeling encouraged by his progress in the new art he continued Gunk gunk gunk Gunk gunk Please try not to do it she urged pleadingly You CAN stop it if you try Won t you dear But Penrod felt that he was almost upon the point of attaining a mastery equal to Sam Williams s He had just managed to do something in his throat that he had never done before and he felt that unless he kept on doing it at this time his new born facility might evade him later Gunk he croaked Gunk gunk gunk And he continued to croak persevering monotonously his expression indicating the depth of his preoccupation His mother looked down solicitously murmured in a melancholy undertone shook her head then disappeared from the window and after a moment or two opened the front door Come in dear she said I ve got something for you Penrod s look of preoccupation vanished he brightened and ceased to croak His mother had already given him a small leather pocketbook with a nickel in it as a souvenir of her journey Evidently she had brought another gift as well delaying its presentation until now I ve got something for you These were auspicious words What is it Mamma he asked and as she smiled tenderly upon him his gayety increased Yay he shouted Mamma is it that reg lar carpenter s tool chest I told you about No she said But I ll show you Penrod Come on dear He followed her with alacrity to the dining room and the bright anticipation in his eyes grew more brilliant until she opened the door of the china closet simultaneously with that action announcing cheerily It s something that s going to do you lots of good Penrod He was instantly chilled for experience had taught him that when predictions of this character were made nothing pleasant need be expected Two seconds later his last hope departed as she turned from the closet and he beheld in her hands a quart bottle containing what appeared to be a section of grassy swamp immersed in a cloudy brown liquor He stepped back grave suspicion in his glance What IS that he asked in a hard voice missus Schofield smiled upon him It s nothing she said That is it s nothing you ll mind at all It s just so you won t be so nervous I m not nervous You don t think so of course dear she returned and as she spoke she poured some of the brown liquor into a tablespoon People often can t tell when they re nervous themselves but your Papa and I have been getting a little anxious about you dear and so I got this medicine for you WHERE D you get it he demanded missus Schofield set the bottle down and moved toward him insinuatingly extending the full tablespoon Here dear she said just take this little spoonful like a goo I want to know where it came from he insisted darkly again stepping backward Where she echoed absently watching to see that nothing was spilled from the spoon as she continued to move toward him Why I was talking to old missus Wottaw at market this morning and she said her son Clark used to have nervous trouble and she told me about this medicine and how to have it made at the drug store She told me it cured Clark and I don t want to be cured Penrod said adding inconsistently I haven t got anything to be cured of Now dear missus Schofield began you don t want your papa and me to keep on worrying about I don t care whether you worry or not the heartless boy interrupted I don t want to take any horrable ole medicine What s that grass and weeds in the bottle for missus Schofield looked grieved There isn t any grass and there aren t any weeds those are healthful herbs I bet they ll make me sick She sighed Penrod we re trying to make you well But I AM well I tell you No dear your papa s been very much troubled about you Come Penrod swallow this down and don t make such a fuss about it It s just for your own good And she advanced upon him again the spoon extended toward his lips It almost touched them for he had retreated until his back was against the wall paper He could go no farther but he evinced his unshaken repugnance by averting his face What s it taste like he demanded It s not unpleasant at all she answered poking the spoon at his mouth missus Wottaw said Clark used to be very fond of it It doesn t taste like ordinary medicine at all she said How often I got to take it Penrod mumbled as the persistent spoon sought to enter his mouth Just this once No dear three times a day I won t do it Penrod She spoke sharply You swallow this down and stop making such a fuss I can t be all day Hurry She inserted the spoon between his lips so that its rim touched his clenched teeth he was still reluctant Moreover is reluctance was natural and characteristic for a boy s sense of taste is as simple and as peculiar as a dog s though of course altogether different from a dog s A boy passing through the experimental age may eat and drink astonishing things but they must be of his own choosing His palate is tender and in one sense might be called fastidious nothing is more sensitive or more easily shocked A boy tastes things much more than grown people taste them what is merely unpleasant to a man is sheer broth of hell to a boy Therefore not knowing what might be encountered Penrod continued to be reluctant Penrod his mother exclaimed losing patience I ll call your papa to make you take it if you don t swallow it right down Open your mouth Penrod It isn t going to taste bad at all Open your mouth THERE The reluctant jaw relaxed at last and missus Schofield dexterously elevated the handle of the spoon so that the brown liquor was deposited within her son There she repeated triumphantly It wasn t so bad after all was it Penrod did not reply His expression had become odd and the oddity of his manner was equal to that of his expression Uttering no sound he seemed to distend as if he had suddenly become a pneumatic boy under dangerous pressure Meanwhile his reddening eyes fixed awfully upon his mother grew unbearable Now it wasn t such a bad taste missus Schofield said rather nervously Don t go acting THAT way Penrod But Penrod could not help himself In truth even a grown person hardened to all manner of flavours and able to eat caviar or liquid Camembert would have found the cloudy brown liquor virulently repulsive It contained in solution with other things the vital element of surprise for it was comparatively odourless and unlike the chivalrous rattlesnake gave no warning of what it was about to do In the case of Penrod the surprise was complete and its effect visibly shocking The distention by which he began to express his emotion appeared to be increasing his slender throat swelled as his cheeks puffed His shoulders rose toward his ears he lifted his right leg in an unnatural way and held it rigidly in the air Stop that Penrod missus Schofield commanded You stop it He found his voice Uff OOOFF he said thickly and collapsed a mere ordinary every day convulsion taking the place of his pneumatic symptoms He began to writhe at the same time opening and closing his mouth rapidly and repeatedly waving his arms stamping on the floor Ow Ow ow OW he vociferated Reassured by these normal demonstrations of a type with which she was familiar missus Schofield resumed her fond smile YOU RE all right little boysie she said heartily Then picking up the bottle she replenished the tablespoon and told Penrod something she had considered it undiplomatic to mention before Here s the other one she said sweetly Uuf he sputtered Other uh what Two tablespoons before each meal she informed him Instantly Penrod made the first of a series of passionate efforts to leave the room His determination was so intense and the manifestations of it were so ruthless that missus Schofield exhausted found herself obliged to call for the official head of the house in fact she found herself obliged to shriek for him and mister Schofield hastily entering the room beheld his wife apparently in the act of sawing his son back and forth across the sill of an open window Penrod made a frantic effort to reach the good green earth even after his mother s clutch upon his ankle had been reenforced by his father s Nor was the lad s revolt subdued when he was deposited upon the floor and the window closed Indeed it may be said that he actually never gave up though it is a fact that the second potion was successfully placed inside him But by the time this feat was finally accomplished mister Schofield had proved that in spite of middle age he was entitled to substantial claims and honours both as athlete and orator his oratory being founded less upon the school of Webster and more upon that of Jeremiah So the thing was done and the double dose put within the person of Penrod Schofield It proved not ineffective there and presently as its new owner sat morosely at table he began to feel slightly dizzy and his eyes refused him perfect service This was natural because two tablespoons of the cloudy brown liquor contained about the amount of alcohol to be found in an ordinary cocktail Now a boy does not enjoy the effects of intoxication enjoyment of that kind is obtained only by studious application Therefore Penrod spoke of his symptoms complainingly and even showed himself so vindictive as to attribute them to the new medicine His mother made no reply Instead she nodded her head as if some inner conviction had proven well founded BILIOUS TOO she whispered to her husband That evening during the half hour preceding dinner the dining room was the scene of another struggle only a little less desperate than that which had been the prelude to lunch and again an appeal to the head of the house was found necessary Muscular activity and a liberal imitation of the jeremiads once more subjugated the rebel and the same rebellion and its suppression in a like manner took place the following morning before breakfast But this was Saturday and without warning or apparent reason a remarkable change came about at noon However mister and missus Schofield were used to inexplicable changes in Penrod and they missed its significance When missus Schofield with dread in her heart called Penrod into the house to take his medicine before lunch he came briskly and took it like a lamb Why Penrod that s splendid she cried You see it isn t bad at all No m he said meekly Not when you get used to it And aren t you ashamed making all that fuss she went on happily Yes m I guess so And don t you feel better Don t you see how much good it s doing you already Yes m I guess so Upon a holiday morning several weeks later Penrod and Sam Williams revived a pastime that they called drug store setting up display counters selling chemical cosmetic and other compounds to imaginary customers filling prescriptions and variously conducting themselves in a pharmaceutical manner They were in the midst of affairs when Penrod interrupted his partner and himself with a cry of recollection I know he shouted I got some mighty good ole stuff we want You wait And dashing to the house he disappeared Returning immediately Penrod placed upon the principal counter of the drug store a large bottle It was a quart bottle in fact and it contained what appeared to be a section of grassy swamp immersed in a cloudy brown liquor There Penrod exclaimed How s that for some good ole medicine It s good ole stuff Sam said approvingly Where d you get it Whose is it Penrod It WAS mine said Penrod Up to about serreval days ago it was They quit givin it to me I had to take two bottles and a half of it What did you haf to take it for I got nervous or sumpthing said Penrod You all well again now I guess so Uncle Passloe and cousin Ronald came to visit and I expect she got too busy to think about it or sumpthing Anyway she quit makin me take it and said I was lots better She s forgot all about it by this time Sam was looking at the bottle with great interest What s all that stuff in there Penrod he asked What s all that stuff in there looks like grass It IS grass said Penrod How d it get there I stuck it in there the candid boy replied First they had some horrable ole stuff in there like to killed me But after they got three doses down me I took the bottle out in the yard and cleaned her all out and pulled a lot o good ole grass and stuffed her pretty full and poured in a lot o good ole hydrant water on top of it Then when they got the next bottle I did the same way and It don t look like water Sam objected Penrod laughed a superior laugh Oh that s nothin he said with the slight swagger of young and conscious genius Of course I had to slip in and shake her up sometimes so s they wouldn t notice But what did you put in it to make it look like that Penrod upon the point of replying happened to glance toward the house His gaze lifting rested for a moment upon a window The head of missus Schofield was framed in that window She nodded gayly to her son She could see him plainly and she thought that he seemed perfectly healthy and as happy as a boy could be She was right What DID you put in it Sam insisted And probably it was just as well that though missus Schofield could see her son the distance was too great for her to hear him Oh nothin Penrod replied Nothin but a little good ole mud CHAPTER XII GIPSY On a fair Saturday afternoon in November Penrod s little old dog Duke returned to the ways of his youth and had trouble with a strange cat on the back porch This indiscretion so uncharacteristic was due to the agitation of a surprised moment for Duke s experience had inclined him to a peaceful pessimism and he had no ambition for hazardous undertakings of any sort He was given to musing but not to avoidable action and he seemed habitually to hope for something that he was pretty sure would not happen 
3744-178594-0000	train-other-500	Even in his sleep this gave him an air of wistfulness Thus being asleep in a nook behind the metal refuse can when the strange cat ventured to ascend the steps of the porch
none	none	 his appearance was so unwarlike that the cat felt encouraged to extend its field of reconnaissance for the cook had been careless 
3744-178594-0001	train-other-500	and the backbone of a three pound whitefish lay at the foot of the refuse can
none	none	 This cat was for a cat needlessly tall powerful 
3744-178594-0002	train-other-500	independent and masculine Once long ago he had been a roly poly pepper and salt kitten he had a home in those days and a name Gipsy which he abundantly justified He was precocious in dissipation
3744-178594-0003	train-other-500	Long before his adolescence his lack of domesticity was ominous and he had formed bad companionships Meanwhile he grew so rangy and developed such length and power of leg and such traits of character
3744-178594-0004	train-other-500	that the father of the little girl who owned him was almost convincing when he declared that the young cat was half broncho and half Malay pirate though in the light of Gipsy s later career this seems bitterly unfair to even the lowest orders of bronchos and Malay pirates No
3744-178594-0005	train-other-500	Gipsy was not the pet for a little girl The rosy hearthstone and sheltered rug were too circumspect for him Surrounded by the comforts of middle class respectability and profoundly oppressed even in his youth by the Puritan ideals of the household
3744-178594-0006	train-other-500	he sometimes experienced a sense of suffocation He wanted free air and he wanted free life he wanted the lights the lights and the music He abandoned the bourgeoise irrevocably He went forth in a May twilight carrying the evening beefsteak with him and joined the underworld
3744-178594-0007	train-other-500	His extraordinary size his daring and his utter lack of sympathy soon made him the leader and at the same time the terror of all the loose lived cats in a wide neighbourhood He contracted no friendships and had no confidants
3744-178594-0008	train-other-500	He seldom slept in the same place twice in succession and though he was wanted by the police he was not found In appearance he did not lack distinction of an ominous sort the slow rhythmic perfectly controlled mechanism of his tail
3744-178594-0009	train-other-500	as he impressively walked abroad was incomparably sinister This stately and dangerous walk of his his long vibrant whiskers his scars his yellow eye so ice cold so fire hot haughty as the eye of Satan
none	none	 gave him the deadly air of a mousquetaire duellist 
3744-178594-0010	train-other-500	His soul was in that walk and in that eye it could be read
none	none	 the soul of a bravo of fortune 
3744-178594-0011	train-other-500	living on his wits and his velour asking no favours and granting no quarter Intolerant proud sullen yet watchful and constantly planning purely a militarist believing in slaughter as in a religion
3744-178594-0012	train-other-500	and confident that art science poetry and the good of the world were happily advanced thereby Gipsy had become though technically not a wildcat undoubtedly the most untamed cat at large in the civilized world
3744-178594-0013	train-other-500	Such in brief was the terrifying creature that now elongated its neck and over the top step of the porch bent a calculating scrutiny upon the wistful and slumberous Duke The scrutiny was searching but not prolonged Gipsy muttered contemptuously to himself
3744-178594-0014	train-other-500	Oh sheol I m not afraid o THAT And he approached the fishbone his padded feet making no noise upon the boards It was a desirable fishbone large with a considerable portion of the fish s tail still attached to it
3744-178594-0015	train-other-500	It was about a foot from Duke s nose and the little dog s dreams began to be troubled by his olfactory nerve This faithful sentinel on guard even while Duke slept signalled that alarums and excursions by parties unknown were taking place
3744-178594-0016	train-other-500	and suggested that attention might well be paid Duke opened one drowsy eye What that eye beheld was monstrous Here was a strange experience the horrific vision in the midst of things so accustomed
3744-178594-0017	train-other-500	Sunshine fell sweetly upon porch and backyard yonder was the familiar stable and from its interior came the busy hum of a carpenter shop established that morning by Duke s young master in association with Samuel Williams and Herman
3744-178594-0018	train-other-500	Here close by were the quiet refuse can and the wonted brooms and mops leaning against the latticed wall at the end of the porch and there by the foot of the steps was the stone slab of the cistern with the iron cover displaced and lying beside the round opening
3744-178594-0019	train-other-500	where the carpenters had left it not half an hour ago after lowering a stick of wood into the water to season it All about Duke were these usual and reassuring environs of his daily life and yet it was his fate to behold
3744-178594-0020	train-other-500	right in the midst of them and in ghastly juxtaposition to his face a thing of nightmare and lunacy Gipsy had seized the fishbone by the middle Out from one side of his head and mingling with his whiskers projected the long spiked spine of the big fish
3744-178594-0021	train-other-500	down from the other side of that ferocious head dangled the fish s tail and from above the remarkable effect thus produced shot the intolerable glare of two yellow eyes To the gaze of Duke still blurred by slumber this monstrosity was all of one piece
3744-178594-0022	train-other-500	the bone seemed a living part of it What he saw was like those interesting insect faces that the magnifying glass reveals to great M Fabre It was impossible for Duke to maintain the philosophic calm of M Fabre however
3744-178594-0023	train-other-500	there was no magnifying glass between him and this spined and spiky face Indeed Duke was not in a position to think the matter over quietly If he had been able to do that he would have said to himself
3744-178594-0024	train-other-500	We have here an animal of most peculiar and unattractive appearance though upon examination it seems to be only a cat stealing a fishbone
none	none	 Nevertheless as the thief is large beyond all my recollection of cats and has an unpleasant stare 
3744-178594-0025	train-other-500	I will leave this spot at once On the contrary Duke was so electrified by his horrid awakening that he completely lost his presence of mind In the very instant of his first eye s opening the other eye and his mouth behaved similarly
3744-178594-0026	train-other-500	the latter loosing upon the quiet air one shriek of mental agony before the little dog scrambled to his feet and gave further employment to his voice in a frenzy of profanity At the same time the subterranean diapason of a demoniac bass viol was heard
3744-178594-0027	train-other-500	it rose to a wail and rose and rose again till it screamed like a small siren It was Gipsy s war cry and at the sound of it Duke became a frothing maniac He made a convulsive frontal attack upon the hobgoblin and the massacre began
3744-178594-0028	train-other-500	Never releasing the fishbone for an instant Gipsy laid back his ears in a chilling way beginning to shrink into himself like a concertina but rising amidships so high that he appeared to be giving an imitation of that peaceful beast the dromedary
3744-178594-0029	train-other-500	Such was not his purpose however for having attained his greatest possible altitude
none	none	 he partially sat down and elevated his right arm after the manner of a semaphore 
3744-178594-0030	train-other-500	This semaphore arm remained rigid for a second threatening then it vibrated with inconceivable rapidity feinting But it was the treacherous left that did the work Seemingly this left gave Duke three lightning little pats upon the right ear
3744-178594-0031	train-other-500	but the change in his voice indicated that these were no love taps He yelled help
none	none	 and bloody murder Never had such a shattering uproar all vocal broken out upon a peaceful afternoon 
3744-178594-0032	train-other-500	Gipsy possessed a vocabulary for cat swearing certainly second to none out of Italy and probably equal to the best there while Duke remembered and uttered things he had not thought of for years The hum of the carpenter shop ceased
3744-178594-0033	train-other-500	and Sam Williams appeared in the stable doorway He stared insanely My gorry he shouted
none	none	 Duke s havin a fight with the biggest cat you ever saw in your life C mon His feet were already in motion toward the battlefield 
3744-178594-0034	train-other-500	with Penrod and Herman hurrying in his wake Onward they sped and Duke was encouraged by the sight and sound of these reenforcements to increase his own outrageous clamours and to press home his attack But he was ill advised
none	none	 This time it was the right arm of the semaphore that dipped 
3744-178594-0035	train-other-500	and Duke s honest nose was but too conscious of what happened in consequence A lump of dirt struck the refuse can with violence and Gipsy beheld the advance of overwhelming forces They rushed upon him from two directions cutting off the steps of the porch
3744-178594-0036	train-other-500	Undaunted the formidable cat raked Duke s nose again somewhat more lingeringly and prepared to depart with his fishbone He had little fear for himself because he was inclined to think that unhampered he could whip anything on earth still
3744-178594-0037	train-other-500	things seemed to be growing rather warm and he saw nothing to prevent his leaving And though he could laugh in the face of so unequal an antagonist as Duke Gipsy felt that he was never at his best or able to do himself full justice
3744-178594-0038	train-other-500	unless he could perform that feline operation inaccurately known as spitting To his notion this was an absolute essential to combat but as all cats of the slightest pretensions to technique perfectly understand it can neither be well done nor produce the best effects
3744-178594-0039	train-other-500	unless the mouth be opened to its utmost capacity so as to expose the beginnings of the alimentary canal down which at least that is the intention of the threat the opposing party will soon be passing And Gipsy could not open his mouth without relinquishing his fishbone
3744-178594-0040	train-other-500	Therefore on small accounts he decided to leave the field to his enemies and to carry the fishbone elsewhere He took two giant leaps The first landed him upon the edge of the porch There without an instant s pause
3744-178594-0041	train-other-500	he gathered his fur sheathed muscles concentrated himself into one big steel spring and launched himself superbly into space He made a stirring picture however brief
3744-178594-0042	train-other-500	as he left the solid porch behind him and sailed upward on an ascending curve into the sunlit air His head was proudly up he was the incarnation of menacing power and of self confidence
3744-178594-0043	train-other-500	It is possible that the whitefish s spinal column and flopping tail had interfered with his vision and in launching himself he may have mistaken the dark round opening of the cistern for its dark round cover In that case it was a leap calculated and executed with precision
none	none	 for as the boys clamoured their pleased astonishment Gipsy descended accurately into the orifice and passed majestically from public view with the fishbone still in his mouth and his haughty head still high There was a grand splash CHAPTER XIII CONCERNING TROUSERS Duke hastening to place himself upon the stone slab raged at his enemy in safety and presently the indomitable Gipsy could be heard from the darkness below turning on the bass of his siren threatening the water that enveloped him returning Duke s profanity with interest and cursing the general universe You hush Penrod stormed rushing at Duke You go way from here You DUKE And Duke after prostrating himself decided that it would be a relief to obey and to consider his responsibilities in this matter at an end He withdrew beyond a corner of the house thinking deeply Why n t you let him bark at the ole cat Sam Williams inquired sympathizing with the oppressed I guess you d want to bark if a cat had been treatin you the way this one did Duke Well we got to get this cat out o here haven t we Penrod demanded crossly What fer Herman asked Mighty mean cat If it was me I let at ole cat drownd My goodness Penrod cried What you want to let it drown for Anyways we got to use this water in our house haven t we You don t s pose people like to use water that s got a cat drowned in it do you It gets pumped up into the tank in the attic and goes all over the house and I bet you wouldn t want to see your father and mother usin water a cat was drowned in I guess I don t want my father and moth Well how CAN we get it out Sam asked cutting short this virtuous oration It s swimmin around down there he continued peering into the cistern and kind of roaring and it must of dropped its fishbone cause it s spittin just awful I guess maybe it s mad cause it fell in there I don t know how it s goin to be got out said Penrod but I know it s GOT to be got out and that s all there is to it I m not goin to have my father and mother Well once said Sam once when a kitten fell down OUR cistern Papa took a pair of his trousers and he held em by the end of one leg and let em hang down through the hole till the end of the other leg was in the water and the kitten went and clawed hold of it and he pulled it right up easy as anything Well that s the way to do now cause if a kitten could keep hold of a pair of trousers I guess this ole cat could It s the biggest cat I ever saw All you got to do is to go and ast your mother for a pair of your father s trousers and we ll have this ole cat out o there in no time Penrod glanced toward the house perplexedly She ain t home and I d be afraid to Well take your own then Sam suggested briskly You take em off in the stable and wait in there and I and Herman ll get the cat out Penrod had no enthusiasm for this plan but he affected to consider it Well I don t know bout that he said and then after gazing attentively into the cistern and making some eye measurements of his knickerbockers he shook his head They d be too short They wouldn t be NEAR long enough Then neither would mine said Sam promptly Herman s would said Penrod No suh Herman had recently been promoted to long trousers and he expressed a strong disinclination to fall in with Penrod s idea My Mammy sit up late nights sewin on ese britches fer me makin em outen of a pair o pappy s an they mighty good britches Ain goin have no wet cat climbin up em No suh Both boys began to walk toward him argumentatively while he moved slowly backward shaking his head and denying them I don t keer how much you talk he said Mammy gave my OLE britches to Verman an ese here ones on y britches I got now an I m go to keep em on me not take em off an let ole wet cat splosh all over em My Mammy she sewed em fer ME I reckon d in sew em fer no cat Oh PLEASE come on Herman Penrod begged pathetically You don t want to see the poor cat drown do you Mighty mean cat Herman said Bet let at ole pussy cat lone whur it is Why it ll only take a minute Sam urged You just wait inside the stable and you ll have em back on again before you could say Jack Robinson I ain got no use to say no Jack Robason said Herman An I ain go to han over my britches fer NO cat Listen here Herman Penrod began pleadingly You can watch us every minute through the crack in the stable door can t you We ain t goin to HURT em any are we You can see everything we do can t you Look at here Herman you know that little saw you said you wished it was yours in the carpenter shop Well honest if you ll just let us take your trousers till we get this poor ole cat out the cistern I ll give you that little saw Herman was shaken he yearned for the little saw You gimme her to keep he asked cautiously You gimme her befo I han over my britches You ll see Penrod ran into the stable came back with the little saw and placed it in Herman s hand Herman could resist no longer and two minutes later he stood in the necessary negligee within the shelter of the stable door and watched through the crack the lowering of the surrendered garment into the cistern His gaze was anxious and surely nothing could have been more natural since the removal had exposed Herman s brown legs and although the weather was far from inclement November is never quite the month for people to be out of doors entirely without leg covering Therefore he marked with impatience that Sam and Penrod after lowering the trousers partway to the water had withdrawn them and fallen into an argument Name o goo ness Herman shouted I ain got no time fer you all do so much talkin If you go git at cat out why n t you GIT him Wait just a minute Penrod called and he came running to the stable seized upon a large wooden box which the carpenters had fitted with a lid and leather hinges and returned with it cumbersomely to the cistern There he said That ll do to put it in It won t get out o that I bet you Well I d like to know what you want to keep it for Sam said peevishly and with the suggestion of a sneer he added I s pose you think somebody ll pay about a hunderd dollars reward or something on account of a cat I don t either Penrod protested hotly I know what I m doin I tell you Well what on earth I ll tell you some day won t I Penrod cried I got my reasons for wantin to keep this cat and I m goin to keep it YOU don t haf to ke Well all right Sam said shortly Anyways it ll be dead if you don t hurry It won t either Penrod returned kneeling and peering down upon the dark water Listen to him He s growlin and spittin away like anything It takes a mighty fine blooded cat to be as fierce as that I bet you most cats would a given up and drowned long ago The water s awful cold and I expect he was perty supprised when he lit in it Herman s makin a fuss again Sam said We better get the ole cat out o there if we re goin to Well this is the way we ll do Penrod said authoritatively I ll let you hold the trousers Sam You lay down and keep hold of one leg and let the other one hang down till its end is in the water Then you kind of swish it around till it s somewheres where the cat can get hold of it and soon as he does you pull it up and be mighty careful so s it don t fall off Then I ll grab it and stick it in the box and slam the lid down Rather pleased to be assigned to the trousers Sam accordingly extended himself at full length upon the slab and proceeded to carry out Penrod s instructions Meanwhile Penrod peering from above inquired anxiously for information concerning this work of rescue Can you see it Sam Why don t it grab hold What s it doin now Sam It s spittin at Herman s trousers said Sam My gracious but it s a fierce cat If it s mad all the time like this you better not ever try to pet it much Now it s kind o sniffin at the trousers It acks to me as if it was goin to ketch hold Yes it s stuck one claw in em OW Sam uttered a blood curdling shriek and jerked convulsively The next instant streaming and inconceivably gaunt the ravening Gipsy appeared with a final bound upon Sam s shoulder It was not in Gipsy s character to be drawn up peaceably he had ascended the trousers and Sam s arm without assistance and in his own way Simultaneously for this was a notable case of everything happening at once there was a muffled soggy splash and the unfortunate Herman smit with prophecy in his seclusion uttered a dismal yell Penrod laid hands upon Gipsy and after a struggle suggestive of sailors landing a man eating shark succeeded in getting him into the box and sat upon the lid thereof Sam had leaped to his feet empty handed and vociferous Ow ow OUCH he shouted as he rubbed his suffering arm and shoulder Then exasperated by Herman s lamentations he called angrily Oh what I care for your ole britches I guess if you d a had a cat climb up YOU you d a dropped em a hunderd times over However upon excruciating entreaty he consented to explore the surface of the water with a clothes prop but reported that the luckless trousers had disappeared in the depths Herman having forgotten to remove some fishin sinkers from his pockets before making the fated loan Penrod was soothing a lacerated wrist in his mouth That s a mighty fine blooded cat he remarked I expect it d got away from pretty near anybody specially if they didn t know much about cats Listen at him in the box Sam I bet you never heard a cat growl as loud as that in your life I shouldn t wonder it was part panther or sumpthing Sam began to feel more interest and less resentment I tell you what we can do Penrod he said Let s take it in the stable and make the box into a cage We can take off the hinges and slide back the lid a little at a time and nail some o those laths over the front for bars That s just exackly what I was goin to say Penrod exclaimed I already thought o that Sam Yessir we ll make it just like a reg lar circus cage and our good ole cat can look out from between the bars and growl It ll come in pretty handy if we ever decide to have another show Anyways we ll have her in there good and tight where we can watch she don t get away I got a mighty good reason to keep this cat Sam You ll see Well why don t you Sam was interrupted by n vehement appeal from the stable Oh we re comin he shouted We got to bring our cat in its cage haven t we Listen Herman Penrod called absent mindedly Bring us some bricks or something awful heavy to put on the lid of our cage so we can carry it without our good ole cat pushin the lid open Herman explained with vehemence that it would not be right for him to leave the stable upon any errand until just restorations had been made He spoke inimically of the cat that had been the occasion of his loss and he earnestly requested that operations with the clothes prop be resumed in the cistern Sam and Penrod declined on the ground that this was absolutely proven to be of no avail and Sam went to look for bricks These two boys were not unfeeling They sympathized with Herman but they regarded the trousers as a loss about which there was no use in making so much outcry To them it was part of an episode that ought to be closed They had done their best and Sam had not intended to drop the trousers that was something no one could have helped and therefore no one was to be blamed What they were now interested in was the construction of a circus cage for their good ole cat It s goin to be a cage just exactly like circus cages Herman Penrod said as he and Sam set the box down on the stable floor You can help us nail the bars and I ain studyin bout no bars Herman interrupted fiercely What good you reckon nailin bars go do me if Mammy holler fer me You white boys sutn y show me bad day I try treat people nice n en they go th ow my britches down cistern I did not Sam protested That ole cat just kicked em out o my hand with its hind feet while its front ones were stickin in my arm I bet YOU D of Blame it on cat Herman sneered At s nice Jes looky here minute Who d I len em britches to D I len em britches to thishere cat No suh you know I didn You know well s any man I len em britches to you an you tuck an th owed em down cistern Oh PLEASE hush up about your old britches Penrod said plaintively I got to think how we re goin to fix our cage up right and you make so much noise I can t get my mind on it Anyways didn t I give you that little saw Li l saw Herman cried unmollified Yes an thishere li l saw go do me lot o good when I got to go home Why it s only across the alley to your house Herman said Sam That ain t anything at all to step over there and you ve got your little saw Aw right You jes take off you closes an step cross the alley said Herman bitterly I give you li l saw to carry Penrod had begun to work upon the cage Now listen here Herman he said if you ll quit talkin so much and kind of get settled down or sumpthing and help us fix a good cage for our panther well when mamma comes home about five o clock I ll go and tell her there s a poor boy got his britches burned up in a fire and how he s waitin out in the stable for some and I ll tell her I promised him Well she ll give me a pair I wore for summer honest she will and you can put em on as quick as anything There Herman said Sam now you re all right again WHO all right Herman complained I like feel sump m roun my laigs befo no five o clock Well you re sure to get em by then Penrod promised It ain t winter yet Herman Come on and help saw these laths for the bars Herman and Sam and I ll nail em on It ain t long till five o clock Herman and then you ll just feel fine Herman was not convinced but he found himself at a disadvantage in the argument The question at issue seemed a vital one to him and yet his two opponents evidently considered it of minor importance Obviously they felt that the promise for five o clock had settled the whole matter conclusively but to Herman this did not appear to be the fact However he helplessly suffered himself to be cajoled back into carpentry though he was extremely ill at ease and talked a great deal of his misfortune He shivered and grumbled and by his passionate urgings compelled Penrod to go into the house so many times to see what time it was by the kitchen clock that both his companions almost lost patience with him There said Penrod returning from performing this errand for the fourth time It s twenty minutes after three and I m not goin in to look at that ole clock again if I haf to die for it I never heard anybody make such a fuss in my life and I m gettin tired of it Must think we want to be all night fixin this cage for our panther If you ask me to go and see what time it is again Herman I m a goin to take back about askin mamma at five o clock and THEN where ll you be Well it seem like mighty long aft noon to me Herman sighed I jes like to know what time it is gettin to be now Look out Penrod warned him You heard what I was just tellin you about how I d take back Nemmine Herman said hurriedly I wasn astin you I jes sayin sump m kind o to myse f like CHAPTER XIV CAMERA WORK IN THE JUNGLE The completed cage with Gipsy behind the bars framed a spectacle sufficiently thrilling and panther like Gipsy raved spat struck virulently at taunting fingers turned on his wailing siren for minutes at a time and he gave his imitation of a dromedary almost continuously These phenomena could be intensified in picturesqueness the boys discovered by rocking the cage a little tapping it with a hammer or raking the bars with a stick Altogether Gipsy was having a lively afternoon There came a vigorous rapping on the alley door of the stable and Verman was admitted Yay Verman cried Sam Williams Come and look at our good ole panther Another curiosity however claimed Verman s attention His eyes opened wide and he pointed at Herman s legs Wha ma oo Mammy hay oo hip ap hoe woob Mammy tell ME git at stove wood Herman interpreted resentfully How m I go git at stove wood when my britches down bottom at cistern I like you answer ME please You shet at do behime you Verman complied and again pointing to his brother s legs requested to be enlightened Sin I tole you once they down bottom at cistern Herman shouted much exasperated You wan know how come so you ast Sam Williams He say thishere cat tuck an th owed em down there Sam who was busy rocking the cage remained cheerfully absorbed in that occupation Come look at our good ole panther Verman he called I ll get this circus cage rockin right good an then Wait a minute said Penrod I got sumpthing I got to think about Quit rockin it I guess I got a right to think about sumpthing without havin to go deaf haven t I Having obtained the quiet so plaintively requested he knit his brow and gazed intently upon Verman then upon Herman then upon Gipsy Evidently his idea was fermenting He broke the silence with a shout I know Sam I know what we ll do NOW I just thought of it and it s goin to be sumpthing I bet there aren t any other boys in this town could do because where would they get any good ole panther like we got and Herman and Verman And they d haf to have a dog too and we got our good ole Dukie I guess I bet we have the greatest ole time this afternoon we ever had in our lives His enthusiasm roused the warm interest of Sam and Verman though Herman remaining cold and suspicious asked for details An I like to hear if it s sump m he concluded what s go git me my britches back outen at cistern Well it ain t exackly that said Penrod It s different from that What I m thinkin about well for us to have it the way it ought to be so s you and Verman would look like natives well Verman ought to take off his britches too Mo said Verman shaking his head violently Mo Well wait a minute can t you Sam Williams said Give Penrod a chance to say what he wants to first can t you Go on Penrod Well you know Sam said Penrod turning to this sympathetic auditor you remember that movin pitcher show we went to Fortygraphing Wild Animals in the Jungle Well Herman wouldn t have to do a thing more to look like those natives we saw that the man called the beaters They were dressed just about like the way he is now and if Verman MO said Verman Oh WAIT a minute Verman Sam entreated Go on Penrod Well we can make a mighty good jungle up in the loft Penrod continued eagerly We can take that ole dead tree that s out in the alley and some branches and I bet we could have the best jungle you ever saw And then we d fix up a kind of place in there for our panther only of course we d haf to keep him in the cage so s he wouldn t run away but we d pretend he was loose And then you remember how they did with that calf Well we d have Duke for the tied up calf for the panther to come out and jump on so they could fortygraph him Herman can be the chief beater and we ll let Verman be the other beaters and I ll Yay shouted Sam Williams I ll be the fortygraph man No said Penrod you be the one with the gun that guards the fortygraph man because I m the fortygraph man already You can fix up a mighty good gun with this carpenter shop Sam We ll make spears for our good ole beaters too and I m goin to make me a camera out o that little starch box and a bakin powder can that s goin to be a mighty good ole camera We can do lots more things Yay Sam cried Let s get started He paused Wait a minute Penrod Verman says he won t Well he s got to said Penrod I momp Verman insisted almost distinctly They began to argue with him but for a time Verman remained firm They upheld the value of dramatic consistency declaring that a beater dressed as completely as he was wouldn t look like anything at all He would spoil the whole biznuss they said and they praised Herman for the faithful accuracy of his costume They also insisted that the garment in question was much too large for Verman anyway having been so recently worn by Herman and turned over to Verman with insufficient alteration and they expressed surprise that anybody with any sense should make such a point of clinging to a misfit Herman sided against his brother in this controversy perhaps because a certain loneliness of which he was censcious might be assuaged by the company of another trouserless person or it may be that his motive was more sombre Possibly he remembered that Verman s trousers were his own former property and might fit him in case the promise for five o clock turned out badly At all events Verman finally yielded under great pressure and consented to appear in the proper costume of the multitude of beaters it now became his duty to personify Shouting the boys dispersed to begin the preparation of their jungle scene Sam and Penrod went for branches and the dead tree while Herman and Verman carried the panther in his cage to the loft where the first thing that Verman did was to hang his trousers on a nail in a conspicuous and accessible spot near the doorway And with the arrival of Penrod and Sam panting and dragging no inconsiderable thicket after them the coloured brethren began to take a livelier interest in things Indeed when Penrod a little later placed in their hands two spears pointed with tin their good spirits were entirely restored and they even began to take a pride in being properly uncostumed beaters Sam s gun and Penrod s camera were entirely satisfactory especially the latter The camera was so attractive in fact that the hunter and the chief beater and all the other beaters immediately resigned and insisted upon being photographers Each had to be given a turn before the jungle project could be resumed Now for goodnesses sakes said Penrod taking the camera from Verman I hope you re done so s we can get started doin something like we ought to We got to have Duke for a tied up calf We ll have to bring him and tie him out here in front the jungle and then the panther ll come out and jump on him Wait and I ll go bring him Departing upon this errand Penrod found Duke enjoying the declining rays of the sun in the front yard Hyuh Duke called his master in an indulgent tone Come on good ole Dukie Come along Duke rose conscientiously and followed him I got him men Penrod called from the stairway I got our good ole calf all ready to be tied up Here he is And he appeared in the doorway with the unsuspecting little dog beside him Gipsy who had been silent for some moments instantly raised his banshee battlecry and Duke yelped in horror Penrod made a wild effort to hold him but Duke was not to be detained Unnatural strength and activity came to him in his delirium and for the second or two that the struggle lasted his movements were too rapid for the eyes of the spectators to follow merely a whirl and blur in the air could be seen Then followed a sound of violent scrambling and Penrod sprawled alone at the top of the stairs Well why n t you come and help me he demanded indignantly I couldn t get him back now if I was to try a million years What we goin to do about it Sam asked Penrod rose and dusted his knees We got to get along without any tied up calf that s certain But I got to take those fortygraphs SOME way or other Me an Verman aw ready begin at beatin Herman suggested You tole us we the beaters Well wait a minute said Penrod whose feeling for realism in drama was always alert I want to get a mighty good pitcher o that ole panther this time As he spoke he threw open the wide door intended for the delivery of hay into the loft from the alley below Now bring the cage over here by this door so s I can get a better light it s gettin kind of dark over where the jungle is We ll pretend there isn t any cage there and soon as I get him fortygraphed I ll holler Shoot men Then you must shoot Sam and Herman you and Verman must hammer on the cage with your spears and holler Hoo Hoo and pretend you re spearin him Well we aw ready said Herman Hoo Hoo Wait a minute Penrod interposed frowningly surveying the cage I got to squat too much to get my camera fixed right He assumed various solemn poses to be interpreted as those of a photographer studying his subject No he said finally it won t take good that way My gootness Herman exclaimed When we goin begin at beatin Here Apparently Penrod had solved a weighty problem Bring that busted ole kitchen chair and set the panther up on it There THAT S the ticket This way it ll make a mighty good pitcher He turned to Sam importantly Well Jim is the chief and all his beaters here Yes Bill all here Sam responded with an air of loyalty Well then I guess we re ready said Penrod in his deepest voice Beat men Herman and Verman were anxious to beat They set up the loudest uproar of which they were capable Hoo Hoo Hoo they bellowed flailing the branches with their spears and stamping heavily upon the floor Sam carried away by the elan of the performance was unable to resist joining them Hoo Hoo Hoo he shouted Hoo Hoo Hoo And as the dust rose from the floor to their stamping the three of them produced such a din and hoo hooing as could be made by nothing on earth except boys Back men Penrod called raising his voice to the utmost Back for your lives The PA A ANTHER Now I m takin his pitcher Click click Shoot men shoot Bing Bing shouted Sam levelling his gun at the cage while Herman and Verman hammered upon it and Gipsy cursed boys the world and the day he was born Bing Bing Bing You missed him screamed Penrod Give me that gun And snatching it from Sam s unwilling hand he levelled it at the cage BING he roared Simultaneously there was the sound of another report but this was an actual one and may best be symbolized by the statement that it was a whack The recipient was Herman and outrageously surprised and pained he turned to find himself face to face with a heavily built coloured woman who had recently ascended the stairs and approached the preoccupied hunters from the rear In her hand was a lath and even as Herman turned it was again wielded this time upon Verman MAMMY Yes you bettuh holler Mammy she panted My goo ness if yo pappy don lam you to night Ain you got no mo sense an to let white boys suede you play you Affikin heathums Whah you britches Yonnuh Verman s quavered Herman Whah y own Choking Herman answered bravely At ole cat tuck an th owed em down cistern Exasperated almost beyond endurance she lifted the lath again But unfortunately in order to obtain a better field of action she moved backward a little coming in contact with the bars of the cage a circumstance that she overlooked More unfortunately still the longing of the captive to express his feelings was such that he would have welcomed the opportunity to attack an elephant He had been striking and scratching at inanimate things and at boys out of reach for the past hour but here at last was his opportunity He made the most of it I learn you tell me cat th owed OOOOH The coloured woman leaped into the air like an athlete and turning with a swiftness astounding in one of her weight beheld the semaphoric arm of Gipsy again extended between the bars and hopefully reaching for her Beside herself she lifted her right foot briskly from the ground and allowed the sole of her shoe to come in contact with Gipsy s cage The cage moved from the tottering chair beneath it It passed through the yawning hay door and fell resoundingly to the alley below where as Penrod and Sam with cries of dismay rushed to the door and looked down it burst asunder and disgorged a large bruised and chastened cat Gipsy paused and bent one strange look upon the broken box Then he shook his head and departed up the alley the two boys watching him till he was out of sight Before they turned a harrowing procession issued from the carriage house doors beneath them Herman came first hurriedly completing a temporary security in Verman s trousers Verman followed after a little reluctance that departed coincidentally with some inspiriting words from the rear He crossed the alley hastily and his Mammy stalked behind using constant eloquence and a frequent lath They went into the small house across the way and closed the door Then Sam turned to Penrod Penrod he said thoughtfully was it on account of fortygraphing in the jungle you wanted to keep that cat No that was a mighty fine blooded cat We d of made some money Sam jeered You mean when we d sell tickets to look at it in its cage Penrod shook his head and if Gipsy could have overheard and understood his reply that atrabilious spirit almost broken by the events of the day might have considered this last blow the most overwhelming of all No said Penrod when she had kittens CHAPTER XV A MODEL LETTER TO A FRIEND On Monday morning Penrod s faith in the coming of another Saturday was flaccid and lustreless Those Japanese lovers who were promised a reunion after ten thousand years in separate hells were brighter with hope than he was On Monday Penrod was virtually an agnostic Nowhere upon his shining morning face could have been read any eager anticipation of useful knowledge Of course he had been told that school was for his own good in fact he had been told and told and told but the words conveying this information meaningless at first assumed with each repetition more and more the character of dull and unsolicited insult He was wholly unable to imagine circumstances present or future under which any of the instruction and training he was now receiving could be of the slightest possible use or benefit to himself and when he was informed that such circumstances would frequently arise in his later life he but felt the slur upon his coming manhood and its power to prevent any such unpleasantness If it were possible to place a romantic young Broadway actor and athlete under hushing supervision for six hours a day compelling him to bend his unremittent attention upon the city directory of Sheboygan Wisconsin he could scarce be expected to respond genially to frequent statements that the compulsion was all for his own good On the contrary it might be reasonable to conceive his response as taking the form of action which is precisely the form that Penrod s smouldering impulse yearned to take To Penrod school was merely a state of confinement envenomed by mathematics For interminable periods he was forced to listen to information concerning matters about which he had no curiosity whatever and he had to read over and over the dullest passages in books that bored him into stupors while always there overhung the preposterous task of improvising plausible evasions to conceal the fact that he did not know what he had no wish to know Likewise he must always be prepared to avoid incriminating replies to questions that he felt nobody had a real and natural right to ask him And when his gorge rose and his inwards revolted the hours became a series of ignoble misadventures and petty disgraces strikingly lacking in privacy It was usually upon Wednesday that his sufferings culminated the nervous strength accumulated during the holiday hours at the end of the week would carry him through Monday and Tuesday but by Wednesday it seemed ultimately proven that the next Saturday actually never was coming this time and the strained spirit gave way Wednesday was the day averaging highest in Penrod s list of absences but the time came when he felt that the advantages attendant upon his Wednesday sick headache did not compensate for its inconveniences For one thing this illness had become so symmetrically recurrent that even the cook felt that he was pushing it too far and the liveliness of her expression when he was able to leave his couch and take the air in the backyard at about ten o clock became more disagreeable to him with each convalescence There visibly increased too about the whole household an atmosphere of uncongeniality and suspicion so pronounced that every successive illness was necessarily more severe and at last the patient felt obliged to remain bedded until almost eleven from time to time giving forth pathetic little sounds eloquent of anguish triumphing over Stoic endurance yet lacking a certain conviction of utterance Finally his father enacted and his mother applied a new and distinctly special bit of legislation explaining it with simple candour to the prospective beneficiary Whenever you really ARE sick they said you can go out and play as soon as you re well that is if it happens on Saturday But when you re sick on a school day you ll stay in bed till the next morning This is going to do you good Penrod Physically their opinion appeared to be affirmed for Wednesday after Wednesday passed without any recurrence of the attack but the spiritual strain may have been damaging And it should be added that if Penrod s higher nature did suffer from the strain he was not unique For confirming the effect of Wednesday upon boys in general it is probable that if full statistics concerning cats were available they would show that cats dread Wednesdays and that their fear is shared by other animals and would be shared to an extent by windows if windows possessed nervous systems Nor must this probable apprehension on the part of cats and the like be thought mere superstition Cats have superstitions it is true but certain actions inspired by the sight of a boy with a missile in his hand are better evidence of the workings of logic upon a practical nature than of faith in the supernatural Moreover the attention of family physicians and specialists should be drawn to these significant though obscure phenomena for the suffering of cats is a barometer of the nerve pressure of boys and it may be accepted as sufficiently established that Wednesday after school hours is the worst time for cats After the promulgation of that parental edict You ll stay in bed till the next morning four weeks went by unflawed by a single absence from the field of duty but when the fifth Wednesday came Penrod held sore debate within himself before he finally rose In fact after rising and while actually engaged with his toilet he tentatively emitted the series of little moans that was his wonted preliminary to a quiet holiday at home and the sound was heard as intended by mister Schofield who was passing Penrod s door on his way to breakfast ALL right the father said making use of peculiar and unnecessary emphasis Stay in bed till to morrow morning Castor oil this time too Penrod had not hoped much for his experiment nevertheless his rebellious blood was sensibly inflamed by the failure and he accompanied his dressing with a low murmuring apparently a bitter dialogue between himself and some unknown but powerful patron Thus he muttered Well they better NOT Well what can I DO about it Well I D show em Well I WILL show em Well you OUGHT to show em that s the way I do I just shake em around and say Here I guess you don t know who you re talkin to like that You better look out Well that s the way I m goin to do Well go on and DO it then Well I AM goin The door of the next room was slightly ajar now it swung wide and Margaret appeared Penrod what on earth are you talking about Nothin None o your Well hurry to breakfast then it s getting late Lightly she went humming a tune leaving the door of her room open and the eyes of Penrod as he donned his jacket chanced to fall upon her desk where she had thoughtlessly left a letter a private missive just begun and intended solely for the eyes of mister Robert Williams a senior at a far university In such a fashion is coincidence the architect of misfortune Penrod s class in English composition had been instructed the previous day to concoct at home and bring to class on Wednesday morning a model letter to a friend on some subject of general interest Penalty for omission to perform this simple task was definite whosoever brought no letter would inevitably be kept in after school that afternoon until the letter was written and it was precisely a premonition of this misfortune that had prompted Penrod to attempt his experimental moaning upon his father for alas he had equipped himself with no model letter nor any letter whatever In stress of this kind a boy s creed is that anything is worth a try but his eye for details is poor He sees the future too sweepingly and too much as he would have it seldom providing against inconsistencies of evidence that may damage him For instance there is a well known case of two brothers who exhibited to their parents with pathetic confidence several imported dried herring on a string as a proof that the afternoon had been spent not at a forbidden circus but with hook and line upon the banks of a neighbouring brook So with Penrod He had vital need of a letter and there before his eyes upon Margaret s desk was apparently the precise thing he needed From below rose the voice of his mother urging him to the breakfast table warning him that he stood in danger of tardiness at school he was pressed for time and acted upon an inspiration that failed to prompt him even to read the letter Hurriedly he wrote Dear freind at the top of the page Margaret had partially filled Then he signed himself Yours respectfuly Penrod Schofield at the bottom and enclosed the missive within a battered volume entitled Principles of English Composition With that and other books compacted by a strap he descended to a breakfast somewhat oppressive but undarkened by any misgivings concerning a letter to a friend on some subject of general interest He felt that a difficulty had been encountered and satisfactorily disposed of the matter could now be dismissed from his mind He had plenty of other difficulties to take its place No he had no misgivings nor was he assailed by anything unpleasant in that line even when the hour struck for the class in English composition If he had been two or three years older experience might have warned him to take at least the precaution of copying his offering so that it would appear in his own handwriting when he handed it in but Penrod had not even glanced at it I think Miss Spence said I will ask several of you to read your letters aloud before you hand them in Clara Raypole you may read yours Penrod was bored but otherwise comfortable he had no apprehension that he might be included in the several especially as Miss Spence s beginning with Clara Raypole a star performer indicated that her selection of readers would be made from the conscientious and proficient division at the head of the class He listened stoically to the beginning of the first letter though he was conscious of a dull resentment inspired mainly by the perfect complacency of Miss Raypole s voice Dear Cousin Sadie she began smoothly I thought I would write you to day on some subject of general interest and so I thought I would tell you about the subject of our court house It is a very fine building situated in the centre of the city and a visit to the building after school hours well repays for the visit Upon entrance we find upon our left the office of the county clerk and upon our right a number of windows affording a view of the street And so we proceed finding on both sides much of general interest The building was begun in eighteen eighty six A D and it was through in eighteen eighty seven A D It is four stories high and made of stone pressed brick wood and tiles with a tower or cupola one hundred and twenty seven feet seven inches from the ground Among other subjects of general interest told by the janitor we learn that the architect of the building was a man named Flanner and the foundations extend fifteen feet five inches under the ground Penrod was unable to fix his attention upon these statistics he began moodily to twist a button of his jacket and to concentrate a new born and obscure but lasting hatred upon the court house Miss Raypole s glib voice continued to press upon his ears but by keeping his eyes fixed upon the twisting button he had accomplished a kind of self hypnosis or mental anaesthesia and was but dimly aware of what went on about him The court house was finally exhausted by its visitor who resumed her seat and submitted with beamish grace to praise Then Miss Spence said in a favourable manner Georgie Bassett you may read your letter next The neat Georgie rose nothing loath and began Dear Teacher There was a slight titter which Miss Spence suppressed Georgie was not at all discomfited My mother says he continued reading his manuscript we should treat our teacher as a friend and so I will write YOU a letter This penetrated Penrod s trance and he lifted his eyes to fix them upon the back of Georgie Bassett s head in a long and inscrutable stare It was inscrutable and yet if Georgie had been sensitive to thought waves it is probable that he would have uttered a loud shriek but he remained placidly unaware continuing I thought I would write you about a subject of general interest and so I will write you about the flowers There are many kinds of flowers spring flowers and summer flowers and autumn flowers but no winter flowers Wild flowers grow in the woods and it is nice to hunt them in springtime and we must remember to give some to the poor and hospitals also Flowers can be made to grow in flower beds and placed in vases in houses There are many names for flowers but I call them nature s ornaments Penrod s gaze had relaxed drooped to his button again and his lethargy was renewed The outer world grew vaguer voices seemed to drone at a distance sluggish time passed heavily but some of it did pass Penrod Miss Spence s searching eye had taken note of the bent head and the twisting button She found it necessary to speak again Penrod Schofield He came languidly to life Ma am You may read your letter Yes m And he began to paw clumsily among his books whereupon Miss Spence s glance fired with suspicion Have you prepared one she demanded Yes m said Penrod dreamily But you re going to find you forgot to bring it aren t you I got it said Penrod discovering the paper in his Principles of English Composition Well we ll listen to what you ve found time to prepare she said adding coldly for once The frankest pessimism concerning Penrod permeated the whole room even the eyes of those whose letters had not met with favour turned upon him with obvious assurance that here was every prospect of a performance that would by comparison lend a measure of credit to the worst preceding it But Penrod was unaffected by the general gaze he rose still blinking from his lethargy and in no true sense wholly alive He had one idea to read as rapidly as possible so as to be done with the task and he began in a high pitched monotone reading with a blind mind and no sense of the significance of the words Dear friend he declaimed You call me beautiful but I am not really beautiful and there are times when I doubt if I am even pretty though perhaps my hair is beautiful and if it is true that my eyes are like blue stars in heaven Simultaneously he lost his breath and there burst upon him a perception of the results to which he was being committed by this calamitous reading And also simultaneous the outbreak of the class into cachinnations of delight severely repressed by the perplexed but indignant Miss Spence Go on she commanded grimly when she had restored order Ma am he gulped looking wretchedly upon the rosy faces all about him Go on with the description of yourself she said We d like to hear some more about your eyes being like blue stars in heaven Here many of Penrod s little comrades were forced to clasp their faces tightly in both hands and his dismayed gaze in refuge sought the treacherous paper in his hand What it beheld there was horrible Proceed Miss Spence said I often think he faltered and a a tree more th thrills my bein when I REcall your last words to me that last that last that GO ON That last evening in the moonlight when you you you Penrod Miss Spence said dangerously you go on and stop that stammering You you said you would wait for for years to to to to PENROD To win me the miserable Penrod managed to gasp I should not have pre premitted permitted you to speak so until we have our our parents con consent but oh how sweet it He exhaled a sigh of agony and then concluded briskly Yours respectfully Penrod Schofield But Miss Spence had at last divined something for she knew the Schofield family Bring me that letter she said And the scarlet boy passed forward between rows of mystified but immoderately uplifted children Miss Spence herself grew rather pink as she examined the missive and the intensity with which she afterward extended her examination to cover the complete field of Penrod Schofield caused him to find a remote centre of interest whereon to rest his embarrassed gaze She let him stand before her throughout a silence equalled perhaps by the tenser pauses during trials for murder and then containing herself she sweepingly gestured him to the pillory a chair upon the platform facing the school Here he suffered for the unusual term of an hour with many jocular and cunning eyes constantly upon him and when he was released at noon horrid shouts and shrieks pursued him every step of his homeward way For his laughter loving little schoolmates spared him not neither boy nor girl Yay Penrod they shouted How s your beautiful hair And Hi Penrod When you goin to get your parents consent And Say blue stars in heaven how s your beautiful eyes And Say Penrod how s your tree mores Does your tree mores thrill your bein Penrod And many other facetious inquiries hard to bear in public And when he reached the temporary shelter of his home he experienced no relief upon finding that Margaret was out for lunch He was as deeply embittered toward her as toward any other and considering her largely responsible for his misfortune he would have welcomed an opportunity to show her what he thought of her CHAPTER XVI WEDNESDAY MADNESS How long he was kept in after school that afternoon is not a matter of record but it was long Before he finally appeared upon the street he had composed an ample letter on a subject of general interest namely School Life under the supervision of Miss Spencer He had also received some scorching admonitions in respect to honourable behaviour regarding other people s letters and Margaret s had been returned to him with severe instructions to bear it straight to the original owner accompanied by full confession and apology As a measure of insurance that these things be done Miss Spence stated definitely her intention to hold a conversation by telephone with Margaret that evening Altogether the day had been unusually awful even for Wednesday and Penrod left the school house with the heart of an anarchist throbbing in his hot bosom It were more accurate indeed to liken him to the anarchist s characteristic weapon for as Penrod came out to the street he was in all inward respects a bomb loaded and ticking He walked moodily with a visible aspect of soreness A murmurous sound was thick about his head wherefore it is to be surmised that he communed with his familiar and one vehement oft repeated phrase beat like a tocsin of revolt upon the air Daw gone em He meant everybody the universe Particularly included evidently was a sparrow offensively cheerful upon a lamp post This self centred little bird allowed a pebble to pass overhead and remained unconcerned but a moment later feeling a jar beneath his feet and hearing the tinkle of falling glass he decided to leave Similarly and at the same instant Penrod made the same decision and the sparrow in flight took note of a boy likewise in flight The boy disappeared into the nearest alley and emerged therefrom breathless in the peaceful vicinity of his own home He entered the house clumped upstairs and down discovered Margaret reading a book in the library and flung the accursed letter toward her with loathing You can take the old thing he said bitterly I don t want it And before she was able to reply he was out of the room The next moment he was out of the house Daw GONE em he said And then across the street his soured eye fell upon his true comrade and best friend leaning against a picket fence and holding desultory converse with Mabel Rorebeck an attractive member of the Friday Afternoon Dancing Class that hated organization of which Sam and Penrod were both members Mabel was a shy little girl but Penrod had a vague understanding that Sam considered her two brown pig tails beautiful Howbeit Sam had never told his love he was in fact sensitive about it This meeting with the lady was by chance and although it afforded exquisite moments his heart was beating in an unaccustomed manner and he was suffering from embarrassment being at a loss also for subjects of conversation It is indeed no easy matter to chat easily with a person however lovely and beloved who keeps her face turned the other way maintains one foot in rapid and continuous motion through an arc seemingly perilous to her equilibrium and confines her responses both affirmative and negative to Uh huh Altogether Sam was sufficiently nervous without any help from Penrod and it was with pure horror that he heard his own name and Mabel s shrieked upon the ambient air with viperish insinuation Sam my and May bul OH oh Sam started violently Mabel ceased to swing her foot and both encarnadined looked up and down and everywhere for the invisible but well known owner of that voice It came again in taunting mockery Sammy s mad and I am glad And I know what will please him A bottle o wine to make him shine And Mabel Rorebeck to squeeze him Fresh ole thing said Miss Rorebeck becoming articulate And unreasonably including Sam in her indignation she tossed her head at him with an unmistakable effect of scorn She began to walk away Well Mabel Sam said plaintively following it ain t MY fault I didn t do anything It s Penrod I don t care she began pettishly when the viperish voice was again lifted Oh oh oh Who s your beau Guess I know Mabel and Sammy oh oh oh I caught you Then Mabel did one of those things that eternally perplex the slower sex She deliberately made a face not at the tree behind which Penrod was lurking but at the innocent and heart wrung Sam You needn t come limpin after me Sam Williams she said though Sam was approaching upon two perfectly sound legs And then she ran away at the top of her speed Run rigger run Penrod began inexcusably But Sam cut the persecutions short at this point Stung to fury he charged upon the sheltering tree in the Schofields yard Ordinarily at such a juncture Penrod would have fled keeping his own temper and increasing the heat of his pursuer s by back flung jeers But this was Wednesday and he was in no mood to run from Sam He stepped away from the tree awaiting the onset Well what you goin to do so much he said Sam did not pause to proffer the desired information Tcha got ny SENSE was the total extent of his vocal preliminaries before flinging himself headlong upon the taunter and the two boys went to the ground together Embracing they rolled they pommelled they hammered they kicked Alas this was a fight They rose flailing a while then renewed their embrace and grunting bestowed themselves anew upon our ever too receptive Mother Earth Once more upon their feet they beset each other sorely dealing many great blows ofttimes upon the air but with sufficient frequency upon resentful flesh Tears were jolted to the rims of eyes but technically they did not weep Got ny sense was repeated chokingly many many times also Dern ole fool and I ll SHOW you The peacemaker who appeared upon the animated scene was Penrod s great uncle Slocum This elderly relative had come to call upon missus Schofield and he was well upon his way to the front door when the mutterings of war among some shrubberies near the fence caused him to deflect his course in benevolent agitation Boys Boys Shame boys he said but as the originality of these expressions did not prove striking enough to attract any great attention from the combatants he felt obliged to assume a share in the proceedings It was a share entailing greater activity than he had anticipated and before he managed to separate the former friends he intercepted bodily an amount of violence to which he was wholly unaccustomed Additionally his attire was disarranged his hat was no longer upon his head and his temper was in a bad way In fact as his hat flew off he made use of words that under less extreme circumstances would have caused both boys to feel a much profounder interest than they did in great uncle Slocum I ll GET you Sam babbled Don t you ever dare to speak to me again Penrod Schofield long as you live or I ll whip you worse n I have this time Penrod squawked For the moment he was incapable of coherent speech and then failing in a convulsive attempt to reach his enemy his fury culminated upon an innocent object that had never done him the slightest harm Great uncle Slocum s hat lay upon the ground close by and Penrod was in the state of irritation that seeks an outlet too blindly as people say he HAD to do SOMETHING He kicked great uncle Slocum s hat with such sweep and precision that it rose swiftly and breasting the autumn breeze passed over the fence and out into the street Great uncle Slocum uttered a scream of anguish and immediately ceasing to peacemake ran forth to a more important rescue but the conflict was not renewed Sanity had returned to Sam Williams he was awed by this colossal deed of Penrod s and filled with horror at the thaught that he might be held as accessory to it Fleetly he fled pursued as far as the gate by the whole body of Penrod and thereafter by Penrod s voice alone You BETTER run You wait till I catch you You ll see what you get next time Don t you ever speak to me again as long as you Here he paused abruptly for great uncle Slocum had recovered his hat and was returning toward the gate After one glance at great uncle Slocum Penrod did not linger to attempt any explanation there are times when even a boy can see that apologies would seem out of place Penrod ran round the house to the backyard Here he was enthusiastically greeted by Duke You get away from me Penrod said hoarsely and with terrible gestures he repulsed the faithful animal who retired philosophically to the stable while his master let himself out of the back gate Penrod had decided to absent himself from home for the time being The sky was gray and there were hints of coming dusk in the air it was an hour suited to his turbulent soul and he walked with a sombre swagger Ran like a c ardy calf he sniffed half aloud alluding to the haste of Sam Williams in departure All he is ole c ardy calf Then as he proceeded up the alley a hated cry smote his ears Hi Penrod How s your tree mores And two jovial schoolboy faces appeared above a high board fence How s your beautiful hair Penrod they vociferated When you goin to git your parents consent What makes you think you re only pretty ole blue stars Penrod looked about feverishly for a missile and could find none to his hand but the surface of the alley sufficed he made mud balls and fiercely bombarded the vociferous fence Naturally hostile mud balls presently issued from behind this barricade and thus a campaign developed that offered a picture not unlike a cartoonist s sketch of a political campaign wherein this same material is used for the decoration of opponents But Penrod had been unwise he was outnumbered and the hostile forces held the advantageous side of the fence Mud balls can be hard as well as soggy some of those that reached Penrod were of no inconsiderable weight and substance and they made him grunt despite himself Finally one at close range struck him in the pit of the stomach whereupon he clasped himself about the middle silently and executed some steps in seeming imitation of a quaint Indian dance His plight being observed through a knothole his enemies climbed upon the fence and regarded him seriously Aw YOU RE all right ain t you old tree mores inquired one I ll SHOW you bellowed Penrod recovering his breath and he hurled a fat ball thoughtfully retained in hand throughout his agony to such effect that his interrogator disappeared backward from the fence without having taken any initiative of his own in the matter His comrade impulsively joined him upon the ground and the battle continued Through the gathering dusk it went on It waged but the hotter as darkness made aim more difficult and still Penrod would not be driven from the field Panting grunting hoarse from returning insults fighting on and on an indistinguishable figure in the gloom he held the back alley against all comers For such a combat darkness has one great advantage but it has an equally important disadvantage the combatant cannot see to aim on the other hand he cannot see to dodge And all the while Penrod was receiving two for one He became heavy with mud Plastered impressionistic and sculpturesque there was about him a quality of the tragic of the magnificent He resembled a sombre masterpiece by Rodin No one could have been quite sure what he was meant for Dinner bells tinkled in houses Then they were rung from kitchen doors Calling voices came urging from the distance calling boys names into the darkness They called and a note of irritation seemed to mar their beauty Then bells were rung again and the voices renewed appeals more urgent much more irritated They called and called and called THUD went the mud balls Thud Thud Blunk OOF said Penrod Sam Williams having dined with his family at their usual hour seven slipped unostentatiously out of the kitchen door as soon as he could after the conclusion of the meal and quietly betook himself to the Schofields corner Here he stationed himself where he could see all avenues of approach to the house and waited Twenty minutes went by and then Sam became suddenly alert and attentive for the arc light revealed a small grotesque figure slowly approaching along the sidewalk It was brown in colour shaggy and indefinite in form it limped excessively and paused to rub itself and to meditate Peculiar as the thing was Sam had no doubt as to its identity He advanced Lo Penrod he said cautiously and with a shade of formality Penrod leaned against the fence and lifting one leg tested the knee joint by swinging his foot back and forth a process evidently provocative of a little pain Then he rubbed the left side of his encrusted face and opening his mouth to its whole capacity as an aperture moved his lower jaw slightly from side to side thus triumphantly settling a question in his own mind as to whether or no a suspected dislocation had taken place Having satisfied himself on these points he examined both shins delicately by the sense of touch and carefully tested the capacities of his neck muscles to move his head in a wonted manner Then he responded somewhat gruffly Lo Where you been Sam said eagerly his formality vanishing Havin a mud fight I guess you did Sam exclaimed in a low voice What you goin to tell your Oh nothin Your sister telephoned to our house to see if I knew where you were said Sam She told me if I saw you before you got home to tell you sumpthing but not to say anything about it She said Miss Spence had telephoned to her but she said for me to tell you it was all right about that letter and she wasn t goin to tell your mother and father on you so you needn t say anything about it to em All right said Penrod indifferently She says you re goin to be in enough trouble without that Sam went on You re goin to catch fits about your Uncle Slocum s hat Penrod Well I guess I know it And about not comin home to dinner too Your mother telephoned twice to Mamma while we were eatin to see if you d come in our house And when they SEE you MY but you re goin to get the DICKENS Penrod Penrod seemed unimpressed though he was well aware that Sam s prophecy was no unreasonable one Well I guess I know it he repeated casually And he moved slowly toward his own gate His friend looked after him curiously then as the limping figure fumbled clumsily with bruised fingers at the latch of the gate there sounded a little solicitude in Sam s voice Say Penrod how how do you feel What Do you feel pretty bad No said Penrod and in spite of what awaited him beyond the lighted portals just ahead he spoke the truth His nerves were rested and his soul was at peace His Wednesday madness was over No said Penrod I feel bully CHAPTER XVII PENROD S BUSY DAY Although the pressure had thus been relieved and Penrod found peace with himself nevertheless there were times during the rest of that week when he felt a strong distaste for Margaret His schoolmates frequently reminded him of such phrases in her letter as they seemed least able to forget and for hours after each of these experiences he was unable to comport himself with human courtesy when constrained as at dinner to remain for any length of time in the same room with her But by Sunday these moods had seemed to pass he attended church in her close company and had no thought of the troubles brought upon him by her correspondence with a person who throughout remained unknown to him Penrod slumped far down in the pew with his knees against the back of that in front and he also languished to one side so that the people sitting behind were afforded a view of him consisting of a little hair and one bored ear The sermon a noble one searching and eloquent was but a persistent sound in that ear though now and then Penrod s attention would be caught by some detached portion of a sentence when his mind would dwell dully upon the phrases for a little while and lapse into a torpor At intervals his mother without turning her head would whisper Sit up Penrod causing him to sigh profoundly and move his shoulders about an inch this mere gesture of compliance exhausting all the energy that remained to him The black backs and gray heads of the elderly men in the congregation oppressed him they made him lethargic with a sense of long lives of repellent dullness But he should have been grateful to the lady with the artificial cherries upon her hat His gaze lingered there wandered away and hopelessly returned again and again to be a little refreshed by the glossy scarlet of the cluster of tiny globes He was not so fortunate as to be drowsy that would have brought him some relief and yet after a while his eyes became slightly glazed he saw dimly and what he saw was distorted The church had been built in the early Seventies and it contained some naive stained glass of that period The arch at the top of a window facing Penrod was filled with a gigantic Eye Of oyster white and raw blues and reds inflamed by the pouring sun it had held an awful place in the infantile life of Penrod Schofield for in his tenderer years he accepted it without question as the literal Eye of Deity He had been informed that the church was the divine dwelling and there was the Eye Nowadays being no longer a little child he had somehow come to know better without being told and though the great flaming Eye was no longer the terrifying thing it had been to him during his childhood it nevertheless retained something of its ominous character It made him feel spied upon and its awful glare still pursued him sometimes as he was falling asleep at night When he faced the window his feeling was one of dull resentment His own glazed eyes becoming slightly crossed with an ennui that was peculiarly intense this morning rendered the Eye more monstrous than it was It expanded to horrible size growing mountainous it turned into a volcano in the tropics and yet it stared at him indubitably an Eye implacably hostile to all rights of privacy forever Penrod blinked and clinched his eyelids to be rid of this dual image and he managed to shake off the volcano Then lowering the angle of his glance he saw something most remarkable and curiously out of place An inverted white soup plate was lying miraculously balanced upon the back of a pew a little distance in front of him and upon the upturned bottom of the soup plate was a brown cocoanut Mildly surprised Penrod yawned and in the effort to straighten his eyes came to life temporarily The cocoanut was revealed as Georgie Bassett s head and the soup plate as Georgie s white collar Georgie was sitting up straight as he always did in church and Penrod found this vertical rectitude unpleasant He knew that he had more to fear from the Eye than Georgie had and he was under the impression a correct one that Georgie felt on intimate terms with it and was actually fond of it Penrod himself would have maintained that he was fond of it if he had been asked He would have said so because he feared to say otherwise and the truth is that he never consciously looked at the Eye disrespectfully He would have been alarmed if he thought the Eye had any way of finding out how he really felt about it When not off his guard he always looked at it placatively By and by he sagged so far to the left that he had symptoms of a stitch in the side and rousing himself sat partially straight for several moments Then he rubbed his shoulders slowly from side to side against the back of the seat until his mother whispered Don t do that Penrod Upon this he allowed himself to slump inwardly till the curve in the back of his neck rested against the curved top of the back of the seat It was a congenial fit and Penrod again began to move slowly from side to side finding the friction soothing Even so slight a pleasure was denied him by a husky Stop that from his father Penrod sighed and slid farther down He scratched his head his left knee his right biceps and his left ankle after which he scratched his right knee his right ankle and his left biceps Then he said Oh hum unconsciously but so loudly that there was a reproving stir in the neighbourhood of the Schofield pew and his father looked at him angrily Finally his nose began to trouble him It itched and after scratching it he rubbed it harshly Another Stop that from his father proved of no avail being greeted by a desperate sounding whisper I GOT to And continuing to rub his nose with his right hand Penrod began to search his pockets with his left The quest proving fruitless he rubbed his nose with his left hand and searched with his right Then he abandoned his nose and searched feverishly with both hands going through all of his pockets several times What DO you want whispered his mother But Margaret had divined his need and she passed him her own handkerchief This was both thoughtful and thoughtless the latter because Margaret was in the habit of thinking that she became faint in crowds especially at the theatre or in church and she had just soaked her handkerchief with spirits of ammonia from a small phial she carried in her muff Penrod hastily applied the handkerchief to his nose and even more hastily exploded He sneezed stupendously he choked sneezed again wept passed into a light convulsion of coughing and sneezing together a mergence of sound that attracted much attention and after a few recurrent spasms convalesced into a condition marked by silent tears and only sporadic instances of sneezing By this time his family were unanimously scarlet his father and mother with mortification and Margaret with the effort to control the almost irresistible mirth that the struggles and vociferations of Penrod had inspired within her And yet her heart misgave her for his bloodshot and tearful eyes were fixed upon her from the first and remained upon her even when half blinded with his agony and their expression as terrible as that of the windowed Eye confronting her was not for an instant to be misunderstood Absolutely he believed that she had handed him the ammonia soaked handkerchief deliberately and with malice and well she knew that no power on earth could now or at any time henceforth persuade him otherwise Of course I didn t mean it Penrod she said at the first opportunity upon their homeward way I didn t notice that is I didn t think Unfortunately for the effect of sincerity she hoped to produce her voice became tremulous and her shoulders moved suspiciously Just you wait You ll see he prophesied in a voice now choking not with ammonia but with emotion Poison a person and then laugh in his face He spake no more until they had reached their own house though she made some further futile efforts at explanation and apology And after brooding abysmally throughout the meal that followed he disappeared from the sight of his family having answered with one frightful look his mother s timid suggestion that it was almost time for Sunday school He retired to his eyry the sawdust box in the empty stable and there gave rein to his embittered imaginings incidentally forming many plans for Margaret Most of these were much too elaborate but one was so alluring that he dwelt upon it working out the details with gloomy pleasure even after he had perceived its defects It involved some postponement in fact until Margaret should have become the mother of a boy about Penrod s present age This boy would be precisely like Georgie Bassett Penrod conceived that as inevitable and like Georgie he would be his mother s idol Penrod meant to take him to church and force him to blow his nose with an ammonia soaked handkerchief in the presence of the Eye and all the congregation Then Penrod intended to say to this boy after church Well that s exackly what your mother did to me and if you don t like it you better look out And the real Penrod in the sawdust box clenched his fists Come ahead then he muttered You talk too much Whereupon the Penrod of his dream gave Margaret s puny son a contemptuous thrashing under the eyes of his mother who besought in vain for mercy This plan was finally dropped not because of any lingering nepotism within Penrod but because his injury called for action less belated One after another he thought of impossible things one after another he thought of things merely inane and futile for he was trying to do something beyond his power Penrod was never brilliant or even successful save by inspiration At four o clock he came into the house still nebulous and as he passed the open door of the library he heard a man s voice not his father s To me said this voice the finest lines in all literature are those in Tennyson s Maud Had it lain for a century dead My dust would hear her and beat And blossom in purple and red There somewhere around near her feet I think I have quoted correctly continued the voice nervously but at any rate what I wished to ah say was that I often think of those ah words but I never think of them without thinking of of of YOU I ah The nervous voice paused and Penrod took an oblique survey of the room himself unobserved Margaret was seated in an easy chair and her face was turned away from Penrod so that her expression of the moment remained unknown to him Facing her and leaning toward her with perceptible emotion was mister Claude Blakely a young man with whom Penrod had no acquaintance though he had seen him was aware of his identity and had heard speech between missus Schofield and Margaret which indicated that mister Blakely had formed the habit of calling frequently at the house This was a brilliantly handsome young man indeed his face was so beautiful that even Penrod was able to perceive something about it which might be explicably pleasing at least to women And Penrod remembered that on the last evening before mister Robert Williams s departure for college Margaret had been peevish because Penrod had genially spent the greater portion of the evening with Robert and herself upon the porch Margaret made it clear later that she strongly preferred to conduct her conversations with friends unassisted and as Penrod listened to the faltering words of mister Claude Blakely he felt instinctively that in a certain contingency Margaret s indignation would be even more severe to day than on the former occasion mister Blakely coughed faintly and was able to continue I mean to say that when I say that what Tennyson says ah seems to to apply to to a feeling about you At this point finding too little breath in himself to proceed in spite of the fact that he had spoken in an almost inaudible tone mister Blakely stopped again Something about this little scene was making a deep impression upon Penrod What that impression was he could not possibly have stated but he had a sense of the imminence of a tender crisis and he perceived that the piquancy of affairs in the library had reached a point which would brand an intentional interruption as the act of a cold blooded ruffian Suddenly it was as though a strong light shone upon him he decided that it was mister Blakely who had told Margaret that her eyes were like blue stars in heaven THIS was the person who had caused the hateful letter to be written That decided Penrod his inspiration so long waited for had come I I feel that perhaps I am not plain said mister Blakely and immediately became red whereas he had been pale He was at least modest enough about his looks to fear that Margaret might think he had referred to them I mean not plain in another sense that is I mean not that I am not plain in saying what I mean to you I mean what you mean to ME I feel This was the moment selected by Penrod He walked carelessly into the library inquiring in a loud bluff voice Has anybody seen my dog around here anywheres mister Blakely had inclined himself so far toward Margaret and he was sitting so near the edge of the chair that only a really wonderful bit of instinctive gymnastics landed him upon his feet instead of upon his back As for Margaret she said Good gracious and regarded Penrod blankly Well said Penrod breezily I guess it s no use lookin for him he isn t anywheres around I guess I ll sit down Herewith he sank into an easy chair and remarked as in comfortable explanation I m kind of tired standin up anyway Even in this crisis Margaret was a credit to her mother s training Penrod have you met mister Blakely What Margaret primly performed the rite mister Blakely this is my little brother Penrod mister Blakely was understood to murmur How d ye do I m well said Penrod Margaret bent a perplexed gaze upon him and he saw that she had not divined his intentions though the expression of mister Blakely was already beginning to be a little compensation for the ammonia outrage Then as the protracted silence which followed the introduction began to be a severe strain upon all parties Penrod felt called upon to relieve it I didn t have anything much to do this afternoon anyway he said And at that there leaped a spark in Margaret s eye her expression became severe You should have gone to Sunday school she told him crisply Well I didn t said Penrod with a bitterness so significant of sufferings connected with religion ammonia and herself that Margaret after giving him a thoughtful look concluded not to urge the point mister Blakely smiled pleasantly I was looking out of the window a minute ago he said and I saw a dog run across the street and turn the corner What kind of a lookin dog was it Penrod inquired with languor Well said mister Blakely it was a it was a nice looking dog What colour was he He was ah white That is I think It wasn t Duke said Penrod Duke s kind of brownish gray like mister Blakely brightened Yes that was it he said This dog I saw first had another dog with him a brownish gray dog Little or big Penrod asked without interest Why Duke s a little dog Margaret intervened Of COURSE if it was little it must have been Duke It WAS little said mister Blakely too enthusiastically It was a little bit of a dog I noticed it because it was so little Couldn t a been Duke then said Penrod Duke s a kind of a middle sized dog He yawned and added I don t want him now I want to stay in the house this afternoon anyway And it s better for Duke to be out in the fresh air mister Blakely coughed again and sat down finding little to say It was evident also that Margaret shared his perplexity and another silence became so embarrassing that Penrod broke it I was out in the sawdust box he said but it got kind of chilly Neither of his auditors felt called upon to offer any comment and presently he added I thought I better come in here where it s warmer It s too warm said Margaret at once mister Blakely would you mind opening a window By all means the young man responded earnestly as he rose Maybe I d better open two Yes said Margaret that would be much better But Penrod watched mister Blakely open two windows to their widest and betrayed no anxiety His remarks upon the relative temperatures of the sawdust box and the library had been made merely for the sake of creating sound in a silent place When the windows had been open for several minutes Penrod s placidity though gloomy denoted anything but discomfort from the draft which was powerful the day being windy It was mister Blakely s turn to break a silence and he did it so unexpectedly that Margaret started He sneezed Perhaps Margaret began but paused apprehensively Perhaps per per Her apprehensions became more and more poignant her eyes seemed fixed upon some incredible disaster she appeared to inflate while the catastrophe she foresaw became more and more imminent All at once she collapsed but the power decorum had over her was attested by the mildness of her sneeze after so threatening a prelude Perhaps I d better put one of the windows down mister Blakely suggested Both I believe said Margaret The room has cooled off now I think mister Blakely closed the windows and returning to a chair near Margaret did his share in the production of another long period of quiet Penrod allowed this one to pass without any vocal disturbance on his part It may be however that his gaze was disturbing to mister Blakely upon whose person it was glassily fixed with a self forgetfulness that was almost morbid Didn t you enjoy the last meeting of the Cotillion Club Margaret said finally And upon mister Blakely s answering absently in the affirmative she suddenly began to be talkative He seemed to catch a meaning in her fluency and followed her lead a conversation ensuing which at first had all the outward signs of eagerness They talked with warm interest of people and events unknown to Penrod they laughed enthusiastically about things beyond his ken they appeared to have arranged a perfect way to enjoy themselves no matter whether he was with them or elsewhere but presently their briskness began to slacken the appearance of interest became perfunctory Within ten minutes the few last scattering semblances of gayety had passed and they lapsed into the longest and most profound of all their silences indoors that day Its effect upon Penrod was to make him yawn and settle himself in his chair Then mister Blakely coming to the surface out of deep inward communings snapped his finger against the palm of his hand impulsively By George he exclaimed under his breath What is it Margaret asked Did you remember something No it s nothing he said Nothing at all But by the way it seems a pity for you to be missing the fine weather I wonder if I could persuade you to take a little walk Margaret somewhat to the surprise of both the gentlemen present looked uncertain I don t know she said mister Blakely saw that she missed his point One can talk better in the open don t you think he urged with a significant glance toward Penrod Margaret also glanced keenly at Penrod Well perhaps And then I ll get my hat she said Penrod was on his feet before she left the room He stretched himself I ll get mine too he said But he carefully went to find it in a direction different from that taken by his sister and he joined her and her escort not till they were at the front door whither mister Blakely with a last flickering of hope had urged a flight in haste I been thinkin of takin a walk all afternoon said Penrod pompously Don t matter to me which way we go The exquisite oval of mister Claude Blakely s face merged into outlines more rugged than usual the conformation of his jaw became perceptible and it could be seen that he had conceived an idea which was crystallizing into a determination I believe it happens that this is our first walk together he said to Margaret as they reached the pavement but from the kind of tennis you play I judge that you could go a pretty good gait Do you like walking fast She nodded For exercise Shall we try it then You set the pace said Margaret I think I can keep up He took her at her word and the amazing briskness of their start seemed a little sinister to Penrod though he was convinced that he could do anything that Margaret could do and also that neither she nor her comely friend could sustain such a speed for long On the contrary they actually increased it with each fleeting block they covered Here he panted when they had thus put something more than a half mile behind them There isn t anybody has to have a doctor I guess What s the use our walkin so fast In truth Penrod was not walking for his shorter legs permitted no actual walking at such a speed his gait was a half trot Oh WE RE out for a WALK mister Blakely returned a note of gayety beginning to sound in his voice Marg ah Miss Schofield keep your head up and breathe through your nose That s it You ll find I was right in suggesting this It s going to turn out gloriously Now let s make it a little faster Margaret murmured inarticulately for she would not waste her breath in a more coherent reply Her cheeks were flushed her eyes were brimming with the wind but when she looked at Penrod they were brimming with something more Gurgling sounds came from her Penrod s expression had become grim He offered no second protest mainly because he likewise would not waste his breath and if he would he could not Of breath in the ordinary sense breath breathed automatically he had none He had only gasps to feed his straining lungs and his half trot which had long since become a trot was changed for a lope when mister Blakely reached his own best burst of speed And now people stared at the flying three The gait of Margaret and mister Blakely could be called a walk only by courtesy while Penrod s was becoming a kind of blind scamper At times he zigzagged other times he fell behind wabbling Anon with elbows flopping and his face sculptured like an antique mask he would actually forge ahead and then carom from one to the other of his companions as he fell back again Thus the trio sped through the coming of autumn dusk outflying the fallen leaves that tumbled upon the wind And still Penrod held to the task that he had set himself The street lamps flickered into life but on and on Claude Blakely led the lady and on and on reeled the grim Penrod Never once was he so far from them that they could have exchanged a word unchaperoned by his throbbing ear OH Margaret cried and halting suddenly she draped herself about a lamp post like a strip of bunting Guh uh guh GOODNESS she sobbed Penrod immediately drooped to the curb stone which he reached by pure fortune in a sitting position mister Blakely leaned against a fence and said nothing though his breathing was eloquent We we must go go home Margaret gasped We must if if we can drag ourselves Then Penrod showed them what mettle they he d tried to crack A paroxysm of coughing shook him he spoke through it sobbingly Drag S jus lul like a girl Ha why I walk OOF faster n that every day on my way to school He managed to subjugate a tendency to nausea What you want to go home for he said Le s go on In the darkness mister Claude Blakely s expression could not be seen nor was his voice heard For these and other reasons his opinions and sentiments may not be stated missus Schofield was looking rather anxiously forth from her front door when the two adult figures and the faithful smaller one came up the walk I was getting uneasy she said Papa and I came in and found the house empty It s after seven Oh mister Blakely is that you Good evening he said I fear I must be keeping an engagement Good night Good night Miss Schofield Good night Well good night Penrod called staring after him But mister Blakely was already too far away to hear him and a moment later Penrod followed his mother and sister into the house I let Della go to church missus Schofield said to Margaret You and I might help Katie get supper Not for a few minutes Margaret returned gravely looking at Penrod Come upstairs mamma I want to tell you something Penrod cackled hoarse triumph and defiance Go on Tell What I care You try to poison a person in church again and then laugh in his face you ll see what you get But after his mother had retired with Margaret to the latter s room he began to feel disturbed in spite of his firm belief that his cause was wholly that of justice victorious Margaret had insidious ways of stating a case and her point of view no matter how absurd or unjust was almost always adopted by mister and missus Schofield in cases of controversy Penrod became uneasy Perceiving himself to be in danger he decided that certain measures were warranted Unquestionably it would be well to know beforehand in what terms Margaret would couch the charges which he supposed he must face in open court that is to say at the supper table He stole softly up the stairs and flattening himself against the wall approached Margaret s door which was about an inch ajar He heard his mother making sounds which appalled him he took them for sobs And then Margaret s voice rang out in a peal of insane laughter Trembling he crept nearer the door Within the room Margaret was clinging to her mother and both were trying to control their hilarity He did it all to get even Margaret exclaimed wiping her eyes He came in at just the right time That GOOSE was beginning to talk his silly soft talk the way he does with every girl in town and he was almost proposing and I didn t know how to stop him And then Penrod came in and did it for me I could have hugged Penrod mamma I actually could And I saw he meant to stay to get even for that ammonia and oh I worked so hard to make him think I wanted him to GO Mamma mamma if you could have SEEN that walk That GOOSE kept thinking he could wear Penrod out or drop him behind but I knew he couldn t so long as Penrod believed he was worrying us and getting even And that GOOSE thought I WANTED to get rid of Penrod too and the conceited thing said it would turn out gloriously meaning we d be alone together pretty soon I d like to shake him You see I pretended so well in order to make Penrod stick to us that GOOSE believed I meant it And if he hadn t tried to walk Penrod off his legs he wouldn t have wilted his own collar and worn himself out and I think he d have hung on until you d have had to invite him to stay to supper and he d have stayed on all evening and I wouldn t have had a chance to write to Robert Williams Mamma there have been lots of times when I haven t been thankful for Penrod but to day I could have got down on my knees to you and papa for giving me such a brother In the darkness of the hall as a small but crushed and broken form stole away from the crack in the door a gigantic Eye seemed to form seemed to glare down upon Penrod warning him that the way of vengeance is the way of bafflement and that genius may not prevail against the trickeries of women This has been a NICE day Penrod muttered hoarsely CHAPTER XVIII ON ACCOUNT OF THE WEATHER There is no boredom not even an invalid s comparable to that of a boy who has nothing to do When a man says he has nothing to do he speaks idly there is always more than he can do Grown women never say they have nothing to do and when girls or little girls say they have nothing to do they are merely airing an affectation But when a boy has nothing to do he has actually nothing at all to do his state is pathetic and when he complains of it his voice is haunting missus Schofield was troubled by this uncomfortable quality in the voice of her son who came to her thrice in his search for entertainment or even employment one Saturday afternoon during the February thaw Few facts are better established than that the February thaw is the poorest time of year for everybody But for a boy it is worse than poorest it is bankrupt The remnant streaks of old soot speckled snow left against the north walls of houses have no power to inspire rather they are dreary reminders of sports long since carried to satiety One cares little even to eat such snow and the eating of icicles also has come to be a flaccid and stale diversion There is no ice to bear a skate there is only a vast sufficiency of cold mud practically useless Sunshine flickers shiftily coming and going without any honest purpose snow squalls blow for five minutes the flakes disappearing as they touch the earth half an hour later rain sputters turns to snow and then turns back to rain and the sun disingenuously beams out again only to be shut off like a rogue s lantern And all the wretched while if a boy sets foot out of doors he must be harassed about his overcoat and rubbers he is warned against tracking up the plastic lawn and sharply advised to stay inside the house Saturday might as well be Sunday Thus the season Penrod had sought all possible means to pass the time A full half hour of vehement yodelling in the Williams yard had failed to bring forth comrade Sam and at last a coloured woman had opened a window to inform Penrod that her intellect was being unseated by his vocalizations which surpassed in unpleasantness she claimed every sound in her previous experience and for the sake of definiteness she stated her age to be fifty three years and four months She added that all members of the Williams family had gone out of town to attend the funeral of a relative but she wished that they might have remained to attend Penrod s which she confidently predicted as imminent if the neighbourhood followed its natural impulse Penrod listened for a time but departed before the conclusion of the oration He sought other comrades with no success he even went to the length of yodelling in the yard of that best of boys Georgie Bassett Here was failure again for Georgie signalled to him through a closed window that a closeting with dramatic literature was preferable to the society of a playmate and the book that Georgie exhibited was openly labelled three hundred Choice Declamations Georgie also managed to convey another reason for his refusal of Penrod s companionship the visitor being conversant with lip reading through his studies at the movies TOO MUDDY Penrod went home Well missus Schofield said having almost exhausted a mother s powers of suggestion well why don t you give Duke a bath She was that far depleted when Penrod came to her the third time Mothers suggestions are wonderful for little children but sometimes lack lustre when a boy approaches twelve an age to which the ideas of a Swede farm hand would usually prove more congenial However the dim and melancholy eye of Penrod showed a pale gleam and he departed He gave Duke a bath The entertainment proved damp and discouraging for both parties Duke began to tremble even before he was lifted into the water and after his first immersion he was revealed to be a dog weighing about one fourth of what an observer of Duke when Duke was dry must have guessed his weight to be His wetness and the disclosure of his extreme fleshly insignificance appeared to mortify him profoundly He wept But presently under Penrod s thorough ministrations for the young master was inclined to make this bath last as long as possible Duke plucked up a heart and began a series of passionate attempts to close the interview As this was his first bath since September the effects were lavish and impressionistic both upon Penrod and upon the bathroom However the imperious boy s loud remonstrances contributed to bring about the result desired by Duke missus Schofield came running and eloquently put an end to Duke s winter bath When she had suggested this cleansing as a pleasant means of passing the time she assumed that it would take place in a washtub in the cellar and Penrod s location of the performance in her own bathroom was far from her intention Penrod found her language oppressive and having been denied the right to rub Duke dry with a bath towel or even with the cover of a table in the next room the dismal boy accompanied by his dismal dog set forth by way of the kitchen door into the dismal weather With no purpose in mind they mechanically went out to the alley where Penrod leaned morosely against the fence and Duke stood shivering close by his figure still emaciated and his tail absolutely withdrawn from view There was a cold wet wind however and before long Duke found his condition unendurable He was past middle age and cared little for exercise but he saw that something must be done Therefore he made a vigorous attempt to dry himself in a dog s way Throwing himself shoulders first upon the alley mud he slid upon it back downward he rolled and rolled and rolled He began to feel lively and rolled the more in every way he convinced Penrod that dogs have no regard for appearances Also having discovered an ex fish near the Herman and Verman cottage Duke confirmed an impression of Penrod s that dogs have a peculiar fancy in the matter of odours that they like to wear Growing livelier and livelier Duke now wished to play with his master Penrod was anything but fastidious nevertheless under the circumstances he withdrew to the kitchen leaving Duke to play by himself outside Della the cook was comfortably making rolls and entertaining a caller with a cup of tea Penrod lingered a few moments but found even his attention to the conversation ill received while his attempts to take part in it met outright rebuff His feelings were hurt he passed broodingly to the front part of the house and flung himself wearily into an armchair in the library With glazed eyes he stared at shelves of books that meant to him just what the wallpaper meant and he sighed from the abyss His legs tossed and his arms flopped he got up scratched himself exhaustively and shuffled to a window Ten desolate minutes he stood there gazing out sluggishly upon a soggy world During this time two wet delivery wagons and four elderly women under umbrellas were all that crossed his field of vision Somewhere in the world he thought there was probably a boy who lived across the street from a jail or a fire engine house and had windows worth looking out of Penrod rubbed his nose up and down the pane slowly continuously and without the slightest pleasure and he again scratched himself wherever it was possible to do so though he did not even itch There was nothing in his life Such boredom as he was suffering can become agony and an imaginative creature may do wild things to escape it many a grown person has taken to drink on account of less pressure than was upon Penrod during that intolerable Saturday A faint sound in his ear informed him that Della in the kitchen had uttered a loud exclamation and he decided to go back there However since his former visit had resulted in a rebuff that still rankled he paused outside the kitchen door which was slightly ajar and listened He did this idly and with no hope of hearing anything interesting or helpful Snakes Della exclaimed Didja say the poor man was seein snakes missus Cullen No Della missus Cullen returned dolorously jist one Flora says he niver see more th n one jist one big long ugly faced horrible black one the same one comin back an makin a fizzin n ise at um iv ry time he had the fit on um Twas alw ys the same snake an he d holler at Flora Here it comes ag in oh me soul he d holler The big black ugly faced thing it s as long as the front fence he d holler an it s makin a fizzin n ise at me an breathin in me face he d holler Fer th love o hivin Flora he d holler it s got a little black man wit a gassly white forehead a pokin of it along wit a broom handle an a sickin it on me the same as a boy sicks a dog on a poor cat Fer the love o hivin Flora he d holler cantcha fright it away from me before I go out o me head Poor Tom said Della with deep compassion An the poor man out of his head all the time an not knowin it Twas awful fer Flora to sit there an hear such things in the night like that You may believe yerself whin ye say it missus Cullen agreed Right the very night the poor soul died he was hollerin how the big black snake and the little black man wit the gassly white forehead a pokin it wit a broomstick had come fer um Fright em away Flora he was croakin in a v ice that hoarse an husky twas hard to make out what he says Fright em away Flora he says Tis the big black ugly faced

Cullen she protested Poor Tom I thought Flora was wrong last week whin she hid the whisky Twas takin it away from him that killed him an him already so sick Well said missus Cullen he hardly had the strengt to drink much she tells me after he see the big snake an the little black divil the first time Poor woman she says he talked so plain she sees em both herself iv ry time she looks at the poor body where it s laid out She says Don t tell me cried the impressionable Della Don t tell me missus Cullen I can most see em meself right here in me own kitchen Poor Tom To think whin I bought me new hat only last week the first time I d be wearin it d be to his funeral To morrow afternoon it is At two o clock said missus Cullen Ye ll be comin to th house to night o course Della I will said Della After what I ve been hearin from ye I m most afraid to come but I ll do it Poor Tom I remember the day him an Flora was married But the eavesdropper heard no more he was on his way up the back stairs Life and light and purpose had come to his face once more Margaret was out for the afternoon Unostentatiously he went to her room and for the next few minutes occupied himself busily therein He was so quiet that his mother sewing in her own room would not have heard him except for the obstinacy of one of the drawers in Margaret s bureau missus Schofield went to the door of her daughter s room What are you doing Penrod Nothin You re not disturbing any of Margaret s things are you No ma am said the meek lad What did you jerk that drawer open for Ma am You heard me Penrod Yes ma am I was just lookin for sumpthing For what missus Schofield asked You know that nothing of yours would be in Margaret s room Penrod don t you Ma am What was it you wanted she asked rather impatiently I was just lookin for some pins Very well she said and handed him two from the shoulder of her blouse I ought to have more he said I want about forty What for I just want to MAKE sumpthing Mamma he said plaintively My goodness Can t I even want to have a few pins without everybody makin such a fuss about it you d think I was doin a srime Doing a what Penrod A SRIME he repeated with emphasis and a moment s reflection enlightened his mother Oh a crime she exclaimed You MUST quit reading the murder trials in the newspapers Penrod And when you read words you don t know how to pronounce you ought to ask either your papa or me Well I am askin you about sumpthing now Penrod said Can t I even have a few PINS without stoppin to talk about everything in the newspapers Mamma Yes she said laughing at his seriousness and she took him to her room and bestowed upon him five or six rows torn from a paper of pins That ought to be plenty she said for whatever you want to make And she smiled after his retreating figure not noting that he looked softly bulky around the body and held his elbows unnaturally tight to his sides She was assured of the innocence of anything to be made with pins and forbore to press investigation For Penrod to be playing with pins seemed almost girlish Unhappy woman it pleased her to have her son seem girlish Penrod went out to the stable tossed his pins into the wheelbarrow then took from his pocket and unfolded six pairs of long black stockings indubitably the property of his sister Evidently missus Schofield had been a little late in making her appearance at the door of Margaret s room Penrod worked systematically he hung the twelve stockings over the sides of the wheelbarrow and placed the wheelbarrow beside a large packing box that was half full of excelsior One after another he stuffed the stockings with excelsior till they looked like twelve long black sausages Then he pinned the top of one stocking securely over the stuffed foot of another pinning the top of a third to the foot of the second the top of a fourth to the foot of the third and continued operations in this fashion until the twelve stockings were the semblance of one long and sinuous black body sufficiently suggestive to any normal eye He tied a string to one end of this unpleasant looking thing led it around the stable and by vigorous manipulations succeeded in making it wriggle realistically but he was not satisfied and dropping the string listlessly sat down in the wheelbarrow to ponder Penrod sometimes proved that there were within him the makings of an artist he had become fascinated by an idea and could not be content until that idea was beautifully realized He had meant to create a big long ugly faced horrible black snake with which to interest Della and her friend missus Cullen but he felt that results so far were too crude for exploitation Merely to lead the pinned stockings by a string was little to fulfill his ambitious vision Finally he rose from the wheelbarrow If I only had a cat he said dreamily CHAPTER XIX CREATIVE ART He went forth seeking The Schofield household was catless this winter but there was a nice white cat at the Williams Penrod strolled thoughtfully over to the Williams s yard He was entirely successful not even having been seen by the sensitive coloured woman aged fifty three years and four months But still Penrod was thoughtful The artist within him was unsatisfied with his materials and upon his return to the stable he placed the cat beneath an overturned box and once more sat down in the inspiring wheelbarrow pondering His expression concentrated and yet a little anxious was like that of a painter at work upon a portrait that may or may not turn out to be a masterpiece The cat did not disturb him by her purring though she was indeed already purring She was one of those cozy youngish cats plump even a little full bodied perhaps and rather conscious of the figure that are entirely conventional and domestic by nature and will set up a ladylike housekeeping anywhere without making a fuss about it If there be a fault in these cats overcomplacency might be the name for it they err a shade too sure of themselves and their assumption that the world means to treat them respectfully has just a little taint of the grande dame Consequently they are liable to great outbreaks of nervous energy from within engendered by the extreme surprises that life sometimes holds in store for them They lack the pessimistic imagination missus Williams s cat was content upon a strange floor and in the confining enclosure of a strange box She purred for a time then trustfully fell asleep Twas well she slumbered she would need all her powers presently She slumbered and dreamed not that she would wake to mingle with events that were to alter her serene disposition radically and cause her to become hasty tempered and abnormally suspicious for the rest of her life Meanwhile Penrod appeared to reach a doubtful solution of his problem His expression was still somewhat clouded as he brought from the storeroom of the stable a small fragment of a broken mirror two paint brushes and two old cans one containing black paint and the other white He regarded himself earnestly in the mirror then with some reluctance he dipped a brush into one of the cans and slowly painted his nose a midnight black He was on the point of spreading this decoration to cover the lower part of his face when he paused brush halfway between can and chin What arrested him was a sound from the alley a sound of drumming upon tin The eyes of Penrod became significant of rushing thoughts his expression cleared and brightened He ran to the alley doors and flung them open Oh Verman he shouted Marching up and down before the cottage across the alley Verman plainly considered himself to be an army Hanging from his shoulders by a string was an old tin wash basin whereon he beat cheerily with two dry bones once the chief support of a chicken Thus he assuaged his ennui Verman come on in here Penrod called I got sumpthing for you to do you ll like awful well Verman halted ceased to drum and stared His gaze was not fixed particularly upon Penrod s nose however and neither now nor later did he make any remark or gesture referring to this casual eccentricity He expected things like that upon Penrod or Sam Williams And as for Penrod himself he had already forgotten that his nose was painted Come on Verman Verman continued to stare not moving He had received such invitations before and they had not always resulted to his advantage Within that stable things had happened to him the like of which he was anxious to avoid in the future Oh come ahead Verman Penrod urged and divining logic in the reluctance confronting him he added This ain t goin to be anything like last time Verman I got sumpthing just SPLENDUD for you to do Verman s expression hardened he shook his head decisively Mo he said Oh COME on Verman Penrod pleaded It isn t anything goin to HURT you is it I tell you it s sumpthing you d give a good deal to GET to do if you knew what it is Mo said Verman firmly I mome maw woo Penrod offered arguments Look Verman he said Listen here a minute can t you How d you know you don t want to until you know what it is A person CAN T know they don t want to do a thing even before the other person tells em what they re goin to get em to do can they For all you know this thing I m goin to get you to do might be sumpthing you wouldn t miss doin for anything there is For all you know Verman it might be sumpthing like this well f rinstance s pose I was standin here and you were over there sort of like the way you are now and I says Hello Verman and then I d go on and tell you there was sumpthing I was goin to get you to do and you d say you wouldn t do it even before you heard what it was why where d be any sense to THAT For all you know I might of been goin to get you to eat a five cent bag o peanuts Verman had listened obdurately until he heard the last few words but as they fell upon his ear he relaxed and advanced to the stable doors smiling and extending his open right hand Aw wi he said Gi m here Well Penrod returned a trifle embarrassed I didn t say it WAS peanuts did I Honest Verman it s sumpthing you ll like better n a few old peanuts that most of em d prob ly have worms in em anyway All I want you to do is But Verman was not favourably impressed his face hardened again Mo he said and prepared to depart Look here Verman Penrod urged It isn t goin to hurt you just to come in here and see what I got for you is it You can do that much can t you Surely such an appeal must have appeared reasonable even to Verman especially since its effect was aided by the promising words See what I got for you Certainly Verman yielded to it though perhaps a little suspiciously He advanced a few cautious steps into the stable Look Penrod cried and he ran to the stuffed and linked stockings seized the leading string and vigorously illustrated his further remarks How s that for a big long ugly faced horr ble black ole snake Verman Look at her follow me all round anywhere I feel like goin Look at her wiggle will you though Look how I make her do anything I tell her to Lay down you ole snake you See her lay down when I tell her to Verman Wiggle you ole snake you See her wiggle Verman Hi Undoubtedly Verman felt some pleasure Now listen Verman Penrod continued hastening to make the most of the opportunity Listen I fixed up this good ole snake just for you I m goin to give her to you HI On account of a previous experience not unconnected with cats and likely to prejudice Verman Penrod decided to postpone mentioning missus Williams s pet until he should have secured Verman s cooperation in the enterprise irretrievably All you got to do he went on is to chase this good ole snake around and sort o laugh and keep pokin it with the handle o that rake yonder I m goin to saw it off just so s you can poke your good ole snake with it Verman Aw wi said Verman and extending his open hand again he uttered a hopeful request Peamup His host perceived that Verman had misunderstood him Peanuts he exclaimed My goodness I didn t say I HAD any peanuts did I I only said s pose f rinstance I DID have some My goodness You don t expeck me to go round here all day workin like a dog to make a good ole snake for you and then give you a bag o peanuts to hire you to play with it do you Verman My goodness Verman s hand fell with a little disappointment Aw wi he said consenting to accept the snake without the bonus That s the boy NOW we re all right Verman and pretty soon I m goin to saw that rake handle off for you too so s you can kind o guide your good ole snake around with it but first well first there s just one more thing s got to be done I ll show you it won t take but a minute Then while Verman watched him wonderingly he went to the can of white paint and dipped a brush therein It won t get on your clo es much or anything Verman he explained I only just got to But as he approached dripping brush in hand the wondering look was all gone from Verman determination took its place Mo he said turned his back and started for outdoors Look here Verman Penrod cried I haven t done anything to you yet have I It isn t goin to hurt you is it You act like a little teeny bit o paint was goin to kill you What s the matter of you I only just got to paint the top part of your face I m not goin to TOUCH the other part of it nor your hands or anything All I want MO said Verman from the doorway Oh my goodness moaned Penrod and in desperation he drew forth from his pocket his entire fortune All right Verman he said resignedly If you won t do it any other way here s a nickel and you can go and buy you some peanuts when we get through But if I give you this money you got to promise to wait till we ARE through and you got to promise to do anything I tell you to You goin to promise The eyes of Verman glistened he returned gave bond and grasping the coin burst into the rich laughter of a gourmand Penrod immediately painted him dead white above the eyes all round his head and including his hair It took all the paint in the can Then the artist mentioned the presence of missus Williams s cat explained in full his ideas concerning the docile animal and the long black snake and Della and her friend missus Cullen while Verman listened with anxiety but remained true to his oath They removed the stocking at the end of the long black snake and cut four holes in the foot and ankle of it They removed the excelsior placed missus Williams s cat in the stocking shook her down into the lower section of it drew her feet through the four holes there leaving her head in the toe of the stocking then packed the excelsior down on top of her and once more attached the stocking to the rest of the long black snake How shameful is the ease of the historian He sits in his dressing gown to write The enemy attacked in force The tranquil pen moving in a cloud of tobacco smoke leaves upon the page its little hieroglyphics serenely summing up the monstrous deeds and sufferings of men of action How cold how niggardly to state merely that Penrod and the painted Verman succeeded in giving the long black snake a motive power or tractor apparently its own but consisting of missus Williams s cat She was drowsy when they lifted her from the box she was still drowsy when they introduced part of her into the orifice of the stocking but she woke to full vigorous young life when she perceived that their purpose was for her to descend into the black depths of that stocking head first Verman held the mouth of the stocking stretched and Penrod manipulated the cat but she left her hearty mark on both of them before in a moment of unfortunate inspiration she humped her back while she was upside down and Penrod took advantage of the concavity to increase it even more than she desired The next instant she was assisted downward into the gloomy interior with excelsior already beginning to block the means of egress Gymnastic moments followed there were times when both boys hurled themselves full length upon the floor seizing the animated stocking with far extended hands and even when the snake was a complete thing with legs growing from its unquestionably ugly face either Penrod or Verman must keep a grasp upon it for it would not be soothed and refused over and over to calm itself even when addressed as Poor pussy and Nice ittle kitty Finally they thought they had their good ole snake about quieted down as Penrod said because the animated head had remained in one place for an unusual length of time though the legs produced a rather sinister effect of crouching and a noise like a distant planing mill came from the interior and then Duke appeared in the doorway He was still feeling lively CHAPTER XX THE DEPARTING GUEST By the time Penrod returned from chasing Duke to the next corner Verman had the long black snake down from the rafter where its active head had taken refuge with the rest of it dangling and both boys agreed that missus Williams s cat must certainly be able to see SOME anyway through the meshes of the stocking Well said Penrod it s gettin pretty near dark what with all this bother and mess we been havin around here and I expeck as soon as I get this good ole broom handle fixed out of the rake for you Verman it ll be about time to begin what we had to go and take all this trouble FOR mister Schofield had brought an old friend home to dinner with him Dear old Joe Gilling he called this friend when introducing him to missus Schofield mister Gilling as missus Schofield was already informed by telephone had just happened to turn up in town that day and had called on his classmate at the latter s office The two had not seen each other in eighteen years mister Gilling was a tall man clad highly in the mode and brought to a polished and powdered finish by barber and manicurist but his colour was peculiar being almost unhumanly florid and as missus Schofield afterward claimed to have noticed his eyes wore a nervous apprehensive look his hands were tremulous and his manner was queer and jerky at least that is how she defined it She was not surprised to hear him state that he was travelling for his health and not upon business He had not been really well for several years he said At that mister Schofield laughed and slapped him heartily on the back Oh mercy mister Gilling cried leaping in his chair What IS the matter Nothing mister Schofield laughed I just slapped you the way we used to slap each other on the campus What I was going to say was that you have no business being a bachelor With all your money and nothing to do but travel and sit around hotels and clubs no wonder you ve grown bilious Oh no I m not bilious mister Gilling said uncomfortably I m not bilious at all You ought to get married mister Schofield returned You ought He paused for mister Gilling had jumped again What s the trouble Joe Nothing I thought perhaps perhaps you were going to slap me on the back again Not this time mister Schofield said renewing his laughter Well is dinner about ready he asked turning to his wife Where are Margaret and Penrod Margaret s just come in missus Schofield answered She ll be down in a minute and Penrod s around somewhere Penrod mister Gilling repeated curiously in his nervous serious way What is Penrod And at this missus Schofield joined in her husband s laughter mister Schofield explained Penrod s our young son he said He s not much for looks maybe but he s been pretty good lately and sometimes we re almost inclined to be proud of him You ll see him in a minute old Joe Old Joe saw him even sooner Instantly as mister Schofield finished his little prediction the most shocking uproar ever heard in that house burst forth in the kitchen Distinctly Irish shrieks unlimited came from that quarter together with the clashing of hurled metal and tin the appealing sound of breaking china and the hysterical barking of a dog The library door flew open and missus Cullen appeared as a mingled streak crossing the room from one door to the other She was followed by a boy with a coal black nose and between his feet as he entered there appeared a big long black horrible snake with frantic legs springing from what appeared to be its head and it further fulfilled missus Cullen s description by making a fizzin noise Accompanying the snake and still faithfully endeavouring to guide it with the detached handle of a rake was a small black demon with a gassly white forehead and gasslier white hair Duke evidently still feeling his bath was doing all in his power to aid the demon in making the snake step lively A few kitchen implements followed this fugitive procession through the library doorway The long black snake became involved with a leg of the heavy table in the centre of the room The head developed spasms of agility there were clangings and rippings then the foremost section of the long black snake detached itself bounded into the air and after turning a number of somersaults became severally a torn stocking excelsior and a lunatic cat The ears of this cat were laid back flat upon its head and its speed was excessive upon a fairly circular track it laid out for itself in the library Flying round this orbit it perceived the open doorway passed through it thence to the kitchen and outward and onward Della having left the kitchen door open in her haste as she retired to the backyard The black demon with the gassly white forehead and hair finding himself in the presence of grown people who were white all over turned in his tracks and followed missus Williams s cat to the great outdoors Duke preceded Verman missus Cullen vanished Of the apparition only wreckage and a rightfully apprehensive Penrod were left But where missus Schofield began a few minutes later looking suddenly mystified where where Where what mister Schofield asked testily What are you talking about His nerves were jarred and he was rather hoarse after what he had been saying to Penrod That regretful necromancer was now upstairs doing unhelpful things to his nose over a washstand What do you mean by Where where where mister Schofield demanded I don t see any sense to it But where is your old classmate she cried Where s mister Gilling She was the first to notice this striking absence By George mister Schofield exclaimed Where IS old Joe Margaret intervened You mean that tall pale man who was calling she asked Pale no said her father He s as flushed as He was pale when I saw him Margaret said He had his hat and coat and he was trying to get out of the front door when I came running downstairs He couldn t work the catch for a minute but before I got to the foot of the steps he managed to turn it and open the door He went out before I could think what to say to him he was in such a hurry I guess everything was so confused you didn t notice but he s certainly gone missus Schofield turned to her husband But I thought he was going to stay to dinner she cried mister Schofield shook his head admitting himself floored Later having mentally gone over everything that might shed light on the curious behaviour of old Joe he said without preface He wasn t at all dissipated when we were in college missus Schofield nodded severely Maybe this was just the best thing could have happened to him after all she said It may be her husband returned I don t say it isn t BUT that isn t going to make any difference in what I m going to do to Penrod CHAPTER XXI YEARNINGS The next day a new ambition entered into Penrod Schofield it was heralded by a flourish of trumpets and set up a great noise within his being On his way home from Sunday school he had paused at a corner to listen to a brass band which was returning from a funeral playing a medley of airs from The Merry Widow and as the musicians came down the street walking so gracefully the sun picked out the gold braid upon their uniforms and splashed fire from their polished instruments Penrod marked the shapes of the great bass horns the suave sculpture of their brazen coils and the grand sensational flare of their mouths And he saw plainly that these noble things to be mastered needed no more than some breath blown into them during the fingering of a few simple keys Then obediently they gave forth those vast but dulcet sounds which stirred his spirit as no other sounds could stir it quite The leader of the band walking ahead was a pleasing figure nothing more Penrod supposed him to be a mere decoration and had never sympathized with Sam Williams deep feeling about drum majors The cornets the trombones the smaller horns were rather interesting of course and the drums had charm especially the bass drum which must be partially supported by a youth in front but immeasurably above all these what fascinated Penrod was the little man with the monster horn There Penrod s widening eyes remained transfixed upon the horn so dazzling with its broad spaces of brassy highlights and so overwhelming with its mouth as wide as a tub that there was something almost threatening about it The little elderly band musician walked manfully as he blew his great horn and in that pompous engine of sound the boy beheld a spectacle of huge forces under human control To Penrod the horn meant power and the musician meant mastery over power though of course Penrod did not know that this was how he really felt about the matter Grandiloquent sketches were passing and interchanging before his mind s eye Penrod in noble raiment marching down the staring street his shoulders swaying professionally the roar of the horn he bore submerging all other sounds Penrod on horseback blowing the enormous horn and leading wild hordes to battle while Marjorie Jones looked on from the sidewalk Penrod astounding his mother and father and sister by suddenly serenading them in the library Why Penrod where DID you learn to play like this These were vague and shimmering glories of vision rather than definite plans for his life work yet he did with all his will determine to own and play upon some roaring instrument of brass And after all this was no new desire of his it was only an old one inflamed to take a new form Nor was music the root of it for the identical desire is often uproarious among them that hate music What stirred in Penrod was new neither in him nor in the world but old old as old Adam old as the childishness of man All children have it of course they are all anxious to Make a Noise in the World While the band approached Penrod marked the time with his feet then he fell into step and accompanied the musicians down the street keeping as near as possible to the little man with the big horn There were four or five other boys strangers also marching with the band but these were light spirits their flushed faces and prancing legs proving that they were merely in a state of emotional reaction to music Penrod on the contrary was grave He kept his eyes upon the big horn and now and then he gave an imitation of it His fingers moved upon invisible keys his cheeks puffed out and from far down in his throat he produced strange sounds Taw p taw p taw Taw p taw p taw PAW The other boys turned back when the musicians ceased to play but Penrod marched on still keeping close to what so inspired him He stayed with the band till the last member of it disappeared up a staircase in an office building down at the business end of the street and even after that he lingered a while looking at the staircase Finally however he set his face toward home whither he marched in a procession the visible part of which consisted of himself alone All the way the rhythmic movements of his head kept time with his marching feet and also with a slight rise and fall of his fingers at about the median line of his abdomen And pedestrians who encountered him in this preoccupation were not surprised to hear as he passed a few explosive little vocalizations Taw p taw p taw TAW Taw aw HAW These were the outward symptoms of no fleeting impulse but of steadfast desire therefore they were persistent The likeness of the great bass horn remained upon the retina of his mind s eye losing nothing of its brazen enormity with the passing of hours nor abating in his mind s ear one whit of its fascinating blatancy Penrod might have forgotten almost anything else more readily for such a horn has this double compulsion people cannot possibly keep themselves from looking at its possessor and they certainly have GOT to listen to him Penrod was preoccupied at dinner and during the evening now and then causing his father some irritation by croaking Taw p taw p taw while the latter was talking And when bedtime came for the son of the house he mounted the stairs in a rhythmic manner and p tawed himself through the upper hall as far as his own chamber Even after he had gone to bed there came a revival of these manifestations His mother had put out his light for him and had returned to the library downstairs three quarters of an hour had elapsed since then and Margaret was in her room next to his when a continuous low croaking which she was just able to hear suddenly broke out into loud triumphal blattings TAW p taw p taw aw HAW P taw WAW aw Aw PAW Penrod Margaret called stop that I m trying to write letters If you don t quit and go to sleep I ll call papa up and you ll SEE The noise ceased or rather it tapered down to a desultory faint croaking which finally died out but there can be little doubt that Penrod s last waking thoughts were of instrumental music And in the morning when he woke to face the gloomy day s scholastic tasks something unusual and eager fawned in his face with the return of memory Taw p taw he began PAW All day in school and out his mind was busy with computations not such as are prescribed by mathematical pedants but estimates of how much old rags and old iron would sell for enough money to buy a horn Happily the next day at lunch he was able to dismiss this problem from his mind he learned that his Uncle Joe would be passing through town on his way from Nevada the following afternoon and all the Schofield family were to go to the station to see him Penrod would be excused from school At this news his cheeks became pink and for a moment he was breathless Uncle Joe and Penrod did not meet often but when they did Uncle Joe invariably gave Penrod money Moreover he always managed to do it privately so that later there was no bothersome supervision Last time he had given Penrod a silver dollar At thirty five minutes after two Wednesday afternoon Uncle Joe s train came into the station and Uncle Joe got out and shouted among his relatives At eighteen minutes before three he was waving to them from the platform of the last car having just slipped a two dollar bill into Penrod s breast pocket And at seven minutes after three Penrod opened the door of the largest music store in town A tall exquisite fair man evidently a musical earl stood before him leaning whimsically upon a piano of the highest polish The sight abashed Penrod not a bit his remarkable financial condition even made him rather peremptory See here he said brusquely I want to look at that big horn in the window Very well said the earl look at it And leaned more luxuriously upon the polished piano I meant Penrod began but paused something daunted while an unnamed fear brought greater mildness into his voice as he continued I meant I How much IS that big horn How much the earl repeated I mean said Penrod how much is it worth I don t know the earl returned Its price is eighty five dollars Eighty fi Penrod began mechanically but was forced to pause and swallow a little air that obstructed his throat as the difference between eighty five and two became more and more startling He had entered the store rich in the last ten seconds he had become poverty stricken Eighty five dollars was the same as eighty five millions Shall I put it aside for you asked the salesman earl while you look around the other stores to see if there s anything you like better I guess I guess not said Penrod whose face had grown red He swallowed again scraped the floor with the side of his right shoe scratched the back of his neck and then trying to make his manner casual and easy Well I can t stand around here all day he said I got to be gettin on up the street Business I suppose Penrod turning to the door suspected jocularity but he found himself without recourse he was nonplussed Sure you won t let me have that horn tied up in nice wrapping paper in case you decide to take it Penrod was almost positive that the spirit of this question was satirical but he was unable to reply except by a feeble shake of the head though ten minutes later as he plodded forlornly his homeward way he looked over his shoulder and sent backward a few words of morose repartee Oh I am am I he muttered evidently concluding a conversation which he had continued mentally with the salesman Well you re double anything you call me so that makes you a smart Aleck twice Ole double smart Aleck After that he walked with the least bit more briskness but not much No wonder he felt discouraged there are times when eighty five dollars can be a blow to anybody Penrod was so stunned that he actually forgot what was in his pocket He passed two drug stores and they had absolutely no meaning to him He walked all the way without spending a cent At home he spent a moment in the kitchen pantry while the cook was in the cellar then he went out to the stable and began some really pathetic experiments His materials were the small tin funnel which he had obtained in the pantry and a short section of old garden hose He inserted the funnel into one end of the garden hose and made it fast by wrappings of cord Then he arranged the hose in a double circular coil tied it so that it would remain coiled and blew into the other end He blew and blew and blew he set his lips tight together as he had observed the little musician with the big horn set his and blew and sputtered and sputtered and blew but nothing of the slightest importance happened in the orifice of the funnel Still he blew He began to be dizzy his eyes watered his expression became as horrible as a strangled person s He but blew the more He stamped his feet and blew He staggered to the wheelbarrow sat and blew and yet the funnel uttered nothing it seemed merely to breathe hard It would not sound like a horn and when Penrod finally gave up he had to admit piteously that it did not look like a horn No boy over nine could have pretended that it was a horn He tossed the thing upon the floor and leaned back in the wheelbarrow inert Yay Penrod Sam Williams appeared in the doorway and behind Sam Master Roderick Magsworth Bitts Junior Yay there Penrod made no response The two came in and Sam picked up the poor contrivance Penrod had tossed upon the floor What s this ole dingus Sam asked Nothin Well what s it for Nothin said Penrod It s a kind of a horn What kind For music said Penrod simply Master Bitts laughed loud and long he was derisive Music he yipped I thought you meant a cow s horn He says it s a music horn Sam What you think o that Sam blew into the thing industriously It won t work he announced Course it won t Roddy Bitts shouted You can t make it go without you got a REAL horn I m goin to get me a real horn some day before long and then you ll see me goin up and down here playin it like sixty I ll Some day before long Sam mocked Yes we will Why n t you get it to day if you re goin to I would said Roddy I d go get the money from my father right now only he wouldn t give it to me Sam whooped and Penrod in spite of his great depression uttered a few jibing sounds I d get MY father to buy me a fire engine and team o HORSES Sam bellowed only he wouldn t Listen can t you cried Roddy I mean he would most any time but not this month I can t have any money for a month beginning last Saturday because I got paint on one of our dogs and he came in the house with it on him and got some on pretty near everything If it hadn t a been for that Oh yes said Sam If it hadn t a been for that It s always SUMPTHING It is not Well then why n t you go GET a real horn Roddy s face had flushed with irritation Well didn t I just TELL you he began but paused while the renewal of some interesting recollection became visible in his expression Why I COULD if I wanted to he said more calmly It wouldn t be a new one maybe I guess it would be kind of an old one but Oh a toy horn said Sam I expect one you had when you were three years old and your mother stuck it up in the attic to keep till you re dead or sumpthing It s not either any toy horn Roddy insisted It s a reg lar horn for a band and I could have it as easy as anything The tone of this declaration was so sincere that it roused the lethargic Penrod Roddy is that true he sat up to inquire piercingly Of course it is Master Bitts returned What you take me for I could go get that horn this minute if I wanted to A real one honest Well didn t I say it was a real one Like in the BAND I said so didn t I I guess you mean one of those little ones said Penrod No sir Roddy insisted stoutly it s a big one It winds around in a big circle that would go all the way around a pretty fat man What store is it in It s not in any store said Roddy It s at my Uncle Ethelbert s He s got this horn and three or four pianos and a couple o harps and Does he keep a music store No These harps and pianos and all such are old ones awful old Oh said Sam he runs a second hand store He does not Master Bitts returned angrily He doesn t do anything He s just got em He s got forty one guitars Yay Sam whooped and jumped up and down Listen to Roddy Bitts makin up lies You look out Sam Williams said Roddy threateningly You look out how you call me names What name d I call you You just the same as said I told lies That s just as good as callin me a liar isn t it No said Sam but I got a right to if I want to Haven t I Penrod How Roddy demanded hotly How you got a right to Because you can t prove what you said Well said Roddy you d be just as much of one if you can t prove what I said WASN T true No sir You either got to prove it or be a liar Isn t that so Penrod Yes sir Penrod ruled with a little importance that s the way it is Roddy Well then said Roddy come on over to my Uncle Ethelbert s and I ll show you No said Sam I wouldn t walk over there just to find out sumpthing I already know isn t so Outside of a music store there isn t anybody in the world got forty one guitars I ve heard lots o people TALK but I never heard such a big l You shut up shouted Roddy You ole Penrod interposed Why n t you show us the horn Roddy he asked You said you could get it You show us the horn and we ll believe you If you show us the horn Sam ll haf to take what he said back won t you Sam Yes said Sam and added He hasn t got any He went and told a Roddy s eyes were bright with rage he breathed noisily I haven t he cried You just wait here and I ll show you And he ran furiously from the stable CHAPTER XXII THE HORN OF FAME Bet he won t come back said Sam Well he might Well if he does and he hasn t got any horn I got a right to call him anything I want to and he s got to stand it And if he doesn t come back Sam continued as by the code then I got a right to call him whatever I like next time I ketch him out I expect he ll have SOME kind of ole horn maybe said Penrod No the skeptical Sam insisted he won t But Roddy did Twenty minutes elapsed and both the waiting boys had decided that they were legally entitled to call him whatever they thought fitting when he burst in puffing and in his hands he bore a horn It was a real one and of a kind that neither Penrod nor Sam had ever seen before though they failed to realize this because its shape was instantly familiar to them No horn could have been simpler it consisted merely of one circular coil of brass with a mouthpiece at one end for the musician and a wide flaring mouth of its own for the noise at the other But it was obviously a second hand horn dents slightly marred it here and there and its surface was dull rather greenish There were no keys and a badly faded green cord and tassel hung from the coil Even so shabby a horn as this electrified Penrod It was not a stupendous horn but it was a horn and when a boy has been sighing for the moon a piece of green cheese will satisfy him for he can play that it is the moon Gimme that HORN Penrod shouted as he dashed for it YAY Sam cried and sought to wrest it from him Roddy joined the scuffle trying to retain the horn but Penrod managed to secure it With one free hand he fended the others off while he blew into the mouthpiece Let me have it Sam urged You can t do anything with it Lemme take it Penrod No said Roddy Let ME My goodness Ain t I got any right to blow my own horn They pressed upon Penrod who frantically fended and frantically blew At last he remembered to compress his lips and force the air through the compression A magnificent snort from the horn was his reward He removed his lips from the mouthpiece and capered in pride Hah he cried Hear that I guess I can t play this good ole horn Oh no During his capers Sam captured the horn But Sam had not made the best of his opportunities as an observer of bands he thrust the mouthpiece deep into his mouth and blew until his expression became one of agony No no Penrod exclaimed You haven t got the secret of blowin a horn Sam What s the use your keepin hold of it when you don t know any more about it n that It ain t makin a sound You lemme have that good ole horn back Sam Haven t you got sense enough to see I know how to PLAY Laying hands upon it he jerked it away from Sam who was a little piqued over the failure of his own efforts especially as Penrod now produced a sonarous blat quite a long one Sam became cross My goodness Roddy Bitts said peevishly Ain t I ever goin to get a turn at my own horn Here you ve had two turns Penrod and even Sam Williams Sam s petulance at once directed itself toward Roddy partly because of the latter s tactless use of the word even and the two engaged in controversy while Penrod was left free to continue the experiments which so enraptured him Your own horn Sam sneered I bet it isn t yours Anyway you can t prove it s yours and that gives me a right to call you any You better not It is too mine It s just the same as mine No sir said Sam I bet you got to take it back where you got it and that s not anything like the same as yours so I got a perfect right to call you whatev I do NOT haf to take it back where I got it either Roddy cried more and more irritated by his opponent s persistence in stating his rights in this matter I BET they told you to bring it back said Sam tauntingly They didn t either There wasn t anybody there Yay Then you got to get it back before they know it s gone I don t either any such a thing I heard my Uncle Ethelbert say Sunday he didn t want it He said he wished somebody d take that horn off his hands so s he could buy sumpthing else That s just exactly what he said I heard him tell my mother He said I guess I prackly got to give it away if I m ever goin to get rid of it Well when my own uncle says he wants to give a horn away and he wishes he could get rid of it I guess it s just the same as mine soon as I go and take it isn t it I m goin to keep it Sam was shaken but he had set out to demonstrate those rights of his and did not mean to yield them Yes you ll have a NICE time he said next time your uncle goes to play on that horn and can t find it No sir I got a perfect ri My uncle don t PLAY on it Roddy shrieked It s an ole wore out horn nobody wants and it s mine I tell you I can blow on it or bust it or kick it out in the alley and leave it there if I want to No you can t I can too No you can t You can t PROVE you can and unless you prove it I got a perf Roddy stamped his foot I can too he shrieked You ole durn jackass I can too I can can can can Penrod suddenly stopped his intermittent production of blats and intervened I know how you can prove it Roddy he said briskly There s one way anybody can always prove sumpthing belongs to them so that nobody d have a right to call them what they wanted to You can prove it s yours EASY How Well said Penrod if you give it away What you mean asked Roddy frowning Well look here Penrod began brightly You can t give anything away that doesn t belong to you can you No So then the resourceful boy continued f r instance if you give this ole horn to me that d prove it was yours and Sam d haf to say it was and he wouldn t have any right to I won t do it said Roddy sourly I don t want to give you that horn What I want to give you anything at all for Penrod sighed as if the task of reaching Roddy s mind with reason were too heavy for him Well if you don t want to prove it and rather let us have the right to call you anything we want to well all right then he said You look out what you call me Roddy cried only the more incensed in spite of the pains Penrod was taking with him I don t haf to prove it It s MINE What kind o proof is that Sam Williams demanded severely You GOT to prove it and you can t do it Roddy began a reply but his agitation was so great that what he said had not attained coherency when Penrod again intervened He had just remembered something important Oh I know Roddy he exclaimed If you sell it that d prove it was yours almost as good as givin it away What ll you take for it I don t want to sell it said Roddy sulkily Yay Yay YAY shouted the taunting Sam Williams whose every word and sound had now become almost unbearable to Master Bitts Sam was usually so good natured that the only explanation of his conduct must lie in the fact that Roddy constitutionally got on his nerves He KNOWS he can t prove it He s a goner and now we can begin callin him anything we can think of I choose to call him one first Penrod Roddy you re a Wait shouted Penrod for he really believed Roddy s claims to be both moral and legal When an uncle who does not even play upon an old second hand horn wishes to get rid of that horn and even complains of having it on his hands it seems reasonable to consider that the horn becomes the property of a nephew who has gone to the trouble of carrying the undesired thing out of the house Penrod determined to deal fairly The difference between this horn and the one in the music store window seemed to him just about the difference between two and eighty five He drew forth the green bill from his pocket Roddy he said I ll give you two dollars for that horn Sam Williams s mouth fell open he was silenced indeed But for a moment the confused and badgered Roddy was incredulous he had not dreamed that Penrod possessed such a sum Lemme take a look at that money he said If at first there had been in Roddy s mind a little doubt about his present rights of ownership he had talked himself out of it Also his financial supplies for the month were cut off on account of the careless dog Finally he thought that the horn was worth about fifty cents I ll do it Penrod he said with decision Thereupon Penrod shouted aloud prancing up and down the carriage house with the horn Roddy was happy too land mingled his voice with Penrod s Hi Hi Hi shouted Roddy Bitts I m goin to buy me an air gun down at Fox s hardware store And he departed galloping He returned the following afternoon School was over and Penrod and Sam were again in the stable Penrod was practising upon the horn with Sam for an unenthusiastic spectator and auditor Master Bitts brow was heavy he looked uneasy Penrod he began I got to Penrod removed the horn briefly from his lips Don t come bangin around here and interrup me all the time he said severely I got to practice And he again pressed the mouthpiece to his lips He was not of those whom importance makes gracious Look here Penrod said Roddy I got to have that horn back Penrod lowered the horn quickly enough at this What you talkin about he demanded What you want to come bangin around here for and I came around here for that horn Master Bitts returned and his manner was both dogged and apprehensive the apprehension being more prevalent when he looked at Sam I got to have that horn he said Sam who had been sitting in the wheelbarrow jumped up and began to dance triumphantly Yay It WASN T his after all Roddy Bitts told a big l I never either Roddy almost wailed Well what you want the horn back for the terrible Sam demanded Well cause I want it I got a right to want it if I want to haven t I Penrod s face had flushed with indignation You look here Sam he began hotly Didn t you hear Roddy say this was his horn He said it Sam declared He said it a million times Well and didn t he sell this horn to me Yes SIR Didn t I pay him money cash down for it Two dollars Well and ain t it my horn now Sam You bet you YES sir Penrod went on with vigour It s my horn now whether it belonged to you or not Roddy because you SOLD it to me and I paid my good ole money for it I guess a thing belongs to th person that paid their own money for it doesn t it I don t haf to give up my own propaty even if you did come on over here and told us a big l I NEVER shouted Roddy It was my horn too and I didn t tell any such a thing He paused then reverting to his former manner said stubbornly I got to have that horn back I GOT to Why n t you tell us what FOR then Sam insisted Roddy s glance at this persecutor was one of anguish I know my own biz nuss he muttered And while Sam jeered Roddy turned to Penrod desperately You gimme that horn back I got to have it But Penrod followed Sam s lead Well why can t you tell us what FOR he asked Perhaps if Sam had not been there Roddy could have unbosomed himself He had no doubt of his own virtue in this affair and he was conscious that he had acted in good faith throughout though perhaps a little impulsively But he was in a predicament and he knew that if he became more explicit Sam could establish with undeniable logic those rights about which he had been so odious the day before Such triumph for Sam was not within Roddy s power to contemplate he felt that he would rather die or sumpthing I got to have that horn he reiterated woodenly Penrod had no intention to humour this preposterous boy and it was only out of curiosity that he asked Well if you want the horn back where s the two dollars I spent it I bought an air gun for a dollar and sixty five cents and three sodies and some candy with the rest I ll owe you the two dollars Penrod I m willing to do that much Well why don t you give him the air gun asked the satirical Sam and owe him the rest I can t Papa took the air gun away from me because he didn t like sumpthing I did with it I got to owe you the whole two dollars Penrod Look here Roddy said Penrod Don t you s pose I d rather keep this horn and blow on it than have you owe me two dollars There was something about this simple question which convinced Roddy that his cause was lost His hopes had been but faint from the beginning of the interview Well said Roddy For a time he scuffed the floor with his shoe Daw gone it he said at last and he departed morosely Penrod had already begun to practice again and mister Williams after vain appeals to be permitted to practice in turn sank into the wheelbarrow in a state of boredom not remarkable under the circumstances Then Penrod contrived it may have been accidental to produce at one blast two tones which varied in pitch His pride and excitement were extreme though not contagious Listen Sam he shouted How s THAT for high The bored Sam made no response other than to rise languidly to his feet stretch and start for home Left alone Penrod s practice became less ardent he needed the stimulus of an auditor With the horn upon his lap he began to rub the greenish brass surface with a rag He meant to make this good ole two dollar horn of his LOOK like sumpthing Presently moved by a better idea he left the horn in the stable and went into the house soon afterward appearing before his mother in the library Mamma he said complainingly Della won t But missus Schofield checked him Sh Penrod your father s reading the paper Penrod glanced at mister Schofield who sat near the window reading by the last light of the early sunset Well I know it said Penrod lowering his voice But I wish you d tell Della to let me have the silver polish She says she won t and I want to Be quiet Penrod you can t have the silver polish But mamma Not another word Can t you see you re interrupting your father Go on papa mister Schofield read aloud several despatches from abroad and after each one of them Penrod began in a low but pleading tone Mamma I want SH Penrod mister Schofield continued to read and Penrod remained in the room for he was determined to have the silver polish Here s something curious said mister Schofield as his eye fell upon a paragraph among the locals What Valuable relic missing mister Schofield read It was reported at police headquarters to day that a valuable object had been stolen from the collection of antique musical instruments owned by E Magsworth Bitts seven hundred twenty four Central Avenue The police insist that it must have been an inside job but mister Magsworth Bitts inclines to think it was the work of a negro as only one article was removed and nothing else found to be disturbed The object stolen was an ancient hunting horn dating from the eighteenth century and claimed to have belonged to Louis XV King of France It was valued at about twelve hundred and fifty dollars missus Schofield opened her mouth wide Why that IS curious she exclaimed She jumped up Penrod But Penrod was no longer in the room What s the matter mister Schofield inquired Penrod said missus Schofield breathlessly HE bought an old horn like one in old hunting pictures yesterday He bought it with some money Uncle Joe gave him He bought it from Roddy Bitts Where d he go Together they rushed to the back porch Penrod had removed the lid of the cistern he was kneeling beside it and the fact that the diameter of the opening into the cistern was one inch less than the diameter of the coil of Louis the Fifteenth s hunting horn was all that had just saved Louis the Fifteenth s hunting horn from joining the drowned trousers of Herman Such was Penrod s instinct and thus loyally he had followed it He was dragged into the library expecting anything whatever The dreadful phrases of the newspaper item rang through his head like the gongs of delirium Police headquarters Work of a negro King of France Valued at about twelve hundred and fifty dollars Eighty five dollars had dismayed him twelve hundred and fifty was unthinkable Nightmares were coming to life before his eyes But a light broke slowly it came first to mister and missus Schofield and it was they who illuminated Penrod Slowly slowly as they spoke more and more pleasantly to him it began to dawn upon him that this trouble was all Roddy s And when mister Schofield went to take the horn to the house of mister Ethelbert Magsworth Bitts Penrod sat quietly with his mother mister Schofield was gone an hour and a half Upon his solemn return he reported that Roddy s father had been summoned by telephone to bring his son to the house of Uncle Ethelbert mister Bitts had forthwith appeared with Roddy and when mister Schofield came away Roddy was still after half an hour s previous efforts explaining his honourable intentions mister Schofield indicated that Roddy s condition was agitated and that he was having a great deal of difficulty in making his position clear Penrod s imagination paused outside the threshold of that room in mister Ethelbert Magsworth Bitts house and awe fell upon him when he thought of it Roddy seemed to have disappeared within a shrouding mist where Penrod s mind refused to follow him Well he got back his ole horn said Sam after school the next afternoon I KNEW we had a perfect right to call him whatever we wanted to I bet you hated to give up that good ole horn Penrod But Penrod was serene He was even a little superior Pshaw he said I m goin to learn to play on sumpthing better n any ole horn It s lots better because you can carry it around with you anywhere and you couldn t a horn What is it Sam asked not too much pleased by Penrod s air of superiority and high content You mean a jew s harp I guess not I mean a flute with all silver on it and everything My father s goin to buy me one I bet he isn t He is too said Penrod soon as I m twenty one years old CHAPTER XXIII THE PARTY Miss Amy Rennsdale At Home Saturday the twenty third from three to six R s v p Dancing This little card delicately engraved betokened the hospitality incidental to the ninth birthday anniversary of Baby Rennsdale youngest member of the Friday Afternoon Dancing Class and by the same token it represented the total social activity during that season of a certain limited bachelor set consisting of Messrs Penrod Schofield and Samuel Williams The truth must be faced Penrod and Sam were seldom invited to small parties they were considered too imaginative But in the case of so large an affair as Miss Rennsdale s the feeling that their parents would be sensitive outweighed fears of what Penrod and Sam might do at the party Reputation is indeed a bubble but sometimes it is blown of sticky stuff The comrades set out for the fete in company final maternal outpourings upon deportment and the duty of dancing with the hostess evaporating in their freshly cleaned ears Both boys however were in a state of mind body and decoration appropriate to the gala scene they were approaching Their collars were wide and white inside the pockets of their overcoats were glistening dancing pumps wrapped in tissue paper inside their jacket pockets were pleasant smelling new white gloves and inside their heads solemn timidity commingled with glittering anticipations Before them like a Christmas tree glimpsed through lace curtains they beheld joy shimmering music ice cream macaroons tinsel caps and the starched ladies of their hearts Penrod and Sam walked demurely yet almost boundingly their faces were shining but grave they were on their way to the Party Look at there said Penrod There s Carlie Chitten Where Sam asked Cross the street Haven t you got any eyes Well whyn t you say he was cross the street in the first place Sam returned plaintively Besides he s so little you can t hardly see him This was of course a violent exaggeration though Master Chitten not yet eleven years old was an inch or two short for his age He s all dressed up Sam added I guess he must be invited I bet he does sumpthing said Penrod I bet he does too Sam agreed This was the extent of their comment upon the small person across the street but in spite of its non committal character the manner of both commentators seemed to indicate that they had just exchanged views upon an interesting and even curious subject They walked along in silence for several minutes staring speculatively at Master Chitten His appearance was pleasant and not remarkable He was a handsome dark little boy with quick eyes and a precociously reserved expression his air was well bred he was exquisitely neat and he had a look of manly competence that grown people found attractive and reassuring In short he was a boy of whom a timid adult stranger would have inquired the way with confidence And yet Sam and Penrod had mysterious thoughts about him obviously there was something subterranean here They continued to look at him for the greater part of block when their progress bringing them in sight of Miss Amy Rennsdale s place of residence their attention was directed to a group of men bearing festal burdens encased violins a shrouded harp and other beckoning shapes There were signs too that most of those invited intended to miss no moment of this party guests already indoors watched from the windows the approach of the musicians Washed boys in black and white and girls in tender colours converged from various directions making gayly for the thrilling gateway and the most beautiful little girl in all the world Marjorie Jones of the amber curls jumped from a carriage step to the curbstone as Penrod and Sam came up She waved to them Sam responded heartily but Penrod feeling real emotion and seeking to conceal it muttered Lo Marjorie gruffly offering no further demonstration Marjorie paused a moment expectant and then as he did not seize the opportunity to ask her for the first dance she tried not to look disappointed and ran into the house ahead of the two boys Penrod was scarlet he wished to dance the first dance with Marjorie and the second and the third and all the other dances and he strongly desired to sit with her at refreshments but he had been unable to ask for a single one of these privileges It would have been impossible for him to state why he was thus dumb although the reason was simple and wholly complimentary to Marjorie she had looked so overpoweringly pretty that she had produced in the bosom of her admirer a severe case of stage fright That was all the matter with him but it was the beginning of his troubles and he did not recover until he and Sam reached the gentlemen s dressing room whither they were directed by a polite coloured man Here they found a cloud of acquaintances getting into pumps and gloves and in a few extreme cases readjusting hair before a mirror Some even went so far after removing their shoes and putting on their pumps as to wash traces of blacking from their hands in the adjacent bathroom before assuming their gloves Penrod being in a strange mood was one of these sharing the basin with little Maurice Levy Carrie Chitten s here said Maurice as they soaped their hands I guess I know it Penrod returned I bet he does sumpthing too Maurice shook his head ominously Well I m gettin tired of it I know he was the one stuck that cold fried egg in P fesser Bartet s overcoat pocket at dancin school and ole p fesser went and blamed it on me Then Carlie he cum up to me th other day and he says Smell my buttonhole bokay He had some vi lets stickin in his buttonhole and I went to smell em and water squirted on me out of em I guess I ve stood about enough and if he does another thing I don t like he better look out Penrod showed some interest inquiring for details whereupon Maurice explained that if Master Chitten displeased him further Master Chitten would receive a blow upon one of his features Maurice was simple and homely about it seeking rhetorical vigour rather than elegance in fact what he definitely promised Master Chitten was a bang on the snoot Well said Penrod he never bothered ME any I expect he knows too much for that A cry of pain was heard from the dressing room at this juncture and glancing through the doorway Maurice and Penrod beheld Sam Williams in the act of sucking his right thumb with vehemence the while his brow was contorted and his eyes watered He came into the bathroom and held his thumb under a faucet That darn little Carlie Chitten he complained He ast me to hold a little tin box he showed me He told me to hold it between my thumb and fingers and he d show me sumpthing Then he pushed the lid and a big needle came out of a hole and stuck me half through my thumb That s a NICE way to act isn t it Carlie Chitten s dark head showed itself cautiously beyond the casing of the door How s your thumb Sam he asked You wait Sam shouted turning furiously but the small prestidigitator was gone With a smothered laugh Carlie dashed through the groups of boys in the dressing room and made his way downstairs his manner reverting to its usual polite gravity before he entered the drawing room where his hostess waited Music sounding at about this time he was followed by the other boys who came trooping down leaving the dressing room empty Penrod among the tail enders of the procession made his dancing school bow to Miss Rennsdale and her grown up supporters two maiden aunts and a governess then he looked about for Marjorie discovering her but too easily Her amber curls were swaying gently in time to the music she looked never more beautiful and her partner was Master Chitten A pang of great penetrative power and equal unexpectedness found the most vulnerable spot beneath the simple black of Penrod Schofield s jacket Straightway he turned his back upon the crash covered floors where the dancers were and moved gloomily toward the hall But one of the maiden aunts Rennsdale waylaid him It s Penrod Schofield isn t it she asked Or Sammy Williams I m not sure which Is it Penrod Ma am he said Yes m Well Penrod I can find a partner for you There are several dear little girls over here if you ll come with me Well He paused shifted from one foot to the other and looked enigmatic I better not he said He meant no offence his trouble was only that he had not yet learned how to do as he pleased at a party and at the same time to seem polite about it I guess I don t want to he added Very well And Miss Rennsdale instantly left him to his own devices He went to lurk in the wide doorway between the hall and the drawing room under such conditions the universal refuge of his sex at all ages There he found several boys of notorious shyness and stood with them in a mutually protective group Now and then one of them would lean upon another until repelled by action and a husky What s matter th you Get off o me They all twisted their slender necks uneasily against the inner bands of their collars at intervals and sometimes exchanged facetious blows under cover In the distance Penrod caught glimpses of amber curls flashing to and fro and he knew himself to be among the derelicts He remained in this questionable sanctuary during the next dance but edging along the wall to lean more comfortably in a corner as the music of the third sounded he overheard part of a conversation that somewhat concerned him The participants were the governess of his hostess Miss Lowe and that one of the aunts Rennsdale who had offered to provide him with a partner These two ladies were standing just in front of him unconscious of his nearness I never Miss Rennsdale said never saw a more fascinating little boy than that Carlie Chitten There ll be some heartaches when he grows up I can t keep my eyes off him Yes he s a charming boy Miss Lowe said His manners are remarkable He s a little man of the world the enthusiastic Miss Rennsdale went on very different from such boys as Penrod Schofield Oh PENROD Miss Lowe exclaimed Good gracious I don t see why he came He declines to dance rudely too I don t think the little girls will mind that so much Miss Lowe said If you d come to the dancing class some Friday with Amy and me you d understand why They moved away Penrod heard his name again mentioned between them as they went and though he did not catch the accompanying remark he was inclined to think it unfavourable He remained where he was brooding morbidly He understood that the government was against him nor was his judgment at fault in this conclusion He was affected also by the conduct of Marjorie who was now dancing gayly with Maurice Levy a former rival of Penrod s The fact that Penrod had not gone near her did not make her culpability seem the less in his gloomy heart he resolved not to ask her for one single dance He would not go near her He would not go near ANY OF EM His eyes began to burn and he swallowed heavily but he was never one to succumb piteously to such emotion and it did not even enter his head that he was at liberty to return to his own home Neither he nor any of his friends had ever left a party until it was officially concluded What his sufferings demanded of him now for their alleviation was not departure but action Underneath the surface nearly all children s parties contain a group of outlaws who wait only for a leader to hoist the black flag The group consists mainly of boys too shy to be at ease with the girls but who wish to distinguish themselves in some way and there are others ordinarily well behaved whom the mere actuality of a party makes drunken The effect of music too upon children is incalculable especially when they do not hear it often and both a snare drum and a bass drum were in the expensive orchestra at the Rennsdale party Nevertheless the outlawry at any party may remain incipient unless a chieftain appears but in Penrod s corner were now gathering into one anarchical mood all the necessary qualifications for leadership Out of that bitter corner there stepped not a Penrod Schofield subdued and hoping to win the lost favour of the Authorities but a hot hearted rebel determined on an uprising Smiling a reckless and challenging smile he returned to the cluster of boys in the wide doorway and began to push one and another of them about They responded hopefully with counter pushes and presently there was a tumultuous surging and eddying in that quarter accompanied by noises that began to compete with the music Then Penrod allowed himself to be shoved out among the circling dancers so that he collided with Marjorie and Maurice Levy almost oversetting them He made a mock bow and a mock apology being inspired to invent a jargon phrase Excuse me he said at the same time making vocal his own conception of a taunting laugh Excuse me but I must a got your bumpus Marjorie looked grieved and turned away with Maurice but the boys in the doorway squealed with maniac laughter Gotcher bumpus Gotcher bumpus they shrilled And they began to push others of their number against the dancing couples shouting Scuse me Gotcher bumpus It became a contagion and then a game As the dances went on strings of boys led by Penrod pursued one another across the rooms howling Gotcher bumpus at the top of their lungs They dodged and ducked and seized upon dancers as shields they caromed from one couple into another and even into the musicians of the orchestra Boys who were dancing abandoned their partners and joined the marauders shrieking Gotcher bumpus Potted plants went down a slender gilt chair refused to support the hurled body of Master Roderick Magsworth Bitts and the sound of splintering wood mingled with other sounds Dancing became impossible Miss Amy Rennsdale wept in the midst of the riot and everybody knew that Penrod Schofield had started it Under instructions the leader of the orchestra clapping his hands for attention stepped to the centre of the drawing room and shouted A moment silence if you bleace Slowly the hubbub ceased the virtuous and the wicked paused alike in their courses to listen Miss Amy Rennsdale was borne away to have her tearful face washed and Marjorie Jones and Carlie Chitten and Georgie Bassett came forward consciously escorted by Miss Lowe The musician waited until the return of the small hostess then he announced in a loud voice A fency dence called Les Papillons denced by Miss Amy Rennstul Miss Chones Mister Chorch Passett ant Mister Jitten Some young chentlemen haf mate so much noise ant confoosion Miss Lowe wish me to ask bleace no more such a nonsense Fency dence Les Papillons Thereupon after formal salutations mister Chitten took Marjorie s hand Georgie Bassett took Miss Rennsdale s and they proceeded to dance Les Papillons in a manner that made up in conscientiousness whatever it may have lacked in abandon The outlaw leader looked on smiling a smile intended to represent careless contempt but in reality he was unpleasantly surprised A fancy dance by Georgie Bassett and Baby Rennsdale was customary at every party attended by members of the Friday Afternoon Dancing Class but Marjorie and Carlie Chitten were new performers and Penrod had not heard that they had learned to dance Les Papillons together He was the further embittered Carlie made a false step recovering himself with some difficulty whereupon a loud jeering squawk of laughter was heard from the insurgent cluster which had been awed to temporary quiet but still maintained its base in the drawing room doorway There was a general SH followed by a shocked whispering as well as a general turning of eyes toward Penrod But it was not Penrod who had laughed though no one would have credited him with an alibi The laughter came from two throats that breathed as one with such perfect simultaneousness that only one was credited with the disturbance These two throats belonged respectively to Samuel Williams and Maurice Levy who were standing in a strikingly Rosencrantz and Guildenstern attitude He got me with his ole tin box needle too Maurice muttered to Sam He was goin to do it to Marjorie and I told her to look out and he says Here YOU take it all of a sudden and he stuck it in my hand so quick I never thought And then BIM his ole needle shot out and perty near went through my thumb bone or sumpthing He ll be sorry before this day s over Well said Sam darkly he s goin to be sorry he stuck ME anyway Neither Sam nor Maurice had even the vaguest plan for causing the desired regret in the breast of Master Chitten but both derived a little consolation from these prophecies And they too had aligned themselves with the insurgents Their motives were personal Carlie Chitten had wronged both of them and Carlie was conspicuously in high favour with the Authorities Naturally Sam and Maurice were against the Authorities Les Papillons came to a conclusion Carlie and Georgie bowed Marjorie Jones and Baby Rennsdale curtesied and there was loud applause In fact the demonstration became so uproarious that some measure of it was open to suspicion especially as hisses of reptilian venomousness were commingled with it and also a hoarse but vociferous repetition of the dastard words Carrie dances ROTTEN Again it was the work of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern but the plot was attributed to another SHAME Penrod Schofield said both the aunts Rennsdale publicly and Penrod wholly innocent became scarlet with indignant mortification Carlie Chitten himself however marked the true offenders A slight flush tinted his cheeks and then in his quiet self contained way he slipped through the crowd of girls and boys unnoticed into the hall and ran noiselessly up the stairs and into the gentlemen s dressing room now inhabited only by hats caps overcoats and the temporarily discarded shoes of the dancers Most of the shoes stood in rows against the wall and Carlie examined these rows attentively after a time discovering a pair of shoes with patent leather tips He knew them they belonged to Maurice Levy and picking them up he went to a corner of the room where four shoes had been left together under a chair Upon the chair were overcoats and caps that he was able to identify as the property of Penrod Schofield and Samuel Williams but as he was not sure which pair of shoes belonged to Penrod and which to Sam he added both pairs to Maurice s and carried them into the bathroom Here he set the plug in the tub turned the faucets and after looking about him and discovering large supplies of all sorts in a wall cabinet he tossed six cakes of green soap into the tub He let the soap remain in the water to soften a little and returning to the dressing room whiled away the time in mixing and mismating pairs of shoes along the walls and also in tying the strings of the mismated shoes together in hard knots Throughout all this his expression was grave and intent his bright eyes grew brighter but he did not smile Carlie Chitten was a singular boy though not unique he was an only child lived at a hotel and found life there favourable to the development of certain peculiarities in his nature He played a lone hand and with what precocious diplomacy he played that curious hand was attested by the fact that Carlie was brilliantly esteemed by parents and guardians in general It must be said for Carlie that in one way his nature was liberal For instance having come upstairs to prepare a vengeance upon Sam and Maurice in return for their slurs upon his dancing he did not confine his efforts to the belongings of those two alone He provided every boy in the house with something to think about later when shoes should be resumed and he was far from stopping at that Casting about him for some material that he desired he opened a door of the dressing room and found himself confronting the apartment of Miss Lowe Upon a desk he beheld the bottle of mucilage he wanted and having taken possession of it he allowed his eye the privilege of a rapid glance into a dressing table drawer accidentally left open He returned to the dressing room five seconds later carrying not only the mucilage but a switch worn by Miss Lowe when her hair was dressed in a fashion different from that which she had favoured for the party This switch he placed in the pocket of a juvenile overcoat unknown to him and then he took the mucilage into the bathroom There he rescued from the water the six cakes of soap placed one in each of the six shoes pounding it down securely into the toe of the shoe with the handle of a back brush After that Carlie poured mucilage into all six shoes impartially until the bottle was empty then took them back to their former positions in the dressing room Finally with careful forethought he placed his own shoes in the pockets of his overcoat and left the overcoat and his cap upon a chair near the outer door of the room Then he went quietly downstairs having been absent from the festivities a little less than twelve minutes He had been energetic only a boy could have accomplished so much in so short a time In fact Carlie had been so busy that his forgetting to turn off the faucets in the bathroom is not at all surprising No one had noticed his absence That infectious pastime Gotcher bumpus had broken out again and the general dancing which had been resumed upon the conclusion of Les Papillons was once more becoming demoralized Despairingly the aunts Rennsdale and Miss Lowe brought forth from the rear of the house a couple of waiters and commanded them to arrest the ringleaders whereupon hilarious terror spread among the outlaw band Shouting tauntingly at their pursuers they fled and bellowing trampling flight swept through every quarter of the house Refreshments quelled this outbreak for a time The orchestra played a march Carlie Chitten and Georgie Bassett with Amy Rennsdale and Marjorie formed the head of a procession while all the boys who had retained their sense of decorum immediately sought partners and fell in behind The outlaws succumbing to ice cream hunger followed suit one after the other until all of the girls were provided with escorts Then to the moral strains of The Stars and Stripes Forever the children paraded out to the dining room Two and two they marched except at the extreme tail end of the line where since there were three more boys than girls at the party the three left over boys were placed These three were also the last three outlaws to succumb and return to civilization from outlying portions of the house after the pursuit by waiters They were Messieurs Maurice Levy Samuel Williams and Penrod Schofield They took their chairs in the capacious dining room quietly enough though their expressions were eloquent of bravado and they jostled one another and their neighbours intentionally even in the act of sitting However it was not long before delectable foods engaged their whole attention and Miss Amy Rennsdale s party relapsed into etiquette for the following twenty minutes The refection concluded with the mild explosion of paper crackers that erupted bright coloured fantastic headgear and during the snapping of the crackers Penrod heard the voice of Marjorie calling from somewhere behind him Carrie and Amy will you change chairs with Georgie Bassett and me just for fun The chairs had been placed in rows back to back and Penrod would not even turn his head to see if Master Chitten and Miss Rennsdale accepted Marjorie s proposal though they were directly behind him and Sam but he grew red and breathed hard A moment later the liberty cap that he had set upon his head was softly removed and a little crown of silver paper put in its place PENROD The whisper was close to his ear and a gentle breath cooled the back of his neck CHAPTER XXIV THE HEART OF MARJORIE JONES Well what you want Penrod asked brusquely Marjorie s wonderful eyes were dark and mysterious like still water at twilight What makes you behave so AWFUL she whispered I don t either I guess I got a right to do the way I want to haven t I Well anyway said Marjorie you ought to quit bumping into people so it hurts Poh It wouldn t hurt a fly Yes it did It hurt when you bumped Maurice and me that time It didn t either WHERE D it hurt you Let s see if it Well I can t show you but it did Penrod are you going to keep on Penrod s heart had melted within him but his reply was pompous and cold I will if I feel like it and I won t if I feel like it You wait and see But Marjorie jumped up and ran around to him abandoning her escort All the children were leaving their chairs and moving toward the dancing rooms the orchestra was playing dance music again Come on Penrod Marjorie cried Let s go dance this together Come on With seeming reluctance he suffered her to lead him away Well I ll go with you but I won t dance he said I wouldn t dance with the President of the United States Why Penrod Well because well I won t DO it All right I don t care I guess I ve danced plenty anyhow Let s go in here She led him into a room too small for dancing used ordinarily by Miss Amy Rennsdale s father as his study and now vacant For a while there was silence but finally Marjorie pointed to the window and said shyly Look Penrod it s getting dark The party ll be over pretty soon and you ve never danced one single time Well I guess I know that don t I He was unable to cast aside his outward truculence though it was but a relic However his voice was gentler and Marjorie seemed satisfied From the other rooms came the swinging music shouts of Gotcher bumpus sounds of stumbling of scrambling of running of muffled concus signs and squeals of dismay Penrod s followers were renewing the wild work even in the absence of their chief Penrod Schofield you bad boy said Marjorie you started every bit of that You ought to be ashamed of yourself I didn t do anything he said and he believed it Pick on me for everything Well they wouldn t if you didn t do so much said Marjorie They would too They wouldn t either Who would That Miss Lowe he specified bitterly Yes and Baby Rennsdale s aunts If the house d burn down I bet they d say Penrod Schofield did it Anybody does anything at ALL they say Penrod Schofield shame on you When you and Carlie were dan Penrod I just hate that little Carlie Chitten P fesser Bartet made me learn that dance with him but I just hate him Penrod was now almost completely mollified nevertheless he continued to set forth his grievance Well they all turned around to me and they said Why Penrod Schofield shame on you And I hadn t done a single thing I was just standin there They got to blame ME though Marjorie laughed airily Well if you aren t the foolishest They would too he asserted with renewed bitterness If the house was to fall down you d see They d all say Marjorie interrupted him She put her hand on the top of her head looking a little startled What s that she said What s what Like rain Marjorie cried Like it was raining in here A drop fell on my Why it couldn t he began But at this instant a drop fell upon his head too and looking up they beheld a great oozing splotch upon the ceiling Drops were gathering upon it and falling the tinted plaster was cracking and a little stream began to patter down and splash upon the floor Then there came a resounding thump upstairs just above them and fragments of wet plaster fell The roof must be leaking said Marjorie beginning to be alarmed Couldn t be the roof said Penrod Besides there ain t any rain outdoors As he spoke a second slender stream of water began to patter upon the floor of the hall outside the door Good gracious Marjorie cried while the ceiling above them shook as with earthquake or as with boys in numbers jumping and a great uproar burst forth overhead I believe the house IS falling down Penrod she quavered Well they ll blame ME for it he said Anyways we better get out o here I guess sumpthing must be the matter His guess was accurate so far as it went The dance music had swung into Home Sweet Home some time before the children were preparing to leave and Master Chitten had been the first boy to ascend to the gentlemen s dressing room for his cap overcoat and shoes his motive being to avoid by departure any difficulty in case his earlier activities should cause him to be suspected by the other boys But in the doorway he halted aghast The lights had not been turned on but even the dim windows showed that the polished floor gave back reflections no floor polish had ever equalled It was a gently steaming lake from an eighth to a quarter of an inch deep And Carlie realized that he had forgotten to turn off the faucets in the bathroom For a moment his savoir faire deserted him and he was filled with ordinary human boy panic Then at a sound of voices behind him he lost his head and rushed into the bathroom It was dark but certain sensations and the splashing of his pumps warned him that the water was deeper in there The next instant the lights were switched on in both bathroom and dressing room and Carlie beheld Sam Williams in the doorway of the former Oh look Maurice Sam shouted in frantic excitement Somebody s let the tub run over and it s about ten feet deep Carlie Chitten s sloshin around in here Let s hold the door on him and keep him in Carlie rushed to prevent the execution of this project but he slipped and went swishing full length along the floor creating a little surf before him as he slid to the demoniac happiness of Sam and Maurice They closed the door however and as other boys rushed shouting and splashing into the flooded dressing room Carlie began to hammer upon the panels Then the owners of shoes striving to rescue them from the increasing waters made discoveries The most dangerous time to give a large children s party is when there has not been one for a long period The Rennsdale party had that misfortune and its climax was the complete and convulsive madness of the gentlemen s dressing room during those final moments supposed to be given to quiet preparations on the part of guests for departure In the upper hall and upon the stairway panic stricken little girls listened wild eyed to the uproar that went on while waiters and maid servants rushed with pails and towels into what was essentially the worst ward in Bedlam Boys who had behaved properly all afternoon now gave way and joined the confraternity of lunatics The floors of the house shook to tramplings rushes wrestlings falls and collisions The walls resounded to chorused bellowings and roars There were pipings of pain and pipings of joy there was whistling to pierce the drums of ears there were hootings and howlings and bleatings and screechings while over all bleated the heathen battle cry incessantly GOTCHER BUMPUS GOTCHER BUMPUS For the boys had been inspired by the unusual water to transform Penrod s game of Gotcher bumpus into an aquatic sport and to induce one another by means of superior force dexterity or stratagems either to sit or to lie at full length in the flood after the example of Carlie Chitten One of the aunts Rennsdale had taken what charge she could of the deafened and distracted maids and waiters who were working to stem the tide while the other of the aunts Rennsdale stood with her niece and Miss Lowe at the foot of the stairs trying to say good night reassuringly to those of the terrified little girls who were able to tear themselves away This latter aunt Rennsdale marked a dripping figure that came unobtrusively and yet in a self contained and gentlemanly manner down the stairs Carlie Chitten she cried You poor dear child you re soaking To think those outrageous little fiends wouldn t even spare YOU As she spoke another departing male guest came from behind Carlie and placed in her hand a snakelike article a thing that Miss Lowe seized and concealed with one sweeping gesture It s some false hair somebody must of put in my overcoat pocket said Roderick Magsworth Bitts Well g night Thank you for a very nice time Good night Miss Rennsdale said Master Chitten demurely Thank you for a But Miss Rennsdale detained him Carrie she said earnestly you re a dear boy and I know you ll tell me something It was all Penrod Schofield wasn t it You mean he left the I mean she said in a low tone not altogether devoid of ferocity I mean it was Penrod who left the faucets running and Penrod who tied the boys shoes together and filled some of them with soap and mucilage and put Miss Lowe s hair in Roddy Bitts s overcoat No look me in the eye Carlie They were all shouting that silly thing he started Didn t he do it Carlie cast down thoughtful eyes I wouldn t like to tell Miss Rennsdale he said I guess I better be going or I ll catch cold Thank you for a very nice time There said Miss Rennsdale vehemently as Carlie went on his way What did I tell you Carlie Chitten s too manly to say it but I just KNOW it was that terrible Penrod Schofield Behind her a low voice unheard by all except the person to whom it spoke repeated a part of this speech What did I tell you This voice belonged to one Penrod Schofield Penrod and Marjorie had descended by another stairway and he now considered it wiser to pass to the rear of the little party at the foot of the stairs As he was still in his pumps his choked shoes occupying his overcoat pockets he experienced no difficulty in reaching the front door and getting out of it unobserved although the noise upstairs was greatly abated Marjorie however made her curtseys and farewells in a creditable manner There Penrod said again when she rejoined him in the darkness outside What did I tell you Didn t I say I d get the blame of it no matter if the house went and fell down I s pose they think I put mucilage and soap in my own shoes Marjorie delayed at the gate until some eagerly talking little girls had passed out The name Penrod Schofield was thick and scandalous among them Well said Marjorie I wouldn t care Penrod Course about soap and mucilage in YOUR shoes anybody d know some other boy must of put em there to get even for what you put in his Penrod gasped But I DIDN T he cried I didn t do ANYTHING That ole Miss Rennsdale can say what she wants to I didn t do Well anyway Penrod said Marjorie softly they can t ever PROVE it was you He felt himself suffocating in a coil against which no struggle availed But I never DID it he wailed helplessly I never did anything at all She leaned toward him a little and the lights from her waiting carriage illumined her dimly but enough for him to see that her look was fond and proud yet almost awed Anyway Penrod she whispered I don t believe there s any other boy in the whole world could of done HALF as much And with that she left him and ran out to the carriage But Penrod remained by the gate to wait for Sam and the burden of his sorrows was beginning to lift In fact he felt a great deal better in spite of his having just discovered why Marjorie loved him End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of
